<TITLE>Autism speaks</TITLE>
<TEXT>
On occasion my mother would remind me that I did not talk until I was 4 years old If I wanted anything I would simply point to it When she took me to the doctor the wise man would simply say He s just thinking he ll talk when he s ready One thing I wanted most was to play outdoors So I would go to the window and point to go outside If it was cold or snowy or raining my mother would say Wait for the sunshine wait for the sunshine When I was 4 years old my parents were in the ministry We were visited one day by a missionary lady who was from India After talking to my folks for a while she looked at me and asked And what is your name Before my mother had a chance to tell her that I didn t talk I looked her in the eye and replied Sunshine Jones These are the first words I spoke A few years ago in order to celebrate my Shawnee heritage I went with my family to our county courthouse and made Sunshine part of my legal name There are an increasing number of children coming into our world who are being labeled as autistic and treated as if they are retarded and placed in programs to train them into the narrow minded path of socialization This faith of action is short sighted and doomed for failure There is absolutely nothing wrong with these children They are advanced vibrational spiritual beings who have a bead on happiness and choose to communicate using the highest level of vibrations known to our universe Most of the communication in our universe is through vibrations The most powerful vibrations are the ones that are accompanied with strong physical sensations and emotions of appreciation love joy happiness excitement and enthusiasm The children who avoid eye contact refuse to talk and engage in alternate behavior are the real teachers In their own humorous way they are reminding us who we really are They are leading by example teaching us to use our imagination to picture places things and experiences that make us happy and follow the trail of good feeling thoughts back to our connection with source energy Each autistic child has a unique vibrational frequency and offers physical manifestations that serve as clues to their own thought processes These physical signs also are offered as a bridge for family members to interact and engage the child in meaningful vibrational communication without words In moments of intense love joy happiness and acceptance preconceived ideas of right and wrong appropriateness or what s acceptable behavior will fall away Those who let go and let the children lead will be swept away in a stream of well being and energy downstream toward every good thing life could bring Let the children be who they want to be and eventually the words will come Sunshine Jones Steubenville
