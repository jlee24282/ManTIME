<TITLE>Queens Wharf Lighthouse opens in fortnight</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Michael Parekowhai’s artwork on Queens Wharf, The Lighthouse, will be publicly opened on Saturday 11 February from 7pm – with no speeches or unveiling. 
 
Auckland Council arts  amp; culture manager Kaye Glamuzina said the finishing touches were being applied and the fences around it would be taken down at opening time. 
 
The opening celebration is timed to coincide with dusk  amp; sunset to offer people the opportunity to see The Lighthouse – a conceptual design in the form of a 1950s state house filled by a hand-blown glass chandelier – against the changing night sky. 
 
It’s surrounded by a wooden jetty that ‘floats’ on the wharf. The public can explore the work by looking in windows  amp; doors and climbing the staircase. 
 
Real estate agency Barfoot  amp; Thompson donated $1 million of the council’s $1.5 million project budget.
