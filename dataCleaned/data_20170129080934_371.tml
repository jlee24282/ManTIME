A group of Duluth Denfeld High School students will have their ears full Friday at the State Music Listening Contest in Augsburg College in Minneapolis. The four Hunters include Keira Wilhelm, Hannah Strom, Logan Griggs and alternate Ying Moua. 
   
The state competition will test the students' active listening and critical analysis abilities as they listen to classical, ethnic and pop music composers. The students will have to identify the music's composers, cultures, periods and styles.
