<TITLE>Trump and Putin connect over Middle East and repairing relationship</TITLE>
<TEXT>
President Donald Trump had a “positive call” with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Saturday, during which the two promised to cooperate on destroying ISIS in Syrian and repair U.S. and Russian relations. 
 
The discussion was part of a diplomatic effort to connect over the phone with foreign leaders from countries including Japan, Germany, France and Australia. 
 
“The positive call was a significant start to improving the relationship between the United States and Russia that is in need of repair,” the White House said in a readout of the conversation. “Both President Trump and President Putin are hopeful that after today’s call the two sides can move quickly to tackle terrorism and other important issues of mutual concern.” 
 
A statement from the Kremlin’s office went even further to solidify the ties between the two, saying that the leaders “agreed to maintain regular personal contacts.” 
 
The Kremlin’s statement said that the two spoke about the “Ukraine Crisis” and repairing economic relationships, suggesting that Trump said he would be open to lifting sanctions against Russia. 
 
“The sides stressed the importance of rebuilding mutually beneficial trade and economic ties between the two countriesâ business communities, which could give an additional impetus to progressive and sustainable development of bilateral relations,” the Kremlin’s office said in a statement. 
 
“During the conversation, both sides expressed their readiness to make active joint efforts to stabilize and develop Russia-US cooperation on a constructive, equitable and mutually beneficial basis.” 
 
On Friday, Trump said he hoped to have a “fantastic relationship” with Putin. Following Trump’s pledge to restore relations with Russia, there has been some speculation that he will lift economic sanctions on the country that were instated for it’s invasion in Ukraine. 
 
Trump’s close relationship with Putin has been an issue of concern for the defense agencies who found evidence of Russian hacking to meddle in the U.S. elections. 
 
Trump started his day with a morning call with Japanese Premiere Shinzo Abe. The two leaders affirmed “the ironclad U.S. commitment to ensuring the security of Japan” including an agreement to cooperate on the threat posed by North Korea, according to a White House readout of the meeting. 
 
There was also an agreement to “deepen” bilateral trade following Trump’s executive order this week to pull out of the Transpacific Trade Partnership. 
 
Abe agreed to come to Washington on February 10. Secretary of Defense General Mattis will visit the region, including Japan.

Following the call, Trump had a 45 minute conversation with German Chancellor Angela Merkel that covered topics from reinforcing a U.S. commitment NATO, combatting terrrorism and dealing with Russian aggression, according to a White House re-out. 
 
While Trump has been critical of NATO, calling it “obsolete” on the campaign trail, his statements seem open to supporting NATO as long as EU partners agree to pay two percent of their budgets to the defense alliance. At a press conference in Washington yesterday, British Prime Minister Theresa revealed a piece of their conversation on the diplomatically sensitive topic for Russia’s neighbors in Europe saying that Trump pledged his “100 percent commitment” to NATO. 
 
“The President and Chancellor also agreed on the NATO Alliance’s fundamental importance to the broader transatlantic relationship and its role in ensuring the peace and stability of our North Atlantic community,” the White House said in a statement. 
 
“In this vein, the leaders recognized that NATO must be capable of confronting 21st century threats and that our common defense requires appropriate investment in military capabilities to ensure all Allies are contributing their fair share to our collective security.” 
 
Francois Hollande reaffirmed France’s commitment to the United Nations and NATO, and warned Trump against being too protectionist. 
 
“In an unstable and uncertain world, turning inward would be a dead-end,” he said, according to a statement from the French government. 
 
The White House has not issued a readout on the call. 
 
Trump accepted Merkel’s invitation to the G-20 in Hamburg in July and also promised to visit Washington “soon,” according to the readout. 
 
Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, Press Secretary Sean Spicer, National Security advisor General Michael Flynn and senior advisor Steve Bannon were all present in the room during Trump’s call with Putin. 
 
Translators were used during the conversation with Putin, Abe, Merkel and Hollande. 
 
After signing three executive orders in the late afternoon, Trump started his call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
