<TEXT>
ALEXANDRIA, La. (LSUA) - No. 1 LSUA scored the game’s first 13 points and never looked back in a wire-to-wire, 84-57 win over the University of the Southwest Mustangs for the Generals’ 21st straight victory, tying the program record win streak which was set last season. 
 
The opening run starting 80 seconds into the contest as Joseph Feraci passed the ball over to an open Evan Smith who drained the 3 for a 3-0 lead. Smith also capped the run with another three as Chris Vickers gave it to him for the shot that made the score 13-0 with just about 15:45 left in the period. Hayward Register gave the Generals their largest lead of the period as Jordin Williams found him open for another three-pointer that put LSUA up 19-3 with 14:20 to go in the first half. 
 
Southwest got back into the game though, going on a 16-4 run, starting with Jim Coleman’s bucket and ending on Anthony Brown’s three-pointer that pulled the Mustangs back to within four points, 23-19, of the Generals with ten minutes to go before halftime. But the Generals answered that run by closing the half on a 17-6 run that Brian Sylvester finished to give LSUA a 40-25 lead at the break and put the lead in double-figures to stay. 
 
LSUA came out on fire in the second half, getting the lead up to 20 points on Joseph Feraci’s three just 2:30 into the period to put the score at 48-28. That was part of a half-opening 17-3 run that Jordin Williams finished with his own three-pointer to push the lead to 57-28 with just move than 14:00 left. A Brandon Ellis long ball broke the 30-point margin for the first time as that bucket made the score 66-35 with 10:30 to go. Colby Harrison provided LSUA with its largest lead of the game as his corner three put the Generals up 78-45 with 7:00 to go and allowed LSUA to coast to victory from there. 
 
“It was another good win in front of another solid crowd inside The Fort,” said head coach Larry Cordaro. “We truly have a great fan base here in Alexandria. We were very balanced scoring wise and I thought we shared the ball well, leading to a lot of assists. We were a bit loose with the ball at times though, which led to some turnovers. We need to protect the ball better. But overall, we played well, and got to reward some younger players for their hard work with some quality playing time tonight, and I thought they did very well while out on the court. Now our guys get to enjoy a day off before we start preparing for a tough road game at our rival in Shreveport.” 
 
Five Generals scored in double digits, led by Jordin Williams and Brian Sylvester, who each out in 14 points. Sylvester also notched his seventh double-double of the season by grabbing 13 rebounds. Gilbert Talbot, Evan Smith and Joseph Feraci closed out the leading scorers as each put in 12 points in the win. 
 
The Generals (21-0, 11-0 RRAC) shot 48.3% from the field in the contest, including 36.1% from above the three-point arc and hit on 13 of their 18 free throw attempts. LSUA led in all of the extended stats, beating the Mustangs on the fast break, 10-6, off turnovers, 20-14, in the paint, 30-24, with second chance points, 11-4, and points from reserves at 29-18. Southwest (8-13, 2-9 RRAC) shot 40.0% from the field, 34.8% from distance and made only five of their 11 free throw opportunities. 
 
LSUA hits the road on Wednesday for the return game of the Battle for Louisiana as the Generals head up I-49 to take on LSU Shreveport. Tip-off Wednesday night is set for 7:30 p.m. in The Dock and can be heard on Magic 100.9 FM in central Louisiana.
