<TITLE>PD Editorial A brewing fiscal crisis for Santa Rosa schools</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Santa Rosa City Schools the largest school district in Sonoma County is marching toward insolvency Structural budget deficits are growing by about 1 million a year and barring big changes reserve funds will be exhausted within three years It is in short a budget crisis And district officials beginning with the Board of Education deserve an F on their report cards for failing in their obligation to share this information with the public in a clear and timely fashion Not a word was mentioned during the recently concluded school board election Nor is there a member of the school board a parent or any other representative of the public on a committee of principals administrators and union representatives that was quietly appointed last summer to study the district s options The most thorough update came at the end of a four hour board meeting in mid December the first for three new members elected in November It s unlikely at best that anyone perusing the meeting agenda would have identified First Interim Report for Fiscal Year 2016 17 as the late night blockbuster that it proved to be Here s a brief summary The deficit for 2016 17 is 10 7 million in a budget of 180 million followed by projected deficits of 7 9 million in 2017 2018 and 11 million in 2018 19 District enrollment is basically flat but a decline in elementary school enrollment is masked by increased enrollment in charter schools which are funded separately Santa Rosa City Schools will experience staggering increases in retirement costs for teaching and non teaching employees over the next several years according to a financial consultant hired by the district By 2020 21 payments to the California Public Employees Retirement System and the California State Teachers Retirement System will eat up 20 percent of payroll dollars about double the level in 2014 15 To remain solvent and to comply with a state law requiring school districts to maintain a reserve equal to 3 percent of general fund spending Santa Rosa schools must make budget adjustments that s a euphemism for spending cuts and or tax increases totaling 4 million for 2017 18 and 2 million more for 2018 19 At that point consultant Terry Ryland told the school board we re still deficit spending but it gets us down to where we meet our 3 percent reserve The district s financial situation was exacerbated by million dollar accounting mistakes that apparently resulted in the departure of two top administrators in recent weeks It appears that the bookkeeping mistakes have been rectified but the district hasn t credibly addressed its systemic problems After listening to Ryland s Dec 14 report without comment on questions and receiving a vague report from the special budget committee which made suggestions including attracting more students and seeking a parcel tax the board unanimously declared that it had met its legal obligation to adopt a sustainable spending plan Sonoma County school Superintendent Steve Herrington whose responsibilities include oversight of school district budgets grudgingly accepted that conclusion but warned Santa Rosa school officials that they need to be much more specific about their plans for erasing the deficit In 2014 Santa Rosa voters taxed themselves to pay for 229 million in capital improvements to local schools money that cannot be used for day to day operations At least one school board member is on record advocating a parcel tax to help balance the books But the district s elected and appointed leaders will need to be far more forthcoming and establish a more transparent process if they expect voters to bail them out
