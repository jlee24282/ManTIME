Manama :  Bahrain National Triathlon Team won the first leg of the Triple Crown Ironman Championship held in Dubai as the Bahraini team qualified for the World Championship to be held in Barcelona. 
 
“The awards the Bahraini teams received at the closing ceremony of the Triple Crown Ironman Championship reflects the advanced level our Bahraini youth have reached thanks to the unwavering and support from HM the King,” said HH Shaikh Nasser bin Hamad Al Khalifa, Representative of His Majesty the King for Charity Works and Youth Affairs, Chairman of the Supreme Council for Youth and Sports, President of Bahrain Olympic Committee. 
 
Shaikh Nasser was placed first amongst GCC participants and fifth overall and set a new record of four hours 15 minutes in the Gulf region, over a course distance of 1.9km swim, 90km cycling and a 21.1km run.

“The Championship attracted a large number of young athletes from Bahrain, who occupied top places. This asserts the popularity of triathlon sport in the region, and it gives us motivation to continue our work to extend its outreach,” Shaikh Nasser highlighted.
