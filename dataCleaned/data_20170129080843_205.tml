<TITLE>P.K. Subban crashes Drew Doughty's media scrum</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Los Angeles - What's an All-Star Weekend without a little bit of the P.K. Subban show? After Saturday night's Skills Competition, Subban took over reporting duties for the LA Kings team site and threw some questions at defenseman Doughty, who was a good sport about the entire thing.

Towards the end, Subban asks Doughty what the plans are for hanging out later, to which Doughty is very non-committal. Also, if you listen carefully, you'll catch Subban asking "was that ok?" as he hands off the microphone.
