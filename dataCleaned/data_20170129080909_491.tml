<TITLE>Woman finds cats stuck in apartment wall</TITLE>
<TEXT>
HOUSTON, TX (KTRK/CNN) – A pet owner’s two cats ended up stuck in her apartment walls, thanks to a distracted maintenance worker.

Natalie Pradia’s two tabby cats, named Ginger and Zelda, were seen on home surveillance footage playing around 10:30 a.m. Thursday. Then, their owner says her cats seemed to vanish.

"Rewind the cameras. Slow it down. Skip forward. Go backwards. The cats just seem like they poof, disappeared,” she said.

Pradia assumed someone accidentally let the cats out, even though cameras didn’t catch the animals fleeing out the front door. She and her family searched the neighborhood for hours with no luck.

When they returned home, Pradia finally heard the cats’ cries for help.

"I'm like, ‘Where are you all, Zelda, Ginger?’ Then I hear ‘meow, meow,’” she said.

Pradia’s daughters, Jerrica and Jazmynn, said the cats sounded like they were calling from under the floor. 

"It sounded boxed in, so I figured they were stuck somewhere," Jerrica said.

Crews cut through a downstairs neighbor’s ceiling Friday morning to free Ginger and Zelda. The cats had been trapped inside the walls for more than 12 hours. 

While replacing tiles in the Pradias’ bathroom, a maintenance worker created an opening, and the cats climbed through without him noticing. Staff at the apartment complex called this an unfortunate accident.

Ginger and Zelda seem to be doing fine after their adventure.
