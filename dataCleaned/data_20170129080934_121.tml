<TITLE>Atlantic Division wins Skills Competition</TITLE>
<TEXT>
The Atlantic Division won the deciding Shootout event, and won the NHL All-Star Skills Competition on Saturday. 
 
As a result, they have decided to face the Metropolitan Division in the second three-on-three game for tomorrow’s NHL All-Star Game in L.A. The Atlantic took the shootout — and the final score — 4-1 over the Pacific Division, which got its lone goal from Ryan Kesler ‘s young son, Ryker Kesler, who went five-hole on Carey Price . 
 
Connor McDavid , the Edmonton Oilers star, fell just short of beating Dylan Larkin ‘s record of 13.172 seconds in the Fastest Skater competition, which would’ve given the Pacific an additional bonus point from that event. 
 
Shea Weber also had a share in the Atlantic Division win. His slap shot of 102.8 miles per hour , while not matching his attempts of 108.1 mph and 108.5 mph from the previous two ASG skills competitions, was good enough to best the competition once again. 
 
Weber takes the Hardest Shot title for a third consecutive year. 
 
Brent Burns and goalie Mike Smith — yes, you read that last part correctly — put on a show in the newly introduced Four Line Challenge. 
 
Burns picked the top corner from center ice and Smith, one of the better puck-playing goalies in the league, delighted the crowd by scoring into a small slot in the middle of the net on his shot from the far end of the rink .
