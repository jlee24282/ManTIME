<TITLE>Old school Zach Randolph is rolling for the Grizzlies</TITLE>
<TEXT>
6 45 AM GMT SALT LAKE CITY Much has changed for Memphis Grizzlies franchise cornerstone Zach Randolph this season He has a new role for a new coach in a new system But he s still the same ol Z Bo even at the ripe old age of 35 I don t see anything different man point guard Mike Conley said after Randolph s season high 28 points led the Grizzlies to a 102 95 victory Saturday over the Utah Jazz It s the same guy making the same moves We joke all the time I m like Man you re never going to stop playing You don t look like you age You don t look like you re slowing down It s fun to see him just continually doing his thing That s a polite way of saying that Randolph has been getting buckets his entire career despite a vertical leap that can be measured with your thumb and index finger They say it s an old man game old school game Randolph said with a smile I ll take it how it comes Randolph s role has changed this season as he sacrificed by accepting a sixth man role but his per minute production hasn t dipped His player efficiency rating 19 2 is right about his career norm He s putting up 20 7 points per 36 minutes which is actually 1 5 points better than his career average Zach Randolph scored a season high 28 points on Saturday night much to the appreciation of Mike Conley James Ennis and the rest of the Grizzlies Jeff Swinger USA TODAY Sports The major dip for Randolph has been in his minutes He s playing only 24 2 minutes per game his fewest since he was a 21 year old pup in Portland However Randolph s playing time is trending upward as he s in the midst of his best month of the season He s averaging 27 9 minutes in January while putting up 15 9 points and 9 8 rebounds per game Three of his five 20 plus point performances so far this season have come this month I m just in a rhythm man Randolph said I had to get my legs under me and get a feel Coach is playing me more minutes and longer stretches I m getting a chance to get my rhythm First year coach David Fizdale He s worked his way to that I needed to get him on the court more but it also came with his conditioning level going up That has meant more minutes alongside All Star center Marc Gasol For years that duo formed a punishing one two punch as the Grizzlies built their six year postseason streak on a bullying style of basketball With the league trending toward a space and pace style Fizdale was hesitant about using the two bruisers together a lot primarily due to concerns about Randolph defending small ball power forwards Fizdale made a deal with Randolph Prove he can defend pick and rolls and prevent opposing power forwards from getting open 3 pointers and he d get to be on the floor with Gasol more The 6 foot 9 260 pound Randolph has responded to the challenge As a result he s a crunch time regular again which is much more important to Randolph than starting games His presence down the stretch is paying dividends Randolph has 21 points on 10 of 15 shooting in 31 clutch minutes this month according to NBA com stats The Gasol Randolph pairing is perhaps more potent than ever on the offensive end in large part due to Gasol emerging as a lethal long range shooter after operating primarily around the elbows for most of his career Gasol serves as a stretch 4 these days when he plays with Randolph who remains a crafty bull on the block The Grizzlies have a sky high offensive rating of 114 6 points per 100 possessions in the 220 minutes Gasol and Randolph have played together this month They played only 219 minutes together this season before January I know where he wants the ball and I know how to get it there said Gasol who had 18 points and five assists Saturday I ll do that It s something that we ve been very productive at I know how to pass it where to pass it and I m pretty good at it If they try to front him it s a wrap because I m going to get it to him with an advantage And once he gets going and in a rhythm then you re guessing what to take away When he s in a rhythm it s hard to stop him Check out the team site for more game coverage Check out the team site for more game coverage That s true regardless of who s guarding Randolph There certainly aren t many second team bigs who can disrupt his rhythm But he proved Saturday that he could still score against even a dominant defender Randolph s 12 of 20 shooting night included four buckets on seven attempts when he was guarded by Defensive Player of the Year candidate Rudy Gobert highlighted by a beautiful old school up and under move when he got the NBA s best shot blocker to leave his feet He just gave him the business Grizzlies shooting guard Tony Allen said gleefully You saw it I mean you saw it I ain t making this s up Randolph raved about Gobert s impact as a defender after the game but he certainly wasn t surprised to have some success against the Jazz big man I ve been doing it my whole career Randolph said as he strolled to the Grizzlies bus Anybody It don t matter
