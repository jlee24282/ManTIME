<TITLE>Mom Who Filmed Herself Raping 1-Year-Old Son Gets Shocking News From Judge</TITLE>
<TEXT>
New Zealand woman Krystal Harvey is now being threatened after she filmed the rape of her 1-year-old son. 
 
Harvey admitted to filming herself as she performed sexual acts on her 1-year-old son and selling the tape to a pedophile for $300, the New Zealand Herald reports. She then used the money to buy herself a laptop.

Harvey’s child hasbeen  permanently removed from her custody. 
 
The child molester, however, won’t serve any time in jail for her crimes. Instead, she was sentenced to eight months of home detention and 100 hours of community service. As a result, many have attacked her on social media.

The Facebook page Krystal Harvey Should Go To Prison has more than 5,000 followers as of Jan. 28. Others have suggested more radical punishments and even wishes for her death. 
 
“This scum needs to be out of our community and away from our children,” one user wrote. “This filthy excuse of a human being from Waiuku.” 
 
Harvey will not be required to register as a sex offender, according to the Herald. 
 
It’s unclear if Harvey will be able to have custody of any children she may have in the future.
