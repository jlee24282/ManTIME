The all-India Senior Selection Committee of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has selected the 14 member India 'A' squad for the two-day practice game to be played against Bangladesh at Gymkhana Ground. 
Tamil Nadu captain Abhinav Mukund will be leading a 14-member India A side in a two-day warm-up match against Bangladesh before the one-off Test against visitors start on February 9 in Hyderabad. 

The squad features all-rounder Jayant Yadav, who sustained an injury during England series and the match will be his fitness Test before the big game against the neighbouring nation, reports the Indian Express.
