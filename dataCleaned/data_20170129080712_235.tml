<TITLE>Leica confident that dust is less of a problem for the M10</TITLE>
<TEXT>
One of the problems associated with an interchangeable lens system with no mirror is an increased likelihood of dust getting to the sensor This seemed to be particularly problematic for previous M digital rangefinders such as the M9 and the M Typ 240 However speaking to Camera Jabber during a trip to the Leica HQ in Wetzlar Germany the product management team responsible for the M10 believes that the new sensor inside the camera should tackle that issue Some have questioned why there s no electronic sensor cleaning system such as we see in plenty of other cameras especially when it has been noted to be a problem in the past Slim line Jesko Oeynhausen product manager for camera systems said There is no electronic cleaning system there because there is not enough space One of the key improvements and key facts about the camera that Leica is keen to celebrate is how they have managed to slim down the design to bring it in line with the size of classic analogue M cameras Confident that the new design wouldn t present the same kind of problems as previous cameras Oeynhausen continued we have done something with the sensor design which makes dust less visible less of a problem than before It will be interesting to see if users report the same kind of dust issues some have gone so far as to suggest that older M digital cameras needed to be sent away for sensor cleaning every few weeks READ MORE Leica M10 review Leica M10 vs Leica M Typ 240 what are the key differences Share this Like this Like Loading Contributor Amy Davies is a journalist and photographer who has been published in a wide variety of places including TechRadar Wired Amateur Photographer Photography Blog ePhotoZine What Digital Camera and more She lives in Cardiff and has a penchant for sausage shaped dogs View her full profile
