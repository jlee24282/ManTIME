<TITLE>BJP to release its Goa poll manifesto</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Panaji (Goa) [India], Jan. 29 : Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar will on Sunday release the Bharatiya Janata Party's election manifesto in Goa ahead of state assembly polls.

Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadanvis and others will also be present on the occasion.

Assuring the people of Goa a better life, Prime Minister Narendra Modi yesterday said they would ensure that the state 'blooms' if the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is voted to power.

Asserting that the government has contributed a lot towards the development of Goa, Prime Minister Modi said they have given more to Goa in 25 months than what other governments in past gave it in 50 years.

Taking a dig at the Congress, Prime Minister Modi said Goa witnessed slow development during 1990-2000 due to political instability.

Appealing the people of Goa to vote for them, Prime Minister Modi said, "I would make the state most comfortable in the country if the voters give us a comfortable majority." Check out More news from Telecom Sector :: Pharmaceutical Sector :: Auto Sector :: Infrastructure :: Real Estate
