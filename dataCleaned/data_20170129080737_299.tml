<TITLE>Vaqueros fall 99-92 to Cochise</TITLE>
<TEXT>
SIGNAL PEAK — A rough week for the Central Arizona College men’s basketball team that began with a 97-95 overtime loss on Wednesday at Scottsdale concluded with the Vaqueros dropping a 99-92 decision to Cochise on Saturday at the George Young Activity Center. 
 
Central trailed the Apaches by 10 points on four occasions in the second half, the last time with 2:40 remaining. Karriem Simmons’ basket narrowed the deficit to 92-90 with 52.3 seconds left before Cochise secured the victory on Dallas Polk-Hilliard’s 3-pointer with 31 seconds to play and four free throws on four attempts in the final 14.6 seconds. 
 
“We threw some punches, they threw some punches and we both took hits,” CAC coach Tramaine Aaron said. “At the end, they were able to withstand our swings.” 
 
With nine games remaining in the regular season, the Vaqueros (11-10, 4-9 Arizona Community College Athletic Conference) are still very much in the hunt for the fourth and final berth in the Division I Region 1 tournament. They are battling Eastern Arizona, which entered Saturday’s play with a 3-9 conference mark. 
 
“Our next few games are not going to be easy,” Aaron said. “This may sound funny, but we have to concentrate more on concentrating.” 
 
The Apaches improved to 18-3 overall and 10-3 in the ACCAC. They overcame an early 13-5 deficit to take a 48-45 halftime lead and never trailed in the second half. 
 
“When we played defense and the intensity was there, we were fine,” Aaron said. “When it wasn’t, Cochise made their runs. We didn’t get the stops when we needed them.” 
 
The Apaches made 9 of 17 3-pointers and shot 54 percent from the field overall. They also converted 20 Central turnovers into 27 points and went 18 for 19 on free throws. 
 
Polk-Hill was 5 for 5 on 3-pointers and finished with 27 points. Brandell Evans scored 20 points, Shadeed Shabazz had 17, Bryan Urrutia scored 15 and Frank Agyemang had 10 for the Apaches. Polk-Hill was 11 for 17 from the field, Evans went 7 for 12, Urrutia made 4 of 8 shots (including 3 of 6 3-pointers) and Agyemang was 4 for 5. 
 
Simmons led all scorers with 31 points. He connected on 11 of 21 field-goal tries, including 4 of 7 3-pointers. Four other Vaqueros finished in double digits — with Isaiah Bellamy scoring 17 points, DaShawn Shelton 13, Josiah Westbrook 11 and Simon Okolue 10. Okolue also had 10 rebounds. 
 
Central shot 47 percent from the floor, made 19 of 24 free throws and outscored Cochise 17-6 in second-chance points. 
 
The Vaqueros took a 13-5 lead on JaQuan Johnson’s drive with 16:14 left in the first half. Polk-Hilliard’s 3-pointer gave the Apaches their first lead at 26-23 with 10:24 remaining in the half. 
 
Central regained the lead for the final time at 27-26 on the second of back-to-back baskets by Westbrook with 9:46 left. Garrett Jackson’s basket 10 seconds later put Cochise ahead to stay. 
 
The Apaches built leads of 64-54, 74-64, 84-74 and 90-80 in the second half.
