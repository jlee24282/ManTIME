<TITLE>Community makes Gift of Warmth a success</TITLE>
<TEXT>
By news seacoastonline com PORTSMOUTH The 11th annual of the Gift of Warmth fuel assistance program proved to be a success once again as community members donated more than 38 000 to the cause The Gift of Warmth raises money from area residents businesses and other groups to allow the Community Action Partnership of Strafford County and Rockingham Community Action to help residents who do not meet guidelines for other fuel assistance programs that may not take into account factors such as illnesses recent job losses a broken furnace or heat sources such as kerosene or wood Others may be slightly above strict income bracket limits of federal fuel assistance programs or receive some government help but not enough to get them through the winter Both community action partnerships work together to keep people warm during the cold New Hampshire winters The success of the 11 year old campaign is largely dependent on local residents who have received assistance from the community action partnerships being willing to share their stories A common thread among these neighbors and friends is their pride which stands tall in the face of adversity Those who come to community action programs for help vary widely in the life situations that brought them to ask for help Most only asked for help when there were no other options The stories we highlighted often demonstrate one main point Many of us are a job loss death of a spouse or a medical illness away from a life altering change of financial position We spoke to people who were scraping by when their furnace stopped working and they had no money to replace it There were people who could not afford to fill their oil tanks because they were single parents and had to choose their child s needs over buying oil We talked to a woman who was making a six figure income when a debilitating medical condition resulted in her not being able to work and a woman who found the Community Action Partnership of Strafford County after putting her children in its Head Start program When she needed fuel assistance CAP of Strafford County was there Each person who shared their story in the 2016 17 Gift of Warmth talked about their hesitation to ask for help and then their great surprise and pleasure when they were compassionately treated by community action partnership staff I was embarrassed because I was raised and I am raising my kids that we take care of our problems said Crystal Greenwood who shared her story in this year s campaign We do and will continue to do that But if life gets out of hand please ask for help The people at RCA are so graceful and they want us to come to them if they can help Gift of Warmth would simply not be viable without the generosity of community members willing to donate And donate they have Through 11 years Gift of Warmth has now raised nearly 460 000 Donations are still being accepted How to help Tax deductible donations can be made by sending a check for any amount to Seacoast Media Group c o Gift of Warmth 111 New Hampshire Ave Portsmouth NH 03801 Please include which organization the donation is intended for Rockingham Community Action or Community Action Partnership of Strafford County To apply for fuel assistance call RCA at 431 2911 People experiencing any significant hardship and financial crisis can also call the number and they will be referred to the appropriate person The main office is at 4 Cutts St in Portsmouth For more information visit www snhs org For CAP of Strafford County visit www straffordcap org or call 435 2500 The Dover office is at 61 Locust St The Farmington office is at 527 Main St and its phone number is 460 4313
