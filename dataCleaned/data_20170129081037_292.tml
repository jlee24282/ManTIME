<TITLE>Midori makes a virtuoso visit to Marin</TITLE>
<TEXT>
More than 30 years after bursting on the scene as a pint-size violin prodigy, Midori continues to set an example for how to be an engaged musician in the modern world. 
 
Sure, she gives first-rate performances — that’s item one on the job description, and she did it once again on Friday, Jan. 27, in a splendid appearance with the Marin Symphony. But she also busies herself with a host of other activities — education, commissioning, audience development — that help ensure a place for the musical tradition through generations to come. 
 
It was those activities that brought her to the Marin Veterans’ Memorial Auditorium in San Rafael in the first place. Each year Midori spends a week in residency with a regional orchestra, coaching its youth ensembles, making school visits and leading educational workshops, and this year the Marin Symphony was the beneficiary of her largesse. 
 
On Friday, Midori’s behind-the-scenes activities were conveyed to the audience through a short video, but the sheer musical impact of her presence was evident in the performance of Britten’s Violin Concerto that she gave with Music Director Alasdair Neale and the orchestra. 
 
This early masterpiece, written when the composer was in his mid-20s, has for too long been a relatively overlooked jewel. Fortunately, the piece has begun to regain some of its appeal to performers, and Midori’s rendition — vivacious, expressive and full of judiciously chosen interpretive points — was a good reminder why. 
 
For one thing, Britten’s work is a wonderful combination of the traditional and the wildly unconventional, in both its details and its large-scale rhetoric. The thematic material sounds graspable enough, except that it never quite goes where you expect; there’s plenty of opportunity for virtuoso display from the soloist without making that subordinate to the overall musical argument; and the finale, a broad passacaglia in a tenderly elegiac vein, more or less comes out of nowhere. 
 
Midori and Neale collaborated on a performance that found an optimal balance among all these forces. She brought eloquence and energy to the opening government, a sense of concentrated urgency to the big cadenza, and unruffled nobility to the finale. Neale and the orchestra supported her with full-voiced, detailed playing. 
 
The orchestra sounded just as focused on its own, beginning with the buoyant rhythms and crackling instrumental textures of Mason Bates’ exuberant curtain-raiser “Devil’s Radio.” Written in 2014 for the Sun Valley Summer Symphony, the annual festival that Neale runs in the mountains of Idaho, it’s a sampler of Bates’ most supple and crackling musical ideas, and the orchestra dispatched it without a hitch. 
 
For even more ensemble display, there was Bartók’s Concerto for Orchestra, which occupied the second half of the program in a muscular, finely blended account. 
 
Neale proved particularly adept at mustering big orchestral textures in the outer movements, although the streamlined writing in the even-numbered movements also elicited strong solos from several of the players.
