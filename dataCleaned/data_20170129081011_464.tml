<TITLE>Herald-Standard opens new office in Connellsville</TITLE>
<TEXT>
A leader in providing coverage of the area, the Herald-Standard is increasing its presence in Connellsville by opening a bureau office at 150 W. Crawford Ave.

“When the Tribune-Review pulled out of Fayette County in 2016, we saw an opportunity, especially with our Sunday product, to be more involved in the redevelopment of Connellsville,’’ said Robert Pinarski, Herald-Standard publisher. “Connellsville has always been a substantial part of the Herald-Standard audience, and we’re fortunate enough to be able to invest and play a more integral role in Connellsville.’’

The venture marks the return of a Connellsville bureau for the Herald-Standard, which formerly maintained an office in the city for many years.

Herald-Standard Executive Editor Michael Palm said, “I’m excited about opening this office. It puts us back in the heart of the Connellsville community.’’

Palm noted, “We’ve always covered the city of Connellsville, and, in recent years, have even enhanced our news coverage. I’m hoping by opening a Herald-Standard office in the city, this will prove our commitment to the Connellsville community and entice residents to share more of their news with us.’’

The Herald-Standard publishes six days a week and offers the only Sunday newspaper in the community.

Like the Uniontown office, the Connellsville bureau will be open 8:30 a.m.-5 p.m. Monday through Friday and staffed with editorial and sales personnel, bringing an array of services to the community. The office phone number is 724-603-2008.

“We will have papers for sale there. Subscribers can pay their bills and set up subscriptions,’’ Pinarski said. “The public can drop by to discuss news item and advertising needs.’’

In addition, the Herald-Standard will offer services that include the Be Local Network, which is a marketing plan dedicated to strengthening the region’s economy and promoting local independent businesses, as well as OnPoint Media Solutions, designed to help small businesses thrive in the digital age.

Ted Flowers, Be Local coordinator and Herald-Standard multimedia consultant, said, “We want to educate residents and visitors about the importance of thinking, buying, investing and visiting locally owned and independent business to strengthen the local economy. We want them to use our motto, which is ‘Think, Buy, Invest and Visit.’’’

OnPoint offers advertising and digital services like website design, social media management, texting, blogging and more to help increase revenue for businesses and organizations.

Pinarski pointed out the Herald-Standard’s new bureau is part of a growing redevelopment in Connellsville.

“Over the past few years, a number of businesses have opened in Connellsville. Connellsville has a vibrant and energized chamber of commerce,’’ Pinarski said. “Greg Lincoln, the mayor, is working hard in the community, and we want to be part of that as well as help bring jobs to the Connellsville community.’’

Community leaders are welcoming.

“We are very excited to have the Herald-Standard back in the city again,’’ said Lincoln. “I’m taking it as a positive of the hard work we’ve been doing in the city to make it more marketable. There are more things to cover in the city. 2017 is going to be a very positive year for Connellsville.’’

“We’re glad they’re back,” said Michael Edwards, executive director for the , who noted, “The whole Be Local program is something that’s important to us. Most of our businesses are private and independently owned.”

Brooke Deason, executive director of the Greater Connellsville Chamber of Commerce, said, “We’re looking forward to more of a storefront presence from the Herald-Standard, having them here, being able to interact, share stories and be part of Be Local. We already promote Be Local. Our businesses are looking forward to being more involved.’’

Deason added, “We’ve had a long relationship with the Herald-Standard, but having them up the street is convenient.’’

The Herald-Standard’s new bureau is one of many businesses locating to downtown Connellsville in recent years.

The new Cobblestone Hotel and Suites is slated to open on North First Street near the Great Allegheny Passage biking and hiking trail that runs from Pittsburgh to Washington, D.C.

Edwards noted, “A lot of businesses have been built around the Great Allegheny Passage. It was completed a couple of years ago and now we’re seeing spin-off businesses.’’

Edwards said they include restaurants, and noted state Sen. Pat Stefano, R-Bullskin Township, established an office in Downtown Connellsville. The Connellsville Canteen contains a local World War II history museum as well as the Indian Creek Valley Railroad Display in addition to a café.

Skip and Pat Colborn, of Colborn and Harrison Properties, own the building in which the Herald-Standard’s new bureau is located.

The couple had been living in Florida, then going back and forth before returning three years ago to Mill Run where Skip Colborn grew up, graduating from Connellsville Area High School in 1969. He is a licensed landscape architect and maintains businesses in Florida and Pennsylvania.

The Colborns purchased their Connellsville building in December 2014. It housed a number of businesses over the years, most recently Salvatore’s Sewing Center.

Skip Colborn, who attended business workshops in Connellsville when he started coming back to the area, said, “Downtown Connellsville seemed to show excitement in its revitalization. My wife and I were looking for a long-term investment in Connellsville, and this building would not only help us but could do something for downtown Connellsville.’’

The couple has made renovations to some of the upstairs apartments and are happy to welcome the Herald-Standard as street-front clients.

“We were looking for a client who would contribute to the current upswing of downtown Connellsville and be involved in the community,’’ Skip Colborn said, noting, “We are excited that the Herald-Standard is coming in.’’
