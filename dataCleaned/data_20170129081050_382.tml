Video: Wet 'N' Wild to hire hundreds... 
PALM SPRINGS, Calif. - Wet 'N' Wild Palm Springs is two months away from re-opening for the 2017 season, but before they open the park gates, they're hiring more than 300 employees.  
 
Saturday morning the water park hosted a job fair.  
 
Dennis Campbell Jr. is one of many applicants who's hoping to get hired.  
 
"I always wanted to take care of my family financial needs and I always wanted to have a job just to feel good about myself, and I think this is the place I want to do that," Campbell said.  
 
Wet 'N' Wild operations manager, Corion Wynn, said a willing and positive attitude are qualities he looks for in a candidate.   
 
The park is hoping to fill positions in at least 10 different departments.  
 
"For the lifeguards you need to be able to swim 200 yards none-stop. You need to be able to tread water and retrieve a brick. For slide attendants it's a lot easier. You just need to be able to safely dispatch people and get them down the slide safely. EMT and security guards have a little more additional training they need before hand," Wynn explained. 
 
The park will continue to accept applications into the Summer months. You must be at least 16 years of age to apply for most positions.
