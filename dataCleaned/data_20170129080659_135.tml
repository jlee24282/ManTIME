<TITLE>Veteran Spears wins Open mixed doubles</TITLE>
<TEXT>
American veteran Abigail Spears and Colombian partner Juan Sebastian Cabal have claimed victory in the Australian Open mixed doubles' final. 
 
Age continues to be no barrier to success at the Australian Open, with American veteran Abigail Spears taking out the mixed doubles crown with Colombian partner Juan Sebastian Cabal. 
 
The duo were too good for No.2 seeds, Croatia's Ivan Dodig and India's Sania Mirza, charging to a 6-2 6-4 victory in Sunday afternoon's final. 
 
It is the first grand slam silverware for Spears or Cabal, who are competing at Melbourne Park together for the first time. 
 
The victory is particularly sweet for 35-year-old Spears, who has twice finished runner-up in the mixed doubles at the US Open and has outlined plans to retire at the end of the season. 
 
Serena and Venus Williams - aged 35 and 36 respectively - faced off on Saturday night in the oldest women's grand slam decider, 38-year-old twins Bob and Mike Bryan lost the men's doubles final to Australian John Peers and Henri Kontinen of Finland. 
 
The retro theme will continue on Sunday night in the men's singles final, with 35-year-old Roger Federer and 30-year-old Rafael Nadal doing battle in a hotly anticipated decider.
