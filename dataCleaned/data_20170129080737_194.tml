<TITLE>Our View Thumbs up to new leaders for Rialto</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Thumbs up To the new members of the Rialto board and both Joliet Mayor Bob O Dekirk and Gov Bruce Rauner who appointed them The new board led by Chairman Robert Filotto appears to be filled with top members of the local business community and seems to be heading the theater in the right direction working to pay off old bills and make the theater financially viable into the future while taking its time on reviewing and potentially negotiating a new contract with booking contractor VenuWorks We believe the board is set up well and will make the right moves heading into the future for the theater Thumbs down To the continued squabbling among Lincoln Way District 210 board candidates that has led to not all candidates agreeing to attend the Lincoln Way Area Taxpayers Unite candidate forum on Feb 2 While it is understandable that candidates might not want to be involved if they feel a forum will be unfair we believe it is in the best interest of taxpayers and the district for school board members to be at one place at one time to discuss the issues and allow the community to decide in one place who they would like to be on the board heading into the future For that reason we hope that all candidates will attend the forum to be held on March 8 by the Lincoln Way Education Association Thumbs up To the Cathedral of St Raymond Nonnatus for its Blue Mass to honor local law enforcement officers for their work in the community Students at St Raymond School took part in the program as part of their commitment this year to the culture of RISE or Respect Integrity Service and Excellence Thumbs down To whoever decided to set fires at two parks in New Lenox a week ago The fires at Sharon s Bay Park and Lion s Den Park destroyed a fence and shed along with expending the time of local firefighters and police in solving the issue Needlessly setting fires in public areas is both costly and dangerous and can also lead to unforeseen issues as they spread Police believe both fires were set intentionally Comments
