COLONIAL HEIGHTS — On Oct. 25, 2016, five members of Violet Bank Garden Club collaborated with the city's Parks and Recreation Department to plant and mulch 40 Korean boxwoods in a hedgerow across the front of the Violet Bank Museum property. 
 
The decision to plant boxwoods is historically accurate because, according to Russell Woodburn, museum curator, colonial gardens typically grew boxwoods as a part of the landscaping. 
 
With input from the city's horticulturist, Amy Armstrong, it was decided to purchase Korean boxwoods because of their hardiness, low upkeep, mounding characteristics, and they are deer and rabbit resistant. 
 
The boxwoods were purchased with funds donated by Violet Bank Garden Club and a Piedmont District Grant, which were matched by the city of Colonial Heights as part of the five-year plan “for general restoration and improvements to the most important and recognized city-owned historic building, Violet Bank.” 
 
Because the cost of the boxwoods was less than was budgeted, the city horticulturist was able to order 60 bushes. 
 
Craig Skalak, director of Parks and Recreation, asked the garden club to extend the hedgerow along the north side of the property. 
 
After the city workers marked and cleared the space, six garden club members, Amy Armstrong and her assistants, met on Nov. 21, 2016, to plant and mulch the additional 20 boxwoods. 
 
In the next year, Skalak would like to complete the hedgerow on the north side of the property and continue planting boxwoods along the back of the Violet Bank grounds.
