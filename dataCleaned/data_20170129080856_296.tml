<TITLE>Why India should resist getting flattered by Trump s </TITLE>
<TEXT>
By Jyoti Malhotra A droll picture of US president Donald Trump in khaki shorts after talking to Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been furiously circulating on social media and Whatsapp showing once again that humour can go where no strategic analyst dares to even think of A panel of top foreign policy honchos which included former national security advisor Shivshankar Menon was true to form at the Jaipur Literature Festival last week as they agreed that the disruption caused by the 45th US President is good for India because it creates spaces for middling powers like Delhi to manoeuvre foreign policy in the national interest And if that sounded cold blooded and transactional said Carnegie India director C Rajamohan then that was a good thing as India has to be even more more and more transactional if that suited her Perhaps it has always been like this in key centres of power worldwide At the height of the non aligned movement NAM led by the troika of India Egypt and Yugoslavia several NAM members were unafraid of striking deals at the cost of other NAM relationships Also Read In one week Trump shakes up Washington and the world So should the pursuit of foreign affairs subject itself to the high moral ground The Jaipur Litfest panel cited above would certainly say no But for a unique civilization like India which marshalled a freedom movement to redeem itself it cannot be that its foreign policy is so divorced from national values and so devoted to vaulting ambition that it shuts its eyes to all that is wilfully abominable Hint of Desperation When Trump called Modi earlier this week to say hello media outlets gushed that he was only the fifth head of government the US president had spoken to Even before Putin some media outlets crowed Modi is likely to make that trip to America sooner than later so as to quickly establish a relationship with the most powerful man in the world As India s relations with China deteriorate the PM will increasingly see Trump as a hedge against the other Asian power especially as Trump has openly stated his intention to curb Xi Jinping s dream of becoming Numero Uno The realpolitik school is already applauding And what of Trump s open hostility to Muslims and Muslim immigrants For a country with the world s second largest Muslim population that is a course to worry about Then there is Trump s determination to build a wall so as to prevent Mexicans from neighbouring Mexico enter his country Or the decision to ban abortion and roll back decades of the women s liberation movement not to speak of his abhorrent locker room talk on the campaign trail It boggles the mind but I m almost sure Indira Gandhi wouldn t have fallen forward so determinedly Perhaps that assumption is also being made because Mrs Gandhi was also a woman although in that department of high female standards which includes a sense of distinctive right and wrong the British PM Theresa May seems terribly lacking as she rushed to meet Trump this weekend Come to think of it how many women does Modi have in his senior echelons who could strike a dissenting note and offer restraining advice Sushma Swaraj the best of them all was marginalised even before she fell ill Everyone knows Vasundhara Raje and Modi hardly see eye to eye The Chinese philosopher Sun Tzu said that for any leader to be successful he should know his enemy Deng Xiaoping took a leaf out of that book to formulate his Twenty Four Character strategy which enjoined his fellow men and women to observe the situation calmly and refuse to react Modi should read Deng s book and follow his advice In the turbulence that follows Trump s ascension to power so much better to stay cool and refuse to be flattered A multi polar world suits India s interests far better than hanging on to the coat tails of just one power especially one which refuses to respect large parts of his population India s foreign policy has to be rooted in domestic values and must emerge from it The writer is a senior journalist
