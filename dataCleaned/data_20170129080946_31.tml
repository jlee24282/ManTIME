<TITLE>Kendall Jenner Was scared of telling parents about boyfriends</TITLE>
<TEXT>
So of course it s pretty shocking to hear that Kendall actually kept a huge secret from both her parents back during her days as a high school student Kendall who was homeschooled for a majority of her teens shared that the craziest thing she ever did during that time was fib to my parents about where I was at night I ve grown up a lot since high school but I feel like personality wise at least I was pretty similar to how I am now The Keeping Up With the Kardashians star has opened up about feeling so mortified about telling mother Kris Jenner and her father Caitlyn formerly Bruce Jenner of her relationships because she thought she would get told of Because my parents weren t very strict Ky and I were super responsible she wrote The supermodel now 21 took to her blog on Friday January 27 to share the wildest thing she ever did in high school We d invite a bunch of people over to hang out but it was never a rager lol They were OK with it if we went to parties because they knew we weren t getting into trouble we never did anything that bad My dad didn t really know I had a boyfriend So if there was a mutual level of trust between Kendall and her parents what could possibly be enough to make the model lie and what more importantly what was the lie about
