<TITLE>Learn from Craig Machen s can do attitude</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Watching the swell come in on Saturday Craig Machen s arms moved quicker and he caught the wave on to Burnie beach There are many problems in this world that need attention But there are also only a set few people prepared to get out and attempt to fix them Craig Machen is one of those inspirational few Watching the swell come in on Saturday afternoon Craig s arms moved quicker and he caught the wave on to Burnie beach That feeling of sand touching the bottom of his ski signaled the end of a 25 day circumnavigation of Tasmania A headwind harboured his progress most days and the weather made life tough But thinking of his friend and Motor Neurone Disease sufferer Kirk Dicker Craig pushed on His goal was to raise 20 000 for MND but on Saturday a giant cheque for 43 785 was presented to Mr Dicker Craig identified a cause that needed funding and did something about it The admiration of his feat is only matched by the admiration for the people living with MND MND is a progressive terminal neurological disease that can strike anyone There is no known cure and no effective treatment Each day in Australia two people die from MND and two more are diagnosed People with MND progressively lose the use of their limbs and ability to speak swallow and breathe whilst their mind and senses usually remain intact Mr Dicker is aware of all this he knows what is coming and cherishes each moment Craig s paddle and the significant contribution of almost 50 000 by people across the state and probably the nation will go a long way to finding a cure for the debilitating disease With society s races and faiths seemingly becoming more divisive it is good to know there are still community minded people ready to pick up the paddle and jump in To often in this world people stand on the sidelines but it takes someone courageous and strong to get out and do something about it Well done Craig on behalf of the entire North West Coast for your initiative and completing that significant achievement in such a short space of time And good on the region for getting behind him It is what makes us great Remember you can still donate to Craig s Circumnavigating Tasmania for MND
