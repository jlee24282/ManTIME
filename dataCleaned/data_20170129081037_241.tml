<TITLE>Editorial: A sad display in Columbia</TITLE>

Senate President Pro Tem Hugh Leatherman refused to recognize his constitutional duty. 
 Herald-Journal Editorial Board  
South Carolinians watched last week as state senators carried out a careful, well-choreographed ballet aimed at avoiding the requirements of the state constitution and making sure that a longtime power broker gets to hold onto his power. 
 
Gov. Nikki Haley resigned from her position when the U.S. Senate confirmed her as the new U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. That meant that the lieutenant governor, Henry McMaster, was elevated to governor. 
 
According to the South Carolina Constitution, the leader of the state Senate, the president pro tem, becomes the lieutenant governor. That’s what happened when former Lt. Gov. Ken Ard was forced to resign due to ethics violations. Then-Senate President Pro Tem Glenn McConnell became lieutenant governor. 
 
McConnell did not want the position. The Senate president pro tem is one of the most powerful lawmakers in South Carolina, and this is a legislature-driven state. The lieutenant governor’s position is mostly ceremonial and lacks any real power. 
 
But McConnell said that his duty under the state constitution was clear, and he became lieutenant governor. 
 
Senate President Pro Tem Hugh Leatherman did not recognize his constitutional duty. Despite the fact that he took the same oath of office as his colleagues to “preserve, protect, and defend the constitution of this state,” he decided he would escape from his duty. 
 
To Leatherman’s credit, he was open about shirking his duty. He was completely transparent about his intentions of holding onto power and twisting and evading the rules of the constitution. He told his fellow senators when he ran for re-election as president pro tem that he wouldn’t serve as lieutenant governor if the situation arose. 
 
So when it did arise, he resigned his position and allowed then-Sen. Kevin Bryant of Anderson to be elected Senate president pro tem so that he could become lieutenant governor. Once that transition was done, state senators elected Leatherman to resume his powerful post. 
 
It was not unanimous. Sen. Harvey Peeler of Gaffney challenged Leatherman for the president pro tem position, and 16 Republican senators voted for him. These senators recognized that our state leaders should follow the rules laid out in the constitution. 
 
They also realize that as Senate president pro tem and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Leatherman holds too much power for one man. 
 
In the end, this dance allowed an 85-year-old senator, who has amassed a great deal of power by virtue of his longevity, to hold onto that authority. 
 
Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey correctly called it “a shameless and obvious game of musical chairs.” He pointed out that people know when politicians don’t play by the rules. And the people are sick of politicians avoiding the rules. 
 
This entire episode demonstrates that too many lawmakers are concerned only with their internal alliances, their deals to support one another, their drive to accumulate their own power. They are not concerned with fulfilling their oath of office. They are not concerned with serving the people of this state. 
 
Leatherman just pulled off a shameless, naked power grab and an evasion of his responsibility under the South Carolina Constitution. Twenty-eight state senators helped him do it. Their constituents should ask them who they are really serving – the public or their cronies.
