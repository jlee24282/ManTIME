<TEXT>
Antonio Conte can do no wrong at present The Chelsea manager watched his team ease into the fifth round of the FA Cup at the expense of a Brentford team that did not turn up until the second half and the icing on the cake was provided by Branislav Ivanovic the player that he had dropped from the starting line up Conte introduced the Chelsea stalwart whose future at the club looks uncertain as a 64th minute substitute and with his first meaningful involvement Ivanovic scored his first goal of the season to make it 3 0 He gave the ball to Pedro and rumbled forward in support before getting it back and squeezing a low finish underneath the goalkeeper Daniel Bentley There was more Ivanovic got himself into the area towards the end and when he was taken out by Yoann Barbet the referee Michael Oliver pointed to the penalty spot Michy Batshuayi scored to round off Chelsea s 17th win in their past 19 matches in all competitions Related Wolves stun Liverpool after Richard Stearman kickstarts FA Cup upset Conte made nine changes from the line up that had beaten Hull City in the Premier League last Sunday retaining only Pedro and C sar Azpilicueta but it did not matter His team still had plenty of cohesion and punch where it mattered with Pedro outstanding and Ruben Loftus Cheek and Willian not too far behind Pedro scored the second his eighth of the season and also had a hand in the first and third goals Chelsea took an early lead and what a goal it was a beautifully executed free kick by Willian which he got to dip sharply after it had cleared the defensive wall Dean Smith the Brentford manager did not look happy at the award of the foul but Lasse Vibe did check Pedro after Chelsea had worked a short corner routine It was Willian s seventh goal of the season Conte s team made inroads up the right from the first whistle where Pedro overlapped from the wing back position to good effect What a season the Spaniard is having and he scored his team s second before the midway point of the first half At that point the tie looked over Willian initiated the move rolling the ball into Batshuayi who threaded a pass forward for Loftus Cheek The young attacking midfielder did not look to get a touch but Pedro had hared up in anticipation of being involved and he was His touch was instant and the low stabbed finish was too good for Bentley Pedro did not have much room in which to work but he only needs a yard at present It was men against boys in the first half and the only surprise was that Chelsea did not rack up more goals They created the chances with Loftus Cheek who played to the left of Batshuayi the central striker in marauding mood Loftus Cheek showed his power and a deft touch at times too He had three sightings of goal before the interval and from two of them he forced Bentley into smart saves Bentley managed to deny Batshuayi at close quarters following a goalmouth scramble on 27 minutes scruffily halting the ball on his own line and he later touched Cesc F bregas s low shot from distance past the post Chelsea could also point to a scuffed John Terry effort when the captain was well placed and a swing and a miss from Batshuayi who promptly buried his head in his hands Brentford could not wait for the half time whistle Their only flicker before that came when Barbet speared a shot from a tight angle into Asmir Begovic s midriff Brentford brought 6 000 fans and they found their voices when their team began the second half with a little more hustle It felt as though Smith had to have had some strong words during the interval and the response was good The men in red and white stripes finally got into the faces of their opponents and there was a better balance to the tie for a while The visitors had chances as well two presentable ones the first immediately after the break It was teed up by Ryan Woods for Vibe who had got the better of Terry Begovic was off his line to claw the ball away from him The second came on 63 minutes and it followed a piece of skill inside the penalty area from Nico Yennaris that Dennis Bergkamp would have been proud of Yennaris pirouetted away from Terry and Azpilicueta to open up the opportunity but again Begovic was out quickly to block Loftus Cheek had hit the crossbar after excellent work from Willian on 58 minutes while he went close following another surge into the area before Ivanovic made his push for the headlines This article was written by David Hytner at Stamford Bridge for The Observer on Saturday 28th January 2017 17 14 Europe London guardian co uk Guardian News and Media Limited 2
