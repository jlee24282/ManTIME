<TITLE>KCI Start over involve public</TITLE>
<TEXT>
The Republican victory in November has changed the rules for getting things done in Washington D C Perhaps surprising to some this could work to the benefit of both Republicans and Democrats on one issue of importance to the Midland Empire The four state region is heavily dependent on Kansas City International Airport This is why both the flying public and many civic leaders have challenged a proposed massive overhaul of the airport that would make needed improvements but also potentially jeopardize the airport s prized convenience to air travelers This 1 2 billion project stalled last year after surveys showed a strong majority of Kansas City voters opposed a plan for demolishing the existing terminals and building a larger single terminal hub That plan would require voter approval new investments from airlines and new user fees from KCI customers from the region Now word comes that proponents of an airport overhaul have wised up to political realities The Kansas City Star reports backers realize they need to do more to win the support of Republican U S Rep Sam Graves an ardent critic who has 16 years of seniority in the House and holds seats on important transportation infrastructure and aviation committees Graves hails from Tarkio in far Northwest Missouri but his district encompasses much of Kansas City The Star news report suggests boosters of an airport overhaul made a strategic error Graves was cast by airport supporters as a pest rather than someone whose support could help swing public opinion and federal influence in the airport s favor Apparently a new view has taken hold over the last several months It was affirmed after the election and when it became known KCI could be a candidate for federal funding under President Trump s proposals for a massive program to replace aging infrastructure You would have to think that money would be welcomed and heavily dependent on Graves recommendation This is where the tide may turn in favor of the public Graves spokesman told The Star he isn t against reasonable renovations at KCI but in his mind he needs there to be public buy in for that to happen The spokesman adds The way to do that is for the city to start the process over be more transparent with the public from the get go and consider every option Graves is in sync with his constituents on this important issue It remains to be seen whether boosters of a big airport overhaul are prepared to take a step back invite the public fully into the process and consider a wider range of options
