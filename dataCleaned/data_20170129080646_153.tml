<TITLE>Spelling champ is crowned at Fort Frye</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Catie Sleek, a seventh grader at Fort Frye High School, won Fort Frye’s district spelling bee held Thursday, January 19 at Fort Frye High School.  Competing against twelve other spellers representing Beverly-Center, Lowell, and Salem-Liberty Elementary Schools as well as Fort Frye junior high, who conquered such words as ‘burglarious’ and ‘thaumaturge’, Sleek won by correctly spelling the word ‘alliteration’.  Second place went to Keira Knox, a sixth grader at Beverly-Center, who fought through twelve rounds with Sleek before bowing out.  Third place went to Beverly-Center fifth grader Brandon Dye.  Rounding out the group was sixth grader Jackson Lowe from Salem-Liberty, who had his own battle to fight with C.J. Riddle after both boys missed in the same round earlier in the bee and had to be brought back up on stage to compete for fourth place.  All four of these spellers will represent Fort Frye at the regional spelling bee scheduled for Friday, March 24 at Marietta High School. 
  
Other students competing in the district spelling bee were:  Anna McIntire, Fort Frye Junior High;  Phinn Spindler and Brenden Schultz — Beverly-Center;  Kaden Dowler, Emma Snyder, C.J. Riddle, and Gage Mace — Lowell Elementary;  and Kianna O’Brien and Bryce Moncrief — Salem-Liberty Elementary. 
 
District coordinator for the spelling bee was Karen Kubota, assisted by Megan Miller.  Judges were teachers Paige Greathouse, Lynette Stengel, Teri Huck, and Alaina Jones. Pronouncer was Sue Sampson.
