<TITLE>Kyrgios can be world No.1 - if he gets a coach</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Former world No.4 Brad Gilbert says Nick Kyrgios could be world No.1, but only if he gets a coach and a good team around him.

Multiple grand slam winner Rennae Stubbs adds part of that decision is whether Kyrgios wants to be great.

Kyrgios hasn't had a coach since he parted ways with Todd Larkham in the lead-up to Wimbledon in 2015, but admitted it was probably time to get one following his exit from the Australian Open in the second round.

Gilbert felt it would be the difference between the Canberran climbing up 12 rungs from world No.13, where he was ranked on Sunday.

The Olympic Games bronze medallist said having that steadying influence around him would allow him to reach his potential.

"Nick has unbelievable talent and he just needs to have a team around him to make his ability become way better," Gilbert said on the ABC's Offsiders.

"I think he needs a coach to come in and say, 'This is going to be the physio, this is going to be the trainer', and he's going to come in and establish respect and change the team.

"When he's willing to do that I think that he has the capabilities of being No.1 in the world.

"It won't happen until he puts an incredible team around him and they have discipline in the team. And then his god-given talent can become a lot better."

Gilbert's been a successful coach, having helped Andre Agassis win six of eight major titles.

He led Andy Roddick to his 2003 US Open triumph and also worked with current No.1 Andy Murray and Kei Nishikori.

When pressed on whether he'd been keen to work with the 21-year-old, Gilbert didn't rule it out.

"I've never spent time with him, so that would be the first thing ... you never say never about anything, you never know," he said.

Stubbs, who won four grand slam doubles titles during her career, said because Kyrgios was a "special person" he was the only one who could decide on who his coach should be.

Kyrgios has been linked with Roger Rasheed, Lleyton Hewitt and Radek Stepanek, although the latter is still playing.

But Stubbs felt the decision he was facing was much more than just whether to get a coach and if so who, but just how good he wanted to be.

If he wanted to be great, like the Australian Open men's singles finalists Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, then it was up to him.

"He's a special person. He will have to make this decision on his own," Stubbs said.

"It's kind of like when someone's an alcoholic, at some point your family and friends around you are saying you've got to stop drinking, but at some point you're the one that has to make the decision to do it.

"And he has to make the decision in himself that he wants to be great and it's hard being a great tennis player."
