<TEXT>
LOS ANGELES Frans Nielsen might not be as well known as Pittsburgh Penguins star Sidney Crosby but he s got skills Nielsen took part in his first skills competition at the Staples Center Saturday afternoon helping the Atlantic Division to the victory over the Metropolitan Central and Pacific divisions In the first of six events the NHL Skills Challenge Relay Nielsen got to be the passer with just 45 seconds to put the puck in four very small nets I was a little nervous actually Nielsen said in the crowded Eastern Conference dressing room I think I missed my first one by three feet but when you get the first one then it kind of slows down a little bit It s not easy for sure Need a little luck there too when it goes post and in sometimes The other parts of the relay included one timers puck control stick handling and goalie goals Although Nielsen did his part and Montreal goaltender Carey Price needed just one shot to score Crosby got the Metropolitan Division the win with a quick finish in stick handling Nielsen did not participate in the NHL Four Line Challenge won by the Pacific Division when Arizona goaltender Mike Smith got 20 points by scoring a goal from the opposite end of the ice In the NHL Accuracy Shooting Nielsen helped pass to former New York Islanders teammate Kyle Okposo as Okposo went up against current Islander John Tavares Okposo hit all four targets in 15 97 seconds to Tavares 26 80 It s skills competition so I m just trying to hit the targets Tavares said It s not like you re battling in a game or the corner and you re getting a little bit more physical and playing hard on him Hat s off to him he did a good job and for me it wasn t as efficient as it was last year but it was fun Tavares won the accuracy shooting competition last year but this year Crosby took top honors I think I would like to try the accurate shooting with the targets Nielsen said I think it s one of those big ones every year that and the hardest shot those are two that you remember It would have have been fun to try that Edmonton Oilers captain Connor McDavid easily won the NHL Fastest Skater competition beating Vancouver s Bo Horvat McDavid then had a chance to try to beat Dylan Larkin s one lap record of 13 172 but came up short going 13 310 No one was surprised that Canadiens defenseman Shea Weber won the hardest shot competition with a 102 8 mile an hour blast Winnipeg Jets rookie Patrik Laine was impressive with shots at 101 7 and 101 5 miles per hour Nielsen and Tavares both say they will let Weber and Laine have that competition to themselves I m going to stay out of that one Nielsen said Said Tavares I m glad I didn t participate in the fastest skater or hardest shot that s for sure Those aren t easy especially when you re cold and sitting around and not much warm up and we had a travel day yesterday They re all pretty challenging I know a couple years ago I did the passing and didn t do that well in it so it was nice to be a little bit better this year I did really well on the targets last year didn t go as well this year They re all challenging in their own way they re all a lot of fun That s what it s meant to be is to enjoy and celebrate all the skill and talent that s here and why our game s so great Because Weber won the hardest shot competition that broke the tie with the Metropolitan Division and the Atlantic Division team competed in the shootout against the Pacific Division Despite being one of the best shootout performers in league history Nielsen could not beat Smith You re sitting out there didn t feel really good skating down there after sitting on the ice for half an hour Nielsen said I just tried to keep it simple and hope to catch him five hole It was all fun Boston s Brad Marchand Weber and Crosby with the two point Discover puck scored for the Atlantic Division and only Ryker Kesler Ryan Kesler s 6 year old son could solve Price who may not have given his best effort That meant the Atlantic Division won earning the right to decide which team they would play and which game Price the captain announced they would play the Metropolitan Division in the second game Just want to beat those guys I guess Nielsen said I wasn t really in the decision making but I just heard some guys played the first game last year and it was tough to sit for so long before you had to go out and play again So that s why they went second just want to keep playing if they win It was certainly a win for Nielsen in the first day of his first All Star experience I don t know if there s one specific thing for sure the thing I was a part of out there Nielsen said But just the whole experience everything It was awesome It was just great all these great players It was just a blast out here
