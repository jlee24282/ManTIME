Charli XCX Makes Creepy Appearance In Crazy Crazy Video Week in Review Charli XCX Makes Creepy Appearance In Crazy Crazy Video was a Top 3 story on Friday Radio com Charli XCX appears in the new video for J pop producer Yasutaka Nakata s track Crazy Crazy but not in the way you might think Her face is superimposed upon a model s body creating an unsettling effect and winking towards the song s title At first the visual which also features kawaii artist Kyary Pamyu Pamyu seems relatively straightforward A keyboardist a drummer and a singer perform Crazy Crazy in a room together but the way the camera shoots each character from above or behind keeps their faces hidden Once viewers begin to catch glimpses of everyone s face things turn strange Charli s face appears on the singer s body while Kyary s face appears on the drummer s Charli wrote the track according to The Fader but when it came to recording it she stayed in Los Angeles with Kyary worked with Nakata in Japan Then he stitched everything together much like he s done with his past hits Watch Charli be both Charli and not Charli here Radio com is an official news provider for antiMusic com Copyright Radio com CBS Local Excerpted here with permission advertisement
