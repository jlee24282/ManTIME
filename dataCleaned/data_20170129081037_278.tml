Scottdale, AZ (PRWEB)  January 29, 2017 
 
SCOTTSDALE - January 28, 2017 – Marker Test Diagnostics, Inc., a leading international supplier to the drug testing industry, has entered into an exclusive agreement with Atlantic Biotech Labs of Pompano Beach FL, to distribute its UR Code™ urine marker product. 
 
UR Code is a urine marker that “bar-codes” a subject’s urine and eliminates the need to supervise urine collection. In the form of a soft gel capsule, UR Code is the only patented test worldwide that can analytically detect sample substitution, dilution or adulteration, resulting in unparalleled accuracy and reliability. This superior level of accuracy eliminates up to 30% of the tests that are deliberately falsified in urine drug testing. 
 
This agreement provides Atlantic Biotech with a distinct competitive advantage by delivering improved confirmation testing results to the criminal justice markets (corrections, probation, parole, and drug courts) in the states of Florida and Tennessee. With drug use on the rise and an out of control opioid epidemic nationally, the UR Code product and Atlantic Biotech labs can have a major impact in assisting the criminal justice markets with the latest innovative tools to better manage the clients they serve. 
 
“The partnership with Atlantic Biotech provides for a very unique opportunity for both companies, beginning with the criminal justice markets in Florida and Tennessee,” said Marker Test Chief Executive Officer Kim Christensen. “Together, we believe the specificity of the product will allow Atlantic Biotech Labs to expand their technical operations and expertise in the corrections, probation, parole, and drug court markets by providing the latest technology with enhanced and accurate results reporting to the market decision makers.” 
 
Representatives from both companies are on-site at the AXIS (Addiction eXecutives Industry Summit) in Naples, FL from January 28 to February 1 (booth 26) at the Naples Grand Beach Resort, and at DATIA (Drug and Alcohol Industry Association) conference May 16 -18, in Orlando, FL.
