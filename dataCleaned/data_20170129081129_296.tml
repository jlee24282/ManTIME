<TEXT>
SALT LAKE CITY Kyle Kuzma had 18 points and 12 rebounds as Utah raced to a commanding lead Saturday and held off Oregon State s late rally for an 86 78 victory David Collette had 13 points and Parker Van Dyke and JoJo Zamora added 11 apiece as Utah 15 6 overall 6 3 Pac 12 led by as many as 28 points before subbing in the seldom used reserves midway through the second half Once Kuzma and the starters sat down the Utes collapsed Stephen Thompson Jr had a career high 30 points and JaQuori McLaughin scored 22 He was one guy that was fighting from the first second coach Wayne Tinkle said of freshman guard McLaughlin who had no turnovers and made all four of his foul shots He played a great game A furious comeback got Oregon State 4 18 0 9 within six points in the final minute A couple of their guards had tremendous nights Utes coach Larry Krystkowiak said They were a focal point for us coming in here and we still didn t have much of an answer for them They made some plays down the stretch to make it interesting Utah s bench players let the lead slip within single digits as Thompson scored on a dunk and two free throws to make it 78 70 with 2 00 remaining The Utes starters returned but Thompson scored again and then drew a foul on a 3 point attempt with 51 1 seconds left He made two of three free throws to pull the Beavers to 81 74 I kind of figured a comeback could happen because we kept taking our foot off the pedal Even in the first half we weren t really playing with energy It came back to haunt us Zamora said
