<TITLE>Stephen Curry took his MVP form in the Warriors' latest Clippers blowout (Ball Don't Lie)</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Stephen Curry was electric on Saturday night.  The conventional wisdom on Stephen Curry’s performance in the 2016-17 season says that he has suffered from the Golden State Warriors’ offseason acquisition of Kevin Durant.  Curry is still the league’s preeminent perimeter threat, but he has not captured the same level of excellence on off-the-dribble, several-feet-past-the-line three-pointers.
