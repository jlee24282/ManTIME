<TITLE>Premier League | Jan 29 2017, 3:54 pm HKT Conte praise for young stars</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Antonio Conte praised the performance of his young Chelsea side following their comprehensive 4-0 win over Brentford in the FA Cup on Saturday.   

  

Goals from Willian, Pedro, Branislav Ivanovic and Michy Batshuayi sealed the win, and a place in the Fifth Round of the famous competition. 
 
Conte had made wholesale changes to his team with the likes of Batshuayi, Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Nathan Ake, Kurt Zouma and Nathaniel Chalobah all starting, and after an impressive performance, the manager has hinted at giving his fringe players more game-time going forward. 
 
After the game, he said: "Our young players are growing and for me and the club that is very important because this season we do not have the Champions League or the Europa League, so we only have the league and the FA Cup. 
 
"And the FA Cup is a good opportunity to see the improvement of these young players and I am satisfied with what I saw today.Â  
 
"But for sure these young players are very important for me and the cub and if they deserve to play, I am ready to put them in the team. 
 
"I am not scared of the young players, but the only thing that I ask is that they must be ready to play." 
 
He added: "The FA Cup, our target was to go to the next round, it has happened and now it is important to see the draw and I hope to play the next game at home again. 
 
"But it is important to take it game by game in the FA Cup and the league. But for sure, nothing will be easy in the FA Cup or the league." 
 
Conte has, meanwhile, admitted that Ivanovic, who scored his 34th Chelsea goal in his 377th Chelsea appearance, may well be on his way out of the club. 
 
The 32-year-old right-back, who has not made a Premier League start since September, only has a contract with Chelsea until the end of the season. 
 
Conte explained: "When one player has the habit to play every game and it happens that you are not playing regularly, it's not easy to accept this decision. 
 
"Ivan knows well the situation and I'm pleased if he remains here, if he stays with us. But in this situation, for sure, the player must make the best decision for him, for his family. 
 
"Ivan deserves great respect for his career at Chelsea. He played a lot of games, he won a lot with this team. 
 
"I think we have to respect every decision."
