<TITLE>Boston Pops salute the Beatles and an enduring British invasion</TITLE>
<TEXT>
By Keith Lockhart, conductor of the Boston Pops for the past 22 years, laughs a little when he says that The Pops playing the Beatles is hardly a programming stretch for Florida, where the audiences of Baby Boomers fit exactly into the Beatles demographic.  
 
“This is a very typical Boston Pops program, with a very wide musical expression and look at music that broadens the definition of what it means to be classical music,” said Lockhart in a telephone interview. “My definition of classical music is music that speaks to generations to which it wasn’t intended. This will have an equal appeal to people born 40 years after the Beatles broke up.”  
 
The title of the Pops’ upcoming concert tour in Florida, which will stop in Sarasota at the Van Wezel Performing Arts Hall on Feb. 2, is a bit of a marketing misnomer. While iconic music by the Beatles will form the backbone of the second act, the concert’s overall theme is a broader definition of the British Invasion, starting with classical British music and then moving into British rock ’n roll, “a lot of things that influenced music over here,” said Lockhart.  
 
The concert will open with Elgar’s “Pomp and Circumstance,” portions of which are known to everyone who’s ever attended a high school commencement ceremony; “Water Music” by Handel (“a good German coming to British shores and becoming more British than British”); and Benjamin Britten’s “A Young Person’s Guide to the Orchestra,” narrated by author and actor John Hodgman, well known for his work on Jon Stewart’s “The Daily Show.”  
 
The Britten work, said Lockhart, “has always suffered from, in my humble opinion, a rather lame narration.” Hodgman offers “a new and perhaps more contemporary look at the orchestra’s instruments and the characters who play them; a really hysterical march through the orchestra.”  
 
The second act will focus on Pops arrangements of the best of the Beatles and other British rock bands, including The Who and Led Zeppelin.  
 
“The Pops were probably the first orchestra to play the Beatles,” said Lockhart, referring to legendary Pops conductor Arthur Fiedler, who led the orchestra from 1930 to 1979. Fiedler and the Pops recorded an album of Beatles music in 1967.  
 
“We don’t play those arrangements any more,” said Lockhart, saying they sounded “a little naive. It’s very difficult translating rock music to an orchestra.  
 
“In the early 1960s when the basic sound of contemporary music moved from the big lush arrangements of Nelson Riddle to a lighter, tighter, more electronic, more rhythm-driven sound, the process of translating became more difficult.  
 
The “immediacy and gutsiness” of rock music was a poor fit with traditional orchestras, which tended to turn rock “into elevator music.” 
 
But, he said, “the great thing is, akin to what Gershwin did in the 1920s with jazz, we have orchestrators who grew up with rock ’n roll in their DNA.”  
 
And as bands like the Beatles moved from the simpler arrangements of “I Wanna Hold Your Hand” to the more complex sounds of “The Long and Winding Road,” the task of orchestrators got easier.  
 
Lockhart’s favorites in the Pops’ rock selections are “Here Comes the Sun,” arranged by Nashville arranger Rob Mathes, and The Who’s Overture to “Tommy.”  
 
“The complexity of the Beatles’ own arrangements really make these pieces a gold mine for orchestration,” he said. The Who’s overture has a “huge brass chorale in it” which “makes total sense to put that on an orchestra.”  
 
And while the Beatles, Led Zeppelin and The Who might not meet the definition of brand-new rock, Lockhart said he’s always on the lookout for new music to incorporate into the Pops’ programming.  
 
“In every generation there is contemporary popular music that has thought behind it, creative process behind it. We do try hard to find them,” he said. “We have collaborated with indie artists of all sorts. That’s not the sort of program we’d tend to take to Florida, if you know what I mean.”
