<TITLE>Reed: Take a walk on the wild side at Flat Island</TITLE>
<TEXT>
LEESBURG — My memories of Flat Island Nature Preserve are mixed. But mixed more good than bad. If I’d only visited for hiking, the memories would all be good. But I made the mistake of camping at its primitive campsite … with five rambunctious middle-schoolers. 
 
The three-day/two-night Camp Adventure program is for teens having experienced a loss and participating in a hospice bereavement counseling program. The idea is remove teens from daily peer pressure so they can lower their guard and bond with the group. Mike Barnett was the children’s bereavement counselor who weaved grief and loss themes into basic survival activities. 
 
The tough part was the sleeping arrangements. Mike’s son was one of the three boys, and naturally he tented with his dad. I had two teens who didn’t want to sleep at all. 
 
Still, it was an interesting way to view the trail, but my last primitive camping trip there — or anywhere else. 
 
I’ve probably hiked Flat Island more than any other Lake County trail. And I’ve written about it more too, between talking about volunteers or my fateful camping trip. 
 
Flat Island Preserve is a 2,300-plus acre conservation area located in southwest Leesburg, just north of Lake Denham. The Lake County Water Authority (LCWA) has preserved two beautiful wooded islands, Flat Island and Magnolia Island, and the vital wetlands that surround them. 
 
It is a great place to hike for several reasons. The looping trail(s) tops the list. I prefer parking at a spot, hiking and winding up back where I started. Its main trail is the 4-mile Daubenmire Trail. It has an access trail, a 3-mile loop, and two cross trails, and is located on Flat Island. The trail honors botanists Rexford and Jean Daubenmire, who performed the initial botanical surveys and developed plant lists for Flat Island Preserve. 
 
The main loop trail leads through several different plant communities, each with its own set of animal inhabitants. The island is generally flat but has slight changes in elevation and subtle differences in soil type and water table. The result is distinct biological zones visible to the careful observer. 
 
Heavily forested wetlands dominated by cypress trees occur outside of the main loop trail, toward the marsh. A must for me every time I hike is the 440-foot long boardwalk that extends southward from the southern loop of the main trail. The last time I hiked another visitor said he couldn’t find the boardwalk. My guess is he just didn’t walk far enough along the marked trail. The boardwalk crosses the forested wetland and reaches a dock on the canal leading to Lake Denham. I have yet to travel the canal in a boat or the canoes available through the LCWA. Maybe one day. 
 
There are several cross trails to extend or shorten hikes. Make sure you take one of the brochures when you sign the visitor log. Also bring water and water equipment you deem necessary. 
 
The Corley Island Trail is a 1.19-mile trail that runs between the main parking area and the Corley Island Mobile Home Park. The mobile home park was home to my mother-in-law for years and I have many fond memories of traveling its trails even before Flat Island became a nature preserve. My nephew Roy and I got in some hot water one Easter Sunday when we went down to the clubhouse to shoot pool. I laughed about an hour into our games when I realized we hadn’t told anyone where we were. They didn’t think it was funny because they envisioned us lost in the swamp. And called the cops. 
 
As far as the trail, it winds through upland hardwood hammocks dominated by oak, hickory and bays, with an island of hardwoods in the center of the marsh. 
 
Flat Island and Magnolia Island are good examples of natural Florida and are located close to Leesburg. Visitors can become quickly immersed into the natural world, escaping the distractions of civilization. 
 
For those with a historical bend, humans have left evidence of life on Flat Island for thousands of years. The island was homesteaded and farmed, and its timber was harvested and taken out by small gauge steam trains called trams. The residents hunted the abundant wildlife as a source of food. But most signs of human activity are no longer visible.
