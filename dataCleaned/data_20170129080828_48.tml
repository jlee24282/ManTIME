<TITLE>Taxing times</TITLE>

As McAllen Mayor Jim Darling said in his Tuesday State of the City address: We have fostered much good will with our southern neighbors. 
 
That good will is now being put to a test. 
 
Thursday’s surprise announcement by the Trump administration to propose a 20 percent tax on all imports from Mexico to offset the costs of building a Southwest border wall should be a giant economic wakeup call for the Rio Grande Valley. 
 
These plans — which Congress must approve — portend more challenging economic times for our region, which has been enriched by cross-border trade that has come about with trade agreements with Mexico including the North American Free Trade Agreement that was struck in the 1990s. 
 
NAFTA has helped to fuel thousands of 18-wheeler trucks filled with goods from south of the border that travel through our Valley every day. 
 
A new tax would break the NAFTA agreement between the United States, Mexico and Canada, which bans unilateral decisions on new taxes and tariffs between the countries. 
 
That could have significant implications, especially for South Texas. 
 
“NAFTA has been a terrible deal, a total disaster for the United States from its inception, costing us as much as $60 billion per year with Mexico alone in trade deficits. You say ‘who negotiates these deals?’ not to mention millions of jobs and thousands of plants closing down all over our country,” President Donald Trump told Republican leaders Thursday at their winter retreat in Philadelphia. 
 
Trump’s plan was revealed just hours after Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto canceled a meeting with Trump scheduled for next month in Washington, D.C., which was brought on by repeated calls and tweets from Trump ordering that Mexico pay for construction of a border wall, which could cost $15 billion or more. 
 
A rift between our nations in the form of a trade war could have severe consequences on the Rio Grande Valley. 
 
Mexico sends about 80 percent of its exports to the United States, something we all witness daily as trucks full of produce and goods cross the international bridges here. 
 
“I want to go a different route. We have no choice,” Trump declared. 
 
That should strike at all of us. We must realize that as the political rhetoric amps up — and we predict it will continue in the months and weeks to come — then the economic challenges for the Valley will grow and our need to diversify and not be reliant on a relatively few revenue streams should become all too clear. 
 
In short: We cannot be complacent. We must be innovative, creative, frugal and flexible. We must seek out dynamic and untapped methods that will provide sustainable funds if we are to continue to grow our region in what appears will be the new normal. 
 
We must promote science, technology, engineering and math graduates who can compete and contribute with the best scientists at SpaceX’s new space launch facility at Boca Chica Beach; move forward with desalination efforts to lower our region’s dependence on current water sources and expand our agriculture abilities here; tantalize new industries, such as those in the technology fields, with our appealing climate, friendly smiles and unique culture. And we must endeavor to attract Mexican shoppers and convince them to invest in our products. 
 
The city of McAllen has given $1.1 million in taxpayer funds to help renovate the Anzalduas International Bridge on Mexican soil so that truck traffic can flow from the United States to Mexico. 
 
We have the highest per capita sales tax revenues in the state of Texas because we cater to Mexican shoppers here. Unfortunately, those sales have been declining with the dip in the Mexican peso. But we must keep attracting them. 
 
As Darling said: “The good news is that they’re still coming, regardless of Washington’s rhetoric.” 
 
We have a shared history and a proven commitment and established relationships with our Mexican counterparts that those in Washington, D.C., do not have — nor, frankly, appear to care much about. 
 
We must not despair but we must prepare. 
 
We must seek out new relationships and recruit “unique” retailers, as Darling suggests. We must encourage foreign travelers to subscribe to the many shows coming to McAllen’s new $41 million Performing Arts Center (including the “Jersey Boys” next month.) We must support our local universities, which in turn bring in more students to our area and more federal and state dollars for grants and studies. 
 
Our time of change is upon us. Are you ready?
