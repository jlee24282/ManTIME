UCSD No 1 CFO John Williams sitting next to school district attorney Geoffrey Phillips talks about some of the budget unknowns the school district is facing this year HERALD PHOTO Bethany Lange EVANSTON School districts around Wyoming are bracing for impact after the introduction of HB 236 on Wednesday HB 236 also known as the education omnibus bill attempts to deal with education funding shortfalls If the bill is passed Evanston s school district will see an additional 2 13 percent budget cut next year or 872 500 on top of the anticipated budget cuts According to the HB 236 Bill Summary Impact document Evanston enrollment will decrease by 44 students in 2018 compared to 2017 projections The Subcommittee on Education Deficit Reduction Options issued a document Dec 28 2016 detailing the state s education budget crisis and some options to address it That document Wyoming K 12 Education Funding Deficit White Paper is available at http tinyurl com gnjdums Wyoming expects an annual shortfall of 360 400 million at least through 2022 This is both caused and exacerbated by the state s mineral industry crisis Due to the overwhelming dependence on the mineral industry to fund education in Wyoming we now find ourselves in a budget phenomenon known as the double whammy the document states In short the state is required to prioritize public education funding the state needs mineral revenue to operate schools and mineral revenues are declining In 2015 alone 5 400 oil and gas employees were laid off total numbers for 2016 are still pending Wyoming also saw its first population drop since 1990 last year Schools are already dealing with the 2016 penny cut and enrollment drops which means less money and will have to cut even more this year as it is The Subcommittee on Education Deficit Reductions Options provided five options to deal with the education funding deficit saying each option could fix up to 80 million of the problem These options are as follows Adjust the funding formula for school districts and reduce appropriations from the School Foundation Program Account including reducing total funding by 06 percent every year changing the funding formula to cost based levels consolidating school districts purchasing instead of leasing school buses reducing administrative salaries reducing student activity funding cutting the instructional facilitator program and cutting professional development days from 10 to five Find savings to offset shortfalls using the Legislative Stabilization Reserve Account or LSRA to balance the School Foundation Program Account or SFPA Find existing revenue increase taxes or increase mineral royalties to the SFPA Recalibrate spending policies increase the balance of the Common School Permanent Land Fund Reserve Account or send more investment income to the SFPA Enhance revenue increase mill levies for education impose a tax on health and professional services and increase sales tax The omnibus bill reflects many of these suggestions HB 236 proposes to raise the state sales tax from 4 percent to 4 5 percent as soon as the LSRA has less than 500 million and continues the funding cuts begun in 2016 Furthermore personnel will see a sharp impact Superintendents assistant superintendents and business managers would see their salaries cut by 10 percent the instructional facilitator program would be cut in half and the school year would be cut from 185 to 180 days Bus purchases and leases and alternative school building would be frozen Committees would be created to study alternative schools and recalibrate funding to a cost based funding model including for transportation and special education Also the LSRA would maintain the SFPA at 100 million every year unless the LSRA has less than 500 million in the account The Uinta County School District No 1 heard about the omnibus bill at Tuesday s school board meeting Superintendent Ryan Thomas said he is keeping in touch with Rep Garry Piiparinen about it The omnibus bill is only one of many education related bills others propose to increase class sizes while the omnibus bill focuses on cutting school days instead of class sizes which would in turn cut salaries possibly by 1 800 per teacher Assistant superintendent Doug Rigby termed it the ominous bill Rep Piiparinen who is also a schoolteacher told the Herald that he was the only member of the education committee who did not put his name on the bill When the committee was asked to sponsor the bill he had not had a chance to read the 53 page bill yet and did not want to put his name to it It would be hard for me to defend a lot of those things he said Piiparinen said the bill was run through quickly but that it seems to put the responsibility for the state s budget issues on education He added that he would like to see other measures investigated as well such as putting the Capitol Square Project on hold including the Herschler building remodel and expansion and working on the general fund They re just expecting education to solve this he said It s a state problem it s not just an education problem The Legislature is accepting public comments on the bill at http tinyurl com zfo9y6e It will come to a vote on Monday evening
