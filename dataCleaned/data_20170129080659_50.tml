<TITLE>Paul Carlucci writes beautifully about ugliness</TITLE>
<TEXT>
A Plea for Constant Motion the second collection of short stories from Ottawa writer Paul Carlucci opens with My New Best Friend in Exile The story seems initially to be one of connection of a loner Wes a former high school art teacher forced out of his job and trying unsuccessfully to build a life in the city Despite the ghosts of the past hanging over him his neighbour Randy seems to be a steadying influence perhaps even a friend They work together building a new porch for Wes s house and drink together once construction is done lounging like gods after a long epic act of creation Wes reflects on his neighbour I liked Randy s thoughtful nature I liked to imagine him shrunk down to adolescence his brawny arms across the desks of one of my art classes a bad kid in some people s eyes but not in mine As the story twists to a close though it becomes clear that Randy is in fact bad this is a crushing understatement a truth which Wes remains somehow unable to fully see It s a shocking and haunting story and in many ways My New Best Friend in Exile is characteristic of the collection as a whole These are stories of heartbreak and betrayal of limited vision and wilful blindness stories laced with booze drugs sex secrets and unemployment with casual and caustic misogyny racism classism and violence The stories are as a rule devoid of outer commentary or narrative distancing forcing the reader to confront and reconcile the often disturbing mindsets and occurrences which mark the work It doesn t make for easy reading but A Plea for Constant Motion has an air of urgency to it a sense of relevance which is at once odd for a collection of short stories and disturbing in and of itself Carlucci whose first collection The Secret Life of Fission was awarded the Danuta Gleed Award writes beautifully of ugliness immersing the reader in the minds and hearts of characters most of us would like to avoid or more critically would prefer to believe didn t exist It s a perfect collection for a world which confronts us with increasing violence and ugliness every day Delivered daily The Morning Headlines Newsletter The Toronto Star and thestar com each property of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited One Yonge Street 4th Floor Toronto ON M5E 1E6 You can unsubscribe at any time Please contact us or see our privacy policy for more information
