<TITLE>Who answers 111 calls?</TITLE>
<TEXT>
What does it take to be a St John 111 call-taker? Resilience and an ability to deal with stress are important to the frantic role. 
   
A young boy falls to the floor in a bank in Auckland. He is having a seizure. Someone yells to call 111. 
 
In a non-descript building near Christchurch International Airport, St John emergency medical dispatcher Sarah  answers the call. 
 
"What is the address of the emergency?" she says. Her fingers whiz across the keyboard as maps and script windows pop up on three large screens. 
 
"Please repeat the address back to me in full so I know I've entered it correctly." 
 
  
   
   
   
   
 
After a moment, she says, "Tell me exactly what happened." 
 
Back in Auckland, the phone is handed to the boy's mother. She is hysterical. 
 
Sarah asks if he is breathing properly: "I'm going to get you to do a breathing test. I need you to count four breaths. Are you ready? Let's count it." 
 
As Sarah elicits information from the mother, she follows an automated script, creating a detailed prognosis of the situation. 
 
Within minutes, the boy's medical condition and current medication are taken and an ambulance is on route to the bank. 
 
Sarah finishes the call and immediately answers another, kicking off a 12-hour shift at St John's call centre in Christchurch. 
 
"A lot of people never thought I'd be in a job like this," she says.  
 
"I honestly thought I would only be able to do the job for three to six months, but all of a sudden I'm here for a year and a half and I love it." 
 
The 28-year-old former air hostess is one of 33 Christchurch-based St John call-takers on rotating 12-hour shifts. 
 
Together with staff at call centres in Auckland and Wellington, they help dispatch nearly 700 vehicles across New Zealand, including first-response ambulances, events and patient transfer service vehicles. 
 
The job can be infuriating at times, Sarah says, "but it is really rewarding when you know you've helped someone out of a really tough situation". 
 
"For a lot of people it's probably one of the most traumatic times of their lives, and a lot of people have never called 111 before. 
 
"A lot of callers might be yelling down the phone to begin with and think you are the most annoying person ever making them repeat their address and trying to ask questions, but once they finally realise you are only there to help them, they often calm down and end up thanking you." 
 
Across the dozen or so desks in the secure area of the operations centre, calmness prevails. 
 
"I definitely think this job has made me a stronger person in dealing with things day to day, but I wouldn't say I'm any different at work and at home," Sarah says. 
 
"You just kind of keep level. Some people you do have to be firm with, because in the end our job is to get that address and get the job to screen." 
 
St John recruits new call centre staff regularly. 
 
New staff are put through an intensive three-month training course before taking their first call, followed by weeks of mentoring with experienced call-takers. 
 
"We've hired people from all backgrounds," St John talent sourcing advisor Katie Carran said. 
 
"Your ability to cope with stress and resilience is very important." 
 
Carran said staff on the phones were remarkable, channelling their community spirit down the line to those in need. 
 
"They do an amazing job . . . and often they don't even know the effect that they're having on everybody that calls." 
 
  Sarah is not her real name. The subject preferred to remain anonymous.
