<TITLE>HAND Baker Dems draw battle lines over pay raises</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Just days after praising his relationship with Democrats Republican Gov Charlie Baker backed them into a corner and gave their opponents a powerful election issue by vetoing pay raises for legislative leaders Democrats in the Legislature dutifully approved the 18 million pay raises in near record time last week despite budget woes that have resulted in cuts to services such as those for opiate addiction Baker had said in advance he would not take a raise for himself but legislative leaders badly wanted them The governor was largely quiet on whether he would approve raises as they were sailing through the House and Senate but then announced Thursday night he would veto them Of course the veto will be overturned because rank and file Democrats at least most of them would never dare buck their leadership But Baker s action brings more attention to the issue and means the Democrats have to take one more uncomfortable vote on the override The move helps Baker shore up support from the right wing of his party which often complains he is too squishy on issues important to them It also gives any Republican running for state Legislature next year against a Democrat an axe handle to pummel his or her opponent with The Democrats will be left trying to explain why their leaders deserve a 40 percent raise Of course state Rep Paul Heroux D Attleboro who tends to be a bit of a maverick on Beacon Hill was one of the few Democrats who voted against the raises His move could be seen as a vote of conscience or an attempt to booster his re election credentials But there is also the very real possibility that he felt free to tick off his leadership one more time before he runs for mayor and no longer has to worry about what they think Elsewhere in politics Newton Mayor Setti Warren a possible Democratic candidate for governor saw the trouble with the legislative pay raises passed this week First he urged Baker to veto them Then he called on Democrats to sustain the veto U S Rep Joseph Kennedy III D Brookline looks like he is trying to raise his profile across the state He made four appearances last week rallying support to save Obamacare Three of them were outside his congressional district Most of the opposition to Gov Charlie Baker s proposal to tax businesses that do not provide enough health care to their employees came for groups that are usually solidly in his corner such as Associated Industries of Massachusetts and National Federation of Independent Businesses Of course it was equally unusual for the pro business governor to ask his allies to pony up more to fund MassHealth the state s subsidized health care program JIM HAND covers politics for His commentaries appear in this space on Sundays He can be reached at 508 236 0399 at jhand thesunchronicle com and on Twitter TSCPolitics
