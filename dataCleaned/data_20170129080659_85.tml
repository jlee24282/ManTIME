HealthCare Royalty Partners Announces New Chief Medical Officer, Senior-Level Promotions, and Further Regional Expansion Business Wire India 
 
HealthCare Royalty Partners ("HCR") announced several firm developments: 
 
New Chief Medical Officer: 
 
As of January 2017, Dr. Warren Cooper has assumed the role of Managing Director and Chief Medical Officer at HCR. Dr. Cooper initially joined the team in 2016, consulting as an Industry Advisor. Dr. Cooper is a UK-trained physician with over 35 years of experience in the global pharmaceutical industry. HCR's senior professionals have known Dr. Cooper for over a decade, working closely with him when he served as CEO of Prism Pharmaceuticals ("Prism"), a portfolio company at their prior firm. Prism was a specialty pharmaceutical company that developed the antiarrhythmic agent NEXTERONE, and was ultimately acquired by Baxter International in 2011 for $338 million. Prior to serving as CEO of Prism, Dr. Cooper spent 12 years with Merck, initially as a UK clinical research physician, then as head of European and subsequently Worldwide Clinical Research Operations. Dr. Cooper also previously led AstraMerck's (now AstraZeneca PLC) cardiovascular division. HCR looks forward to drawing on Dr. Cooper's tremendous clinical, regulatory and operational experience as it evaluates new investment opportunities. 
 
Investment Professional Promotions: 
 
HCR has promoted John Urquhart to a Principal of the firm. Mr. Urquhart was among the first employees at HCR, joining the firm as an analyst in 2007 and re-joining in 2012 after receiving his M.B.A. from The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. Mr. Urquhart has over a decade of healthcare investing experience in the royalty and structured finance market. 
 
HCR has also promoted Anthony Rapsomanikis to Vice President. Mr. Rapsomanikis joined HCR as an Associate in 2012, and was promoted to Director of West Coast Business Development after establishing the firm's San Francisco office in 2015. The San Francisco office launched HCR's strategic initiative to regionalize its business development efforts and better serve the needs of counterparties in key geographic areas. 
 
"John and Tony's promotions are well deserved and serve as recognition of their growth and contributions to the firm over the past several years," commented Clarke Futch, co-founder and Chairman of the Investment Committee at HCR. 
 
Regional Office Expansion: 
 
HCR is pleased to announce its plans to open a Boston, MA office in the first half of 2017, which will be led by John Urquhart. Mr. Urquhart will work closely with Clarke Futch, Paul Hadden (Managing Director - Business Development) and the rest of the senior investment team, most of whom will continue to be based in the firm's headquarters in Stamford, CT. 
 
Paul Hadden commented, "The opening of our Boston office follows the success of HCR's San Francisco office opening in 2015 and furthers our goal of strengthening local coverage and relationships in the key life science and R amp;D centers. Recent data shows that Boston and the San Francisco / Bay Area each garnered about one-third of all biotech venture capital investment in 2016 and it is important for us to continue to focus on these markets."
