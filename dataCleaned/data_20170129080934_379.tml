Family: Wife, singer Lauren Hart; known for singing at Flyers games; children, Yemi, 14, Yordi, 11, Selah, 8, Bek, 5, all adopted from Ethiopia. 

Why Ethiopia: "The origin of the two most important things in my life, where people come from and where coffee comes from. It's also an inexplicable dent in the space/time continuum that just sucks me into it." 

Caffeinated: 3 double espressos before he leaves home, 5 half-cups of coffee throughout the day, a Boylan's Root Beer at 2 p.m., green tea before bed. 

Maybe later: Thinking about a new version of his reality TV show, "Dangerous Grounds."
