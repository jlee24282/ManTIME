<TITLE>Close to Home: Rallying around a statement of defiance</TITLE>
<TEXT>
| Sonoma County is speaking out — shouting might be a better word — in resistance to the Trump administration’s agenda of fear and hate. The local Women’s March on Jan. 21 was the most visible outcry, but there is much more evolving locally.

We will not be dragged back to our racist, homophobic, patriarchal past. We must continue to move forward, and we expect our elected representatives to join us.

If the rhetoric coming from Washington is to be believed, the people of this county will find themselves facing unjust laws that violate civil rights. And just as the colonists did, we must say, "No!"

Recently, 70 people from all walks of life came together to craft a statement that would go to all of our county’s elected representatives, letting them know that we expect them to protect all the people of Sonoma County.

I grew up hearing people of all political persuasions say, "Never again" and "How did the German people let this happen?" In remembrance of 1930s Germany and what happened under the watch of the German people and their local governments, the statement is called "It won’t happen here."

To date, 114 civic organizations, faith communities and businesses have endorsed the "It won’t happen here" statement. An online petition now includes the signatures of 1,300 people, and we haven’t begun to count the paper petitions.

These are not normal times. We are certain that people, including our representatives, will make extraordinary efforts to be on the right side of history.

The immigrant community and others targeted by Donald Trump are bringing "Welcoming Cities" initiatives to Santa Rosa and the county. We have sent our declaration to Mayor Chris Coursey in support of the city’s work. There are ongoing discussions with city councils around the county. The Santa Rosa School Board wrote its safe haven declaration after hearing from us and others.

The Sonoma County Commission on Human Rights wrote its "Resolution in Support of the Protection of the Human and Constitutional Rights of All Members of the Sonoma County Community" after reading our statement and a resolution passed by the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. The commission members will now take it to the Sonoma County Board of Supervisors. We support rewritings which maintain the spirit of our statement.

Earlier this month, the Community Advisory Council of the Independent Office of Law Enforcement Review and Outreach overwhelmingly endorsed the "It won’t happen here" declaration and will send it to the Sheriff’s Office.

We are beginning to see how rapidly the Trump administration plans to undo the human rights gains of the past 50 years. That is unacceptable.

Gov. Jerry Brown has been defiant in defense of the people in California. Resistance from the state must be bolstered by local support and the strength of all of it depends upon the strength of the people. We can and should resist. We can and should say, "It won’t happen here."

Here is what the "It won’t happen here" statement says:

Whereas, to safeguard the equal and inalienable rights and inherent dignity of all people that are the foundation of the relationship between a government and the people;

And, whereas, we recognize that the rights and dignity of all people are under threat;

We, the undersigned organizations, call upon all Sonoma County governing authorities and law enforcement agencies to pledge in writing to protect all of the county’s community members; Furthermore, we call upon these authorities and agencies to proclaim publicly that they will refuse to cooperate with any demands from the federal government to institute detentions, deportations, registries, conversion therapies, imprisonment or any other acts that target or discriminate based on immigration status, race, ethnicity, religion, country of origin, ability, political affiliation, economic status, age, gender-identity or sexual orientation;

Furthermore, we, the undersigned organizations, in obedience to our consciences, pledge to protect all community members and will support our local governments as they move to resist these undemocratic and un-American practices in order to reaffirm their commitment to inclusivity, respect and dignity.

Susan Lamont, former president of the Peace and Justice Center of Sonoma County and longtime peace activist, is a resident of Santa Rosa.
