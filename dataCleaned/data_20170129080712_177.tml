<TITLE>Even rodents with good PR not to be trusted</TITLE>
<TEXT>
By The rampant discourse over the world s economic future must wait There are more important forecasts to consider as fractious factions face off on Feb 2 Groundhog Day over who has the superior groundhog OK I know I write about this every year but I think it adds some lightheartedness to the somberness of investment analysis Peacefully sleeping members of Marmota monax are yanked out of their comfortable dens to view their shadows the purpose being to predict the weather six weeks into the future Staten Island Chuck is up against the powerful PR machine of Punxsutawney Phil and his 130th annual forecast Unfortunately Staten Island Chuck has never had the smoothest of relationships with New York mayors In 2009 he took a chunk out of the finger of then New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg Two years ago New York Mayor Bill de Blasio dropped Chuck after the animal predicted six more miserable weeks of winter and Chuck died several days later of internal injuries But wait it appears that Chuck was not in fact Chuck at all but a female stand in named Charlotte brought in to prevent another finger chewing incident So Chuck lives on and will hopefully take a more tasteful approach to government officials A mayor in Wisconsin learned a valuable lesson about his city s weather predictor It seems that Jimmy the official groundhog in Sun Prairie was being held too close to the mayor s face when it promptly bit his honor s ear Maybe groundhogs are trying to tell us something and not about the weather but rather sleep related Meanwhile General Beauregard Lee of Georgia who holds honorary doctorates from the University of Georgia and Georgia State in Weather Prognostication must compete with Sir Walter Wally of North Carolina By way of full disclosure the University of Georgia tersely informed me a couple of years ago that academic recognition of such magnitude would not have been bestowed on a groundhog I did not mean to imply that Beauregard had really been awarded such a degree After all he never actually put it on his curriculum vitae Desirous of taking advantage of the groundswell of groundhog controversy but with no groundhog of its own to roust Florida at one time decided to borrow one devising an ad campaign indicating that Punxsutawney Phil had exited stage right in search of warmer digs The recent weather up north would have sent any enterprising groundhog southbound Yet Phil s handlers were not amused muttering something about trademark violation and the promotion died an early death unlike 130 year old Punxsutawney Phil Given the level of expertise most groundhogs have with the English language not to mention meteorology there is probably some doubt as to the scientific strength of this forecasting approach Unfortunately many of Wall Street s prognosticators are in the same league as your local groundhog Their idea is that the Super Bowl can foretell the stock market s future If the team from the NFC the old NFL wins it will be an up year for the market If a team from the AFC the old AFL is victorious it foretells a bear market The Super Bowl Indicator has about an 80 percent accuracy rate Therefore if you are invested in stocks and want to see a bull market this year you should root for the Atlanta Falcons If you are short the market and want to see it fall root for the New England Patriots Meanwhile there is a modicum of statistical data that correlates market aberrations with certain calendar events For example the so called January effect where January stock prices supposedly forecast the market s performance for the remaining months of the year Ouch Before you start placing trade orders consider that 20 years ago David Leinweber a visiting economist at Caltech determined that butter production in Bangladesh had a statistically significant correlation an r squared of 99 percent for you math buffs with the S P 500 index And he still receives requests for current butter production numbers as do I Lauren Rudd is president of Rudd International an asset management firm Neither Lauren Rudd nor his employees hold any shares discussed or have plans to buy them within 30 days nor is there any intended inducement to buy or sell any security You can write to Lauren Rudd at LVERudd aol com or call him at 941 706 3449 For back columns go to www ruddreport com Lauren Rudd offers commentary Thursdays on SNN News 6 during the 5 30 p m live newscast
