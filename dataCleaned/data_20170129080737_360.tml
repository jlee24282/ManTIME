<TEXT>
Missouri Court of Appeals Southern District Petitioner Respondent v WENDY JOY HILGENBERG Respondent Appellant No SD34362 Decided January 17 2017 Appellant s Attorney Gregory R Bridges of Neosho Missouri Respondent Pro Se Joseph H Hilgenberg of Neosho Missouri Wendy Joy Hilgenberg Wife appeals the trial court s Judgment of Dissolution of Marriage dated January 12 2015 dissolving her marriage to Joseph Harold Hilgenberg Husband In two points on appeal Wife alleges trial court error in awarding physical custody of the minor children to Husband and the division of marital property Finding no preserved issues before us we dismiss Wife s appeal Factual and Procedural History Husband and Wife were married on November 23 2000 Two children were born of the marriage SHH and PJH who were ages 10 and 13 respectively at the time of trial The parties separated on August 12 2013 On the same day Husband filed a petition for dissolution of marriage asserting it was in the best interest of the minor children that joint legal and physical custody be awarded to Husband and Wife with Husband being designated as the residential custodian for address and educational purposes Husband also requested a division of the marital property which included the marital home and five acres Trial was held on December 4 2014 and December 19 2014 On January 12 2015 the trial court entered its Judgment of Dissolution of Marriage The trial court awarded to Husband marital property that included the marital home and five acres The trial court ordered the minor children to be placed in the joint legal custody of Husband and Wife and in the physical custody of Husband The trial court also adopted Husband s proposed parenting plan On January 26 2015 Wife filed a Motion to Set Aside Decision Amend Reconsider or Alternatively for New Trial post trial motion Wife asserted in part that the trial court failed to make specific findings as to the custody of the minor children in accordance with sections 452 375 2 452 375 4 and 452 375 6 1 and erred in adopting Husband s parenting plan Wife also asserted the trial court failed to make a fair and equitable distribution of the marital property On March 2 2015 a hearing was held on Wife s post trial motion After hearing argument the trial court requested Wife s counsel prepare a proposed judgment for the trial court s review with a copy to Husband s attorney On April 23 2015 Wife filed a Motion for Extension of Time to Set Aside Decision Amend Reconsider or Alternatively for New Trial and a proposed order to grant the trial court additional time in which to rule on Wife s post trial motion On May 18 2015 the trial court signed an Order granting an extension until May 26 2015 in which to allow the trial court sufficient time to rule on Wife s post trial motion On May 20 2015 the trial court filed an Amended Judgment of Dissolution of Marriage Thereafter Husband filed a Motion to Set Aside Order Extending Time and Amended Judgment of Dissolution of Marriage asserting 1 that the trial court no longer had jurisdiction over the January 26 2015 judgment due to its failure to rule on Wife s post trial motion within 90 days and the trial court lacked jurisdiction to enter the May 20 2015 amended judgment On February 23 2016 2 after a hearing the trial court entered its Order and Judgment Setting Aside Order for Exten s ion of Time and Amended Judgment of Dissolution of Marriage for lack of jurisdiction and ordered the parties to comply with the terms of the January 12 2015 Judgment of Dissolution of Marriage Wife filed her Notice of Appeal on March 2 2016 In two points on appeal Wife asserts the trial court erred in failing to make specific findings required by section 452 375 6 when awarding the parties joint legal custody and awarding sole physical custody to Husband and in making an inequitable distribution of the marital property specifically in awarding the martial home and five acres to Husband Before we address the merits of Wife s contentions we are required to sua sponte examine the timeliness of her notice of appeal Douglas v Office of the State Courts Administrator 470 S W 3d 29 30 Mo App W D 2015 Rule 81 04 a 3 requires that an appellant s notice of appeal be filed with the clerk of the trial court no later than 10 days after the judgment appealed becomes final A notice of appeal is deemed filed on the date the trial court clerk receives the notice of appeal with a docket fee Rule 81 04 f Failure to timely file a notice of appeal renders the appeal ineffective Douglas 470 S W 3d at 30 The trial court entered its Judgment of Dissolution of Marriage on January 12 2015 On January 26 2015 Wife filed her motion to set aside the judgment or for new trial The post trial motion raised alleged factual and legal errors in the judgment and therefore qualified as a motion for a new trial and an authorized after trial motion for purposes of Rule 81 05 a Coffer v Wasson Hunt 281 S W 3d 308 311 Mo banc 2009 Because the motion was filed within 30 days of the trial court s judgment under Rule 81 05 a 2 A the filing of this post trial motion extended the trial court s jurisdiction over the judgment to 90 days from January 26 2015 The trial court made no ruling on the motion within 90 days and the motion was overruled by operation of Rule 81 05 a 2 A on April 26 2015 rendering final the January 12 2015 judgment Wife filed her notice of appeal on March 2 2016 more than ten days after April 26 2015 The filing was therefore untimely and ineffective as to the January 12 2015 judgment Rule 81 04 a The trial court lacked jurisdiction to enter the May 20 2015 amended judgment as its jurisdiction was terminated on April 26 2015 However under In re Estate of Shaw 256 S W 3d 72 Mo banc 2008 the fact that a court enters a judgment without jurisdiction does not preclude an appeal or deprive the appellate court of jurisdiction to consider the effect of the judgment and to confine a trial court to its jurisdiction Id at 77 Thus for the purposes described in Shaw an appeal could have been taken from the May 20 2015 amended judgment even though the trial court entered the amended judgment without jurisdiction However Wife s notice of appeal as to the May 20 2015 amended judgment is also untimely Husband filed a motion to set aside the amended judgment on May 26 2015 There are no other filings in the record that constitute authorized post trial motions to the May 20 2015 amended judgment under Rule 81 05 a The motion was not ruled upon by August 24 2015 90 days after the motion was filed and the motion was therefore overruled pursuant to the operation of Rule 81 05 a 2 A Also pursuant to Rule 81 05 a 2 A the amended judgment though entered without jurisdiction would have been final on August 24 2015 Wife s notice of appeal filed March 21 2016 was untimely and ineffective as to the amended judgment even for Shaw purposes inasmuch as it was filed more than ten days after the amended judgment became final Rule 81 04 a The trial court entered an additional judgment on March 21 2016 setting aside its previous order for extension of time and the May 20 2015 amended judgment after Wife filed her notice of appeal For the same reasons as the May 20 2015 amended judgment the March 21 2016 judgment was also entered without jurisdiction Wife s notice of appeal makes reference to the trial court s ruling of February 23 2016 which was formalized in the judgment of March 21 2016 Wife s notice of appeal as to the March 21 2016 judgment was therefore premature under Rule 81 05 b which provides that premature notice shall be considered as filed immediately after the time the judgment becomes final for the purpose of appeal For Shaw purposes Wife s notice of appeal was effective as to the March 21 2016 judgment The March 21 2016 judgment is the only judgment subject to review in this appeal However Wife s points on appeal do not raise any issue regarding the March 21 2016 judgment so there is no claim of error preserved for this Court s review For that reason Wife s appeal is dismissed FOOTNOTES 1 All references to statutes
