<TITLE>Wanted Extremely generous sugar daddy airline </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 So what are we going to do about our number one problem Which is Our national bloody airline Well minister if you want my opinion Which is what I just requested Quite If you want to know what I think I reckon we should just cut it adrift And what s that supposed to mean Let it sink or swim of its own volition No we can t do that Why not If it s a liability today it ll be a double liability tomorrow Yes but this is not a business decision this has to be a political decision It comes to the same thing in the end If it s a bad investment now it s not going to become a better one just by hanging around for a while I suppose not But there s no way we could just simply abandon the national airline it would be electoral suicide Hmm personally I think you ve actually already committed electoral suicide without any help from the national airline What do you mean Do the words Mizzi Schembri Musc I mean Egrant and Panama ring a bell They do but I think by the time the election comes around the people will have forgotten about all that stuff I doubt it but anyhow you want to know what to do about your bankrupt national airline right So what do you suggest What you need is a sugar daddy airline A what And airline rich enough to absorb all your losses and then some and to finance it for an indefinite period We thought we had one in Alitalia No chance they were and are as skint as you are So we have since discovered No what you need is an Etihad or Emirates oil rich carrier that would pick up the tab for your lot for ever and a day And what makes you think one or either of those two would want to saddle itself with our defunct liability Absolutely Nobody in their right mind would want to get lumbered with that You tell them you are giving them an unprecedented opportunity to invest in a cast iron racing certainty So So what What must we do to set about convincing them to invest in a dead or at least moribund duck You do what you politicians do best Ahem which is You lie through your teeth about it Er go on You tell them you are giving them an unprecedented opportunity to invest in a cast iron racing certainty sure thing And you think a canny Arab airline would fall for that Depends how you sell it What do you mean You have to offer them something in return Well it wouldn t be money they ve got that coming out of their ears Exactly so you have to offer them something they really really want Like what Like well like lobbying for them to stage the football World Cup or even the Olympic Games And you reckon that would do it it would save our national airline Definitely But do you really think we little Malta could bring the Olympics to the Gulf states No but what s important is that they should think you can Hmm I don t know Look minister do you want to save your national airline Of course I do you know that But your idea seems pie in the sky Pie in the sky now maybe But let s face it if you don t try something radical and different you ll pretty soon have bugger all in the sky So we tell the sheikhs that we can help to get them the Olympic Games No you behave like proper politicians and absolutely promise them that you can get them the Olympics Just like that Just like that About the only thing you don t promise them is that you can get them the Winter Olympics That may be just a tad out of their reach Right well I ll give it a go Excellent oh just one more thing What s that
