<TITLE>Second-half rally falls short for UTRGV men's basketball vs. Seattle</TITLE>
<TEXT>
SEATTLE — After digging themselves out of a double-digit hole, the UTRGV Vaqueros watched their hopes of a road victory evaporate in a 90-second span midway through the second half and absorbed a 96-84 loss to Seattle on Saturday night. 
 
The Vaqueros, who trailed by as many as 17 in the first half when Seattle hit 13 3-pointers, tightened their perimeter defense and tied it 69-69 with 9:24 remaining, but couldn’t sustain the momentum as Seattle pulled away down the stretch. 
 
“I think we dug ourselves such a hole, when we came back, we just didn’t have the juice to finish it,” UTRGV coach Lew Hill said. 
 
UTRGV (10-14, 2-5) trailed 53-40 at the half, but finally cut the deficit to single digits with a 10-point run, pulling within 63-58 on a three-point play by Antonio Green with 13:25 remaining. 
 
The Vaqueros finally tied it with a 9-2 spurt, getting a four-point play and a five-point play. 
 
Green was fouled on a made 3-pointer from the left corner and added the free throw to cut the lead to 67-64. After a jumper from the left side by Seattle’s Zack Moore, Gage Loy answered with a 3-pointer from the right corner. Moe McDonald was fouled away from the ball and hit both free throws to make it 69-69. 
 
The momentum quickly slipped away as Moore — who had 21 first-half points — hit a 3- pointer and converted a three-point play to fuel an 8-0 run that put the Redhawks on top 77-69. 
 
Seattle (10-11, 2-5) maintained the cushion, pushing the lead to 88-75 on two free throws by Morgan Means with 3:16 left. 
 
“We scored enough, but we didn’t defend,” Hill said. “We didn’t defend in the first half. We’ve been doing a good job full court, but in half court, yes, we’ve been struggling defending the half court. We either steal the ball or they score. We’ve got to do a better job of defending the half court.” 
 
Nick Dixon, coming off a 41-point effort in a 92-81 loss to Utah Valley on Thursday, led the Vaqueros with 26 points, including 12 of 12 from the free-throw line. Green added 22 points. 
 
“It wasn’t fatigue. You’ve got to give Seattle credit,” Dixon said. “They executed at the end. It was just a battle of wills, and they came out tonight. 
 
Moore led the Redhawks with a career-high 33 points, well above his previous best of 17. Brendan Westendorf added 29 points and William Powell had 22. 
 
“We guarded him in the second half,” Hill said of Moore. “Then you don’t get wide-open 3s. That’s what he does. He shoots.” 
 
The Redhawks torched the Vaqueros from beyond the arc in the first half, hitting 13-of-20 3s en route to a 53-40 lead at the break. 
 
“We didn’t follow the game plan,” Green said. “We didn’t stay attached to the shooters like we were told to. We knew exactly what they were capable of and what we were supposed to do. We just didn’t do it the first half. We did it in the second half.” 
 
Moore, shooting 34 percent from long range this season, had 21 first-half points, connecting on 7 of 8 3-point attempts — two more than his previous career high of five made. 
 
Westendorf, a senior guard, made 5 of 7 3-point attempts, adding 17 first-half points. 
 
“We were completely aware how Seattle plays. They like to shoot a lot of 3s,” Dixon said. “It was just a lack of focus. We just over-helped them. We over-exaggerated with the penetration, and they were just baiting us the whole time, penetrate and then kick it. It just took us too long to figure it out.” 
 
The Vaqueros also were dialed in early from outside, with four early baskets from beyond the arc, pulling within 18-16 on Green’s 3 with 13:11 left in the half. 
 
Xavier McDaniel Jr. was fouled on a 3-point attempt and hit all three free throws to pull UTRGV within 31-26. The Redhawks responded with a 16-5 run, including four 3-pointers, pushing the lead 47-31 on two free throws by Powell with 3:03 remaining in the half. 
 
“We just didn’t stick to the game plan,” Green said. “We stuck to it probably 18 minutes in the second half. We just didn’t do it when it mattered most at the end of the game, and that’s why they separated.” 
 
With the loss, the Vaqueros fell to 1-11 on the road. They’re 7-3 at home and 2-0 at neutral sites. 
 
“Homecourt advantage, I always try to underplay it,” Dixon said. “But, after being on the road, experiencing it in college, and the travel, it does take effect on you.”
