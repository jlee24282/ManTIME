Tomas Beauford who died April 16 2014 while in the custody of the Mesa County jail His family is suing the county for not properly caring for Beauford s epilepsy which killed him while an inmate at the jail Photo special to the Sentinel Tomas Beauford and his mother Tiffany Marsh Photo special to the Sentinel One of the men s pods in the Mesa County Jail By Gabrielle Porter Saturday January 28 2017 A bracelet might have kept Tomas Anderson Beauford alive Despite mental and behavioral illnesses that meant the 24 year old functioned more like a 6 year old Beauford had mastered the use of the magnetic bracelet that combatted his epilepsy But on April 16 2014 Beauford didn t have his bracelet It had been confiscated by deputies at the Mesa County Jail Taking his prescribed medications also might have kept Beauford alive But in jail without family and caretakers who often cajoled him with promises of Starbursts and Sprite Beauford hadn t taken his meds regularly in six weeks when he died In the hours before his death Beauford s jailers saw him suffering what they would later realize were several violent seizures in his cell Attorneys representing Beauford s mother wrote that if deputies had reacted correctly he might never have died Alone in his cell Mr Beauford ultimately had a series of seizures fell off his bed and died with his head jammed underneath his desk the attorneys wrote in a civil lawsuit naming Mesa County and the jail health care providers as defendants last spring Mr Beauford s demise could have undoubtedly been prevented had defendants provided him with prompt and appropriate medical attention and treatment An autopsy determined Beauford s death was natural and caused by a seizure Jail workers who dealt with him were cleared of wrongdoing after an internal investigation that s referenced in the civil suit but which the county refused to release saying it was subject to the governmental deliberative process privilege according to Assistant County Attorney John Rhoads Mesa County sheriff s spokeswoman Megan Terlecky wouldn t answer questions about whether any jail policies have changed in the years since Beauford s death citing the ongoing lawsuit Correct Care Solutions the Tennessee based company that employed the jail s nursing staff still holds the contract to provide health care in the jail Mesa County commissioners are expected to vote on that contract soon Beauford s mother Tiffany Marsh of Aurora said her son s death is evidence that jail guards and nursing staff aren t properly trained on handling mental illness Do they not understand what disability means Do they not understand Marsh said He s just a mentally ill kid who needed help not to die in jail STRUGGLED AS YOUTH Beauford s challenges in life started early Marsh then a teenage mother said she was in denial about the issues her family and friends saw in her newborn son Beauford was diagnosed early on with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder at school But a doctor later said when teachers thought his attention was drifting Tomas had probably been suffering from multiple small scale seizures Beauford s emotional and behavioral issues worsened during the next several years Hallucinations began at age 8 after he was injured by a falling windowpane He was 12 when he had his first grand mal seizure He was later diagnosed with epilepsy a condition that never subsided Despite Beauford s health problems Marsh said he was fun loving and kind Generous to a fault he held a job as a groundskeeper at the Aurora Mental Health Center but often gave his pay away When he was little he liked to invent board games that he made his family play That boy wasn t just loved Marsh said He was adored and he was cherished Marsh s goal was always to keep Beauford at home But the single mother of four had an increasingly hard time keeping track of him At 17 he went missing for 10 days Marsh found him at an adult care facility he was taken there when he couldn t remember who he was That s when his memory started going Marsh said Beauford eventually was placed in a psychiatric hospital at Fort Logan where he was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder Later he was sent to another facility in Pueblo where doctors realized how badly he had deteriorated since his epilepsy diagnosis They finally did the IQ test and realized he had lost 20 points on the IQ test Marsh said It s like watching a person with Alzheimer s except he was younger Beauford s condition briefly improved after doctors changed his medications but he eventually started to decline again and his seizures became more violent When he was about 19 Marsh initially resistant to brain surgery eventually agreed that he should receive an implant to help assuage his seizures The implant a vagal nerve stimulator cycled on and off throughout the day He was fitted with a magnetic bracelet and taught to hold the magnet near his body when he felt a seizure coming The device wouldn t necessarily stop seizures but it would prevent them from snowballing into dangerous back to back episodes Marsh said Beauford a young adult whose mental state was still in decline spent a year living at Wheat Ridge Regional Center west of Denver in 2012 It was convenient for Marsh but eventually Beauford started to wander again Once caretakers called to tell Marsh her son had wandered away and was found having a seizure on the railroad tracks Staffers didn t think it was safe for him to stay in Wheat Ridge and suggested he transfer to the Grand Junction Regional Center which was able to lock down residents for security Marsh who looked forward to a date with her son every Thursday shopping movies and other outings with just the two of them reluctantly agreed I didn t want him to go to Grand Junction because it s so far from me she said But I didn t want him to die either ARRESTED FOR VIOLENT BEHAVIOR Beauford s time on the Western Slope far from his family didn t go smoothly He was arrested Nov 30 after staff at the Grand Junction Regional Center reported that he was breaking facility windows by throwing chairs against them an affidavit said Beauford s magnetic bracelet was confiscated when he was booked at the Mesa County Jail despite a document from the Regional Center describing the implant the civil suit said Beauford suffered more than one seizure during a weekend in the jail holding cell The lawsuit suggested jail staff unsuccessfully tried to get Beauford to take his medication but never moved him from the cell Beauford was released on bond Dec 2 and Regional Center staff later told prosecutors not to press charges Beauford was arrested again March 1 During this altercation Beauford threw punches kicks and a steel chair at other people an affidavit for his arrest said The report said Beauford had grabbed the buttocks of people trying to restrain him One victim received no physical injuries but wanted to report the unwanted sexual contact by Tomas who has a history of sexual assaults the report said Beauford was arrested on assault charges as well as a misdemeanor count of unlawful sexual contact This time Beauford wasn t released after a weekend He was ordered held on a 10 000 cash or surety bond and stayed in jail MENTAL STATE DETERIORATED Beauford s condition was poor from the day he was arrested Jail records cited in the civil suit described him having multiple seizures during the booking process Despite the jail s past experience with Beauford and a document from the Grand Junction Regional Center describing in detail his medical needs a deputy wrote on an intake form that Beauford had no special medical or mental health needs His magnetic bracelet was confiscated again and Beauford again stopped taking his meds Grand Junction defense attorney JR Davis who took over Beauford s case two weeks after his arrest said the 24 year old was incoherent the first time they met in court March 17 Davis also visited Beauford in jail March 27 for 45 minutes I tried to ask him questions about his case Davis said I tried to ask him questions about himself and he just maintained his downward gaze He had spit coming out of his mouth Davis who filed a motion for a court ordered mental competency evaluation the next day said he doesn t believe anyone could have mistaken Beauford for a fully functioning adult Marsh didn t visit her son at the jail until April 4 She noticed then that he wasn t wearing his magnetic bracelet Beauford told her it had been taken A staffer from the Regional Center had told Marsh earlier that two magnetic bracelets had been brought to the jail one for Beauford and one usually worn by his caretaker Marsh said a jail nurse she spoke to by phone after the visit assured her Beauford would get it back According to the civil filing though he never did DEATH PRECEDED BY MULTIPLE SEIZURES Beauford s medical condition rapidly deteriorated in the hours before his death April 16 2014 the suit said The filing described multiple instances when jail staff and nurses noted seeing Beauford having a seizure and didn t provide medication or transport him One deputy is described seeing Beauford having a seizure on his bed and neither opening his cell door nor contacting him through the intercom Rather than providing him with the medical attention and treatment he so desperately needed Mr Beauford was actively ignored the complaint said A deputy spotted Beauford lying on the ground in his cell with his head inside the bottom shelf of his desk at about 11 55 p m April 15 The deputy elected not to enter Mr Beauford s cell to check on him knock on Mr Beauford s door or to utilize the intercom to check on him even though he knew that Mr Beauford had suffered multiple seizures earlier in the night the filing said Twenty minutes later the same deputy returned to Beauford s cell to check on him When Beauford didn t move or respond to knocking or calls through the intercom the guard asked for a nurse using a code that the filing describes as meaning the situation to which they are being called is not urgent the civil suit said The nurse immediately recognized that Beauford wasn t breathing and a deputy began CPR The nurse attempted to use an automated external defibrillator on him but Beauford was already dead A case report filed by the Mesa County Sheriff s Office which includes accounts from the nurse that night Renee Workman and two night shift deputies on duty when Beauford died Peter Dalrymple and Richard Perkinson confirms much of the detail from the civil suit It s notable that the magnetic bracelet key to the plaintiff s lawsuit isn t mentioned once in the Sheriff s Office case report Deputy Perkinson s account in the report is particularly significant He recounts how at one point while checking Beauford in his cell he dismisses shaking and grunting under a blanket by Beauford as masturbation An investigator later in the report reminds Deputy Perkinson confirmed he was aware of Mr Beauford s seizures as he was present when Beauford was first booked and experiencing seizures during the process SEEKING REFORMS Marsh said she has been trying to put her life back together since her son s death She planned to speak Jan 21 about her son at the Women s March on Washington In April 2016 Marsh filed a lawsuit naming as defendants Mesa County former Mesa County Sheriff Stan Hilkey Correct Care Solutions and a number of deputies and nurses who had contact with Beauford The suit alleges that county and medical staff violated his 14th Amendment rights by failing to provide medical care and treatments and by depriving Beauford of his life without due process It also claims they violated the federal Americans with Disabilities Act by discriminating against Beauford based on his disabilities The suit which is seeking unspecified damages is ongoing and parties are next due in federal court in Grand Junction Feb 9 Marsh said she doesn t understand why after being told about the importance of his magnetic bracelet jail staff didn t return it to Beauford That was a matter of life and death and it proved to be so she said Marsh said Mesa County needs to reform the way it treats mentally ill people who are crossways with the law She said the jail nurses shouldn t have taken no for an answer with giving her son medication She said arrestees with severe disabilities should be brought before a judge more quickly for a mental status hearing You can t keep people like that in jail she said A lot of these people are too fragile to be incarcerated
