<TITLE>Youth fountaining through NHL All Star Game</TITLE>
<TEXT>
LOS ANGELES Changing the NHL All Star game to a 3 on 3 format was about injecting more excitement into a contest that had grown stale But it is also about the possibilities Imagining what can be done when three superstars have all sorts of extra open ice as their playground Even the three greatest to have ever laced up skates mused about it As he looked over at Bobby Orr and Mario Lemieux Wayne Gretzky said The three of us would have been pretty good in three on three Time moves on of course and new generations of stars emerge As this year s midseason showcase commences on Sunday at Staples Center the current All Stars seemed to focus on what is possible each time Connor McDavid goes over the boards A line to play some shifts with him may already be forming I d like to sit behind the net and have Connor get all his speed and just pick the puck up said the Ducks Cam Fowler who got his first nod And I ll just watch him do his thing I think that ll be fun McDavid the 20 year old supernova of the Edmonton Oilers is a reflection of the super skilled youth becoming the brightest lights for the NHL to shine It is his first All Star game as is for two leading contenders for the Calder Trophy as this season s top rookie Toronto s Auston Matthews and Winnipeg s Patrik Laine Matthews 19 exemplifies the growth of the league into its non traditional markets Born in San Ramon California and raised primarily in Scottsdale Arizona the Maple Leafs star is delivering on his selection as the No 1 overall pick of the 2016 draft Already Matthews has the modern day NHL record for goals in his debut when he scored four times His 23 goals put him among the league leaders and he s counting on getting his share of scoring chances It d be embarrassing if I didn t he said on Saturday sitting at a table in a hotel ballroom I m sure it ll be really tiring Matthews continued I think it s kind of fun Three on three in overtime it s always exciting Always kind of nerve wracking It gets you on the edge of your seat A lot of space out there Especially with all the skill in this room I m sure it ll be a good show A simple fact remains as the game s format has changed throughout the years Defense is optional Jeff Carter joked that his Kings teammate Drew Doughty won t be playing much of it and that San Jose star Brent Burns is basically a forward out there When it came to his wish of players to take shifts with Carter had no particulars I mean everybody right said Carter who leads the Kings with 24 goals It s an All Star game Obviously I m sure everybody wants to get a couple shifts with Connor Johnny Gaudreau I think for my game it could work out pretty well hopefully We ll see what happens McDavid was voted in as captain of the Pacific which won the first 3 on 3 tournament last season San Jose coach Peter DeBoer is eager to have fun with the world class talent at his disposal but may have an ulterior motive at work Just enjoy it and double shift McDavid DeBoer chirped I d like to see maybe some combinations that maybe they can come up with Fowler said You get Gaudreau and Burns out there with a Carter or somebody Have Gaudreau do his thing with the two shooters The possibilities are endless If I m excited about it as a player I can only imagine what fans and people watching the game are excited about it as well The divisional format has Alex Ovechkin and Sidney Crosby as teammates for the Metropolitan pushing aside their rivalry for a weekend Ovechkin is preparing to be put in a different position by Gretzky who is substituting as coach for Columbus s John Tortorella We re going to ask the coach who is going to play on which line and who the lines are going to be Ovechkin said I m pretty sure it s going to be fun It s going to be some new lines We re going to go over the system and see if I m going to be the shot blocker or defenseman When it was suggested that Ovechkin will be the playmaker for Crosby Washington s three time league MVP cracked Yeah we ve switched positions In what could be his first of many Matthews is trying to take it all in You meet everybody he said You look around you see a lot of great history and a lot of great players A lot of past players that are Hall of Famers who have had unbelievable careers
