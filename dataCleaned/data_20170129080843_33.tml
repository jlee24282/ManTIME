<TITLE>Steven Gerrard makes brilliant claim about Liverpool under Jurgen Klopp</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Steven Gerrard has described Liverpool as one of the best teams to watch in the first half of the Premier League season despite their recent blip.  
Liverpool finished 2016 on a high note with a 1-0 win against title rivals Manchester City to leave Jurgen Klopp’s side on the coattails of leaders Chelsea. 
 
However, the Reds have struggled to recreate their electric performances in 2017 so far after a run of one win in seven games in all competitions. 
 
Indeed, Liverpool have dropped to fourth place in the Premier League table after failing to win a game in 2017 despite facing two clubs in the relegation zone. 
 
Speaking to BT Sport ahead of Liverpool’s clash against Wolverhampton Wanderers in the FA Cup fifth round on Saturday afternoon, Gerrard claimed that Jurgen Klopp’s side were one of the best attacking units in the first half of the campaign. 
 
“Jurgen Klopp has come in and he has done wonders to the football club. They have been brilliant up until January. They’re very attacking. They’re one of the best teams to watch,” Gerrard said.
