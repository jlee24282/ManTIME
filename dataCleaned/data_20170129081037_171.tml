Once a long time ago beyond the two bluest mountains on the horizon down Misty Lane that led between two giant hemlock trees there lay a beautiful meadow And in this meadow there lived a Snowlygaster He was as big as a house as high as a house as long as a house and as wide as a house Never was there another animal as big as the Snowlygaster He had two heads One like a horse s head with soft brown eyes and a flowing white mane One like a dragon s head with flashing blue eyes and covered with green scales This head breathed fire from its nose and mouth No animal was ever kinder than the Snowlygaster s horse head And none was ever more ferocious than the green dragon head Now the Snowlygaster had eight legs four like a horse s legs and four like a dragon s legs When he drew up his dragon legs and ran on his horse s legs he could go faster than the wind But when he drew up his horse s legs and stood on his dragon legs the wind stopped The earth held its breath So powerful was the Snowlygaster on his dragon legs that he could lick any beast that lived then or lives now or ever will live About the Author Born in 1924 at her grandmother s house in Chico California Donna Tisdale her parents and her two sisters lived in a wilderness logging town in Feather River Canyon California She enjoys being a part of Zonta International a wonderful service club The Snowlygaster is a 92 page paperback with a retail price of 34 00 The ISBN is 978 1 4809 1994 5 It was published by Dorrance Publishing Co Inc of Pittsburgh Pennsylvania For more information or to request a review copy please go to our virtual pressroom at or our online bookstore at GET IN TOUCH Jessica Stillwell Dorrance Publishing You can see the original version and more on PRLeap here
