<TITLE>Latest trend in yoga takes classes into local breweries</TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ALBUQUERQUE N M Happy hour and yoga aren t usually two things people think about in the same context But both are popular ways people use to unwind so perhaps the latest trend of drinking beer while perched on a yoga mat isn t that far of a stretch YogaZo mobile yoga studio owner Ashley Fathergill is embracing the fad The latest trend in yoga is drinking beer during class Mobile yoga studio YogaZo hosts Pints Planks classes at local breweries such as this one at Rio Bravo Brewing Company Her studio puts on classes every day except Fridays at local breweries around town including Rio Bravo Brewing Company Santa Fe Brewing ABQ Duel Brewing Company Dialogue Brewing and Marble Brewery The Pints Planks yoga courses have become so popular she s had to hire five new yoga instructors It s not clear how the trend started but a studio in Germany BierYoga was one of the first to try the concept Their tagline is The original since 2015 and the studio offers classes that actually incorporate beer drinking and the beer bottle into the yoga routines According to its website BeerYoga is the marriage of two great loves beer and yoga Both are centuries old therapies for body mind and soul The joy of drinking beer and the mindfulness of yoga complement each other and make for an energizing experience The classes are held at bars festivals and parties Continue reading Fathergill has put her own spin on it though by hosting the courses in breweries and making the goal for people to make new friends They also don t incorporate the beer into the routine People can drink during the class or not and are encouraged to stay afterward to socialize During every class she asks everyone to introduce themselves to at least one person they don t know The classes are held in the evening to coincide with typical workday schedules and the time most people socialize Ashley Fathergill is the owner of local mobile yoga studio YogaZo People like to go to happy hour after work she said Having it in a brewery setting makes is seem like more of a gathering than a I have to go to this workout class Making new friends was the reason Fathergill embraced yoga Six years ago she moved to Albuquerque from Ohio and was having a hard time meeting new people She enrolled in some classes as a way to meet people and said she ended up falling in love with yoga and decided to become an instructor She started her yoga business in September 2015 naming it after her dog Zoey who died earlier that year Initially she rented a space and offered three classes a day but nobody showed up It wasn t any different than what was being offered she said I needed a hook Fathergill said she had heard of this idea of holding yoga in breweries and other urban spaces and so approached Rio Bravo Brewing Company on Second Street and pitched the idea to them They agreed to test the concept It took off she said We have 20 to 40 people at each of our classes Fathergill charges 5 per class and most of the money is given to local nonprofit organizations She pays her instructors but does not take a paycheck instead using her full time job in publishing sales to provide her income The classes have even attracted a large group of men which she said is somewhat unusual for yoga She said it s the atmosphere of the brewery not necessarily the drinking that attracts the large crowds and that some people do not even drink during the class I think people immediately have an open mind to it she said They already have positive feelings about it because it s a brewery Pints Planks The yoga classes are held at local breweries by the YogaZo mobile yoga studio and cost 5 each Class locations and times are available at yogazoabq com
