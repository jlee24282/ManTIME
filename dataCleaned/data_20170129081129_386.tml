The Someday Birds Launch Adventure    
In January 2017, Sally J. Pla‘s debut book The Someday Birds will be released. Sally and Adventures by the Book invite readers, children  amp; adults alike for a unique book launch. Over appetizers and refreshments, we will gather to celebrate the release of the novel that Sally describes as her “own neurodiverse heart-gift to kids who are different, kids put in tough situations, kids dragged into journeys they don’t want. It’s about self-acceptance, about learning how to feel more at ease in the world.” If you, like Sally’s protagonist Charlie, adore birds then you will want to be sure to meet us for the start of this book launch at 1:15 pm, for a bird watching walk led by a member of the San Elijo Lagoon Conservancy, where there will be binoculars provided to the first 25 guests. As we stroll around the lagoon looking for the many diverse species of birds, the spirit of The Someday Birds will overtake you. 
 
Please keep in mind to wear comfortable walking shoes and to bring a hat, sunscreen, water, and binoculars (optional, for those not interested in using the supply from the Nature Center). At 2:15 pm we will return to the Nature Center to join the rest of the guests and gather for a reception in the upper story of the center, which boasts a spectacular view of the lagoon. As snacks, soft drinks, beer  amp; wine are served, Sally Pla will introduce her book and host a book discussion, complete with a Q amp;A. Copies of the brand new novel will be available for purchase and signing at the event as well.
