Aerosmith Star Not Sure Of Reason For 'Farewell' Tour (Week in Review)  
 

. 
  
Aerosmith Star Not Sure Of Reason For 'Farewell' Tour was a Top 3 story on Thursday: Aerosmith star Brad Whitford says in a new interview that he is not really sure why the veteran band has decided to embark on what is being billed as a farewell tour. 
 
Whitford was asked by NME about the reasoning behind a farewell tour and he responded, "Oh gosh, I'm not really sure. I don't know, I think it was a general business decision, between the promoters to the management to the band. 
 
"I don't actually feel like we're gonna be shutting the whole thing down at the end of it, but I think there's a lot more life in the band. But, I guess you've got to start somewhere. So, we're just starting to put the farewell label on things." - here.
