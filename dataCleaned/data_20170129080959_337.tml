<TITLE>Forum Post: RE: I really need help with inability to eat</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Hi Sue, 
 

I am so sorry to hear of your struggles with eating - the treatment, the teeth removal and the mucus all combine to make it hard at the moment.  I had RT and chemo in 2013 for tonsil cancer, and your description brings back lots of memories of how it was afterwards. 
 

I can't answer all the questions, but I will do what I can.  Starting from the bottom, the average woman needs 2000 kCal each day to maintain body weight, assuming good health and normal mobility.  If you are healing (as you are at this stage, and will be for a while) then your body needs more in the way of protein, in particular.  If you are less mobile (as you probably are at the moment), then your normal requirements will be reduced.  It's a balance, but what it does mean is that this one bag of feed is giving you the majority of what you need already, and you only have to top up a bit during the day to maintain your weight.  You certainly won't starve. 
 

I found that certain foods made the mucus much worse, and some just made me feel sick at the thought of them, so I can sympathise with your predicament.  Anything with dairy in (and that includes the fortisips) may well increase your mucus production.  It is renowned for doing that anyway, and when your body is out of kilter then you need to be aware of such things.  
 
I found that the easiest foods to eat were either blended very finely, like you would with a Nutribullet), or oily.  The radiotherapy destroys both the saliva glands and the membrane down your throat that provides the lubrication when you swallow food, so anything that is either wet or slightly greasy (in the nicest possible way - I'm not talking about a full english breakfast here) will slide down much better. 
 
If you have soups, I found that adding either silken tofu or pea protein powder was really helpful, as without them I was starving again very quickly.  Both vanish into the soup, especially when it is blended, and both give your body an extra supply of the much-needed protein. 
 
Bananas and avocados blend particularly well together, and for over a year after finishing my treatment I would have a smoothie every day for one of my meals.  I would use 2 bananas (100 calories each), half an avocado (another 100 calories), a big spoon of natural yogurt (100 calories), a very generous spoon of nutella or peanut butter (2-300 calories) and water to make it the right consistency.  Perversely perhaps, water is the most difficult thing for me to swallow on its own as it washes away what little lubrication I have in my throat.  Thicker liquids are much easier. 
 
Once you are back swallowing food successfully then you can try other things, but for now baby steps would be best.  Food is fuel, so whether you want it or not you need to keep trying it.  It took about 6 months for my taste to return to something akin to normal, so for the time being the best thing you can do is make some up, and have it in little portions. 
 
As for the mucus, sorry to be graphic but the only way I could find of dealing with it was to sort of pull it forwards into my mouth by sucking hard at the back of my throat, and then spit it out.  Sparkling water helped in a way that normal water didn't, so you may find that worth a try. 
 
Keep posting if you want the support, there are lots of us here who really do know the need to persevere with the whole food thing, and we can at least be on hand for motivation and ideas.  Feel free to pm me if you want to chat more, I do know something about the psychological side too. 
 
Best wishes, 
 

Josie
