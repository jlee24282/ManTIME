Edo Coaches Ex athletes Want Technocrat As Commissioner A S politicians inten sify lobbying for different political appointment in the Godwin Obaseki government in Edo State sports stakeholders have called on the governor to put round pegs in a round holes by ensuring that a core professional is appointed as sports commissioner Our source who pleaded anonymity blamed the immediate past administration for conducting the final burial of sports development in the state while reiterating their commitment to the all round development of sports in the state if given the material morale and financial support We are very happy that we have a governor who has indicated interest to reposition Edo State in all its ramifications You will agree with me that sports is a strong unifying force in Nigeria No matter your religion culture and political affiliation the moment there is sporting activities or a competition everybody becomes one But here in Edo that unifying force has been completely annihilated by the past administration of Comrade Adams Oshiomhole Look you do not need a prophet to tell you that sports in this state has become moribund It is very important for us to voice out our feelings so that this present government will not make the same mistakes that its predecessor made in the area of sports development For Edo State to regain her past glory in sports in Nigeria our governor must do the needful A man who knows what sports administration is all about must and should be appointed as head of the sports ministry in the state Without prejudice some of the past commissioners especially the immediate past one was a monumental failure a disaster and in fact we have never had it so bad This is why we are begging our governor to appoint someone with a sound resume to manage the Ministry so that Edo State will assume her rightful position in the Nigerian sports calendar On my own part I want to appeal to the governor to look into our condition of service 80 percent of us have not been promoted for the past 16 years We need an improved working condition We voted for Godwin Obaseki because we believed in him and the party s Change Mantra should reflect in every aspect of the state our source said The post appeared first on Vanguard News Original Article Edo Coaches Ex athletes Want Technocrat As Commissioner Edo Coaches Ex athletes Want Technocrat As Commissioner Edo Coaches Ex athletes Want Technocrat As Commissioner Edo Coaches Ex athletes Want Technocrat As Commissioner Edo Coaches Ex athletes Want Technocrat As Commissioner Edo Coaches Ex athletes Want Technocrat As Commissioner Edo Coaches Ex athletes Want Technocrat As Commissioner
