<TITLE>Boston rolls to CAL honors; Georgetown settles for runner-up</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Pentucket senior Kalon Boston remained undefeated and turned quite a few heads at the Cape Ann League/Northeast Conference meet Saturday. 
 
Boston coasted to the 170-pound title, winning with a 17-0 technical fall in the finals and was named CAL Wrestler of the Year. His training partner, Devin Young, nearly joined him in the winner’s circle, losing in overtime in the 195-pound finals. 
 
Masconomet won the meet with 145 points, 12 better than runner-up Georgetown/Ipswich. Although G/I had more wrestlers in the finals with five, they all settled for second place. 
 
Finishing as runner-up for G-I were Ian Forgitano (106), Troy Forgitano (113), Josiah Krason (120), John Blythe (152) and Charlie Koshivas (160). Blythe lost a heartbreaker in overtime. 
 
For North Reading/Lynnfield, Connor Stead was first at 145.  
 
RAIDERS ROLL TO TILE 
 
Central Catholic romped to the Winnacunnet Tournament crown Saturday, scoring 229 points, far ahead of runner-up Exeter. Haverhill wrestled well and finished third. 
 
In an unusual final, Central sophomore Tyler Glynn defeated his freshman brother, Mike , to win the 106-pound title to get the Raiders started and Greg Spero overcame a sizable deficit to prevail at 113. 
 
Other champs for Central were Joe Sanchez (132), Jackson Clark (152), David Onyemem (195) and heavyweight Carlos Cabrera , who remained undefeated. Finishing second for the Raiders were Cam Hebert (132), Connor Murphy (160) and Alex Peralta (182). 
 
For Haverhill, Nick Tejada had a strong day and took top honors at 132 while Kevin Fuller (113), Steven Wise (120) and Jake Nicolosi (126) all took second. 
 
REGGIES CROWN PAIR 
 
Greater Lawrence crowned two champions at the State Vocational Meet on its way toward taking fifth place. 
 
Malib Pastrana continued his fine season by taking first at 182 and Tyler McDonald was a surprise winner at heavyweight. For Whittier , which came in fifth, Shaun Mears (170), Andrew Buzzell (195) and Sal Fonzo (220) all took thirds. 
 
Shawsheen was the team champ with 249 points, six more than runner-up Putnam. 
 
DAVILA DAZZLES 
 
Just back from a broken hand suffered in the preseason, freshman Kelvin Davila scored a pair of wins at 145 pounds and another at 152 as Andover beat Malden Catholic (36-35), St. Paul’s (39-30) and Bedford (45-35). Matt Meagher added three pins for the Warriors. 
 
FAHEY, TANGUAY CROWNED 
 
Pinkerton’s Robbie Fahey prevailed 7-5 in overtime to take first at 120 at the Capital Classic in Concord and Windham’s Mike Tanguay took top honors at 195 to highlight the local wrestlers. 
 
Pinkerton, which was third overall, also had a second from Tyler Mackiernan at 145 and Deene Hill at heavyweight while Windham had thirds from Nick Sawyer (120), Vinnie Marino (126) and Mike Furey (220).
