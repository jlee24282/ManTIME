<TITLE>Ask Amy Snark takes the wind out of wind ensemble</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Dear Amy I am a member of a 50 piece wind ensemble We have a break for cookies and coffee on practice nights once a week I have made homemade cookies for our break for more than 25 years In May we have an outdoor concert I have brought cookies each year for after our performance This year one of the newer band members asked me if I had rat poison in them I was shocked and asked him to repeat what he said to make sure I heard correctly His response It was just a joke I don t understand this type of humor I have continued to make cookies for the band but I think about his comment each week Related Articles January 27 2017 Ask Amy Friend in abusive relationship faces estrangement January 26 2017 Ask Amy Regular customer thanks the wrong sir January 24 2017 Ask Amy Daughter ponders not inviting mother to her wedding January 23 2017 Ask Amy Adult daughter wants birth parents to re adopt her January 22 2017 Ask Amy Husband sends marriage to the dogs Shall I continue to make cookies for our breaks in 2017 Shocked on the West Coast Dear Shocked People sometimes make awkward and unfortunately unkind comments because another person s generosity makes them uncomfortable This person immediately tried to reassure you that he was making a joke This comment was not funny in any context so it can t be characterized as a joke but I hope you will forgive his graceless reaction to you I raise a toast to all of the generous bakers who bring in treats to share with others It is a very kind sweet and generous impulse and sharing these treats helps to bring others together Don t let this person s sarcasm ruin this sweetness for you or the rest of your ensemble Dear Amy Is there a polite way to respond when you are in a room with someone who has or is getting over a cold who coughs or sneezes all over the place without bothering to cover up I ve gotten sick twice this winter and both times it was a day or two after being around someone who is too inconsiderate to cover their mouth when they cough or sneeze I know I can t be sure that the colds came from these people but I m betting they were the cause I travel to people s homes for my job and usually spend two to three hours there so when I am sick I reschedule to prevent spreading anything I don t want to be a jerk But at the same time rescheduling an appointment costs me a few hundred dollars Do you have any suggestions on how to get my message across politely Worried Dear Worried It is common courtesy to cover one s mouth when coughing or sneezing school children are now taught to cover their mouths with the inside of their elbows instead of their hands which may help prevent spreading illness If you are in a room with someone who appears to be sick and is not covering their mouth you should simply respond I m so sorry you seem sick Would you mind covering your mouth when you cough or sneeze I seem to catch everything and I d really appreciate it Obviously you should make sure you keep up with your own hand washing hygiene This will help to protect your clients Dear Amy Concerned Sister was relating an issue where the sister in law wants to use her surname for the third child the other two children have the husband s surname You say that Rarely families choose to divide the spouses surnames between children and this can cause paperwork hassles and some issues when traveling as a family Twenty one years ago my wife and I flipped a coin that determined that our oldest daughter took her last name Seventeen years ago our next daughter took my last name We expected bureaucratic hassles and snide comments My mother asked me whether the girls were going to be confused about who their father really was I can truly say with great surprise that we had no problems navigating this Everybody who mattered knew who was related to whom at every step of the way including during foreign travel I cannot recall a single issue we had that lasted longer than 10 seconds of pleasant conversation nor any extra form that we needed to fill out I do appreciate your first piece of advice on this this is the parents issue not an issue for the in laws cousins and grandparents John D Faucher Dear John I have encountered minor challenges as a parent traveling with a minor child with a different surname one border guard queried her to determine if I was really her mother completely understandable But I agree that this is absolutely manageable
