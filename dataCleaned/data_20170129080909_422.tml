<TITLE>Letter National epidemic of gang warfare in legislatures</TITLE>
<TEXT>
I was under the impression that gang warfare was prohibited However witnessing the conduct of our elected representatives I see it has been legalized Democrats versus Republicans Not just in Illinois either it is a national epidemic in our legislatures Regardless of whether a solution is beneficial to the public who pay the taxes it is vetoed because the other side thought of it Meanwhile because of this deadlock and legalized gang warfare many people suffer due to cuts in services I would suggest that not only should our elected representative pay be withheld so should their benefits per diems etc Once they are forced to survive without health insurance travel assistance etc perhaps they will understand the position they have placed many citizens in Maybe they will get off their lazy butts and do the job they were hired to do One other thing the lack of an Illinois budget is not a new concept This situation has come up many times in the past several years One constant that I see in the equation is House Speaker Michael Madigan I don t know him he may be a great guy but it would appear that regardless as to who the governor is Mr Madigan blocks all progress After 30 some years isn t it time to change Greg Burleson Carlinville
