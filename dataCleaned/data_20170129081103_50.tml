<TITLE>MSSU men nip Central Oklahoma in OT</TITLE>
<TEXT>
It certainly wasn't the best of shooting days for CJ Carr, but Missouri Southern's 5-foot-8 point guard is filled with confidence and determination. 
 
Carr drove the lane for a layup with 8.1 seconds left in overtime, and the Lions nipped Central Oklahoma 83-82 on Saturday afternoon on Robert Corn Court inside the Leggett  amp; Platt Athletic Center. 
 
The Lions (13-8, 7-5 MIAA) trailed for almost 26 minutes, including 70-64 after UCO's Corbin Byford's dunk that became a three-point play. But Vince Fritz nailed a 3 from the right corner as the Lions scored six points in 56 seconds and tied it at 70 when Lawrence Brown made 1-of-2 free throws with 2:03 left. 
 
It was 73-73 after regulation as Fritz tipped away a lob pass near the basket and Brown grabbed the ball, and the Lions' JJ Cratit shot a contested 30-footer that was on line but short. 
 
Missouri Southern fell behind again 79-76 midway through overtime, but five free throws — one by Brown and two apiece by Parker Jennings and Carr — put the Lions ahead 81-79 — their first lead since the opening minutes of the second half. 
 
The Bronchos (12-7, 7-4) received a free throw from Jordan London and, after an MSSU turnover, a bucket by Byford in the lane for a one-point lead with 89 seconds left. 
 
After a Lion timeout, Carr got the ball, dribbled across the lane and made a tough left-handed shot for a one-point lead with 8.1 seconds left. 
 
"Coach drew up a great play where Parker and Vince crossed, which let me to penetrate into the open lane," said Carr, who finished with 16 points and eight assists. "Luckily there was an easy enough layup for me to make. It was a great play by Coach." 
 
"Either man or zone, we wanted to get CJ the ball at the top, cut the guards a little bit and try to get CJ's man to bite a little bit," Lions coach Jeff Boschee said. "I told CJ as soon as you see your guy hesitate when those guys cut through, drive it. It's fortunate that we have a guy who can make the play." 
 
Still, the Bronchos had plenty of time to get off a shot, but they never got a good look and Corey Alpough missed a contested shot near the 3-point arc on the right wing. 
 
"A little bit of concern (leaving so much time on the clock)," Boschee admitted. "If we missed it, we'd have some time to foul and maybe come back and get another opportunity." 
 
"It was a matter of heart by our guys," Carr said. "Coaches really prepared us for this game. We wouldn't have won this game earlier in the season." 
 
Cratit and Elyjah Clark tallied 21 points apiece to lead the Lions, and Brown scored 20, hitting 7-of-11 field goals and 6-of-12 free throws. Brown and Clark shared the team lead with seven rebounds. 
 
"I'm playing closer to the basket," Brown said. "I'm more efficient down there." 
 
"I was really proud of Lawrence the way he played with four fouls without fouling, especially guarding those big kids down low," Boschee said. "Toward the end when we started to press, Vince comes up with a huge steal. I thought that was a big contributing factor to us winning the game. Just little plays ... we got to the free throw line 37 times. Obviously if we had made more of those we wouldn't be in overtime, but we found a way to win. I'm proud of the guys the way they stepped up defensively after the poor showing against Northeastern State (on Wednesday night)." 
 
The Lions made 10 steals, including three by Cratit and two apiece by Fritz, Dexter Frisbie and Kinzer Lambert. 
 
"Defense, defense, just getting stops," Brown said. "Being more active on defense and trying to turn them over, and we did 19 times. Vince had some big steals. He bailed me out on one and got a steal. He played excellent today." 
 
Byford collected 17 points and 14 rebounds for the Bronchos, who won in overtime at Pittsburg State on Thursday night. Marquis Johnson scored 13, Jake Hammond and Alpough both had 11 and Demari Edwards 1
