Sports Information Department By Patti Arnold Saturday January 28 2017 Saying goodbye at the airport is the worst Not hearing your native language speaking English every day understanding the language in a lecture or when a large group is carrying on several conversations at once that s a challenge Missing family knowing you can t go home most school breaks because you re thousands of miles and an expensive plane flight away can compound the normal case of homesickness most college freshmen experience However the experience of getting a college education and playing college athletics just as it is for American student athletes has compelled more than 30 international student athletes to overcome additional hurdles at Colorado Mesa I ve been wanting to do this since I was like 10 said freshman men s basketball player Ludde Saldh who is from Gothenburg Sweden I don t know American basketball I liked the NBA college Saldh attended a boarding school the past three years that was a few hours from his family It helped him learn how to be on his own but still flying nearly 5 000 miles from home was hard It s different from what I m used to he said of college basketball But no regrets Other than the food perhaps I think we have healthier food in Sweden he said Adjusting to an American diet is often an issue I would love to have a home cooked meal said Chiara Giesselbach a freshman on the CMU women s basketball team from Weiterstadt Germany My mom used to make this potatoes with cheese and vegetables in the oven I don t know how she makes it but I miss it a lot Giesselbach s older sister plays college basketball in San Diego so she understood what she might encounter but she and teammate Maja Beier who is from Berlin lean on each other I feel like especially it was good to have each other around all the time Giesselbach said When I first came here I ve never lived on a campus or eaten in a cafeteria Beier said I was always home with my parents I m getting used to it Most of the international student athletes could take advantage of the long break at the holidays and go home The international basketball players and their teammates had only one week off Some including Saldh and Beier headed home others like Giesselbach stayed in the U S An advantage international student athletes have over non athletes from other countries studying at CMU is having a built in group of friends on their team That first year is the toughest one women s basketball coach Taylor Wagner said After that they get to know people and have friends and integrate themselves on campus and in the community That first year they re still learning everything It s hard for someone from the U S let alone leaving home and what you re used to After the first semester even though they still miss their families the homesickness isn t as bad Skype or FaceTime allow them to video chat with their families which helps Like every other student athlete they have to learn to manage their time with practice games and classes In Germany you either play basketball in a club program or go to university Beier said not both at the same place Being able to go to college and play basketball the 6 foot 4 center said is cool One of the international student athletes in the basketball program Filip Nowicki has been through what the freshmen are feeling He s been in the U S five years first attending a prep school in Indiana then going to Sacred Heart before deciding to transfer after two years After coming to the States the biggest challenge was the language said Nowicki from Wloclawek Poland I wasn t homesick because I left home when I was 13 I got used to being away from my family I went to school five hours away Being away from family wasn t a big deal for me but the language and basketball was different Most of the international student athletes have had English classes since they were young but Nowicki said he still struggled when he first came to America Last week he met an American student on his floor who speaks some Polish which was a nice surprise I came with practically no English he said We took English in high school but I would say no English I had to learn everything how to talk speak and read it Beier too said she was worried at first about the language and although sometimes her grammar isn t perfect in her papers she s doing well in class Before I came here I thought it would be really hard with the language In school I would have problems understanding or writing an essay she said Most of the teachers know I m an international student I told them at the beginning When they grade my essays they know I m an international student so maybe that helps International clubs have meetings and have activities such as going on hikes that Beier said helps them meet more people who are sharing the same experiences Sometimes it just takes a little time to become acclimated like any college student Frederikke Karst is doing better this year tennis coach Dan MacDonald said of the sophomore from Denmark She and Rebecca Osterburg who is from Sweden are friends and sometimes that happens you get one and they reach out to a friend and they come Karst struggled a little bit with the language and the food we eat little things like that This year she seems more at ease And there are bonuses Frederikke loves how cheap our clothes are here MacDonald said laughing She s a shopper Electronics phones everything here is so much cheaper When her family comes We re going to go over to the outlets in Dillon everything s so cheap in your country Despite the obstacles they face in language food and distance from home there s also a comfort zone The sports part puts them at ease MacDonald said It gives them a place they re used to
