<TITLE>Training can curb concerns of favoritism when worker gains supervisory role</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Often at a company particularly in an industrial distribution or retail setting an hourly employee will move into a position of authority such as shift supervisor or area leader Whenever someone from within the organization moves into a titled job the company may need to provide training to this employee on employment laws so that he or she does not inadvertently discriminate against former peers The employee is no longer just one of the guys He or she has to see himself or herself as being removed from those under his or her supervision To do otherwise may lead to accusations of favoritism which may lead to decreased morale and even litigation What is favoritism Favoritism is the act of preferring an individual or group of employees over another This can be both a fair and unfair act If it is rooted in a legitimate business concern it is expected and may be the basis for company decisions such as hiring promoting and reviewing employees Unfair favoritism on the other hand may be based on a supervisor s relationship with an applicant or employee This may be in the form of hiring friends or family for positions without regard to qualifications or giving preferential treatment such as job assignments annual reviews and the like to a subordinate that is also a friend Dysfunctional workplace When a supervisor plays favorites it may create disgruntled employees Those that see themselves as being passed over will distrust the organization and supervisor The supervisor will not command the respect necessary for his or her role These employees may begin to put less effort into their work because they feel it goes unnoticed They are thinking Why bother The supervisor s buddy may begin to feel the liberty to slack off because he or she feels protected There is no motivation to improve since the special treatment is not contingent upon work performance Rewards not based on merit can create a chilling effect on teamwork since the favored employee may begin to feel entitled Even within the healthiest of work environments companies see turnover It is best to avoid unfair favoritism if you expect to retain qualified employees Also keep in mind when someone is promoted out of unfair favoritism an ill equipped supervisor may put your company s reputation and safety at risk Develop a policy Often called a workplace relationship policy it is one means of preventing and limiting favoritism Whether creating a new policy or re evaluating an existing one a company should examine the effects of workplace favoritism throughout your supervisory chain One best practice is to have employees identify immediate family members or close relationships to the human resources department A hiring policy may for instance include a statement that you will not create a conflict of interest based on these relationships Some companies have a policy that warns against supervisors spending too much time with employees outside of work When drafting a policy it may be wise to seek legal counsel that is familiar with state and local laws on the topic If you have a policy in place make sure supervisors are trained on it and understand the importance of fairness If a supervisor is accused of a conflict of interest unfair favoritism be discreet and talk to the parties privately to determine if the claims are legitimate violating company policy and potentially against the law Of course in smaller companies and communities it may not be feasible to prevent family and or friends from working together In those cases be sure to keep detailed records why someone was promoted or terminated You want to show decisions were made based on qualifications in the event of a lawsuit Kathy Close is an editor with J J Keller Associates Close specializes in drug and alcohol testing and compliance safety and accountability enforcement with a focus on the transportation and logistics industry She is the editor of several products including the Transport Safety Risk Management Security newsletter For more information visit http www jjkeller com
