<TEXT>
, 65, passed away Jan. 26, 2017, at Hospice House of Reno County, Hutchinson. A lifelong resident of Hutchinson, she was born May 10, 1951, the daughter of Dennis and Florence Maley.

She was fascinated with reading and watching "true crime" books and shows, and had a particular fancy for watching the ID Channel. A lifelong fan of Elvis and The Beatles, she also loved DQ Blizzards and Nu-Way sandwiches. It was always "dessert first" and take the rest home to eat â€“ "doesn't everyone do that?"

She married Terrill Graber April 1, 1988. He preceded her in death Nov. 6, 2016. Survivors include: her adopted mother, Verna Jo Smith; a son, Mark Jordan (Lori); a daughter, Amy Black; a sister, Linda Walters (Tom); adopted sister and brother, Myrna and Vic Jordan; close friend and confidant, Margaret Hahn. She was preceded in death by her parents; a sister, Mary Windholtz; and a brother, Dennis Maley Jr.

Per her request, cremation has taken place. The family has established a memorial fund and gifts may be made to the American Cancer Society, in care of Old Mission-Heritage Funeral Home, 528 N. Main, Hutchinson.
