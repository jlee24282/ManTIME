<TITLE>Petition for ban on 3 Indian channels rejected</TITLE>
<TEXT>
The High Court has rejected a writ petition filed challenging the legality of airing three Indian television channels in Bangladesh. 
 
The bench of Justice Moyeenul Islam Chowdhury and Justice JBM Hassan passed the order on Sunday morning. 
 
The channels are Star Jalsha, Star Plus and Z Bangla. 
 
Lawyer Syeda Shaheen Ara Laily filed the petition in October 2014, looking for a directive from the High Court to stop airing these channels in Bangladesh. 
 
Local radical Islamist parties have also been campaigning against the Indian channels alleging that those were behind social chaos in Bangladesh.
