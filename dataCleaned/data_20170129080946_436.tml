<TITLE>Squad Rotation?!</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Allardyce stated in his pre-match press conference that he would "..rotate the squad" with the imminence of the Bournemouth match in mind. He then puts out a midfield with at least four 'dead men walking' to somewhat prove his point yet plays our best full backs, risking both to injury. Lo and behold, Schlupp picks up an injury! Genius.
