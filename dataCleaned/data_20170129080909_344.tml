Hello and welcome to the latest edition of the Giant Bomb Community Spotlight and I, ZombiePie, am once again honored to be your host this week.

Many of you fastidiously tackled your gaming backlogs, and others are participating in community events which tap into your creative skills. If anything, this all warms the heart of this respective cantankerous moderator rather personally. With this heart-to-heart complete, let's move on to the site related housekeeping:
