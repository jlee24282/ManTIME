<TITLE>Smit family celebrates new citizenship</TITLE>

After coming to America in 2004, Suzette and Jan Smit are now American citizens following a Naturalization ceremony on Friday. 
 
Thirteen years after arriving in the United States, local pharmacists Jan and Suzette Smit are now American citizens. 

 
Friday morning, the family was sworn in as new citizens during a naturalization ceremony in a federal office building in Atlanta. 
 
“For us, it’s an enormous accomplishment and an honor,” said Jan Smit. “You don’t realize what a big deal this. It’s so difficult to get into the United States.” 
 
Their journey from Pretoria, South Africa, to Newnan began in 2004 when Albertsons, a regional grocery store in Florida, began recruiting pharmacists to come to America. The family had spent the previous decade running its own pharmacy in South Africa. 
 
Coming to America was something entirely new for the family that had no idea what awaited them. 
 
“You see America on the television and the movies, but you never really know what it’s all about until you come,” Jan Smit said. “But the people down here in the South are so warm and friendly – they welcomed us from the moment we arrived, and it really made it easy for us to get established.” 
 
Jan Smit eventually went to work for Rite Aid while Suzette worked for Jet Logistics in Atlanta. In 2008, their youngest son joined the Army and was deployed to Iraq for several tours before returning home. 
 
In 2011, he sponsored his parents for a green card, and two years later, the family opened Health Mart Pharmacy on Baker Road. 
 
Located directly across the street from the Health Mart is a CVS Pharmacy. This wasn’t an oversight, but intentional, according to Jan Smit. 
 
“When I was an apprentice in South Africa, a pharmacist once told me to open your store across the street from a very busy pharmacy,” Jan Smit recalled. “You’ll ultimately get not only the runoff, but also those who don’t really care for that style of operation.” 
 
Suzette Smit agreed, citing there are two different kinds of pharmacies – the big box, express, drive-thru kind and the smaller, family operated kind where customers become friends. 
 
“We only get the nice people in here,” Suzette Smit joked. “When it’s a family-run business, it inevitably becomes an extension of your home, and that’s how you interact with every person who comes through your door.” 
 
Jodi Morril is a regular customer who attests to the Smit family philosophy when it comes to business. 
 
“They take a simple visit to the pharmacy and turn it into a neighborly visit,” she said. “In a world where big businesses rush you through the checkout line, this wonderful couple and especially, Miss Suzette, engage you in conversation, make lengthy calls to the insurance provider if there are any problems, and make you feel as if you’ve gone to a neighbor's home for a visit.” 
 
Running the pharmacy is a full-time operation, but when the Smit family gets home, they spend their time connecting with family from across the globe. While their youngest son is a registered nurse at Tanner Hospital in Carrollton, their other two children are in New Zealand and South Africa. 
 
Their Sundays are spent at church and then on Skype where they visit with their two grandchildren. Suzette Smit is the author of two novels and joined the Coweta Writers Group where she has immersed herself in the local writing scene. 
 
“Becoming a citizen is a tremendous honor,” Jan Smit said. “We’re extremely proud to have achieved this accomplishment and to call Newnan home.”
