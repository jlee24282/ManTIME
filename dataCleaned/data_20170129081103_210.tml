<TITLE>Letter: LaMalfa's slick mailer a waste of taxpayer money</TITLE>
<TEXT>
I received a slick, obviously costly mailer from Congressman Doug LaMalfa today and am compelled to respond. Wow, how much did this cost to produce and disseminate? Then to read that it was done at our (taxpayer) expense? It’s like free campaign material. How much did we pay? An estimate is $100,000 for 200,000 homes. 
 
He says he looks forward to the House being productive this term, but why have they not been productive over his last terms in office? He promises to repair the infrastructure yet Republicans have fought any legislation for its repair for years even though they have held the purse strings. Practically nothing has been accomplished for the American people. 
 
He looks forward to ending Obamacare. For years, as a self-employed person I had no health coverage because of pre-existing conditions. With the Affordable Care Act, I was able to get health insurance. My grandson is eligible to be on his mom’s insurance while he goes to college. What can we expect now? 
 
Apparently I pay more in taxes than Trump. LaMalfa gets farm subsidies each year, which I contend is part of the waste, fraud and abuse of the government he says he will now stop. 
 
LaMalfa did not beat Jim Reed by very much. Considering his advantage of position and free advertising, I believe there is hope to get a Democrat elected to Congress 2018.
