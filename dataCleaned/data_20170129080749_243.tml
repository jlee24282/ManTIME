<TITLE>Computer simulations reveal every curve of the dengue viral envelope</TITLE>
<TEXT>
A simulation of the dengue virus fusing with the membrane of a vesicle inside a cell Credit A STAR Bioinformatics Institute The near spherical outer structure of the dengue virus has been recreated in remarkable detail by a team of bioinformaticians in Singapore The virtual model could show researchers how the virus fuses with and infects human cells at the molecular level We want to understand the relationship between structure and dynamics along the pathway of fusion and infection with a view to developing new vaccines and therapies says Peter Bond who together with Chandra Verma led the study at the A STAR Bioinformatics Institute Dengue is a mosquito borne virus that infects an estimated 400 million people a year resulting in 21 000 deaths worldwide It is a flavivirus the same family as the Zika virus Japanese encephalitis and yellow fever Flaviviruses share a common structure a single stranded RNA genome encased in a capsule made up of a fatty lipid sandwich stuffed with proteins called envelopes and membranes Once inside human cells the smooth outer shell of the dengue virus forms spikes and fuses with the membrane of transport vesicles called endosomes infecting the cell through the release of the viral genome Researchers are particularly interested in how the external envelope proteins facilitate this process These proteins are the first thing to come into contact with our immune system says Bond If we are going to protect ourselves we need to recognize and ideally neutralize them The problem with standard experimental techniques such as cryoelectron microscopy for visualizing biological systems is that they can only detect ordered uniform solids Dengue s lipid membranes however are in a free flowing state somewhere between solid and liquid Bond and Verma s teams overcame this hurdle using computational modeling which applies Newton s laws of motion to a static structure to create a movie that zooms in on all the jiggling atoms They simulated the viral shell and played with different components to see what happened with the overall structure We used a Frankenstein style approach to chop off bits of protein from the virus and see how it affected the morphology a difficult job in the wet lab Surprisingly the membrane s curves seemed to be held in place by scaffolding proteins external to the membrane And the positioning of envelope and membrane proteins was secured by specific interactions with negatively charged lipids in the fatty membrane a finding that could be exploited for treatment development The results have important implications for the fusion process see image which Bond and Verma plan to study in more detail through a larger Singapore wide collaboration supported by the Ministry of Education The teams are also expanding their scope to other flaviviruses including Zika More information J K Marzinek et al Pushing the Envelope Dengue Viral Membrane Coaxed into Shape by Molecular Simulations Structure 2016 DOI 10 1016 j str 2016 05 014 Provided by Agency for Science Technology and Research A STAR Singapore Explore further First steps to neutralizing Zika How highly potent antibody neutralizes Zika infection discovered Nov 24 2016 As Zika spreads throughout the world the call for rapid development of therapeutics to treat Zika rings loud and clear Taking a step further in identifying a possible therapeutic candidate a team of researchers at Duke NUS Why humans and not mice are susceptible to Zika May 19 2016 Flaviviruses such as Zika dengue and yellow fever have emerged as human and other primate pathogens because of their ability to specifically overcome our anti viral defenses In the case of Zika researchers at the Cracking the mystery of Zika virus replication Jul 26 2016 Zika virus has now become a household word It can cause microcephaly a birth defect where a baby s head is smaller than usual Additionally it is associated with Guillain Barr syndrome a neurological disorder that could Study could lead to vaccines and treatment for dengue virus Jul 02 2015 Researchers at Vanderbilt University and the National University of Singapore have determined the structure of a human monoclonal antibody which in an animal model strongly neutralizes a type of the potentially lethal dengue
