<TITLE>Malia Obama ditches Palm Springs for Sundance pipeline protest</TITLE>
<TEXT>
If Malia Obama s first week as a former first daughter is anything to go by the 18 year old s re entry into civilian life appears to be going smoothly Take for example her trip to the Sundance Film Festival On Monday she attended an event supporting the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe s protest against the Dakota Access Pipeline which was revived in an executive action signed by President Trump this week and nobody seemed to notice for days In fact the story only gained traction once actress and anti DAP activist Shailene Woodley mentioned it in a Wednesday interview with the website DemocracyNow org It was amazing to see Malia Woodley said To witness a human being and a woman coming into her own outside of her family and outside of the attachments that this country has on her but someone who s willing to participate in democracy because she chooses to because she recognizes regardless of her last name that if she doesn t participate in democracy there will be no world for her future children As part of her gap year to do list Obama begins an internship with the Weinstein Company in February She ll enroll at Harvard University in the fall
