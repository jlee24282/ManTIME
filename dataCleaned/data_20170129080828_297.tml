<TITLE>Every Premier League team's most likely signing before the January transfer deadline</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Premier League clubs are gearing up for deadline day but which clubs will catch a star before the end of the January transfer window.

Football Whispers compile transfer rumours using an algorithm that takes into account how reliable rumour sources are, and the frequency of reports.

They score every transfer target from 0 to 5 - the higher the number, the more reliable - but who is your team most likely to sign?
