Visit the original post to see all 12 images from this gallery If you ve heard of Rich Chigga you would ve already known that the young Indonesian star is absolutely killing the rap game since only 16 years of age an incredibly young age to be in such intense media spotlight And if you thought that was a young age peep this Mike Hope better known as Mike the Ruler has been an Instagram star since only 14 Being a fashion influencer at such an early age is intense in itself and leads one to wonder how he handles it and now thanks to SSENSE we now get a look into his mind as the wunderkind sat down with the Canadian boutique for an extensive interview You can read a few standout excerpts below On growing up in the digital age When I was younger I didn t really know exactly what I was doing But I ve been through some rough shit in the last few years just personal mountains that I ve had to climb and in my opinion that helped me decide exactly where I want to be It made me see exactly how trivial everything is and made me only care about the stuff that really matters On current trends and defining meaning I think trends work in a circle And everything that s trendy now had been trendy before The only new trends in my opinion are ones created in technology that didn t exist before But human expression in terms of clothing design and art even if it s new is a recreation of something in the past Because the human mind hasn t really evolved in the last 200 years On what he considers valuable What I think is valuable is the stuff that s inspiring everything Like if you look back to the original and even the originals are interpretations of something else it almost works in the way a virus spreads This person gets the idea and they took it from something they noticed in their childhood or in the culture where they re from they do something with that and then people all over the world see it because of the internet Then that keeps spanning out and it dilutes itself and changes It s like a game of telephone On Vetements But when you look at synthetic Vetements and then the real thing you really see how the real thing is special No matter what brand tries to do a heavyweight sweatshirt no one is as heavy as Vetements And in my opinion Vetements isn t even streetwear People just term it that because you see all these hypebeasts in their hoodies or in their fake hoodies
