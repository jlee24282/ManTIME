<TITLE>Aggies face Eagles again at Santa Ana Star Center</TITLE>
<TEXT>
College basketball fans will get to not only see the best team in the state but arguably one of the top teams in the nation Monday evening at 7 at Santa Ana Star Center. 
   
No, it’s not the New Mexico Lobos – it’s the New Mexico State Aggies, who rolled to their 17th consecutive victory Thursday at Seattle, 71-56,and next face Northern New Mexico (4-18). 
   
The Aggies (19-2) had still to play at Utah Valley on Saturday, one week after a 94-71 victory over visiting UMKC last Saturday night in front 9,893 fans for its Pack the Pan Am promotion. It was NMSU’s 22nd homecourt win in a row; the Aggies’ home success trails only trails only Kansas (53), Oregon (38) and Akron (26).   
   
Northern New Mexico has five players on its roster who played at high schools in the metro area: Michael Nolan (Manzano), Brandon Saiz (Bernalillo), Carlos Barela (Cibola), Daniel Delgado (Del Norte) and Estevan Martinez (Atrisco Heritage Academy). The Eagles are coached by Ryan Cordova, who had been the head coach at Gallup before accepting the NNMC job several seasons ago. 
   
The NMSU Athletic Department targeted the greater Albuquerque area in an effort to provide the large number of Aggie alums and fans in the northern part of the state access to Aggie basketball. 
   
“There is tremendous support for New Mexico State Athletics in the Albuquerque-Rio Rancho-Corrales-Santa Fe area and we want to give them a chance to see the Aggies play in their own back yard,” said NMSU Director of Athletics Mario Moccia. “It’s great that Northern New Mexico has agreed to do this. 
   
“Our biggest pocket of alums in the country are in the Albuquerque area,” he said. “We want to get in front of them; we’ll bring the (NMSU) president up there and it’s great reminder to the alums.” 
   
Moccia said he expected to see a good team on the floor for first-year coach Paul Weir, but after 20 games, “18-2 is beyond my wildest expectations.” 
   
This is the second year in a row the Aggies will take the court at the Star Center. Last February, nearly 2,500 fans watched New Mexico State clinch an 85-54 victory over Northern New Mexico at the neutral-site venue. The Eagles are 4-18, with one victory coming via forfeit. 
   
Moccia said he’d be delighted if somewhere in the neighborhood of 3,500-4,000 fans — he’s expecting a large walk-up crowd — showed up to see the game; he even checked the long-range forecast and noted no precipitation was expected. 
   
Reserved seats start at $10, with center court seats going for $20 and a limited number of courtside seats available at $50.  Ticket reservations are being accepted by calling (575) 646-1420 or (888) 694-4849, or online at SantaAnaStarCenter.com .
