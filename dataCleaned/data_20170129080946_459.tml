<TEXT>
If you notice any errors in the below information please contact our Webmaster 40 Estimated low steel height of the SR 61 Bridge over the White River a level of more than 6 feet higher than any known flood 30 Record flood is in progress Possible concern about the former IPL Power Plant even though it is located above the 100 year flood plain Immense flood destruction to roads agricultural lands oil fields and river cabins Flood waters overtop any remaining agricultural levees Evacuation is necessary of people and livestock 27 A near record flood is in progress Water level is at a height approached in June 2008 and exceeded in January 2005 Evacuations are necessary River cabins are destroyed Great damage occurs to rural county road system State Road 56 begins to flood in the Bowman area Flooding may damage railroads Flood waters overtop almost all levees in the Petersburg area 26 96 During the Great June 2008 flood flood waters at the edge of SR 56 near Bowman US Highway 50 closed as record flood levels from Edwardsport area approached During the June 2008 flood less water came from the Shoals area than in January 2005 flood Shoals was above 5 foot higher during January 2005 and Edwardsport about 1 5 feet lower Not much heard from the Petersburg area but great agricultural damage and Dodge City probably cleared out 26 The Dodge City area floods extensively The January 2005 flood quickly passed this level and exceeded 27 5 feet Nobody remained in Dodge City The June 2008 and May 2011 floods also exceeded the 26 foot level 25 8 Near major flooding in progress During the May 1990 the town of Petersburg lost their main water line This problem is believed to have been corrected Seven floods since May 1990 have reached this level Levees are monitored at this level Numerous roads flooded Flood waters approach State Road 56 near Bowman Extensive flooding in Dodge City 25 01 A flood has exceeded this level each year since January 2004 6 out of 7 years since May 2002 and 10 times since May 1990 Of these 10 recent floods 7 of them have exceeded the 25 8 foot mark with the January 2005 flood the largest since January 1937 Prior to May 1990 one must go back to March 1964 for a flood above 25 feet and back to May 1961 for a flood over 26 feet The greatest known flood to strike the Petersburg area occurred in March 1913 25 A very significant flood is in progress Emergency flood fighting may be needed Evacuations would begin from river cabins in Dodge City Livestock must be moved 24 25 During April 2013 when Petersburg reached this level the water only reached the white line of SR 257 south of Washington but never closed the road Shoals only went to 11 67 feet during April 2013 This is the first that locals can remember such a high stage for Petersburg and SR 257 remaining open 23 5 Extensive flooding in progress with several bottom land roads flooded in Pike County in March 2011 Pike County roads flooded some by several feet of water east of SR 57 included CR 750N CR 600N and CR 1000E Pike County roads flooded west of SR 57 included River Rd CR 250W CR 400W CR 675N CR 700N CR 1000W CR 900W CR 700W and CR 775W 23 49 Water from the Great June 2008 Flood recedes from SR 257 south of Washington The river stage at Shoals was less than 10 feet and less than 14 feet previous day The Lost River was low except for backwater from the East Fork White during this entire flood event 23 Extensive flooding is progress affecting agricultural and rural residential areas Several rural county roads extensively flooded including Bottoms Rd Brothers Rd and E Governor Rd in Knox County A few residents may move out in an area locally known as Dodge City Several small oil fields are inaccessible During agricultural season much flood damage can occur High water isolates some river cabin residents 21 3 State Road 257 south of Washington began to flood during May 2008 after local rains of more than an inch on very wet soils with Petersburg at 21 3 feet and rising and Shoals at 15 5 feet and rising 21 01 During May 2008 and March 2011 flood waters recede from State Road 257 south of Washington when Petersburg was 21 feet and falling and Shoals slightly below 15 feet and falling During March 2011 White River was rising very slowly and Shoals dropped to 14 7 feet and was leveling off 21 Flooding affects higher bottomlands and may affect a few residents in an area known as Dodge City Local roads leading to Dodge City area are flooded State Road 257 south of Washington completely floods at this level if Shoals remains above 16 feet Ditch Road begins to flood 20 85 During June 2010 State Road 257 south of Washington began to flood at this crest level at Petersburg after Shoals crested at 18 19 feet About a week later Petersburg crested at 21 34 feet about one half foot higher but the water did not reach State Road 257 after Shoals crested at 15 59 feet about 2 5 feet lower Lost River did not contribute much water during this June flood and locally it was not extremely wet 20 5 County Road 250 West from State Road 56 floods and blocks the vehicle access to Dodge City During the March 2008 flood the river remained above this level from late afternoon March 19 through April 9 As mid March 2011 high water was receding SR 257 south of Washington reopened when Shoals was at 10 5 feet and falling steadily for the past 2 days 19 Low bottomlands flood and flooding begins on higher bottomlands State Road 257 may begin to flood if Shoals gage reading is over 17 feet Private levees may be overtopped in many cases 18 Lowland flooding begins to flood several Pike County roads Many of the following county roads begin to flood around this level east of SR 57 include CR 750N CR 600N and CR 1000E Pike county road subject to flooding west of SR 57 include CR 250 W CR 400W CR 675N CR 700 N CR 1000w CR 900W CR 700W and CR 775W 17 Flooding affects low agricultural lands low oil fields and closes Bottoms Rd Brothers Rd and East Govenors Road in Knox County In agricultural season farmers are concerned at this stage 16 Flooding affects agricultural lands 15 Agricultural land near the confluence of the
