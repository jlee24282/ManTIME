<TITLE>Exams are festivals, smile more, score more: Modi</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Focusing his attention on students appearing in their final examinations, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday asked them to consider exams as a festival and to refrain from taking short cuts like cheating. 
 
In his monthly radio address 'Mann ki Baat', Modi said relaxation was the most potent medicine for memory recall and urged the youths to write on social media about the bravery of the Indian soldiers who have been given gallantry awards. 

He said instead of being a reason of stress for the students, parents as well as teachers, exams should be an occasion for happiness. 

"For some, exam is a pleasure but for most it is a pressure. It is for you to chose between pleasure and pressure." 

"Those who will take it as pleasure will get more (marks) and those who take it as pressure will repent," said the Prime Minister, calling upon parents and guardians to create an environment of festivity during examinations. 

"Relaxation boosts your memory recall. When you are in tension, all doors get closed. It becomes a baggage for you. The biggest medicine for memory recall is relaxation." 

"A happy mind is the secret to scoring good marks. Smile more, score more," he said. 

Calling on students to compete with themselves rather than others, Modi said exams were not a benchmark of success. He also gave an example of Cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar in this regard.
