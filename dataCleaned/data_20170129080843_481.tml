Houston Invitational Full Results 

HOUSTON – Rice senior Katie Jensen highlighted day two of the Houston Invitational for the Rice Owls women’s track  amp; field team with a first place finish in the 3000m, breaking former Owl Lennie Waite’s previous meet record with a winning time of 9:26.80. 

Jensen, from The Woodlands, claimed the top C-USA Indoor 3000m mark of the season with a personal best time that translated to 9:21.99 (track adjustment) and is also ranked 17th in the nation. Jensen defeated the next closest runner by nearly 23 full seconds in the race, leading start-to-finish. 

In other distance events junior Elsa Racasan finished first in the 28-runner mile with a time of 4:56.61 (track adjustment of 4:53.61) and also currently holds the top C-USA mark. The Owls third winner of the afternoon was sophomore transfer Hannah Jackson , who won the 400m dash for a second straight indoor meet with a time of 57.08 (10th in C-USA). Jackson barely edged out sophomore teammate Bryanna Rideaux, who finished second in a time of 57.45. 

The Owls also performed well in the jumps with senior All-American Daisy Ding making her 2017 debut and finishing fourth in the high jump (1.65m/5-05.00) and third in the triple jump (12.33m/40-05.50). Senior Cybil Obiozor , who won the C-USA Co-Female Athlete of the Week award after the opener, improved upon her season-debut in the triple jump with a second place finish of 12.55m (41-02.25). 

After a strong performance on Friday, Ijeoma Ugwunze followed it up with a third place finish in the shot put (14.20m/46-07.25). 

“We improved from two weeks ago, which is what we needed,” Rice women’s track  amp; field head coach Jim Bevan said. “We had some great highlights today with Elsa dominating the mile, Ijeoma having a good day in the shot put and Hannah Jackson and Bryanah Rideaux going one-two in the 400m. Daisy started competing and scored high in the high/triple jump and Cybil improved her triple jump over two weeks ago and finished second. The biggest highlight was Katie Jensen dominating the 3000m, running a lifetime best and led from gun to wire. It was an extremely impressive performance. Now we can get into weekly rhythm of meets. 

On Friday the Owls received personal best performances from Dreu Dixson , Dheryl Batts and Ugwunze in the weight throw while Marielle Brisbois won the pole vault and Kylie Swiekatowski placed fourth in the event. 

The Owls will be back in action Feb. 3-4 when they compete at the Charlie Thomas Invitational in College Station, Texas.
