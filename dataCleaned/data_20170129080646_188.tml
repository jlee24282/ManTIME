<TITLE>Why am I still angry that Trump is our president</TITLE>
<TEXT>
A conservative friend told me he did not understand why I and so many others are so angry about this election. Why can’t we move on, and let President Trump govern. Here is my answer.Want to know why I am so angry that Trump is now our president? First and foremost, it has nothing to do with Hillary, Bernie, or any third party candidate. This has nothing to do with Republican, Democrat, or Independent. Just get that out of your head right now.I am angry because my friends, people I care about, people I thought I knew voted for a vile disgusting human being. It has nothing to do with policy, and everything to do with the man himself. If Trump had run as a Democrat, and agreed with me on every single policy position—I would not have voted for him based on character alone.He has mocked the disabled, and the handicapped. He was endorsed by the KKK. He ran on a platform of division and hate. He has an avowed racist on his staff, Steve Bannon, who has allowed Breitbart to be used as an outlet for “alt-right” propaganda. I have no doubt in my mind that Trump is a racist. It bothers me that my friends voted for a racist. There is no defense for that.He treats women as objects; you actually voted for a man who said that he could grab a woman by the pussy, he said this while his wife and newborn son were at home in New York. Better candidates have lost races for lesser things. He is a misogynist. If you think women should be treated in that manner, if you gave him a pass on that, you should be ashamed of yourself.His temperament—how can you trust a man with the nuclear codes who does not have enough self-control to not send a tweet at 3 AM disparaging the latest person who made fun of him, or pointed out one of his many lies? Speaking of lies, I was raised to always tell the truth. I have raised my son in the manner, now we have a president who cannot tell the truth—this is far beyond a normal politician’s lies. It isn’t just him, it is his staff too—alternative facts? Really? I will call it what it is—a fucking lie.
