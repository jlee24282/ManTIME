<TITLE>At Women March swarm of signs was a good sign</TITLE>
<TEXT>
By Today there is talk of a Muslim registry and deportations and walls and bringing back torture Bad signs all of them And I m not even out of bed yet The school bus won t roll by for another hour But in the few minutes that I ve watched the morning news this is what they re talking about And it s happening here in this country s capitol in a city where I spent this weekend and all that keeps going through my head is What have we done I went to Washington D C last weekend with two friends from school The three of us went to Orange County Community College together back in the late 80s a time when it seemed women had very little to complain about I mean we could go to college we could vote and drive and play high school sports There was even a woman finally on the Supreme Court Of course we had the benefit of timing Women like Gloria Steinem and Betty Friedan and Bell Hooks had changed the landscape for us and we were beneficiaries of their work and the work of generations before them For me being a girl was a breeze It gets harder of course being a girl Or well just being The world is bigger than the OCCC campus and the three of us Bridget and Nicole and I have collectively experienced many of the complications and conflicts that come with adulthood And womanhood So within days of Election Day as soon as word of the Women s March was circulating on social media Bridget booked us a room and we put in for days off from work and my Bella who is 15 alerted her teachers that she d be absent Friday because we d be heading to D C The March has been mocked in some circles that it was nothing more than a bunch of women who wanted to get out of the house Or that we re crybabies upset that our candidate lost Or that we re spoiled that we ve forgotten just how good we have it here that it could be a lot worse And besides who can even tell what the March was about every sign seemed to be about a different cause And that s true I saw them The signs were all over the place My body my choice and black lives matter and Trump likes Nickelback and water is life and immigrants we get the job done and repeal misogyny and Resist and women in the sequel and love thy neighbor and build bridges not walls There were rainbow flags and American flags and a Princess Leia was waving the flag of the Rebel Alliance Why was I there For all of it I could carry any one of those There was one sign though that I ll remember above the rest It was waved by a little girl with dark brown hair and she looked to be about 8 She was with her mom who was wearing a knitted hat of Rastafarian colors The little girl s sign quoted Albus Dumbledore and it said this Happiness can be found in the darkest of times if one remembers to turn on the light See There are good signs these days too lmjramirez hotmail com
