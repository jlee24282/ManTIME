NEW MARTINSVILLE — Magnolia girls’ basketball coach Tom Tisher knew early on this season that to be successful his team was going to need to learn as a team and come together quickly. 
 
After losing their first three games, the Blue Eagles have done just that, rolling off 11 wins in their last 13 games, including a great team performance Saturday afternoon against Bishop Donahue. 
 
Magnolia had three players finish with double-doubles and a fourth score double-figures and Big Blue took advantage of a whopping 55-22 rebounding margin to run-away from the Bishops late and post a 62-36 victory at the New Martinsville Rotary Challenge. 
 
“We have really done a good job learning as a team after losing our first three games,” Tisher said. “And now we are having to learn a little bit again after losing senior Autumn Cecil to injury a couple of weeks ago. 
 
“But the girls have been rolling together, and a couple girls have been forced to take on bigger roles and do more, and they have really come through in doing that.” 
 
While Coach Shawn Martin’s 5-12 Donahue squad struggled from the floor all day, the Bishops managed to find a way to stay close, hitting baskets when they needed them the most early on. 
 
Senior standout Kelsi Chapman, who scored 10 of her 15 points in the first quarter, got the Blue Eagles going, however, a pair of Cassidy Campbell 3-pointers and another from Josie Purpura at the horn, had the visitors within 13-11 after one frame. 
 
Magnolia, which had a pair of 3s in the first from Chapman, started dropping the ball inside in the second period, which was good news for freshman Kyndra Pilant, who scored 10 of her 15 in that period. Pilant, who finished with a game-high 20 rebounds, had already completed her double-double at the break. 
 
But while Donahue was only 2 of 16 from the field in the second, they were still within striking distance, down 28-20 at the half. 
 
A total of seven turnovers prevented Magnolia from getting any more separation in the third as the Eagles led 43-32 heading into the final eight minutes. The Bishops got their second buzzer-beating 3-pointer when freshman Abigail Martin beat the horn. 
 
The fourth quarter was a different story as Taylor Ludewig and Jordan Delaney each tallied six points to put them into double-figures and Magnolia used a 15-0 burst to pull away. 
 
“That first half we missed a lot of early shots, but Bishop Donahue had a lot to do with that,” Tisher said. “They have a nice team, but they are also going through an awful lot right now with their school situation. 
 
“I felt like we really regained our focus in the second half and that was the big difference for us.” 
 
While Pilant finished with 15 and 20 on the day, Chapman equaled her with a game-high 15 points while grabbing 13 rebounds. Delaney, who missed the final 6:16 of the first period with two fouls, finished with 12 points and 10 rebounds while Ludewig added 11 points. Logan Spencer, who has added a spark to the lineup with Cecil out, scored eight points and had four rebounds. 
 
Jewell Purpura had a team-high 10 points for the Bishops while Campbell finished with eight and Martin seven. Bishop Donahue was a mere 12 of 61 from the floor for just 20 percent in the game. 
 
“We had to miss 15 lay-ups in the first quarter,” Shawn Martin said. “If we make our lay-ups we would have been ahead in this game. We also forced some turnovers, but we just couldn’t finish. We talk about finishing all the time, and we are going to talk about it again before our next game. 
 
“As far as rebounding goes, we are not a very tall team, but we seem to get our hands on most of them, but we are not strong enough to pull them in and lose control of the ball. 
 
“But our girls played hard, Magnolia just did a better job of hitting their shots in the second half.”
