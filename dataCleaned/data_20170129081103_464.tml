<TITLE>Offensive but lawful</TITLE>

Should the federal government have the authority to deny legal protection to trademarks and service marks it finds offensive The debate is one that the U S Supreme Court has avoided for decades But recently in a case called Lee v Tam the justices heard argument on the question Let s hope they come out in favor of the First Amendment Lee v Tam involves the Slants a dance rock band from the Portland Ore area All the members are Asian American In 2011 the group filed an application to register its name as a mark The application was denied on the ground that Slants would be offensive to large numbers of Asian Americans The Trademark Trial and Appeal Board upheld the refusal but the U S Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed the decision The judges did not dispute that the mark was offensive Instead they ruled that the prohibition on federal registration of disparaging marks violates the First Amendment Trademarks are a form of expressive speech the panel wrote and the government cannot penalize speech because it happens to dislike the message It s plain that the band sees its name as a message Founder Simon Shiao Tam has explained that by naming his band the Slants he was attempting a reappropriation by which a group seizes control of a disparaging word or phrase and converts it to a term of pride Said Tam We want to take on these stereotypes that people have about us like the slanted eyes and own them The Patent and Trademark Office has developed a special test for a proposed mark that is found to refer to identifiable persons institutions beliefs or national symbols Registration will be denied when the mark s meaning may be disparaging to a substantial composite of the referenced group The best known example of the struggle over how to apply this test is the continuing litigation over the registration of marks owned by the Washington Redskins The ban on registration of offensive marks is largely a relic of the years after World War II when it was just one among many rules that the U S developed to enforce a certain public moral hegemony Many libraries refused to carry Invisible Man and The Catcher in the Rye It s time for a change We live in a different world now one in which the protection of speech has become considerably more robust True we also live in a world in which advocacy of censoring the offensive has become depressingly popular especially on the left What s striking about Lee v Tam is how different the support has been from the litigation challenging the Redskins trademark where much of the left has been siding with the mark s rejection Some supporters of the band struggling to thread the identity politics needle have argued that registration of an otherwise offensive term for an ethnic group should be permitted when the mark is used by members of the group Under this theory only outsiders should be unable to register the mark This approach would suggest for example that the Redskins mark would be fine if used by a Native American team And some Native American teams do use it But it s not at all an attractive solution The last thing we need is a Patent and Trademark Office that sorts applications according to the race or ethnicity of the applicant We re better off facing squarely the First Amendment issue raised by Tam s reappropriation Should the federal government have the authority to deny the privileges that come with registration because it dislikes the message a mark expresses Our answer should be a resounding no Stephen L Carter is a professor of law at Yale University Editorial on 01 29 2
