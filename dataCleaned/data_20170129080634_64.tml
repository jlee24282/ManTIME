<TITLE>Dave Solomon s State House Dome Offense taken by rep over wedding talk</TITLE>
<TEXT>
 A FAIRLY ROUTINE session of the House of Representatives ended on a tense note Thursday as Rep Marjorie Porter D Hillsborough the assistant Democratic floor leader raised an objection to comments made earlier in the session by Rep Kurt Wuelper R Stratham which she called offensive not only to me but to many other members of this body including our naturalized citizens Wuelper was speaking for the majority against HB 206 a bill establishing a special marriage officiant license that would authorize any individual to perform a single specified marriage This is something that recognizes people are being more creative in the ways they are getting married said State Rep Renny Cushing D Hampton using examples of a special uncle or best buddy from the service as possible officiants That best buddy or special uncle would have to apply for a one time license from the Secretary of State to conduct the wedding and turn that license in to the town clerk along with the marriage license after the ceremony In explaining committee opposition to the measure which failed 204 158 Wuelper cited the concern of town clerks who worried about getting the proper paperwork The question we thought was well what if anybody could do it emphasis on ANYBODY What if someone from I don t know Oregon or Bothwasswana Botswana or Zambia could come and perform a ceremony What s the chances we could have more problems and the marriage not be officially recognized Porter alluded to this time of powerful rhetoric in reacting to Wuelper s presentation For four terms now I have served in this honorable House and I have always been proud of our decorum she said However today during one of the floor speeches I heard words and tone of voice that was offensive not only to me but to many other members of the body including our naturalized citizens who are here as part of our House Ironically Wuelper s comments came as Welcoming New Hampshire was setting up for its State House Day and luncheon for lawmakers in the State House cafeteria The event focused around the work the organization is doing for the immigrant community in the state Speaker Shawn Jasper R Hudson said Porter s points were well taken and he apologized to the House He said he missed that portion of Wuelper s remarks because he was being distracted by another House member at the time We have to be mindful of what we say and how we say it Jasper said According to Porter it was not only what Wuelper said but how he said it You can watch the video of the session on the State House website and come to your own conclusions but she characterized his tone as uncharacteristically scornful and arrogant for the House The Speaker apologized and I accepted his apology she said Porter said she was motivated to speak up by recent events I think when we re seeing things like the signs that were posted in Manchester recently and the things that have been happening at Jewish community centers around the country and seeing racial slurs and ethnic slurs tweeted out or said out loud we have to speak up Wuelper said at first he didn t even know Porter was alluding to his remarks When I heard her say that I had no idea what she was talking about he said I was just thinking of places that are far away It has nothing to do with anyone When asked about the Speaker s apology Wuelper said I m not sure his apology was for what I said as much as it was for his not noticing it which the Speaker s office confirmed Edelblut hearing set The Executive Council has set the date for its public hearing on the nomination of Frank Edelblut to be the next commissioner of education Edelblut the second place finisher in the GOP primary for governor is likely to face some tough questioning from Democrats who have already raised concerns about his lack of experience in education administration He has the support of conservative organizations such as Americans for Prosperity and Cornerstone Action The hearing is scheduled for 1 p m on Tuesday Jan 31 in the Executive Council chambers at the State House More on marijuana While most of the debate in the Legislature on marijuana up to this point has focused on expanding the state s therapeutic cannabis law measures that call for legalization or decriminalization will be up for debate on Wednesday Feb 1 HB 215 creating a study commission to consider legalization and regulation of adult use will be heard at 10 a m by the House Ways and Means Committee HB 640 which calls for decriminalizing possession of one ounce or less and reducing the penalty from a misdemeanor to a violation punishable by fines ranging from 100 to 350 will be heard by the House Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee in Representatives Hall at 1 p m along with HB 656 HB 656 also calls for legalization and regulation but includes home cultivation of six plants with 70 percent of tax revenues dedicated to property tax relief and 30 percent to the Alcohol Abuse Prevention and Treatment Fund which is also used for drug abuse treatment Saying no to home rule Opponents of high voltage transmission lines such as the Northern Pass or the Seacoast Reliability Project were dealt a setback in the Legislature on Wednesday as the Committee on Municipal and County Government voted unanimously to kill HB 145 a bill to give cities and towns authority over utility line expansion projects It would have prohibited high voltage transmission lines from being located in any municipality without a vote of approval by the municipality The vote to recommend killing the bill was unanimous according to Jim Belanger R Hollis It provides one town veto power over what the two towns on either side of it want he said Also it establishes home rule and New Hampshire is not a home rule state Cities and towns in New Hampshire have no power other than what is granted by the state Legislature through enabling legislation dsolomon unionleader com
