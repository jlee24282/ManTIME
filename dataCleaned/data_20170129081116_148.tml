<TITLE>Apostle Johnson Suleman: Hate Pastor should face full wrath of the law</TITLE>
<TEXT>
General overseer of Omega Fire Ministries Worldwide, Apostle Johnson Suleman, has successfully thrust himself into the limelight like he has always craved.  
Pastors and "Men of God" in Nigeria are a curious breed. 
 
They wear the best suits, ride in luxury cars, reside in exotic homes, spew fake prophecies every other December and threaten fire and brimstone on just about everyone. 
 
Here's a caveat--not all Nigerian Pastors fit the above description.

But there are those whose laps need to be sat on so that they can show you a level of grace you do not understand, those who ask Church members to "kill him and spill his blood on the ground", those who say "if it is your will to break Nigeria, God, break it now!", and those who, like Apostle Suleman, pronounce that the Kaduna Governor, Nasir El-Rufai, will die and that Church members should kill any Fulani herdsman they see . 
 
"I told my people that any Fulani herdsman you see around you, kill him", Apostle Suleman commanded from the comfort of his pulpit recently. "I have told them in the Church here, around this premises, that any Fulani herdsman that just enters by mistake and wants to pretend, kill him...kill him!!! Cut his head!!! 
 
"If they are busy killing Christians and nothing is happening, we will kill them and nothing will happen".

And then he mimics someone else: 'Enh, Pastor why are you saying they should kill somebody?' 
 
Suleman's answer came from Suleman: "Didn't David kill Goliath? Was that spiritual? Many people in Kaduna are now homeless, are now orphans, are now fatherless...because some people think they own power. KILL THEM! 
 
"Are we Christians? Yes! Are we believers? Yes! You can't be widows, you can't be widowers, because of some devilish people that say they have a religion..."

Jesus Christ must have been turning in heaven. His message of love and not returning an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth, was being trod on in Kaduna, North of Nigeria. 
 
For his reward, Suleman was guest of Governor Ayodele Fayose of Ekiti State the week after clips of his hate sermon went viral. 
 
It had to be Fayose. 
 
Fayose would spend some 10 odd minutes eulogising the Pastor for always speaking truth to power, before a crowd of crusade attendees. 
 
While in Ekiti, DSS (Department of State Security) operatives made to quiz Suleman, but he rang the Governor who immediately came to his rescue. 
 
When he's not flaunting his well tailored suits on the altar, he can be a scared man who has State Governors on speed dial. 
 
Apostle Suleman has promised that Nigeria will burn if he spends a day in the custody of security operatives. 
 
He's been invited to appear at the DSS office in Abuja on Monday, January 30, 2017. 
 
Latest news reports say Suleman has planned to storm the DSS office with as many as 30 lawyers.

“Suleman will be appearing before the DSS with about 30 lawyers because we believe that his persecution has become politicised,” one source told Punch newspaper. 
 
Who would have thought that Apostle Suleman will ever call on the services of lawyers? What does a man who can burn Nigeria down with just his tongue, need 30 lawyers for? 
 
Why would a man who charges his followers to call on God when they are in trouble, call on Governor Fayose to help him when he landed in trouble? 
 
No one loves what is happening in Kaduna. There's been a breakdown of law and order in the South of that State for more than 30 years now and it's time the genocide is brought to a halt.

We can't pretend like majority of the persons being killed in Southern Kaduna aren't Christians. We can't pretend like majority of the homes being set ablaze do not belong to persons who aren't Muslims or who aren't from the North of Nigeria. 
 
But you don't solve a crisis of that proportion by inciting hate from the pulpit. You don't solve a crisis that has dragged on for this long by taking the laws into your hands and asking the flock to go rogue.

The last thing a nation sitting on dangerous fault-lines like in Nigeria's case needs, are sermons that ask one religion to pick up arms against the other or slay every herdsman; even those who are going about their business as peacefully and legitimately as possible. 
 
Christianity has never been a movement of violence, even though across the world, there's that temptation from the Christian community to pick up arms and go on the rampage. 
 
The Church is built on a bastion of love, tolerance and sobriety. 
 
Hate preaching has burnt down whole countries, led to loss of lives and limbs, led to the holocaust and anti-semitism and led to the election of a demagogue and lunatic into the White House. 
 
Imagine what will become of Nigeria if every Pastor orders all Christians to cut off the heads of herdsmen across the country?

Apostle Suleman and his band of hate-preaching, fire-belching clergymen--whether they are Imams, Alfas or Pastors--do not belong in our country. They do not belong in our world. 
 
And we should be brave enough to remind them so, whenever they go down this dangerous path. 
 
Suleman should be charged by the State and prosecuted in accordance with the laws of the land, if only to serve as some deterrence. 
 
Hate preachers aren't wanted in Nigeria.
