<TITLE>New Mr. Clean commercial cleaning up before Super Bowl</TITLE>
<TEXT>
(MEREDITH) – Commercials. For 364 days of the year, we pause, fast forward, or skip right over them. But one day – Super Bowl Sunday – is the one day everyone stops to watch them, laugh, and comment on their favorite.

This year, Mr. Clean is getting a head start, and well, let’s just say this isn’t your grandfather’s Mr. Clean. The video was posted on Jan. 26 and in only two days, has amassed more than 1 million views. How? Why? Find out for yourself.
