<TITLE>'Raees' team to celebrate success without alcohol</TITLE>
<TEXT>
The team of "Raees" -- which features Shah Rukh Khan as a bootlegger and has liquor prohibition as the backdrop -- will ironically celebrate the movie's success with a party sans alcohol. To celebrate the occasion, the film's team, along with Shah Rukh, will gather on Monday here. It being January 30 -- Martyr's Day that marks Mahatma Gandhi's assassination -- it also happens to be a dry day, said a source close to the filmmakers. Producer Ritesh Sidhwani of Excel Entertainment said in a statement: "The entire team is very happy with the critical acclaim and audience reaction to the film. It has been a perfect combination. It seems that all efforts have come to fruition."
