TRUMP Supporters Overrun Shia LaBeouf s He Will Not Divide Us Live Feed Today I went down to see the He Will Not Divide Us exhibition put on by Shia LaBeouf Unfortunately Shia couldn t make it He was arrested after attacking a pro Trump onlooker There are two jokes here the first being that the anti Trump protestors are far more violent and aggressive than the pro Trump fascists as they call patriotic Americans that they are protesting So it would be safe to say that these protestors are dividing us more than anything else I mean Shia was arrested for attacking one of us that does not only sound like they are not doing anything productive it also seems like liberals are actually losing their minds since President Trump s inauguration The second joke here is as you can see from the video there were more pro Trump people at Shia s exhibit than protestors There was pizza Smash Mouth songs and even Sam Hyde made an appearance Sam Hyde for those of you who don t know recently had his hit Cartoon Network Adult Swim show Million Dollar Extream canceled because of faux liberal outrage after he was outed as a Trump supporter Below are two videos I recorded via FaceBook Live please excuse the way I was holding the camera it works better for Facebook Live but worse for YouTube uploads Video 1 embedded content Video 2 embedded content
