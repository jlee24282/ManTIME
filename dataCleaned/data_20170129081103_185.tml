<TITLE>Flappy Bird Developer Is Back with Yet Another Addictive Mobile Game</TITLE>
<TEXT>
If you didn't know, Dong Nguyen is the name of the person who created Flappy Bird mobile game, an incredibly addictive title that made headlines years ago. After the success of its first game, Nguyen is back with another title that promises the same level of addiction, but slightly less impossible gameplay mechanics. 
 
Ninja Spinki Challenges is far more polished than Flappy Bird, a game launched back in 2014, and, as mentioned earlier, less challenging to those who played and loved Nguyen's first game. 
 
The new title is in fact a collection of six different games types , which is available on both the Android and iOS platforms. All six feature the same formula that made Flappy Bird so addictive: erratic controls, avoid obstacles. 
 
However, Nguyen adds a new element that seems to be the main theme of all six games: shooting stuff. Playing as a ninja rookie, you'll have to complete a series of challenges during a supposedly training session. Your main task is to hit various targets with a shuriken while avoiding cats and cannon fire. 
 Choose endless mode for the ultimate Flappy Bird-like experience  
To make things slightly more difficult, the challenges are timed-based, so you will also be able to see how long you can survive the cats onslaught. As soon as you complete a challenge, an endless mode will unlock. 
 
During the endless mode , you can play as long as you want assuming you can survive the bouncing cats and cannon fire. Obviously, the longer you survive, the higher your score will be. 
 
Although the game starts easy, so that everyone can get a sense of the game's controls, Ninja Spinki Challenges becomes more difficult as you progress. 
 
It's also worth mentioning that while the game is available for free, it does come with ads, but they are smartly implemented. So, if you fail a challenge, you can opt to continue from where the timer left off by watching a 15- or 30-second video ad.
