<TITLE>Turnovers, poor shooting doom Troy women</TITLE>
<TEXT>
TROY – A cold start and mistakes at the end of the game handed the Troy women’s team a rare 68-65 loss to the Georgia State Panthers Saturday at Trojan Arena. 
   
Troy (14-6 overall, 7-2 Sun Belt Conference) entered the game with six consecutive victories over the Panthers from Atlanta. A 20.8 percent effort from the field in the first half put the Trojans down 30-20 at halftime, and the Panthers converted six fourth-quarter turnovers into six points in holding off Troy. 
   
“We are in a shooting slump right now. Anybody who was at the game could see that,” Trojans head coach Chanda Rigby said. “Because of that, people are running back in the paint in a zone defense. Even though we got the ball close to the goal, we still missed some shots.” 
   
The Trojans entered the game on a two-game winning streak despite shooting just 34.1 percent against Arkansas State on Jan. 21 and 33.8 percent against Georgia Southern Thursday. The Panthers employed a 2-3 zone, something Rigby said was an anomaly for them, to counter the Trojans. 
   
“They picked up on the fact we haven’t been shooting the ball well, and they came out and played the exact zone we’re struggling with,” Rigby said. “When they go to a zone, they usually go to a 1-2-2.” 
   
The Trojans missed their first 10 shots from behind the arc and were just 2-of-18 from deep in the first half. While Rigby said the shot selection did not disappoint her, she said her team must find different ways to attack the zone. 
   
“The coaches have to find a breath of fresh air, a different way to score on a zone,” Rigby said. “We have to get some things going to the basket more rather than just rotating the ball looking for shooters.” 
   
Despite the struggles from the floor, the Trojans possessed a 51-50 lead after three quarters of play. 
   
Troy found itself down 46-34 after a 3-pointer from Astaja Tyghter with 4:13 left but closed the quarter on a 17-4 run to seize the lead. During the stretch, Daleville’s La’Tia Fils-Aime’ and Amanda Mendoza had five points each, while Caitlyn Ramirez had four. 
   
“We just kept telling each other ‘One possession at a time,’” Ramirez said. “Stop and score – that’s something we do in practice all the time. We have to get a stop, turn around and get something positive out of it. We’ve just got to keep pushing through.” 
   
Troy pushed the lead out to 53-50 on a Ramirez basket early in the fourth quarter, but the offense stagnated with a few turnovers. Georgia State also converted two of the mistakes into four points, building a 56-53 lead on a pair of free throws from Jada Lewis. 
   
Mendoza tied the game at 58 on a trey with 5:25 left, but Georgia State scored eight of the next 10 points to take a 66-60 lead with 1:29 left. The last basket came when Lewis stole the ball from Troy and drove in for an easy layup. 
   
Troy had 21 turnovers in the game. 
   
“We’ve come out with wins with 21 turnovers,” Rigby said. “That’s a little more than we like, but when you play fast-paced sometimes there are more turnovers.” 
   
Still, Troy had chances to tie or win the game down the stretch. Ramirez made 1-of-2 free throws with 16 seconds left to cut the deficit to 66-65, and the Trojans forced a turnover on an inbounds play. 
   
Jayla Chills drove inside for a shot attempt but missed. Georgia State’s K.K. Williams rebounded and secured the win with a pair of free throws on the other end. 
   
Tyghter led the Panthers with 19 points, while Lewis followed with 18. Kierra Henry chipped in 15. 
   
Ramirez tied her own Troy Division-I record with 20 rebounds to accompany her 18 points. Mendoza chipped in 14 points.
