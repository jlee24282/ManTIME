<TITLE>A day in court: Landlords and tenants negotiate before eviction</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Everyone in Courtroom A on Wednesday was there for the same reason: an eviction notice. 
 
One tenant was there because he was between jobs and couldn’t pay rent on time. Another said her housemate didn’t pay her half of the rent. A third tenant purposely withheld her rent because parts of her roof had caved in and the landlord didn’t make repairs. 
 
All three — and more than a dozen others — received eviction notices, the common thread that brought them to the Deschutes County Circuit Court, along with landlords, property managers and attorneys. 
 
“We’ve got a really big docket today,” Justine Kenyon-Benson, a court supervisor, told the group. 
 
The week before, on Jan. 17, 16 landlord-tenant suits were filed with the court — more than any day in 2016. 
 
Court documents show that a majority of the tenants were accused of nonpayment of rent. 
 
According to court records, more than 323 landlord-tenant civil suits have been filed since Jan. 1, 2016. Since 2011, there have been more than 500 of those suits, and more than 3,500 eviction cases. 
 
Those are just the cases that make it to court. There’s no way to keep track of the evictions that renters comply with because those never make it on a courthouse calendar. 
 
Almost all of the renters in the courtroom on Wednesday admitted that they didn’t pay on time. In most of these cases, the law was on the landlord’s side. 
 
But even when it isn’t, tenants often don’t know. 
 
“Landlords and management companies typically know the system better, and they have better access to financial resources,” said Mark Peterson, a retired Portland attorney who specializes in landlord-tenant law and has been involved in cases all over the state. “Tenants don’t realize that they may be able to get a lawyer, and a powerful adversary can steamroll you. I’ve seen tenants settle on terms that were terribly unfortunate for them.” 
 
There were two options, Kenyon-Benson explained to everyone who showed up to court: mediation or trial. For the three or four tenants who weren’t present, an automatic judgment was filed in favor of the plaintiff. 
 
Mediation is an option the Deschutes County Circuit Court offers landlords and tenants in these kinds of disputes. Instead of going straight into court, a court-provided volunteer mediator gives the parties a chance to come to an agreement without a court ruling. 
 
“The relationship between the parties in these cases is usually one where there’s not a lot of trust,” Peterson said. “The mediator can help the two to speak. In most cases if the parties can settle then they can have a better shared result. A mediator can help people get past personal hurts.” 
 
Letting a judge decide comes with risks. If a judge rules in a landlord’s favor, an eviction will go on the tenant’s record. And in a rental market like the one in Central Oregon, with a vacancy rate hovering around 1 percent or less, an eviction can be devastating for a renter. Also, in an eviction case, a judge doesn’t make a ruling on rent owed — only who has a right to the property. A landlord typically won’t be able to recover any money lost from the verdict. 
 
“Trained mediators can save a lot of people from going to trial, where there’s typically a loser and a winner or sometimes just two losers,” Peterson said. 
 
According to statistics kept by Deschutes County Circuit Court, 23 mediators volunteered 493.5 hours during the 2015-2016 state fiscal year. 
 
On Wednesday in Courtroom A, everyone agreed to mediation. 
 
Mediation works out differently for different people, depending on their situation. 
 
For Brad Johnson, a 20-year-old who was between jobs and couldn’t pay his December rent, it allowed him to stay in his apartment, which is managed by local property management company PLUS Property. But there was a cost. 
 
“I didn’t want to have to go to trial because I knew there would be fees, and we both knew I was going to pay the rent, it was simply a matter of us getting it extended,” he said. “Me and (PLUS Property) knew what we were there for.” 
 
Johnson said he had called PLUS Property when he knew he wasn’t going to be able to pay on time and it agreed to let him pay late, with a $75 charge. But when he received an eviction notice the day after rent was due, he called again. 
 
“They were like ‘Oh, you just have to go to court on the court date and we can extend it,’” he said. “They didn’t tell me service fees were going to be there.” 
 
The deal that came out of Johnson’s mediation with PLUS Property allowed him to continue living in his apartment under his 12-month lease as long as he paid the $1,050 in rent he owed, plus fees. These included $79.99 for the court filing fees associated with the eviction notice, $40 to cover the cost of the time for a PLUS Property representative to be in court, and a $75 charge for the late rent. 
 
Lawnae Hunter, who owns PLUS Property, said that her company sends eviction notices — even in instances that a prior agreement is reached, like in Johnson’s case — so that the court can be involved with the agreement. She said that if a tenant doesn’t have a history of paying rent late, or is facing an unusual set of circumstances, such as losing a job, her company usually tries to work out a payment plan instead of evicting. 
 
“The court system is such that you have to get into mediation with a written agreement,” she said, adding that her company always chooses to mediate. “So we start with an eviction notice. You have to get it into the system, in case (tenants) don’t do what was agreed.” 
 
As for the fees, Hunter said they’re necessary because her company is representing a property owner that has costs and is paying to file in court. 
 
“We bill hourly rates, and it costs me more than $40 an hour to send someone over there,” she said. “We keep that fee low.” 
 
Jaquita Harrison, 22, is a tenant with a different story. Harrison lives at Mountain Glen Townhomes with her 3-year-old daughter and a housemate. But when the housemate, who works in childcare, couldn’t pay rent, Harrison said she didn’t have enough to cover the gap. 
 
After mediation, Harrison agreed to move out by Friday. 
 
“I went in and basically discussed what’s going to happen,” she said. “The property manager basically said they want the property back because I’m always late on rent. But I’m always late because I get paid on the 10th and the 25th. I could’ve paid the rent right there in court, and she told me no. I’m a single mom. I have other bills. I can’t pay it on the 1st or the 5th.” 
 
The mediation agreement that Harrison and Mountain Glen Townhomes signed gave Harrison 10 days to move out. She had asked for 30. 
 
“I don’t know where me and my daughter are going to go,” Harrison said. “I can’t be homeless with her because it’ll get her taken away from me — it’s cold as hell outside. I work full time and she goes to school. I hardly get to see her as it is.” 
 
A representative of Mountain Glen didn’t return calls for comment. 
 
Michela Estrada’s story is different as well. The only tenant who came to court with a lawyer on Wednesday, Estrada came away from mediation with an arguably better deal. 
 
The reason Estrada had come to court in the first place was because of the weather. In December, one of the snowstorms caused parts of her roof to collapse. 
 
She contacted PLUS Property Management, which manages the house she rents, to discuss the damage, but repairs were slow in coming. 
 
Hunter, the owner of PLUS Property, said that she’s not surprised about that delay. 
 
“We had a hard, hard time getting roofers throughout the big storm,” she said. “I couldn’t get a roofer at my own house when my garage ceiling is caved in. There was a waiting list.” 
 
Estrada withheld her January rent because of the lack of repairs, and PLUS Property sent her an eviction notice. 
 
“Your average landlord is a typical property owner — one or two rentals — and they don’t have a large budget for massive leaks and snowstorms,” said Joseph Harder, the attorney who represented Estrada. “They should always plan for it — they own these properties as an income-generating source, right? Snowstorm hits, roof caves in, no budget, and landlords are in a tough spot. They want to wait for the insurance to pay for it, but the bad thing is they have a tenant in there, and that’s their home. So it needs to be taken care of quickly. It’s hard for both.” 
 
Estrada’s court date arrived after living for a few weeks in a home with caved-in ceilings and a damaged interior, and also racking up a large utility bill because of increased heating costs. 
 
While most of the mediations that took place that day lasted an hour or so, the negotiation that took place between Harder and PLUS Property stretched on for about four hours. Harder said the deal that was ultimately negotiated was certainly preferable to Estrada having to move out, or being allowed to stay but having to pay a full month’s rent for a caved-in roof. 
 
“We ended up negotiating it,” Harder said, adding that Estrada had agreed to pay half of the rent she owed by Friday. “(Estrada) wanted out, so we negotiated a way out of the lease, and now it’s month to month. The landlord is paying for a portion of the cost increases because of the extra heating, and they agreed to waive a portion of rent and get on the repairs immediately. Probably a pretty good resolution for everybody.” 
 
Hunter agrees, adding that Estrada most likely didn’t need a lawyer to come to that agreement. 
 
“Mediation is available to everybody,” she said, noting she wasn’t familiar with the specifics of Estrada’s situation. “(Estrada) didn’t need a lawyer, she would have ended up with the same result. Our response would have been the same even if she didn’t have a lawyer.”
