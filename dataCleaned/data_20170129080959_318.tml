A BBC investigation has revealed the extent of knife crime across the UK.

Figures show that a knife or blade was used in a crime every 16 minutes on average last year.

The number of incidents involving machetes has risen by more than 60% over the last three years in England and Wales - that is according to Freedom of Information request responses from just over half of police forces.

Knife crime across England and Wales is up 11% in the last year and nearing levels of five years ago.

The Home Office says knife crime remains below levels in 2010 but it recognises there is more to be done.

The BBC's Ed Thomas visited Liverpool to meet people who say they carry knives every day.
