<TITLE>Letter Thanks to Women s March organizers Chico police</TITLE>
<TEXT>
On Jan 21 I had the good fortune of attending the Chico Sisters March in downtown Chico The event was extremely well organized and very well attended by the entire community of Chico I appreciated that my town took the opportunity to peacefully express themselves regarding basic human rights and the direction we d like to see our country move toward In addition to the march organizers I would also like to thank the Chico Police Department for its efficient road closures as our enormous crowd moved through downtown Chico I came away from the march inspired to get more involved politically and believe or not somewhat hopeful about our future It was a wonderful day spent with individuals who value mutual respect kindness and the health of our planet Thank you again Kerry V Quevedo Chico Advertisement
