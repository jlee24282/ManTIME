<TITLE>Student extorted $28,000 from teacher he was having sex with, police say</TITLE>
<TEXT>
It’s unclear whether Sandy Doan ever suspected the real source of the threatening blackmail messages on her cellphone, but for nearly a year, investigators say, she dutifully obeyed the texts, leaving thousands of dollars at drop-off locations across Dallas.

In return, the person on the other end of the phone said, he wouldn’t tell authorities about the math teacher’s illicit affair with a student.
