<TITLE>Omaha's Stothert-Mello mayoral race looks to be competitive, costly</TITLE>
<TEXT>
This year’s mayoral election is shaping up to be an expensive, hard-fought race, with Mayor Jean Stothert starting the year with nearly $1 million in the bank and challenger Heath Mello drawing contributions from some of Omaha’s biggest-name business leaders. 
   
In total, Stothert has raised about $1.5 million in preparation for the May 9 election, and Mello has raised about $530,000, according to their 2016 end-of-year reports. 
   
Each of them has raised more than any previous mayoral candidate at this point in the election cycle, and it could become the most expensive Omaha mayoral race ever. 
   
The totals show Mello, a former state senator, is a credible challenger, said Randall Adkins, a political science professor at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. 
   
“I think it’s shaping up to be a competitive mayoral race,” Adkins said. 
   
In the officially nonpartisan race, Stothert is a registered Republican and Mello a Democrat. 
   
But Mello’s list of donors includes several Republican business leaders who have been involved with controversies at City Hall, such as bringing a potential multisport complex to the city and Omaha Performing Arts’ role in a planned headquarters for HDR Inc. 
   
Mello also has garnered support from more traditional Democratic donors, including unions, two former Democratic mayors and former legislative colleagues. 
   
Stothert, too, has her fair share of donations from big Republican names, including donor Charles Herbster, Gov. Pete Ricketts and Ken Stinson. Her donor list also includes several Omaha construction and development-related companies. 
   
Stothert said her $1.5 million fundraising total since the 2013 election exceeds her campaign’s budget for the entire election. But she said she’s not going to stop fundraising. 
   
“I think it shows a lot of support, and I’m very grateful for the people that donated to my campaign,” she said. 
   
Mello said he expects to spend about $1 million overall. 
   
“We’ve got a long way to go still in this campaign, and we’re working hard every single day to expand our support,” he said. 
   
Of the money he’s raised, almost $190,000 was carried over from his legislative campaign committee. 
   
Mello said his support from the business community is an endorsement of his leadership style, saying donors are drawn to his consensus-building. 
   
But Stothert said Mello’s donors are simply an indication that she’s had to say no to people — even potential donors — during her four years in office. 
   
Adkins, the political science professor, noted that there are still several months to go before the May 9 election. 
   
Mello’s business support “demonstrates that there is some interest in the business community in seeing a change in the mayor,” Adkins said. “How much of an interest there is, we’re still going to have to see. I don’t think we’re at the point yet where we really know that.” 
   
Adkins said donors don’t like to give money to those who don’t have a chance to win, so Mello’s fundraising shows that donors believe he’s a quality challenger. 
   
The fundraising totals are good for Stothert too, Adkins said. He said it’s a good sign for her that she’s amassed a war chest of more than $890,000. 
   
“If an incumbent can raise a lot of money and they don’t have to spend it, that’s a pretty good sign,” he said. 
   
The campaigns’ 2016 year-end reports are due to be made public Tuesday, but the campaigns provided their figures to The World-Herald last week. Stothert filed her report Saturday. 
   
Stothert’s report includes all of her donations for the past year. 
   
During 2016, Mello ended his legislative campaign committee and formed a new committee for mayoral election fundraising. 
   
Many of Mello’s top donors last year were Republican business leaders who have had high-profile clashes with Stothert. 
   
He received $25,000 each from Omaha Performing Arts Chairman John Gottschalk and local businessman Dana Bradford. 
   
There are no limits on the amount of campaign contributions in Nebraska state and local political races. 
   
Bradford, executive chairman of Waitt Brands, declined to say why he donated to Mello. 
   
Gottschalk, a former publisher of The World-Herald, said it’s a contested election and he thinks Mello deserves support. 
   
“All the money is essentially to put him in a position where he’d be competitive,” Gottschalk said. 
   
He declined to elaborate or say why he preferred Mello over Stothert. 
   
Other big-name businessman donors to Mello include Mike Yanney, who gave $16,000 and is the co-finance chair of the campaign, and Mike Cassling, who gave $5,000. 
   
A handful of donors gave to both, including Walter Scott, chairman emeritus of Peter Kiewit Sons’ Inc., and Rod Yates and Frank Krejci, who are behind the potential redevelopment of Crossroads Mall. 
   
In a statement, Yanney said he decided to support Mello to bring a new leadership style to City Hall. 
   
He said Mello is “a proven leader who has built consensus to pass balanced budgets and landmark legislation around economic development initiatives and public-private partnerships in the Nebraska Legislature.” 
   
Yanney, founder and chairman emeritus of the Burlington Capital Group, had previously donated to Mello’s legislative campaigns. He did not return a phone message last week. 
   
Mello said he attributes the support to “our record of tackling big issues in the Legislature and helping make significant progress on economic development and public-private partnerships. That’s given my candidacy much more broad appeal than people realize.” 
   
Stothert, though, attributed that support to the fact that she had denied requests from many of those business leaders. 
   
In particular, regarding Gottschalk, Bradford, Cassling and Yanney, Stothert said she’s had to make “difficult decisions” and tell them no. 
   
“When I made those decisions it was always in the best interest of the Omaha taxpayers,” she said. “That’s the price of leadership.” 
   
Particular disputes include: 
   
» Gottschalk was the chairman of OPA last year when the performing arts group asked the city to acquire three buildings near the Holland Performing Arts Center. That land would go to the arts group for future expansion, and the group would turn over a nearby parking lot to HDR Inc. for the company to build a new downtown headquarters. 
   
Stothert agreed to direct the city to buy the buildings. But she declined to tear down the century-old buildings in order to make room for the expansion, which would have been unpopular with preservation groups and others. 
   
The arts group backed out of its request for the buildings, and the deal to bring HDR downtown eventually fell apart. The company’s headquarters will be in Aksarben Village instead. 
   
» Bradford served as the chairman of the Metropolitan Entertainment and Convention Authority, a nonprofit that oversees the city-owned CenturyLink Center and TD Ameritrade Park. Stothert was highly critical of MECA under Bradford’s tenure, saying the group needed to release more information to the city about the facilities’ operations. (Bradford gave Stothert’s campaign $5,000 in 2013 after she took office.) 
   
» Cassling is a former top donor to Stothert, giving her $33,000 between 2012 and 2014. He heads an initiative to bring a multisport complex to the Omaha area. The facility was initially planned to be located in Tranquility Park. That deal fell apart, at least partly, Stothert said, because the group asked for $20 million in city money. The group pulled out of Omaha and later decided to build in La Vista. Cassling, who also serves on the OPA board, did not return a phone message last week. 
   
» Yanney’s daughter, Lisa Roskens, is involved in the multisport project. Yanney and his wife, Gail, also led a campaign to raise money for what is now the Fred  amp; Pamela Buffett Cancer Center. As a council member, Stothert voted against a 3 percent tax on tobacco sales across the city to help fund the center, but the City Council ultimately approved the tax. 
   
Stothert said she’s received donations from well-known Democrats, including developer Jay Noddle and restaurateur Willy Theisen, both MECA board members, as well as John Kotouc, executive chairman of American National Bank. 
   
Noddle gave $10,000, according to her report, Kotouc gave $5,000, and Theisen gave $2,500. 
   
She also received a $2,500 contribution from David Slosburg, another board member of OPA. 
   
Mello said Kotouc gave his campaign $1,000 this month, which is after the deadline for this campaign finance report. 
   
About Mello’s Republican donors, Stothert said: “Some people aren’t used to being told no. It’s much easier to say yes. I still think the right answer was no in these cases. If they’re angry about it, so be it.” 
   
Said Mello: “I’m the leading challenger who has a vision for the city, running against a mayor with no vision.”
