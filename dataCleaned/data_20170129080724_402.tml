<TITLE> CIA assessed Rajiv assassination 5 yrs before he was killed </TITLE>
<TEXT>
Five years before Rajiv Gandhi was killed in 1991 the US Central Intelligence Agency had prepared a very detailed and thorough brief on what would happen if he is assassinated or makes an abrupt departure from the Indian political scene A 23 page report titled India After Rajiv was put out as early as in March 1986 for comments from other senior CIA officials The sanitised report was declassified recently by the Central Intelligence Agency CIA The report whose complete title is not entirely available as it is part deleted was prepared on the basis of inputs available to the CIA till January 1986 The very first sentence of the report s available undeleted page reads Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi faces at least an even chance of assassination before his tenure in office ends in 1989 It however later clearly said that assassination is the major near term threat to him Over five years later Gandhi was assassinated at Sriperumbudur in Tamil Nadu on May 21 1991 The first section titled Key Judgments analyses and deliberates upon what likely scenario would emerge in the domestic and international political situation if there is a sudden change in leadership minus Rajiv Gandhi and the likely impact on India s relations with the US the then USSR and the region It also dealt with the threats posed to Gandhi s life by various extremist groups at that time and the likely fallout of his murder If Gandhi fell to a Sikh or Kashmiri Muslim assassin widespread communal violence probably would erupt even if strong preventive security measures including deployment of Army and paramilitary troops across northern India were taken by the Indian President deleted it said Interestingly it also names P V Narasimha Rao and V P Singh who could be the interim successor and likely candidates in case of sudden exit by Rajiv Rao took over as the Prime Minister in 1991 In a section titled The Threat of Assassination Stability in Jeopardy the report says In our view there is at least an even chance in the next several years of an assassination most likely by extremist Sikhs or disgruntled Kashmiri Muslims who have targeted Rajiv besides a fanatical Hindu Since a significant portion of this section is deleted it is not clear whether Sri Lankan Tamil extremists were also dealt with in the analysis However another section deals in depth with Rajiv s mediation efforts to resolve the conflict between militant Sri Lankan Tamils and the Sinhalese dominated government in Colombo More This article has not been edited by DNA s editorial team and is auto generated from an agency feed
