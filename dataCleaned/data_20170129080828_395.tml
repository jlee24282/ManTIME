<TITLE>Letter: Trump's Orwellian tactics</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Sometimes we “,” said President Donald Trump’s White House press secretary Sean Spicer. “The party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. It was their final, most essential command,” wrote novelist George Orwell in his book "1984."

After incorrect or un-provable statements made by Donald Trump and some White House aides, sales of George Orwell's "1984" book are soaring.

“Thank you for calling the White House comments line. The comment line is currently closed, but your comment is important to the president and we urge you to send us a comment online at www.WhiteHouse.gov/contact or send us a message through Facebook messenger.” Trump has banned the public from calling the White House.

Now that Donald Trump has won the presidential election, the committee investigating the Benghazi embassy attacks have conveniently decided their services are no longer needed; it was all a Republican witch hunt to attack Hillary Clinton and waste millions of taxpayer dollars.

In an ironic twist, Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, promising to lead the investigation of Hillary Clinton, is now under fire himself for use of an illegal private email server.

Republican lawmakers in five states propose bills to criminalize peaceful protests, the freedom of speech.

We are witnessing the beginning of tyranny.
