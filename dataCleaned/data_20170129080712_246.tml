<TITLE>Inaugural trip eyewitness to history</TITLE>
<TEXT>
By David Bradley Publisher and Editor It s not often you get to see international history in the making especially when it s the pomp filled induction of the new leader of the free world That s why my wife Suzy and I jumped at the chance to see up close the inauguration of the 45th president of the United States Donald John Trump Our Missouri senator Roy Blunt made the event happen for us Most senators are allocated two guest tickets to witness the ceremony from the presidential platform on the west wing of the U S Capitol As chairman of the congressional inaugural committee and emcee of the event Blunt earned a few extra tickets to this coveted seating We showed up at 8 a m Jan 20 at the Russell Senate Office Building after going through three security checks An hour and a half later we were marched through the passageway to the west wing of the Capitol We were escorted through the same Capitol corridors as the president elect and partially blinded by television lighting for the incoming elite At the threshold and steps down to the outside we saw a sea of people below stretching back to the National Mall and nearly to the Washington Monument The crowd seemed a little rambunctious quite understandable after the country had endured a long divisive campaign season We took our assigned seating about 50 yards from the presidential dais Then for the next hour the parade of dignitaries were announced one by one as they came to the Capitol steps Before they walked down bugles blared from the upper platform overlooking the main stage The members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff The justices of the U S Supreme Court The entire Senate Governors from many states including newly elected Missouri Gov Eric Greitens Several Trump Cabinet nominees All received polite applause After a few moments of silence intensity grew as the announcer presented past presidents The 39th President Jimmy Carter and First Lady Roslyn first appeared to a strong ovation The 42nd President Bill Clinton escorted his wife Hillary and received bigger applause The audience showed their appreciation for the former first lady s appearance after her bitter battle with Trump I m sure some feel she was fulfilling her duty to help reunify the country Then 43rd President George W Bush and First Lady Laura were presented Bush gave a broad smile and embraced several onlookers as he and his wife found their seats Next came the brood of President elect Trump with all onlookers intensely curious about them More silence and then the crowd erupted as First Lady Michelle Obama walked to her front row seat Incoming First Lady Melania Trump next mesmerized the crowd in her gorgeous powder blue dress Next to last the 44th President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden received a warm welcome as they marched together to their seats Finally you could almost feel the shift of power as President elect Trump appeared at the Capitol threshold He walked slowly to the front of the stage gave a few handshakes and then paused for a warm two handed embrace with his predecessor A joyous roar from the masses below swelled up to our platform as Trump waved and gave a thumbs up Emcee Blunt conducted the ceremonies with precision He gave a historical perspective to the event dating back to Thomas Jefferson s inaugural in 1801 Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer a New York Democrat spoke from a different viewpoint about the duties of president and after a few minutes got some ridicule from the audience shouting Trump Trump The ceremony was laced with a multitude of prayers from religious icons such as Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York and the Rev Franklin Graham of North Carolina As it began to sprinkle rain Graham reminded everyone the Bible teaches us rain is a blessing implying the same with the election of Trump We had a moment to chat with Graham afterwards about the strong support needed for Israel After his swearing in conducted by Chief Justice John Roberts President Trump gave a forceful talk about returning power to the people and snubbing the Washington elite Democrat or Republican Depending on the pundit observers of his speech graded it from masterful to the worst ever But he left no doubt about his underlying philosophy As expected afterwards the streets of the nation s capital were filled with mostly civilized antagonism The big exception was the arrest of more than 200 anti Trump people in one area after vandalizing nearby buildings Some locked arms trying to prevent people from their destinations But most were peaceful leaving the Trump supporters to have their joyous celebration We left the next day at the front end of the Women s March on Washington thankful to return to the quiet confines of Missouri To see an orderly transition of power is becoming a rare occasion in this turbulent world We felt lucky to witness it David Bradley is chairman and CEO of News Press Gazette Co and publisher and editor of the St Joseph News Press
