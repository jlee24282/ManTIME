<TITLE>Rick Astley Closes iHeart80s Party With Greatest Hits Performance (VIDEOS)</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Following back-to-back wistful performances by New Kids On The Block , Eddie Money , Starship , and more at the iHeart80s Party, English singer-songwriter Rick Astley concluded the show with a performance of his greatest hits Saturday night. 
 
Astley kicked off his set with a classic rickroll , leading the fans at SAP Center to believe that he was going to open with " Never Gonna Give You Up ," but instead performed his Whenever You Need Somebody single " Together Forever ," before going into " Strong Strong Man ." In between performances, the '80s icon, who turns 50 on February 6, made self-deprecating jokes about his age and blamed it for his lack of dance numbers, and asked fans to do the two-stepping for him during " She Wants to Dance With Me ."

Following back-to-back performances of energized hits, Astley slowed things down with his single " Angels On My Side " off his 1991 album Free . Before he concluded his set with his world-conquering cut "Never Gonna Give You Up," he performed the first few verses a cappella to make sure fans were prepared to sing along.
