<TEXT>
WASHINGTON â€” President Trump is directing the Pentagon to boost the size and strength of military forces while cutting unnecessary programs, according to a draft of an executive order obtained by The Washington Post.

The order would require Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to conduct a wide-ranging review of military readiness within 30 days that includes the fight against the Islamic State, the Post reported.
