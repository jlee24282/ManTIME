<TITLE>SOUPer Bowl warms up patrons on a chilly day</TITLE>
<TEXT>
By Dan Boudreaux Staff Writer  
Cooler weather returned to Houma just in time as the United Way for South Louisiana kicked off its annual SOUPer Bowl charity cook-off Saturday. 
 
With rows of tents set up in the parking lot of the Courtyard by Marriott in Houma, local businesses and groups whipped up their best soups, bisques, chilis and gumbos to raise money for the United Way for South Louisiana and to vie to for the coveted first place trophy. The event charged $5 for a wristband that allowed attendees to go to the various booths and a coin that allowed people to vote for their favorite dish. 
 
"The turnout's been fabulous," said Ashlee Champagne with the United Way for South Louisiana. "We have new sponsors this year, but it's great that the public has really come out today." 
 
Over 100 people were milling about the Marriott parking lot, trying out the various samples from the 24 teams that were vying to be this year's supreme soup chef. Along with different soups, drinks and baked goods were for sale, charity raffles were being held, and the band, Pot 2 LA, played an eclectic mix of energetic and fun music. 
 
At only one hour into the event, some of the competitors had completely run out of samples. Ampol Services had made 10 gallons of its smoked brisket chili and still ran out so fast that the cooks said they didn't even get a chance to eat any of it. 
 
"We only got to try it when we were cooking it," said Barry Champagne. 
 
Some interesting twists on the definition of soup were handed out at the event, too. Along with red bean gumbo and apple pie soup, the soup that won the "Fan Favorite" award was Synergy Bank's "souptini." It was a loaded baked potato soup served in a disposable martini glass with a Parmesan crusted pig in a blanket on a toothpick instead of the traditional olive. The team also provided free tropical virgin martinis in an area of tables it set up next to its booth. 
 
"The marketing department came up with it," said Missy Hutchinson with Synergy Bank. "They're really creative." 
 
Christine Martin, who attended with her granddaughter, Brelynn, said she had been coming to the event since the very first SOUPer Bowl and said the crowd was "fantastic." 
 
"It's at least tripled in size since the first one and it's fabulous," Martin said. "You feel like you're at a fair with all these people." 
 
A first for the event was the 5K run that started before the SOUPer Bowl at 9:30 a.m. The race had 50 runners participating and the trophies, which depicted little running chefs in honor of the cook-off, were provided by Grand Isle Shipyard Inc. The winner of the race was Matt Kelso, who said it was more than just a race. 
 
"It's a great little event for a great cause. It's not about winning a race, it's about helping the community," Kelso said. 
 
As the event began winding down, the coins were counted and the winners were announced. 
 
In third place was Sonoco with its smoked turkey and green onion sausage gumbo. In second place was Terrebonne General Medical Center with its seafood bisque. And in first place was GSES/Workforce Logistics with its crawfish and smoked corn soup. The team, named Team "No-Tell," was made up of head chef Joey Rogers, Randy Steib, Maria Chaisson and Eddie Doiron. 
 
"This is our first year participating and only our second year here and it feels great," said Steib after his team won. "We made soup great again." 
 
All proceeds for the event went to the United Way for South Louisiana.
