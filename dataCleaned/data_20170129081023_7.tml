<TITLE>Northwoods League returning to Dubuque in 2019</TITLE>
<TEXT>
The Northwoods League has come a long way since the Dubuque Mud Puppies struggled to make a go of it two decades ago at Petrakis Park. 
 
In two years, Dubuque baseball fans will have the opportunity to see just how far. 
 
The non-profit Dubuque Area Youth Baseball and Softball Club on Saturday announced plans to bring a Northwoods League franchise to its proposed 30-acre, five-diamond complex located between Derby Grange Road and Asbury Plaza. Fundraising for the $5.5 million project will begin immediately, and Yoko said the group will seek corporate sponsors, private donors and other potential grants and awards. 
 
Following a business model similar to the non-profit Dubuque Community Ice  amp; Recreation Center, Inc., the complex will serve as the home base for the local Protect Our Nation’s Youth organization, with the Northwoods League franchise serving as the marquis tenant in a 1,500- to 2,000-seat stadium. The high-profile of the Fighting Saints and the United States Hockey League played a pivotal role in the development of the Mystique Community Ice Center from a small facility to a 3,000-seat arena prior to the 2010-11 season. 
 
“The ice arena has made our community a better place to live because it’s created so many more opportunities and things to do, and we believe this project will do the same thing from a baseball perspective,” said Greg Yoko, one of the organizers of the Dubuque Area Youth Baseball and Softball Club. “Just like the Fighting Saints have been a great asset to the community, the Northwoods League franchise will do the same.” 
 
The 20-team Northwoods League, which features top NCAA Division I underclassmen competing in a setting much like the professional minor leagues, has blossomed into the largest collegiate summer league in the United States. Last summer, the Madison Mallards led the league in attendance with an average of 6,039 fans to 34 home dates, while the league average hovered around 1,700. 
 
Under the Dubuque proposal, the new Northwoods League franchise will lease the stadium from the non-profit group and manage the complex. 
 
“As a non-profit group, we have a hard time every year finding parents to volunteer their time to sell team sponsorships, sell outfield signs and raise money,” Yoko said. “That’s not what we do for a living. We just want to play baseball. A Northwoods League franchise understands the business of selling sponsorships and revenue enhancements a lot better than we do. Hopefully, that includes securing a business or individual who sees the benefit in having their name attached to our project.” 
 
The PONY League, which annually averages 600 players of all abilities ranging in age from 4 to 18, currently leases three diamonds at the Derby Grange Golf  amp; Recreation facility but has been scouting locations for a permanent home for more than two years. The league initially hoped to relocate to an 80-acre area along West 32nd Street but drew opposition from neighbors concerned about traffic, lighting and noise. 
 
The PONY League plans to initially lease the land from current owners John and Sally Jo Herrig with the intent of purchasing it before the end of 2019. 
 
“I applaud the group for having the tenacity they’ve shown in getting this project off the drawing board,” said Keith Rahe, the president and CEO of the Dubuque Convention  amp; Visitors Bureau, who also understands the business of organized baseball as a long-time member of the Field of Dreams Ghost Players. “Finding the necessary funding isn’t easy, but the addition of a Northwoods League-type stadium is a huge part of any success. The Northwoods League has been very successful over the last decade or so, and their business model certainly works. 
 
“The Northwoods League is nothing like what Dubuquers remember from the Mud Puppies. Having worked with a lot of those franchises through the Ghost Players, it’s amazing how well some of these franchises do.” 
 
And the new team won’t have to look far for business advice. 
 
“The Fighting Saints are a perfect example of, if you have the right organization that’s well run, people will get behind it and support it, not only as fans but from a financial standpoint,” Rahe said. “It’s great entertainment and another thing to do to enhance the community.” 
 HISTORY IN DUBUQUE  
The Mud Puppies joined four other franchises — Rochester, Minn., and the Wisconsin communities of Kenosha, Manitowoc and Wausau — when the Northwoods League opened for business in 1994. But the minor league business model never took off at Petrakis Park, a facility more suited for recreational use in the McAleece Sports Complex, so the franchise relocated to St. Cloud, Minn., for the 1997 season. 
 
“We’ve both changed a lot since then. Dubuque has changed, and obviously, we’ve changed,” said Dick Radatz Jr., the chairman of the Northwoods League. “We were kind of in our embryotic stage at that point, and we were still trying to figure ourselves out. Obviously, we’ve grown substantially since then, and our business model has proven itself. 
 
“Nothing against Petrakis, because it has served a purpose to the community for many, many years. But we wouldn’t consider a venue like that now. It was necessary at the time, but it’s awfully difficult to create the kind of minor league environment you need to make this work from a business standpoint.” 
 
The Northwoods League will begin its 24th season in 2017 with 20 teams in two divisions. Despite humble beginnings, it has evolved into the largest collegiate summer league in the country and, because of its business model patterned after professional minor league baseball, the most widely attended. 
 
Its footprint ranges from Thunder Bay, Ontario, in the north to Waterloo, Iowa, in the south and from Bismarck, N.D., in the west to Battle Creek, Mich., in the east. In addition to Madison and Waterloo, Dubuque could develop natural geography rivalries with teams in LaCrosse, Wis., and Rockford, Ill. 
 
“We were pretty big dreamers when we started the league, but this has developed into way more than even we envisioned,” Radatz said. “It’s been quite a journey, and we had a lot of ups and downs in those early years when Dubuque was involved. Lately, fortunately, we’ve had a lot more ups than downs.” 
 
Despite its previous struggles and lack of a suitable stadium, Dubuque has been on the league’s radar for several years. And Radatz believes it could follow in the footsteps of Kenosha, which departed the league in 1998 but returned in 2014 and finished third in attendance with an average of 2,514 fans last season. 
 
“They’re both communities that couldn’t survive for one reason or another back in the early days but we believe can thrive now,” Radatz said. “Just as our league has grown a lot since those early days, Dubuque has grown, too.” 
 
LaCrosse Loggers general manager Chris Goodell, a former honorable mention all-state baseball player at Oelwein (Iowa) High School who played at the University of Dubuque under Dennis Rima in the late 1990s, said his organization would jump at the opportunity to operate an expansion franchise in Dubuque. 
 
“We’ve been poking around Dubuque for the last couple of years, and we love the market,” Goodell said. “There are a lot of similarities between LaCrosse and Dubuque in terms of the size of the market, the rich baseball history and the fact that the economic development group has a lot of positive, forward-thinking things going on. And we love the fact that, geographically, it fits perfectly within the footprint of our league, which will keep costs down. 
 
“The league is drastically different now than it was when the Mud Puppies were in Dubuque. There’s so much more stability in it, and it really fits in well with the Midwest style of life. That explains why you have someone like me who has stayed in the league for the past 18 years.” 
 
LaCrosse entered the Northwoods League in 2003 and immediately developed into one of the league’s top draws. The Loggers built the Lumberyard at Copeland Park and have developed it over the years to suit growing needs. 
 
“It doesn’t take long to figure out that there are good organizations and those that just don’t get it, and the Loggers are definitely one that get it,” Rahe said. “They’ve developed quite the atmosphere, and to have them as the main draw of a complex like the one in Dubuque brings a level of importance to the project.” 
 
Goodell believes his organization could hit the ground running in Dubuque. 
 
“We have 15 years of experience, so we have the knowledge and the wherewithal to have success with our model,” Goodell said. “We live and breathe baseball, and this is our main thing. There wouldn’t be any kind of learning curve, like you’d have with a new organization. We could come in and engage with the community right away.” 
 CALIBER OF PLAY  
Reed Stumpf loves the idea of the Northwoods League returning to Dubuque. 
 
The University of Dubuque senior pitcher spent the last month of the 2016 season with the Wisconsin Rapids Rafters and helped the team win its first Northwoods League playoff championship in franchise history. 
 
Stumpf, a former Dubuque Hempstead standout, appeared in six regular-season games and went 2-0 with a 2.45 ERA and six strikeouts in 11 innings of work for the Rafters. The reliever earned a victory in his only postseason appearance, striking out four and not allowing a run in four innings. 
 
“It was an experience I’ll never forget, because the environment, the atmosphere and the level of play was exactly like what you could expect if you were playing professional baseball,” said Stumpf, one of the rare NCAA Division III athletes to earn an opportunity to play in the Northwoods League. “So many of the guys who played in the league last year will be playing pro ball in the next couple of years, and the Northwoods League is great preparation for that. 
 
“The talent level was unbelievable. You had elite college players who were so smooth and so advanced, and the community really embraced it. It’s something Dubuque doesn’t get to see right now, so I’d love for the city to get a franchise.” 
 
The Northwoods League has proven to be fertile proving ground for future Major League Baseball players. Jeff Weaver, who played for the Mud Puppies in 1995 and won a World Series with the St. Louis Cardinals in 2006, became the first Northwoods League graduate to reach the big leagues in 1999, and 162 players have followed suit. The Mud Puppies produced two other big leaguers, Shawn Sedlacek and Robb Quinlan. 
 
The list of Northwoods League graduates includes Juan Pierre (Manitowoc), Curtis Granderson (Mankato), Andre Ethier (Rochester), World Series MVP Ben Zobrist (Wisconsin), National League Cy Young winner Max Scherzer (LaCrosse) and Chris Sale (LaCrosse). 
 
“Every team is loaded with high-end talent that you’re going to be seeing in the big leagues in a few years,” Goodell said. “Because they’re still amateur athletes and we don’t have to pay salaries, we can keep the ticket prices very family friendly. It’s a great opportunity to see the up-and-coming talent at an affordable price before they make it.” 
 
The Northwoods League environment advances the careers of more than just the players. Stumpf said several of his University of Dubuque classmates have served sports management internships with Northwoods League franchises. 
 
The typical Northwoods League franchise employs up to 10 full-time staff members and several dozen seasonal workers. 
 NEED FOR STADIUM  
Last season, the Loggers played just 36 home games at the Lumberyard in LaCrosse. Local colleges, high schools and American Legion teams accounted for the other 184 games at the one-diamond facility. 
 
Yoko expects the stadium diamond at the proposed complex to experience similar usage. 
 
“The facility won’t be exclusive to the Northwoods League or the PONY League,” Yoko said. “Obviously, the No. 1 reason for us doing this is to have a place to play, and we will have priority as far as scheduling goes. But we really want this to be a community amenity that enhances the quality of life in Dubuque. 
 
“We want it to be so much more than just a baseball facility.” 
 
For years, baseball visitors to Dubuque have complained about the lack of quality facilities. The county’s top diamonds reside in the outlying communities of Cascade, Dyersville, Farley and Peosta. 
 
“Having a nice baseball facility is huge for Dubuque,” Rahe said. “We definitely need that. I’m a baseball guy, and from a fan’s perspective, I really love this.” 
 
Yoko said plans for the complex include a walking/biking trail as well as park-like amenities, such as playground equipment, to make it a more well-rounded recreational outlet. It will also include ample concessions and restroom facilities. 
 
Yoko hopes the complex can include a display honoring the Dubuque County Baseball Hall of Fame and the local history of the sport.
