<TITLE>Fabregas Different faces do well</TITLE>
<TEXT>
There were plenty of young Chelsea footballers playing alongside Cesc Fabregas in Saturday s FA Cup win and it was their contribution and the team s overall commitment that earned the Spaniard s praise after the game The three open play goals that preceded Michy Batshuayi s penalty in the 4 0 win over Brentford were scored by the more senior Willian Pedro and Branislav Ivanovic but Nathan Ake back from loan joined fellow Chelsea Academy products Ruben Loftus Cheek and Nathaniel Chalobah in the starting line up Fantastic by Ake was Fabregas s rating of the 21 year old who was initially at wing back before moving into the back three Since I have been here he has trained with the team in pre season and I have always felt that he is a fantastic young player It is great that all of the young players showed what they can do in games like this and also winning which is important for getting the confidence because it is not easy We are only playing in the Premier League and the FA Cup so it is not easy to have minutes in this team but it was good that a lot of them could have minutes in this game and show the manager what can happen if he needs them Fabregas pointed out that the team could have done better in certain aspects against the Championship side but that is why such games are so beneficial for fine tuning the squad and there was no danger of complacency from the Premier League leaders If memories of defeat against Bradford who were similarly 2 0 down at the Bridge in the same round two years ago were not enough other cup upsets this weekend were a clear message It is better to learn from other teams mistakes like what happened to Liverpool and we saw that said Fabregas It is a big lesson before you go onto the pitch that you have to give 100 per cent There were a lot of different faces for this game but a professional job We did well we gave it all and we are pleased Next up it is our turn to take on Liverpool We have three days to prepare well and I am sure the manager and the team will do the best we can to prepare for what I hope will be a fantastic game and a win for us
