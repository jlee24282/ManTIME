<TITLE>Frampton wants Santa Cruz trilogy after losing WBA featherweight title rematch</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Carl Frampton has called on Leo Santa Cruz to complete the trilogy with a final showdown in Belfast after losing his WBA featherweight title in Las Vegas Frampton was beaten for the first time in his career on a majority points decision at the MGM Grand as Santa Cruz regained the belt he lost to the Northern Irishman in July Santa Cruz is open to the idea of a decider and Frampton wants the fight in his backyard I hope so I hope he is a man of his word and we can do it in Belfast he said on Sky Sports 1 I have come to the States twice We could do it four five six times I hope we do it again I am deeply disappointed but let s have a trilogy and have our names linked together forever and hopefully I can win 2 1 One judge scored the contest at 114 114 but the other two gave it 115 113 in Santa Cruz s favour and the Mexican took a deserved victory It was a smart performance by Santa Cruz who improved immeasurably from the first bout in New York last summer and his tactics shocked Frampton I think it was the right decision I thought it was close the Northern Irishman added He frustrated me at times I didn t expect that game plan the boxer got out boxed by the brawler I thought it was the right decision I hope we can do it again it was a close fight I have got no excuses I feel I want to say sorry I feel like I have let everyone down The best man won on the night I am gutted It was my fault Santa Cruz admits he had to fight against his instinct as well as Frampton I worked hard and did what I had t he said I fought a great fighter and let s make a third fight He is a great fighter and a great counter puncher It was tough to change my style in my head I wanted to go for it but I was told to box him and that s what I did I am a man of my word We are both great fighters we deserve it and let s go again
