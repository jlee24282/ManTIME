HAGEN HOPKINS MONIQUE FORD Fairfax NZ MONIQUE FORD Fairfax NZ HAGEN HOPKINS PHIL WALTER KEVIN STENT Low attendance figures are sure to be heavily scrutinised as the Wellington Sevens tournament is reviewed New Zealand s Sione Molia attempts to beat the defence of Argentina s Lautaro Bazan Velez in the fifth place play off match at the Wellington Sevens Argentina won 17 12 Fiji fans cheer on their team against New Zealand on day two of the Wellington Sevens 2017 Fiji won 26 10 Ellen Stewart of Scotland cheering Scotland to victory 14 12 in the quarterfinals against England Vilimoni Koroi of New Zealand beats the tackle of Andrew Durutalo of USA which the home country won 24 12 Philip Snyman of South Africa is tackled in the match between South Africa and Japan which South Africa won 33 0 on the opening day Room to move at Westpac Stadium at 2 15pm on Day One of the Wellington Sevens 2017 1 of 7 Previous Next The future of the Wellington Sevens could be known within the next month after a weekend of disappointment at Westpac Stadium The host team and defending champions were beaten into sixth place on Sunday as only about 10 000 people each day turned up for what used to be Wellington s biggest party Sevens general manager Steve Dunbar admitted the crowd numbers were disappointing and believed a decision over the tournament s future would be made soon Sevens general manager Steve Dunbar believes the future of the Wellington event could become clear within the next three or four weeks I think we would have a pretty good sense within the next three or four weeks I would ve thought Westpac Stadium chief executive Shane Harmon said the tournament was successful at an operational level but the elephant in the room was that there were not enough people A crying shame Sevens fans at the Westpac Stadium on Sunday could be the last to see the event held in Wellington There s going to be no knee jerk reactions made and New Zealand Rugby has already said they ll do a review over the next couple of weeks but it is fairly clear that if what we see out there today is going to be the future well it does clearly call the event into question I m pretty pragmatic about it You know it s the time of the year where we look at it purely as a business there s a lot of events around But it s been such an iconic Wellington event we still want to hold it and if we can turn it around we d like to be part of that Westpac Stadium chief executive Shane Harmon said the tournament went well from an operational perspective but poor crowd numbers were a worry for organisers New Zealand Rugby executive member Nigel Cass will host a conference call with media on Monday morning to outline the parameters of its looming review of the tournament However Dunbar insisted the process was standard practice We go through a review with all the Wellington stakeholders the council with the economic development agency with the stadium with Wellington Rugby who are our partner in the tournament We ll look at the things that went well we ll look at the things that we could be improving on and go from there TWO MORE YEARS New Zealand Rugby still has two years left of a three year licence with World Rugby to host the sevens but Dunbar said it was possible the tournament could be moved to another New Zealand centre World Rugby own the series they give hosting rights to New Zealand Rugby New Zealand Rugby then make recommendations about what city their tournament is held in At the end of the day it s World Rugby s decision They will decide but things need to work well for them and their measures are broadcast viewership and sponsorship It needs to work well for New Zealand Rugby We have different financial risks and it needs to work well for the city as well ROOM FOR OPTIMISM We will get together with the key Wellington stakeholders within the next two weeks We ll have to have a chat to World Rugby we ll have to start to mop up the numbers and that can take a while as you d imagine for a tournament of this size Comment was sought from World Rugby but Stuff was told nobody was available Harmon however remained an optimist I still think there s a future for sevens in Wellington The question is is there enough interest in sevens rugby in New Zealand That s the one thing we have got to explore
