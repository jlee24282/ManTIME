<TITLE>Joey Wignarajah: First step to improve core state services? Change the rules on how taxes are considered</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Recently, Rep. Monroe Nichols, D-Tulsa, introduced a bill that could end the state’s continuous revenue failures that total in the high hundreds of millions of dollars each year.

House Joint Resolution 1003 asks lawmakers to give voters the chance to change how revenue-related bills are approved. Revenue bills require either a three-fourths supermajority and the governor’s signature or a statewide vote of the people to become law. If approved, Nichols’ bill would ask voters to return the requirement to pass revenue bills to a simple majority vote of each chamber and the governor’s signature. This bill is not only smart from a policy perspective; it is an important first step in improving core services in the state.
