<TEXT>
Renovation work has altered the plans for the Capital Region s largest fashion show produced each year by Electric City Couture Universal Preservation Hall where the show is typically held in April in Saratoga Springs will be under construction in late spring According to the campaign manager Teddy Foster UPC will be shut down until the fall of 2018 for construction Work is expected to cost around 5 5 million and will be a complete restoration of the building with the aim of making the venue a year round facility So instead of one large show the ECC is working to produce four smaller shows throughout the year When ECC producer Corey Aldrich first found out about the construction he attempted to find another venue and stick to the tradition of having one spring show But to match the magnitude that we had last year we couldn t relocate Aldrich said As a result he and the ECC team are reinventing their schedule Nothing is set in stone yet but Aldrich is contemplating holding one show per season in various locations across the Capital Region the Berkshires and even New York City Formed in 2010 ECC which was formed in 2010 works to create a sustainable fashion industry market in the upstate area and to bring attention to local talent Last year the show took in 17 000 for the designers 30 000 for charity 10 000 for the creative employees of ECC and 10 000 for food and beverage vendors Combined the show brought in between 80 000 90 000 in 2016 Everyone should benefit from it we want to support our local artists and designers Aldrich said One of the 10 designers who sent looks down the ECC runway had their entire collection purchased by a local boutique For other designers a handful of their pieces were purchased by local stores and it helped them to gain some name recognition Giving the local fashion scene a bit more credibility is another goal of the ECC Lately they ve not only gained credibility on a local level but on more populated stomping grounds with an exhibit in New York City Artist and designer Vilma Mare who has worked with ECC in years past is showing her collection called Creating Beauty that Protects It s a reflection of the personal aspects of politics and Lithuanian heritage The pieces are exhibited at the Consulate General of Lithuania 420 5th Ave No 304 New York NY 10018 until Feb 14 The last day of the exhibit is actually during New York s Fashion Week so we re going to try to get people to go to it from Fashion Week as well Aldrich said Amidst finding other venues for their other shows the ECC will have plenty of other things to keep it busy Aldrich said that the ECC will most likely also take part in Troy s Steampunk Festival this summer with a fashion show The organization participated last year and had a large turnout
