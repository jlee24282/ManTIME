<TITLE>Driver dies after car bursts into flames in Hwy. 101 crash, CHP says</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Update, 8:30 p.m. 

A 55-year-old man was killed Saturday afternoon when his car crashed off Highway 101 and burst into flames in Paso Robles, according to the California Highway Patrol . 

The man, who has not been identified, was driving a Shelby Mustang south on Highway 101 about 1 p.m. when his vehicle crashed off the road near the Highway 46 West off-ramp, a CHP news release stated. 

The vehicle rolled several times down an embankment as it caught fire, becoming “fully engulfed” by the time it came to a stop on its wheels, the CHP said. 

Witnesses attempted to remove the driver from the car, but the fire’s intense heat and the driver’s four-point harness prevented the rescue, the CHP said. 

The driver was pronounced dead at the scene. 

As of Saturday evening, the CHP said it had not determined how fast the vehicle was traveling, and an investigation was in progress.
