Scholar Department of Mechanical Engineering CBIT Hyderabad Telangona India Abstract The present technique in automotive industry is to change their Sedan cars into Hatch back or vice versa instead of manufacturing an entire new car thereby decreasing the manufacture and cost of the production The major goal of this operation is to do external navigation visual of Sedan and Hatch Back car models containing similar front view by applying computational technique on 1 40 reduced scaled car model and dimensions are 0 4m wide high and 1 6m length respectively The Sedan car is measured down model of the existing car while the Hatch Back car model is newly manufactured such that both the car models have similar front view The 3D computational technique was maintained by using CATIA V6 as the modelling technique ICEM CFD as the pre processor meshing process and ANSYS FLUENT as the calculator and ANSYS CFD POST as the post processor Computational outcomes support that Sedan car is more streamlined and nagivagated efficiently as compared to that of newly manufactured Hatch Back car model Though both car models have similar front view Hatch back car model has nearly 3 6 percentage more Drag Co Efficient as compared to that of Sedan car model This can be defined as Hatch Back car which considers Sedan car by putting front area same can develop the Drag Co Efficient of 3 6 percentage Key Words Sedan version Hatch Back version drag co efficient CFD I INTRODUCTION External navigation design of car models has suggested automotive industry in decreasing the drag force operation on the cars over the years Even though drag force operating on the car bases on various variables such as drag co efficient projected front view velocity at which the car is running and the environmental condition in which the car operates density variable it s only the drag co efficient times the front view of the car that can be cared 1 So manufacturing of the cars help in declining the drag co efficient of the cars thereby decline the drag force In modern days automotive industries have implemented a new configure of changing their most successful sedan car version into hatch back version and vice versa where both the cars have similar front view This donates a sense of relaxation for external navigation design engineers where they keep at most pressure in developing fuel efficient and economical cars The automotive companies can invest their money in manufacturing the rear part of the car instead of manufacturing an entire new car where the cost would be more and also the external navigation design engineers will not concentrate on the aesthetics of whole car as it is sufficient to concentrate only at the rear part thereby declining manufacture time and price Also need of CFD equipment and high end featured computers has suggested automotive industries in declining the investment price on cars and also to convert maximum usage of modelling and design equipment to get essential corrections in the geometry of the cars thereby getting actual cars will be secure and infection free before the actual production Bhagirathi zala et al 2013 2 in their research compared 1 21 decreased measure Sedan and Hatch Back car versions by practical analysis The research presented that Sedan car version was more navigation as compared to Square Back car version and had a drag coefficient value 43 lesser than the Hatch Back car version The computational task maintained by having Bijlani et al 2013 3 also supports that Sedan car version is more navigation than Hatch back car version by 43 It is stated from the literature studies that most of the road vehicle external navigation study work has been concentrated either on Sedan cars or bluff equipment such as bus and only a few works has been noticed on the external navigation studies of Hatch Back cars Though there are some works worked on the external navigation comparison of Sedan and Hatch Back cars 3 5 there is no work noticed on the direct comparison of Sedan and Hatch Back cars containing similar front view by computational technique Since each car designing company has its own design language and it s not a good idea to compare two different points of cars i e Sedan and Hatch Back cars of various make company to come into a conclusion that which among them is better unless any of the geometric variable is put study state in the current work front view is put constant II COMPUTATIONAL TECHNIQUE Computational technique was managed for both 1 40 measured down Sedan and Hatch Back car versions containing similar front view Sedan car version was made to see geometrically same to commercially existing Sedan Car while Hatch Back car version was newly analysed by correcting the 2 D background of the similar Sedan car version Both the car versions were versioned such that they contain similar front view but different only at the rear state i e one is versioned as Sedan car version and other as the Hatch Back car version Geometrical version was generated using CATIA V5 modelling software while the 2 International Journal of Development in Engineering Technology and Science IJDETS Volume 01 Issue 01 January 2017 www ijdets com Page 36 meshing process of computational range was managed in ICEM CFD software using blocking phenomenon ANSYS Fluent was applied to calculate the flow problems and CFD POST was applied as post processing software A Geometrical Technique Geometric techniques were modelled using CATIA V5 R22 modelling software For available research only2 D background available car was appliance to generate the 3 D geometrical technique Side mirrors and other joints were not taken to make the simulation case easy For existing work there are four different types of car versions were modelled First is the Hatch Back car version and the Sedan car version was divided into 3 types of same measure i e Sedan with tyres Sedan without tyres fixed to body Sedan with gap between body and tyres because it was need to know what percentage of drag force raises due to the account of tyres and gap between tyres and body So if the drag force gap is less then the car models without tyres can be applied in the future computation methods in order to decline unnecessary meshing process and computational time on the other case if the gap is large than either the car model tyres fixed or the car model with gap between body and tyres can be selected based up on the accuracy and computational resources required The Sedan car model has the measurements 0 066m wide 0 050m high and 0 176m long while Hatch Back car version has the measurements 0 066m wide 0 050m high and 0 155m long Fig 1 Sedan Car Version without Tyres Fig 2 Sedan Car Model With Tyres Fixed Fig 3 Sedan Car Version with Variation between Body and Tyres Fig 4 Hatch Back Car Version B Meshing Process Meshing process of the computation range was exercised entirely by applying blocking in ICE phenomenon CFD meshing phenomenon Since only 2d background of the Sedan and Hatch Back car versions were selected for research in the existing work 2d planer mesh was produced initially in the XY plane catching the 2d background of the car versions which was later on changed to 3d mesh just by considering the mesh blocks in the Z direction 1 Frame work Frame work was managed for 1 40 measured Sedan car version without tyres in a 0 4m wide 0 4m high and 1 6m long wind tunnel range Initially course mesh was produced for the car version with nearly 2 6million nodes later on the mesh was corrected by raising the node count to 1 6 times the past mesh The similar problem was made to work i e at the similar velocity but with distinct mesh size In the final mesh node count was restricted to 15 9 million as there were no great changes in drag co efficient outcomes Table 1 Difference of Drag Co Efficient With Number of Nodes 3 International Journal of Development in Engineering Technology and Science IJDETS Volume 01 Issue 01 January 2017 www ijdets com Page 37 Frame work study for the existing work was managed at 21m s and a total of six different grid resolutions were applied Case A has the coarsest resolution and case G has the existing grid resolution Grid refinement was worked only at some finite identification around the car version where steep pressure gradients were predicted Table 1 shows the difference of drag co efficient with raise in the node count It can be clearly showed that there are no reasonable changes in drag co efficient after 9 7 million node count Hence there was no specific point in selecting existing grid at the price of huge computational systems for slight raise in accuracy So the mesh with 9 7 million node count was discussed for the present computational technique All the meshes produced were concentrated such that the low angle of the grid would lie above 22 degree and the determinant would lie above 0 6 The measurements of the computational range was depended on the real wind tunnel test part measurements 0 4m wide 0 4m high and 1 6m long and the car versions were kept in the computational wind tunnel range certainly similar to that was mounted in the wind tunnel test section with blockage ratio of 4 5 as it was need to simulate actual wind tunnel situations a b Fig 5 Sedan Without Tyres a Mesh Range b External

problem was calculated by applying ANSYS FLUENT as the calculator for both Sedan and Hatch Back car versions at 4 different velocities 15m s 20m s 25m s 30m s Table 2 Calculator Arrangement Fig 9 Correlation of Plot for Sedan Car Version Firstly problem was taken to operate for 7000 repetitions at specific velocity Since there were no great alterations in the dust values above 2000 repetitions all the other flow difficulties were made to operate for 2000 repetitions thereby declining computational time Fig 9 represents the Correlation plot for Sedan car version at 25 m s Correlation absolute approach for measured dust was fixed to 10 6 As the measured dust for all the variables are less than 10 6 it can be said that solution is correlated D Post Processing All the post processing work was made by using CFD POST software pattern Different contour plots such as velocity contours pressure contour etc were pointed at different velocities for both Sedan and Hatch Back car version All the computational technique was managed in Hp Z800 workstation containing the following point Processors 18x Intel Xeon 5570 2 9GHz Memory 32GB DDR2 RAM Chipset Intel 5570 Graphics ATI FirePro 5700 Graphics III RESULTS AND REVIEWS b Fig 10 Pressure Distributions a Sedan car b Hatch Back car Simulative external navigation technique was focussed on Sedan and Hatch Back car versions having same front view in a trial to know their external navigation attitude at distinct velocities It is a Table 3 Corner Conditions 5 International Journal of Development in Engineering Technology and Science IJDETS Volume 01 Issue 01 January 2017 www ijdets com Page 39 proved from the Fig 10 a and Fig 10 b that extreme pressure stagnation plot acts at the front bumper and this pressure raises with raise in velocity for both the cars versions At the meeting point of hood and front windshield the car models practices positive pressure due to the interference harmed by the front windshield The car models while rest of the areas of car versions feels negative pressure Also it can be presented that pressure working over the car models is less where the car structure is streamlined and is more at another areas Due to obstruct change in body and generation of adverse pressure parameter flow division takes place at the mid part of rear wind shield Due to this flow division production of eddies and vortices takes place at the rear wind shield of both Sedan and Hatch Back car versions which can be clearly preented in the Fig 11 b and Fig 12 b Slight flow re fix takes place at the boot region in case of sedan car model b Fig 11 Sedan Car version a Pressure Contour b streamlines It is identified that Pressure co efficient plot trend remains constant at all the velocities for both the car models as shown in the Fig 13 a and b So it can be finalised that pressure co efficient variation along the middle line of the car models is unique of velocity 9 Also it can be identified that variation of pressure co efficient along the middle line of the car model follows same trend as that of the pressure with pressure co efficient being maximum at the front bumper with a value near to 1 0 and minimum on the roof Almost unique value of CP is attained at every port on the car model for different velocity domains a b Fig 12 Hatch Back Car Version a Pressure Contour b Streamlines It is proved from the fig 14 that drag force raises with raise in velocity over the whole velocity valuates for both the car models while drag co efficient declines slightly with raise in Reynolds number It is identified that Hatch Back car model has around 3 6 more drag force and drag co efficient than the Sedan car model though both the car models have similar front view Hatch Back car model feels more drag force as compared to Sedan car model due to actual fact that air flow over the Hatch Back car model separates much earlier and the negative pressure area left behind the Hatch Back car model due to flow division is more as compared to that of Sedan car model It is interested to notice that drag co efficient declines with raise in velocity because of delay in flow division as the speed raises in both the car versions a 6 International Journal of Development in Engineering Technology and Science IJDETS Volume 01 Issue 01 January 2017 www ijdets com Page 40 a b Fig 13 Division of CP a Sedan b Hatch Back From the above computational comparison technique it is fine that body change only at the rear end can generate a drag co efficient division up to 3 6 This can be finalised in the other case correlation of Hatch Back car into a Sedan car can develop the drag co efficient by 3 6 Though the drag development is quite small in magnitudes but this small development can make huge influence on external navigation efficiency of cars In general this development in drag co efficient of the Sedan car suggests in getting the mileage almost equal to that of Hatch Back car though weight of Sedan car is more as compared to Hatch Back cars Fig 14 Variation of Fd with Velocity Fig 15 Division of CD with Velocity As it was important to understand the change in force and drag co efficient attained with and without the respect of tyres and variation between body and tyres computational technique was managed for different classifications of Sedan car models i e Sedan car without tyres Sedan car with tyres fixed Sedan car with gap between body and tyres Table 4 represents the division in drag force and drag co efficient attained for different cases of Sedan car versions at 10m s It can be identified that Sedan car model with tyres fixed has 9 more drag co efficient as compared to Sedan car without tyres while the difference in drag coefficient between Sedan car without tyres and Sedan car with gap between body and tyres is 16 So it is fine that there is a greater basis of drag co efficient on exterior background of the car model But on the other case it can be identified that computational time necessary for Sedan car with gap between tyres and body is around 250 hrs while its only 40 hrs for Sedan car without tyres for each velocity So it can be concluded that the combination of type of car models for technique on the computational resources existing and the accuracy range needed Table 4 Drag Division for different types of Sedan car version 7 International Journal of Development in Engineering Technology and Science IJDETS Volume 01 Issue 01 January 2017 www ijdets com Page 41 IV CONCLUSION 1 Computational technique of Sedan and Hatch Back car models support that Sedan car model has less drag co efficient and drag force over the whole velocity range as compared to that of Hatch Back car model so it can be concluded that Sedan car model is more streamlined and external navigation efficient compared to Hatch Back car version 2 For both Sedan and Hatch Back car versions drag force raises with raise in velocity while drag co efficient declines slightly with raise in Reynolds number 3 Computational technique supports that as the speed raises the difference in drag force between Sedan and Hatch Back car models also raises 4 Computational technique is maintained on Sedan without tyres Sedan with tyres fixed to body and Sedan with tyre and gap between the body states that there is greater dependency on the exterior background of the car models Hence it advised taking the entire background of the car for future external navigation studies based on the computational and practical resources available REFERENCES 1 Bhagirath Zala Dr
