<TEXT>
In line with his signature slogan Oti See Se meaning it has been made possible His Imperial Majesty Oba Dr Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi Ojaja II revived a revered traditional festival The Olojo Festival is celebrated in grand style from October 14 through 17 in Ile Ife Osun State Since he was sworn in in December 2015 King Ogunwusi s footprints have covered thousands of miles from his palace in Ile Ife to other countries in Africa the United States Europe and in cyberspace where he has generated hundreds of thousands of fans on Facebook Twitter and other social media platforms His message of peace harmony economic justice and youth emancipation resonates with millions of millennials King Ogunwusi s winning attributes are his genuine openness and inclusiveness I was among the 50 000 plus participants from Nigeria and the international community who flooded the streets of Ile Ife to show our love and support and to celebrate the Olojo Festival with King Ogunwusi what is the Olojo Festival It was the first festival I attended since I relocated to the United States 30 years ago I was accompanied by New York State Senator Kevin Parker and Sekou Olayinka from Philadelphia The Olojo Festival is the celebration of the God of Iron Ogun whose representative is believed to be the first son of Oduduwa progenitor of the Yoruba people It is a historical festival that has remained popular in Ile Ife due to the belief that it is a day in the year specially blessed by Olodumare the creator of the Universe Olojo in Yoruba also translates to The Owner for the Day Prayers are offered for peace and tranquillity in Yoruba All age groups are invited to participate and the festival also signifies the unification of the Yorubas throughout the world Tradition holds that Ile Ife is the cradle of civilisation the city of survivors the spiritual seat of the Yorubas and the land of the ancients We arrived at Lagos airport and travelled six hours to Ile Ife through a town called Ede We finally arrived at the palace around 4 p m His Imperial Majesty s several days of prayerful seclusion communing with the ancestors on behalf of his people had just ended and though he wasn t ready for public appearance he welcomed us This ritual ensured his purity and the efficacy of his prayers Before the Ooni emerged women from his maternal and paternal families swept the palace symbolising the removal of evil Later the Ooni would appear in public with the Aare crown King s Crown said to be the original crown used by Oduduwa He led a procession of traditional chiefs and priests to perform rituals at the Shrine of Ogun The crowd was then led to Okemogun s shrine where the king performed rituals that included the renewal of oath and divination at the foot of Oketage hill by Araba chief priests Visiting places of historical importance followed Throughout the day there was something magical about the atmosphere I vividly recall the swarming crowds that made it impassable for vehicles Thousands of people shoulder to shoulder anxiously awaited the emergence of the king Drums were talking in rhythm a score of bare chested young men with their heads half shaved and their faces painted in white and red were marching back and forth through the crowd whipping long sticks in the air to keep the crowd from stepping into the pathway that had been cleared for the King s passage talking drums About 30 minutes later we heard the rapid succession of the talking drums and a high pitch chanting in Yoruba honouring the king The energy never ebbed It was palpable becoming volcanic when we spotted the tip of the colourfully beaded sacred crown Aare said to house a spiritual deity that can only be seen once a year As customary upon viewing the crown spectators made a wish hoping that it would be granted This explained why thousands of Ife indigenes had camped out for days to catch a glimpse of the crown and their beloved king They were all praying in solemnity with the hope of having their solemn prayers answered As a Nigerian with unswerving belief in the traditions I bowed my head and made by wish As the king walked along the clear path guarded closely by his traditional men know as Emese the crowds surged All I remembered was being shuffled along There was no room to look left right or down The crowd reminded me of the West Indian Day Parade in New York but purpose and intention were different There is an indescribable sacredness to the Olojo Festival that should be experienced by Yoruba people in the diaspora It is an experience like no other Bukola Shonuga and Dr Glenville Ashby are independent journalists and members of the United States Foreign Press n Dr Glenville Ashby can contacted at glenvilleashby gmail com and is the author of Anam Cara Your Soul Friend and Bridge to Enlightenment and Creativity
