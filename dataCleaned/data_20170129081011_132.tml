The Prince George Cougars posted their most lopsided victory of the season Saturday, 11-3 over the Edmonton Oil Kings. 
 
Jansen Harkins set up three goals to become the Cougars all-time assists leader with 154, two more than Troy Bourke. 
 
The Cougars tied their all-time mark for goals in a single game (11) and set a new record for road victories in a season (19). 
 
14 of the 18 P.G. skaters picked up at least a point. 
 
Colby McAuley scored twice and assisted on two others, Radovan Bondra had two goals and an assist while Brogan O‚ÄùBrien and Kody McDonald each had a goal and two helpers as the Cats enjoyed period leads of 5-2 and 8-2. 
 
It was the 10th consecutive loss for the Oil Kings. 
 
The same teams meet again today (Sunday) in Edmonton.
