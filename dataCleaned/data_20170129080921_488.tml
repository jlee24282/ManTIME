<TITLE>Naveen rejects Negotiation committee on Mahanadi river calls for early formation of Tribunal to resolve the dispute</TITLE>
<TEXT>
The Mahanadi water dispute involving Odisha and Chhatisgarh was further complicated with Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik demanding setting up of Water Tribunal while rejecting the constitution of a Negotiation Committee by the Union Water Resource Minister to resolve the issue Expressing his strong reservation over the formation of Negotiation Committee Mr Patnaik in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi said such a committee will only delay the formation of water Tribunal and allow the Chhatisgarh government to complete all the ongoing projects over the upper end of Mahanadi river which the state government has been vociferously objecting as it would have serious effect on the livelihood of missions of people in the state solely depending upon the Mahanadi river considered as a life line for Odisha The Chief Minister urged the Prime Minister to direct the Union Water Resource Ministry to withdraw the office memorandum on the constitution of the Negotiation Committee and initiate constitution of Tribunal stating that the water dispute on Mahanadi raised by his government cannot be resolved by the negotiation Mr Patnaik also urged the Prime Minister to direct the Chhatisgarh government to stop all the ongoing construction work on Mahanadi forthwith and expressed his opinion stating that I am open to a meeting at your level as a last and final chance to settle the dispute by negotiation if the meeting of chief ministers of the riparian states is called immediately The Chief Minister also expressed his deep concern as the central government has failed to instruct the Chhatisgarh government to stop the construction work in respect of ongoing projects started unilaterally in the Mahanadi basis as repeatedly raised by his government which has caused serious discontentment in the minds of the people of the state who are hugely dependent on the water of Mahanadi river Mr Patnaik also stated that the constitution of the Negotiation Committee is not in accordance with the provisions of the Inter State River Water Dispute Act 1956 which puts the responsibility on the centre to negotiate after receiving the complaint and in this regard the the principle of federal relations mandates that the constitutional functionaries namely the Prime Minister or Union Minister for Water Resources should conduct the negotiation with the Chief Ministers of riparian states rather than appointi8ng a committee headed by an officer of the sub ordinate office such as the Central Water Commission UNI DP KK
