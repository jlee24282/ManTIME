<TITLE>DEAR ANNIE The fruit of an affair</TITLE>
<TEXT>
null Dear Annie Last month my wife of 60 years admitted to a five year affair that occurred 55 years ago I would call it a tryst with sex the same time and the same place almost every day in a five day workweek Count em That s about 1 000 encounters taking time out for the birth of three babies vacations etc The hurt has been indescribable I think about it constantly Fortunately I have found a psychologist I can vent to I keep telling myself it was 55 years ago but it seems like yesterday I still have my unfaithful wife she has no place to go and alas I still love her During that five year period three boys were born The last one I am sure is not mine He is aware that he is different from his siblings and has asked me whether he could have been switched at birth The biological father is dead I think our son should know who he was but his mother does not We are 80 years old and the only ones to know and time is running out to tell him With doctors using DNA information and with Ancestry com etc it is only a matter of time before he finds out he has different genes than his siblings I love him very much and don t want him to think I was involved in wife swapping or somehow a party to the affair It is bad enough to know that he is the product of a cheating mother My wife tells me she has no remorse guilt or shame but she cares about what our son would think of her Tell him Your opinion please It Was Only Sex Dear Only Should you tell your son I m inclined to say no There s no point in upsetting the balance and making him feel more like an outsider Besides he already knows who his real dad is you But if his biological father suffered from any conditions of which genetics are a good predictor then your son should be aware of that medical history Raise that concern with your wife She should want him to be equipped with all the best information to lead a long healthy life I can t imagine the range of emotions you must be cycling through on a daily basis I m happy that you ve found a therapist who can help you process things Keep going The sting of your wife s revelation will lessen with time Dear Annie I just read the letter from Inbox Infinity who was stressed out by having nearly 7 000 unread emails I understand completely I procrastinate have generalized anxiety and attention deficit disorder and am a perfectionist Please suggest to Inbox that he or she can start the culling process painlessly by signing up for Unroll Me which was suggested to me by a website for adults with ADD It is an amazing simple program that will compile your incoming emails into a daily digest and make it easy to unsubscribe from what you don t want Unroll Me will not do anything about the emails already archived in your inbox however It only organizes incoming mail For those 7 000 pesky emails I would suggest some tough love Delete them Simple as that If they haven t been looked at in a week a month or a year they most likely are not important or have expired Don t even look at them Just delete them As for family members consider emailing them after the purge explaining that you want to reconnect but recently deleted a whole bunch of emails They will understand as they probably have several thousand archived emails also Been There Done That Send your questions for Annie Lane to dearannie creators com
