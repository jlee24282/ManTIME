<TITLE>EU implementing energy project in Turkmenistan</TITLE>
<TEXT>
By   Trend 
 
The European Union (EU) has supported the project "Support to the introduction of Sustainable Development policies –and rational use of natural resources in the energy-environment sectors in Turkmenistan" as part of the technical cooperation, the Neutral Turkmenistan newspaper reported. 
 
A report on this issue was read out during the meeting of the country’s Cabinet of Ministers. 
 
Turkmenistan’s President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov drew attention to the further strengthening of constructive cooperation with European partners. 
 
According to BP, Turkmenistan’s recoverable reserves are estimated at 17.5 trillion cubic meters of gas or nine percent of total global reserves, which puts Turkmenistan on the fourth position in this field after Iran, Russia and Qatar. 
 
Negotiations on delivering the Turkmen gas to Europe have been conducted since 2011. The Southern Gas Corridor (SGC), which includes the Trans-Caspian project, is a priority for the European Union. 
 
In May 2015, Ashgabat declaration on energy was signed by energy ministers of Azerbaijan, Turkey and Turkmenistan and European Commission Vice-President for Energy Union Maros Sefcovic. 
 
The project of laying a 300-kilometer gas pipeline through the Caspian Sea to the coast of Azerbaijan, as the interested parties said earlier, is optimal for the delivery of Turkmen resources to the European market. The Turkmen fuel can further reach Turkey, which borders with European countries.
