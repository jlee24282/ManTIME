<TEXT>
Whether it s Every Day or just Tuesdays and Thursdays Bob Martin is immersed in the world of therapy and one particularly memorable patient Martin stars as therapist David in CBC s dramatic comedy Michael Every Day now in its second season after a five year hiatus Season 1 dubbed Michael Tuesdays and Thursdays wrapped up in December 2011 David s patient Michael Matt Watts is back working with him and the two are continuing to build on their symbiotic relationship The final two episodes in the six part run air Sunday night Martin spoke about the show his own phobias and working with old friends Q What s your own personal biggest neurosis A I have a severe elevator phobia It s a huge huge problem for me I spend half the year in New York so it s almost impossible for me to escape elevators Q What is it about elevators A It s not about dying in them it s not about the crashing or the cords breaking It s just simply about being in a box and not being able to do anything It s a control thing But I deal with it I kind of do the immersion therapy approach I just get in the elevator but it s extremely unpleasant The nice thing is I work in musical theatre and David Foster is a very successful composer who cannot get in elevators at all So every time I ask to take the stairs they always bring up David Foster So I feel like I m in good company Matt Watts left and Bob Martin in Michael Every Day CBC Q You re the co creator executive producer writer and star do you enjoy being responsible for everything A I do I m very much a control freak There s a lot of me in that character for sure In fact I would say that David is all the worst parts of me I would love to be a psychologist so it s great for me to live vicariously through that character to enact all my worst possible scenarios in life through that character In order to do that I have to write it too Although Matt Watts wrote two episodes and Lynn Coady wrote two episodes I was kind of the head writer and Don McKellar and Matt and I conceived the whole series so it s a very collective effort Q You re working with a lot of same people it must ve been pretty seamless getting back together for Season 2 A Don and I have a long creative history We went to high school together and we worked on things all our lives together The musical that brought me to New York The Drowsy Chaperone Don and I wrote that together as well He really took a lot of the load this season because of my crazy schedule And Matt and I are like brothers we ve also known each other since I was in my 20s This series it s inspired by all Matt s craziness When CBC approached me to develop a series I was friends with one of the producers and I was talking about something Matt had told me We both thought it would be a great idea for a series and what he was describing was really the first episode of Season 1 an exercise he did with his therapist to deal with his issues with small talk Jennifer Irwin is an old friend of mine who I worked with at Second City and she plays Sammy in the series and Tommie Amber Pirie Claire is a close friend So for sure it s a group of people who are used to working together and are comfortable with each other Fonte canada com
