Denver, CO (PRWEB)  January 29, 2017 
 
STAR Institute for Sensory Processing Disorder (SPD) announces its 2017 corporate partnerships. These partnerships offer a variety of benefits for the partner, as well as STAR Institute, allowing for greater exposure of quality products these partners sell and to expand name recognition mutually by sharing market audiences. 
 
STAR Institute has two new companies who are kicking off 2017 as STAR Institute Corporate Partners, Bellicon and Stokke. “It is extremely important for STAR Institute to have support from organizations like these and we thank each of these companies for their collaboration with us as they help us further our vision of a world where everyone with SPD receives support and services that result in having a meaningful and fulfilled life,” explains Dick Layton, Director of STAR Institute. 
 
Chewigem, Dye-namic Movement Products, FlagHouse, Integrated Listening Systems, Landscape Structures, Makoto, My Feelings, and SensaCalm are all extending their longstanding partnerships with STAR Institute through 2017. 
 
“We serve the very same community of people as the STAR Institute, so our partnership is natural,” said Donna Chambers, Founder and CEO of SensaCalm.  
 
“We chose to partner with STAR Institute, as so many families have a sensory related diagnosis in addition to other diagnoses. As parents to a child with sensory needs, we value the dual model of research and support provided by the STAR Institute. Being a national company that supports those with additional needs, it was important for us to find a like-minded corporate partner that shared our values and mission,” said Shelli Smartt, owner of Chewigem USA.  
 
The STAR Institute thanks all of their 2017 Corporate Partners.
