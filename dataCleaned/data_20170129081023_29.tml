<TITLE>Iowa Games: Celebrating 25 years</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Every winter, Iowans from throughout the state join to celebrate every sport from horseshoes to snowshoeing. This year, the Winter Iowa Games celebrated its 25th year, and Dubuque, as a host city, has been instrumental in making the event an annual opportunity for Iowans to stay active. 
 
Chuck Long, executive director of the Iowa Sports Foundation, said the Iowa Winter Games started with a group of 500 athletes. This year, more than 4,000 are participating, with Dubuque hosting 12 competitions at 14 different venues. 
 
“I’ve just seen the chart of how it’s grown,” said Long, who is in his third year running the Games. “It’s grown in a great way. We love having it in Dubuque. 
 
“We’ve found that people in Iowa want to be active, and we’re trying to push sports, recreation, health and wellness statewide. We have a great Eastern Iowa presence and it’s really because of the games.” 
 
On Saturday, the Dubuque region hosted alpine ski racing, girls basketball, fitness walking, ice hockey, indoor soccer, martial arts, swimming, table tennis and volleyball. Today’s schedule contains boys basketball, pickleball, road racing and Zumba, and on February 11-12, four more Winter Games events will take place in Cedar Rapids. Another 11 competitions have or will take place at varying locations throughout the state. 
 
The Games attract athletes of all ages and experience, said Long. The youngest competitor is 4-year-old Urbandale figure skater Faline Senne; the oldest is Garner-native Marvin Engstler, an 84-year-old horseshoe thrower. Dubuquer Sarah Smith is the second-oldest female athlete at 77, competing today in the pickleball tournament. 
 
“We want a wide variety,” Long said, adding that people from all 99 Iowa counties are participating this year. “You don’t have to be an athlete to participate. Anybody can be an athlete at these games.” 
 
While the event drives competition, organizers try to instill values of sportsmanship and camaraderie in the athletes. Dubuque-native Jim Rolling served as the commissioner of Saturday’s youth volleyball tournament, and after five years helping run it, he said the reason he loves working the Iowa Games is helping young athletes learn. 
 
“They’re here to have fun, they’re here to learn, it’s not all about winning,” Rolling said. “Typically it’s a good way to learn. My emphasis is that you’re here to have fun, you’re here to help these kids become better people, not just better athletes.” 
 
Long already deemed this year’s games a success. And at this rate, he’s looking forward to another strong 25 years of Iowa Games. 
 
“We don’t turn anybody away,” Long said. “There’s a place and a sport for everybody to participate.”
