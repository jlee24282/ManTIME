<TITLE>Dentistâ€™s office not going anywhere</TITLE>
<TEXT>
To the editor: 
  
I would like to report that things are returning to normal since the Follansbee flood of 2016. 
 
Because some had no names, I would like to thank all those who sent flowers to my office. I would like to let everyone know that all rumors of this office closing for good or that I had retired because of the flood are not true. We had X-ray equipment calibrated and inspected, we purchased new equipment, our hours are the same and my old assistant is back. I plan on staying in Follansbee for a long time. I have already been here for 30 years.
