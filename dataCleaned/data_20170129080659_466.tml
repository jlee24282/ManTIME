<TITLE> Car Wash prosecutor says corruption probe to grow</TITLE>
<TEXT>
The lead federal prosecutor in a massive corruption investigation roiling Brazil says that recent developments could double the size of the case a staggering possibility given that the probe has ensnared many of the country s elite threatens to bring down President Michel Temer and is expanding to other Latin American countries Nearly three years after the first arrests in March 2014 the so called Car Wash investigation has no end in sight said Deltan Dallagnol coordinator of the task force in the state of Parana where the operations began and are still largely centred under the jurisdiction of Judge Sergio Moro I would say that the new plea agreements could allow the Car Wash operation to double its size in the future Dallagnol told The Associated Press on Thursday declining to go into detail because the cases were ongoing What started as an investigation into money laundering has morphed into a corruption scandal so large that it has shocked Brazilians long accustomed to graft in politics Investigators say more than US 2 billion in bribes were paid out in a kickback scheme that was centred at state oil company Petrobras and included major construction companies like Odebrecht In the last few years dozens of politicians and top businessmen have been convicted and jailed and many more are facing charges In a wide ranging interview Dallagnol said the investigation lives at risk because of forces trying to snuff it out He said the pressures were increasing as the number of powerful people caught up in it grows by the day Dallagnol said the loss of Supreme Court Justice Teori Zavascki who was overseeing a large part of the investigation and died in a plane crash last week was a huge blow but ultimately would not derail the many cases in progress He said that while many believed the investigation was creating a new Brazil its long term impact depended on whether Latin America s largest nation took measures to reform its political and judicial systems He likened it to an ill patient who goes to the doctor and gets a diagnosis but doesn t act on the medical advice Unfortunately we are still at the diagnostic stage said Dallagnol who studied law in Brazil and then did a master s degree at Harvard University Dallagnol said the Car Wash investigation was succeeding thanks to a four pronged strategy plea bargains that lead to new revelations operational phases that build on each other close co operation between justice and legal officials and a transparent communication strategy that includes divulging details of cases once arrests are made Dallagnol also praised Moro the judge saying his vast knowledge of laws related to corruption and ability to succinctly apply the law were key factors HEROES To many Brazilians fed up with corruption and their political leaders Moro and Dallagnol are heroes a designation that Dallagnol flatly rejects We are just doing our jobs he said The investigation has become so large that it is expanding to other states and judges The arrest warrant issued Thursday in Rio for Eike Batista previously one of the world s richest men now wanted for allegedly making bribes is a testament to how far the Car Wash investigation and its offshoots have gone Last year prosecutors reached a plea agreement with dozens of executives of constructor Odebrecht The agreements expected to be made public early this year are believed to have damning evidence of bribes against top politicians in Brazil and possibly in other Latin American countries including Argentina Peru and Venezuela Temer who has been fingered in other plea bargains but never charged could be removed by the electoral court if Odebrecht plea bargains detail illegal campaign financing that he has long been accused of accepting Temer has denied wrongdoing AP
