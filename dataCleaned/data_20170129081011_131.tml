<TEXT>
Greg Gard s basketball team tied for first in the Big Ten and ranked No 15 in the nation looked like a mediocre unit for almost 40 minutes Saturday at Madison Square Garden Facing unranked Rutgers Wisconsin shot poorly and at times struggled to keep the ball out of the lane Led by Ethan Happ UW overcame a nine point deficit late in regulation and then controlled the overtime to escape with a 61 54 victory Happ scored seven points in the overtime and 15 of UW s last 29 and finished with a college high 32 points He hit 12 of 18 field goal attempts and 8 of 16 free throw attempts and added six rebounds and three assists Bronson Koenig added 10 four on free throws in the overtime but made just 2 of 10 3 pointers and 2 of 13 shots overall UW made 3 of 25 3 point attempts 12 5 percent and 20 of 60 shots overall 33 3 percent Nigel Hayes added seven points a game high 11 rebounds and four assists He had five points in the overtime as well as an assist on a basket by Happ The Badgers 18 3 7 1 Big Ten continued their run through the league with their fifth consecutive victory since suffering an 11 point loss Jan 8 at Purdue UW won for the 14th time in the last 15 games overall and improved to 6 3 away from the Kohl Center this season 3 1 neutral site 3 2 road Guards Corey Sanders and Nigel Johnson scored 15 and 13 points respectively for Rutgers Rutgers which suffered a 20 point loss to UW in Madison saw its record fall to 1 8 in the league and 12 10 overall The Scarlet Knights entered the day as the Big Ten s worst shooting team in league play but the Badgers appeared determined to steal that title The Badgers shooting 40 2 percent from 3 point range and 46 4 percent overall in Big Ten play looked as if they hadn t practiced shooting for weeks They made 1 of 13 3 pointers 8 3 percent 5 of 25 shots overall 20 percent and went the last 10 36 of the half without a field goal Koenig was 0 of 5 from 3 point range and 0 of 6 overall Vitto Brown was 0 of 2 from 3 point range and 0 of 4 overall Hayes was 0 of 2 leaving the trio a combined 0 of 10 for the half If not for the early burst of Happ who scored 10 of his 11 points in the first 4 15 UW s deficit would have been greater than five points UW missed its last 12 field goal attempts of the half and lost the battle for points in the paint 14 8 to Rutgers The Badgers missed their first six shots of the second half before Happ scored inside with 16 44 left That ended UW s run of misses at 18 in a row and a span of 13 52 Ouch
