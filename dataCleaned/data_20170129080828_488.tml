<TITLE>Many fear Nebraska Iowa will lose to Mexico if Trump starts trade war</TITLE>
<TEXT>
In South Omaha last week retailer Carlos Jacobo of Jacobo s Groceries ticked off some of the daily necessities required by cooks whose refrigerators and stoves overflow with the sweet and savory produce of Mexican cuisine Jumex juice drinks Dona Maria marinated cactus Lo Costena enchilada sauce All are staples in kitchens where Mexican fare is on the daily menu and all are imported from Mexico And all would be subject to a 20 percent import tax proposed by the Trump administration last week as a means of paying for a border wall between the two nations Like many in both countries however Jacobo wasn t quite sure how taxing imported goods to be sold to his U S consumers would add up to making Mexico and Mexican consumers pay for the wall a campaign promise of President Donald Trump Rather than burdening Mexico Jacobo said such a tax collected by U S Customs and Border Protection officials would end up being passed on to wholesalers in the United States then to U S retailers and ultimately to his consumers It s like any other price increase said Jacobo whose parents started the family grocery store 40 years ago You have to pass it on to the customer or what s the point of being here The White House said last week that a 20 percent border tax on imports from Mexico is one method the Trump administration is considering to equalize a 60 billion trade deficit and to pay for a barrier between the two nations to control the entry of illegal immigrants drugs and guns A White House spokesman refused to detail exactly how taxing goods coming into the country taxes surely to be passed on to U S consumers in the form of higher retail prices would generate revenue from Mexico s government or consumers for the construction of a wall Sean Spicer the spokesman later appeared to backtrack telling reporters that the tax was one idea to pay for the wall and that his intent was not to roll out a new policy Not all Republicans seemed to be on board either U S Sen Ben Sasse R Neb posted on Twitter that Tariffs are a tax on American families Colleague Lindsey Graham R S C called talk of an import tax mucho sad Some economists last week also were scratching their heads at the idea They included University of Nebraska at Omaha economist and professor Christopher Decker Unless I m missing something I m not quite sure how that works Decker said If imports dry up as a result of the increase in tax you re not going to have a lot of tax revenue On the other hand if imports from Mexico remain high because consumers are willing to pay higher prices for valued goods the people paying those higher prices are U S consumers Instead of Mexico paying for the wall Decker said Americans who buy Mexican made goods would be paying for the wall It s backwards Decker said That confounds me a little bit It s not just foodstuffs that are affected many automobiles some under American nameplates such as Chevrolet and Dodge are assembled in Mexico Presumably they also would be slapped with a 20 percent import tax as they made their way into the U S if automakers didn t find somewhere else to make the cars There apparently is some hope that threat of a tariff or tax on imports to the U S from Mexico could spur carmakers to bring some production back to the U S Dennis Williams president of the United Auto Workers generally expressed support for Trump s idea of tariffs on Mexican imports according to news reports after the November election Such support was in short supply among agricultural interests in the Midlands Farmers and others connected to the ag industry said they had much to lose if talk of an import tax ignited a full on trade war Mexico is Nebraska s second largest trading partner after Canada with 1 2 billion in trade in 2015 according to the U S Department of Commerce Midlands ag folks were crystal clear Friday when they said they do not favor any U S trade policy that will lead Mexico to retaliate with punitive border levies of its own that might cut deeply into the ability of Nebraska and Iowa farmers to sell their grain profitably south of the border Any disruption of export markets would result in continued downward pressure on farm incomes and farm financial health said Steve Nelson president of the Nebraska Farm Bureau Agriculture exports account for roughly one third of farm income Nelson said making trade critical to agriculture Any actions jeopardizing Nebraska s ability to access international markets is of great concern to our members The leading categories are the usual suspects processed food and grain Mexico is the third largest consumer of all U S agriculture goods the second largest consumer of U S corn third of U S soybeans and fourth of U S beef Nebraska in turn ranks in the top five nationally in the production of each as does Iowa in corn and soybeans Major corporations with a stake in Mexico are monitoring the situation closely In Omaha that means Union Pacific Railroad employer of 8 000 in Nebraska The second largest freight railroad in the United States about 11 percent of U P s volume is tied to Mexico The company serves all six of the rail crossings between the United States and Mexico A big chunk is vehicles and vehicle parts going back and forth Union Pacific marketing chief Beth Whited said in a conference call with analysts and investors this month Daniel Sherman a Wall Street transportation industry analyst for St Louis based wealth adviser Edward Jones said he doesn t see any long term threat to Union Pacific from the Mexican standoff because politics and rhetoric aside there are people on both sides of the border with their heads on straight And that means Sherman said a long term agreement wherein both sides prosper because it is not in anyone s best interest for anything but I see the current dust up as the start of a long drawn out negotiation process that likely ends better than it will look in the middle Sherman said in an interview The reason it ends better is because both sides realize that each is benefiting in a major way from the trade between our two countries On the same conference call earlier this month U P Chief Executive Lance Fritz said the economies of the two countries are inextricably tied It is our perception that the United States is tightly woven with our trading partners Fritz said Our consumers benefit greatly from free and open trade Such free and open trade is generally considered to be that in which neither trading partner levies import taxes at the border fees known as tariffs Fritz said free trade benefits the United States by allowing imports of goods that can be produced more cheaply overseas than domestically Free trade advocates say it also opens up exports encouraging technological and productivity advances in U S manufacturing and the concomitant job growth The opposite trading philosophy is known as protectionism in which hefty tariffs are levied at the border to make imported goods more expensive than those manufactured domestically a strategy designed to protect domestic agriculture industries and jobs from foreign competition For the Midwest it is the ag portion that resounds the loudest Corn is selling for less than half the 8 a bushel record seen in 2012 farm debt is up and land prices are declining Mexico has been an important and growing market for raw and processed agricultural goods said John Campbell of Omaha investment bank Ocean Park Advisers whose work includes commodities analysis A trade war with them when farmers are already in a fragile financial situation would be disastrous for rural America Back in South Omaha Tony Vega s Plaza Latina at 4938 S 24th St carries a wide range of goods including Mexican made cowboy boots costing up to 850 a pair Customers will balk at a 20 percent increase and may bargain down the price cutting into the store s earnings The tax option is another negative message from the Trump administration said Vega who helps local people with travel plans and finding doctors or lawyers in Omaha There s a fear that the federal government will track down people who aren t legal residents The most important thing is we want to be the best citizens we can be respect the law respect everything Vega said We must be good neighbors Don t be afraid Mexico is our third largest goods trading partner with 531 billion in total two way goods trade during 2015 the last year with statistics available through the Office of the United States Trade Representative Mexico is the United States
