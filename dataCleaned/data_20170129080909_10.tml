<TITLE>The Latest: Denton Development Code</TITLE>
<TEXT>
What’s new?  
A consultant has begun working on Denton’s development code. A development code lays out the rules for where and how homes and businesses can be built to both preserve the value of existing property and still encourage the kind of growth the city wants to see. 
 How did we get here?  
Some property owners and builders have been lobbying for new rules. They tell city leaders that the old rules make it too difficult to build a new home on a vacant lot in an old neighborhood or rehab an old building for a new business. The Denton City Council approved a consulting contract with Clarion Associates in December. 
 What’s next?  
City leaders said they will be hosting some forums soon to get feedback from the public and “stakeholders.” Typically, property owners hoping to develop their land or old buildings and the developers themselves are considered stakeholders. Sometimes, a neighborhood association have a stake, too, when a new project is proposed for a parcel of land in the neighborhood that has been vacant. The consultant expects to finish writing the rules by 2018.
