PORTSMOUTH — A public hearing was held in Concord on Tuesday on a bill that, if passed, would remove the mandatory requirement for veterinarians in the state to comply with the prescription drug monitoring program. 
 
HB291-FN proposes to not adopt rules written for veterinarians to comply with the state program, and to not require them to take part. 
 
The N.H. prescription monitoring program is a statewide requirement for health care providers and pharmacists who prescribe opioid medications to their patients. The state database tracks a person’s prescription history in efforts to avoid drug shopping habits by people with a substance abuse disorder. 
 
Veterinarians were included in the state PMP because there have been reports across the country of addicted people diverting medications like Tramadol, Ketamine and Valium, intended for a pet’s care but used by the pet owner instead. 
 
Cindy Heister, a longtime employee at the New Hampshire Board of Veterinary Medicine, part of the state’s department of agriculture, said she has heard that some vets have had suspicions that drugs were being diverted and misused, but they are few in New Hampshire. She said in her 20 years, she can only remember about four times when this was brought to her attention. 
 
“I have heard of Tramadol being a drug of concern since it is a narcotic prescribed to animals,” Heister said. “We would report any information we received on misuse to the State Police. We would not handle it here.” 
 
Representative Carol McGuire, R-Epsom, a sponsor of the bill, said it came about partly because there was an unanticipated fiscal impact to veterinarian’s if they take part in the PDM as the rules are written. She said the bill could be used to amend the rules to address the impact if the Legislature decides vets need to be included in the PDM. 
 
“First, a veterinarian’s patients are not in the PDM database,” McGuire said. “It is extra effort for them to do this. This is also an ethical issue for some vets who do not feel they are equipped to check on the pet owners, who are not their patients.” 
 
McGuire said the result might be that it is no longer mandatory for veterinarians but it could be optional, giving them more leeway on doing the database checks. 
 
State Rep. Jim Belanger, R-Hillsborough, testified in favor of HB291 on Tuesday, on behalf of his son, who is a veterinarian. 
 
“Say my son treated my dog named Buddy, who needs medication for a hip injury,” Belanger said. “If I sent the dog to the vet, he is supposed to do a background check on me? I feel my family’s medical information is none of the vet’s business.” 
 
Belanger said he thinks the bill is too far reaching. 
 
“I understand the concept, what it is intended for,” Belanger said. “I think it is flawed and needs to be looked at. I am not even sure how you could know what a person does with the medication once they leave the vet’s.” 
 
Dr. Steve Crawford, state veterinarian and ex-officio member of the board of veterinarian medicine, said he has not, and will not take an official stand on the bill.  
 
"HB1423 required various prescribing standards, and veterinarian medicine was treated very differently," Crawford said. "Veterinarians would be expected to query the PDM for the pet owner, not for the pet. There were comments from veterinarians and that's partly where this came from." 
 
A big questions from the vets, Crawford said, is what would they be required to do with the information from such a query. 
 
"The vets' concerns are that they cannot make a diagnosis for a person," said Crawford. "The Board of Medicine said vets have to make the query but didn't spell out what to do." 
 
Crawford said some compromises were discussed at Tuesday's public hearing, including using a microchip in the pet as opposed to trying to learn about the pet owner, Another suggestion is that pharmacists could make the query when the pet owner comes in to fill a script. 
 
"There are probably solutions to be found," Crawford said.
