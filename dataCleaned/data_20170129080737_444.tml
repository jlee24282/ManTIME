<TEXT>
The spring season for high school sports begins in less than a month and Inland teams discovered Friday afternoon which CIF Southern Section playoff divisions they will be participating in during the upcoming season This marks the first school year the Southern Section has placed teams into playoff divisions using competitive equity formulas In past years all teams were grouped by leagues into divisions based on league strength A team s placement is determined by performance over a two or three year period There are several noteworthy changes for the 2017 spring sports season Riverside Woodcrest Christian s baseball program made a significant jump moving into Division 2 for the upcoming season Woodcrest Christian won the Division 5 title last season and also advanced to the semifinals in 2015 I m not surprised I knew it was coming Royals coach Glenn Prater said You re going to see good pitching anywhere whether its Division 2 or 5 And we have played a lot of great teams at that level in tournament play over the years Redlands East Valley was elevated to Division 1 in baseball after reaching the Division 2 title game last season Fontana Kaiser last year s Division 4 runner up will be joining Woodcrest Christian in Division 2 this season In softball Grand Terrace Yucaipa and Moreno Valley Valley View will be joining the ranks of Division 1 Grand Terrace captured the Division 3 title last season Yucaipa won the Division 2 title and the mythical national title in 2015 Valley View reached the Division 2 championship game last season Redlands won back to back Division 4 championships in boys tennis so it s not surprising to see the Terriers moved up to Division 2 this season Temecula Great Oak King and Temecula Valley also included in Division 2 each moving up a division Menifee Heritage which won the Division 5 championship last season moved up to Division 4 as did Beaumont and Hemet In boys volleyball Riverside Hillcrest moved up one spot to Division 1 The Trojans will be the lone Inland team competing in the top boys volleyball division While most sports now are using competitive equity there are a couple of exceptions Track and field will continue to use enrollment for division placements while swimming and diving will continue to place teams into playoff divisions by league All of the playoff division placements can be found on the Southern Section s website cifss org Contact the writer Staff writer David Zink contributed to this story
