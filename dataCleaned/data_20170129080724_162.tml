<TITLE>Meghan Smith Helping Dreamers benefits all</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals should remain in place By The American dream describes an ethos at the root of our national identity This ideal conveys that all should be given equal opportunity to achieve success through hard work determination and initiative The original architect of this phrase James Truslow Adams envisioned a nation in which all would have the opportunity to achieve their fullest stature regardless of the situation of their birth A group in our nation that uniquely embodies these ideals is the Dreamers Dreamers are our neighbors co workers and friends who were brought to the United States unlawfully when they were very young For many the U S is the only country they ve ever known Most Dreamers identify as American However due to circumstances outside their control they face significant barriers to integrating fully into our communities Before 2012 Dreamers could not legally work or obtain driver s licenses They lived in constant fear of deportation and have faced significant challenges to pursuing higher education To help prioritize immigration enforcement and remove some of the barriers to achieving the American dream the Obama administration implemented Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals DACA in 2012 DACA provides temporary deportation protection and renewable work permits to those who qualify DACA recipients must be in school have a high school diploma or be a veteran and pass background checks More than 740 000 DACA recipients now are able to contribute more fully to their communities through the ability to secure a job pay more in taxes attend college although they are not eligible for any federal aid and obtain driver s licenses While polls show that most Americans believe this group should be protected many criticized President Barack Obama s use of executive action to protect Dreamers President elect Donald Trump has threatened to overturn Obama s executive orders though what he will do about DACA and Dreamers remains uncertain It is clear that repealing DACA would have disastrous results on our national and state economy The Center for American Progress recently reported that ending DACA would reduce the overall gross domestic product by 433 4 billion over 10 years The hit to South Carolina s GDP would be 247 million annually if workers with DACA were removed from the workforce This is money that goes back into our local economy and community Public schools rightly invest in students and desire for them to be college and career ready regardless of their immigration status Starting in elementary school students are taught the value of a college degree and the skills needed prepare them for a successful career Yet for Dreamers college and a career are within reach with a big asterisk at best For most students high school graduation is a day of boundless opportunity but for Dreamers it can be a day of anxiety and disappointment Through my work at SC Test Prep an area nonprofit that provides college readiness to students who are college bound but have financial need and as a local leader with Bibles Badges and Business for Immigration Reform I have had the privilege of working with Dreamers These are students who achieve good grades volunteer in their communities and aspire to contribute fully to American society despite the constant threat of deportation for those who have not received deferred action A growing movement in Spartanburg through the Spartanburg Area Chamber of Commerce and the Spartanburg Academic Movement encourages a higher level of bachelor s degree attainment among its residents The goal is for 40 percent of Spartanburg residents to have bachelor s degrees by 2030 We cannot overlook how Dreamers can be a part of helping Spartanburg meet this goal With bipartisan support Sen Lindsey Graham has introduced the BRIDGE Act which would temporarily extend protection for those who qualify for DACA while Congress works out a longer term solution The BRIDGE Act is a short term answer for those who believe in what DACA has achieved but believed it was an overreach in presidential power The new Congress has much work to do For the new administration repealing DACA and placing Dreamers in jeopardy of losing their jobs licenses and ability to contribute economically to their communities not to mention deportation should not be a priority Members of Congress should quickly pass the BRIDGE Act Then they should direct their attention to passing long term immigration solutions America is great when all who consider themselves American have the opportunity to pursue success and upward mobility Protecting the vulnerable and providing opportunities for individual achievement embody the values that make our country great Here at home we are one Spartanburg Our entire community will thrive when each resident regardless of the situation of his or her birth has the opportunity to pursue the American dream Meghan Smith of Spartanburg is program director for SC Test Prep and a local leader with Bibles Badges and Business for Immigration Reform
