<TITLE>The mysterious life of America s most popular poet a 13th century Persian</TITLE>
<TEXT>
By Rumi s Secret The Life of the Sufi Poet of Love By Brad Gooch Harper 377 pp 28 99 How wonderful it is that Rumi the 13th century Muslim versifier has become the best selling poet in the United States He might enjoy knowing that Trump s America is snapping up translations of his homoerotically tinged work even as the country toys with banning Muslims and rolling back gay rights Rumi like Omar Khayyam has become the warm and fuzzy ecumenical poet of choice for weddings coming of age ceremonies and funerals A benign mist dews our lens on a golden age Islam Edward Said would rap our bourgeois knuckles for the way we idealize classical Persia Now to rescue Rumi from this inane Orientalizing comes the poet novelist and biographer Brad Gooch with Rumi s Secret A dazzling feat of scholarship but a pedestrian read the book restores Rumi to the glories and hardships of his momentous age Gooch spent nearly eight years on the project learning Persian and traveling to Rumi relevant lands including Tajikistan Uzbekistan Iran Syria and Turkey co translating the verse he quotes steeping himself in scores of books and interviewing Rumi luminaries and acolytes Building particularly on Franklin Lewis Rumi 2000 Gooch manages to paint an accessible tangible portrait of the ancient poet He makes real for us Rumi s boyhood travels from his home in the Tajik village of Vakhsh his studies in Aleppo and Damascus and his family and religious life in Konya in what is now Turkey Gooch explores Rumi s relationship not just with Shams the older spiritual intimate with whom he became obsessed but also later after Shams suspicious disappearance with a goldsmith Salah and then with Hosam trusted longtime friend and treasurer of the informal religious order that had formed around Rumi Shams made Rumi question the expectations for his respectable and predictable future He brought out the religious leader s budding mystic inclinations including an unorthodox love of music and dance in which Rumi s prayers began to evolve into poetry and song Was sex involved in the men s many cloistered hours together While no evidence exists of an erotic component Gooch writes Rumi chose to speak of their spiritual love in the mode of Persian romantic love poetry and from weaving the two came his evanescent message In other words who knows Rumi s masterwork the six volume spiritual epic The Masnavi shivers with infinite devotion but also infinite loss Shams may have been murdered by one of Rumi s sons in jealous conspiracy with other apostles who felt the older mystic was undermining Rumi s calling Or Shams may have felt driven away Or he may have left to teach Rumi a lesson about separation After all he d done that before In any case Shams disappearance absent any resolution perhaps echoed in Rumi s mind other losses such as the death of his father and the destruction of his boyhood homes by the Mongol armies of the Khans whose authority increasingly encroached on Konya as well The book s title Rumi s Secret is more a tease than a biographical agenda For if you consider the secret the nature of Rumi s intimacy with Shams or the perpetual mystery underlying great poetic talent then Rumi s secret rests securely with him in his tomb Then again the poet s secret might be no secret at all Fasting whirling dancing and reciting while Hosam acted as scribe Rumi like mystics before and since may have looked increasingly inward as the outward showed signs of toppling all around him Worn down to his physical spiritual and elegiac essence he turned his back on worldly factions and reached out to Christians and Jews tradesmen and lepers At the risk of heresy he found direct connection to God to Mohammed and to the Koran to which he brazenly considered his Masnavi a complement Rumi s Secret is a strangely dry read considering it has a literally whirling mystic as its subject As if fearing that too lyrical an approach to such an orphic figure would result in incoherence Gooch describes this poet s life in a decidedly unpoetic way He offers conscientious chronology who traveled where studied with whom won which royals as patrons and so on And he gives us some helpful exegesis for instance in explaining a surrealistic dream passage by Rumi drawing on a 40 day period of bread and water subsistence in total isolation But this book won t get anyone excited about Rumi Instead it will give those already excited about Rumi help in contextualizing his work Look at what has become of Aleppo and Damascus the centers of learning of Rumi s young manhood Look at today s tatters of his ecumenical outreach What power compels millions nonetheless to seek out his healing verses One wishes that Gooch for all the years he put into understanding Rumi would offer beyond quotes from a few Rumi scholars and enthusiasts some deeper speculation along these lines Gooch does equip us to make some guesses of our own Perhaps in a world of warlords sects and terror the enduring appeal is the immediate spiritual self determination that Rumi promises Oh brother you are nothing but your thoughts The rest of you is merely skin and bones If your thought is a rose you are a rose garden If your thought is a thorn you are fuel for the fire Or do we see ourselves reflected in Rumi s melancholic ambiguities The religion of love he asserts is beyond all faiths With the Middle East again aflame the West in another bitter parochial crouch one wonders does that mean that supreme love is accessible to all of us or to none Alexander C Kafka has written
