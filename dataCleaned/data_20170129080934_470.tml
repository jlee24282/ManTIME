<TITLE>UPDATE 1-Muslim-majority Indonesia deeply regrets U.S. immigrant vetting plans</TITLE>

JAKARTA Jan 29 (Reuters) - Indonesian Foreign Minister
Retno Marsudi said on Sunday the Muslim-majority nation deeply
regrets President Donald Trump's plans for "extreme vetting" of
people from some Muslim countries entering the United States
under new immigration orders. 
    
In a far-reaching order that caused chaos and confusion
after it was signed late on Friday, Trump put a four-month hold
on allowing refugees into the United States and temporarily
barred travellers from Syria and six other Muslim-majority
countries. 
    
Indonesia, which has the world's largest Muslim population,
is not among the seven nations whose citizens face restrictions.
However, when asked about Trump's plans for "extreme vetting",
Marsudi said in social media message sent to Reuters: "We have
deep regrets about the policy." 
    
In December 2015, Trump called for a ban on all Muslims
entering the United States. The idea drew fire for suggesting a
religious test for immigrants that critics said would violate
the U.S. Constitution and later evolved into a proposal for
"extreme vetting". 
    
Most of Indonesia's 220 million Muslims practise a moderate
form of Islam, although the country has some vocal Islamist
groups and has suffered in the past from attacks by militants. 
    
Indonesia has close relations with the United States and
many of its citizens think highly of former U.S. President
Barack Obama, who spent part of his childhood in Jakarta. 
    
Indonesian President Joko Widodo said after Trump's
inauguration he was optimistic that relations between the
countries would strengthen, to the benefit of both.
