<TITLE>What's being done to fix UC Riverside's broken buildings?</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Faculty complaints of poor lab and classroom conditions get renewed – and faster – attention UC Riverside administrators say they are working to address recent complaints about the conditions of labs and classrooms on campus. There has reportedly been a flurry of activity in the past several weeks to address leaky roofs, broken equipment, peeling paint and other conditions some say make the campus appear substandard.

The complaints were aired at a town hall meeting late last year, during which faculty also complained about adequate classroom and laboratory space. Subsequent interviews with personnel revealed conditions that ranged from what some instructors called “embarrassing” to those that actually hinder researchers from conducting experiments.

Following the town hall meeting, Chancellor Kim Wilcox announced personnel changes in the administration of the facilities department. In an interview in December, he said repair and renovation projects were being prioritized.

“We’ve been working hard in the last few weeks to move that along faster,” Wilcox said.

One of the changes Wilcox made was to put Mike Pazzani, vice chancellor of research, in charge of overseeing the campus’ facilities. Pazzani said he realizes there is a serious problem.

“We all feel the urgency of this,” he said. “It’s unfair for faculty not to be able to do their research and for students not to have classrooms.”

Physics professor Ward Beyerman said his lab struggles with keeping a suitably clean environment.

“There’s a lot of black stuff that comes out of the ventilators,” Beyerman said.” Sometimes you’ll come in and there’s black stuff all over your desk. In any lab where they’re doing optical experiments if you have dirt coming in from the ventilation system, that degrades the optics. Optics get dirty with time. Here that time period is a lot shorter than one might expect.”

Beyerman said his team has installed filters in the ventilation system, but they don’t completely take care of the problem. And there are other issues as well.

There is water damage from leakage in the walls, he said. The lab sits partly below grade.

“We have seepage in places,” he said. It has damaged lab equipment, he added.

Pazzani said he has accelerated repair and renovation work. Over the recent holiday break, he said, about 30 faculty offices were painted and new carpeting was installed in the campus’ largest lecture hall. Damaged seats in the 500-seat hall – Pazzani estimated 5 percent needed repair or replacement – were also fixed.

The campus has about $100 million in deferred maintenance, he said, noting that was not unusual for a university the size of UCR. However, he added, at the two other universities where he has worked – UC Irvine and Rutgers – “they were are little bit quicker at getting these things done.”

Many of the problems faculty complained about pre-date Wilcox’s tenure. The degrading of some facilities, researchers said, is a long-standing issue.

One researcher, who declined to be named, said leaks in the roof of the entomology lab – also an old building – require workers there to put out buckets when it rains. It’s been a problem for at least 10 years, he said, and has resulted in large areas where the paint has peeled away and hangs from the ceiling. Periodically, dissolved concrete falls from the ceiling.
