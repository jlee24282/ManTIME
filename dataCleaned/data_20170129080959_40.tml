<TITLE>Learning how to weigh variables takes practice</TITLE>
<TEXT>
In a perfect world you d have a poker coach whispering in your ear when it s time to act telling you what to think and how to weigh those thoughts In reality you have to rely on your own ability knowing what to consider and how to balance the variables Every critical poker decision begins by taking into consideration past patterns present conditions and the likelihood of future behaviors both in the current hand and over the course of play A player has to weigh the strength of these variables with feel and analysis working together With practice this gets easier I ve been working closely with one of my favorite students Donald who came to me a far greater fan of consistency than creativity Mastering what and how to think would require each of these attributes and after a few hundred hands he may have gotten a taste Donald was sitting with 1 200 at a 2 5 no limit cash game at Bellagio He woke up with red kings in middle position and raised to 20 Action folded to the small blind who thought for a long time before calling which suggested that he was considering a raise That s excellent information to have moving forward in a hand The flop came Ac 9h 6d The small blind checked Old Donald would have applied a broad stroke play and made a continuation bet Alex coached New Donald thought it through If he was ahead he d earn no money by betting because of the ace If he was behind he d be throwing money away by betting If he checked and was behind he d save his money and still have a chance for a miracle If he was ahead how much did he risk by checking There were likely two outs for his opponent at best Checking would also make Donald look weak providing an opportunity for a bluff Donald checked The turn came 4h and Donald s opponent bet 30 Donald considered the intention Why would an ace bet so much if I look weak Donald committed to the likelihood that his check trapped his opponent into bluffing He called because raising would likely prompt a fold The river was the 10c The opponent checked There was no reason for Donald to assume a trap as Donald hadn t been aggressive post flop Value time Donald wanted his opponent to call light which meant Donald had to appear weak Betting too small on the river would give the appearance of strength so Donald bet 60 into a 105 pot The opponent called and turned up Js Jc Donald won extracting maximum value Donald considered his past pattern of always continuation betting the flop He adjusted He accounted for the likelihood of what his opponent might do based on whether Donald checked or bet When the opponent revealed more and more information about his hand range Donald adjusted each time accounting for the past present and future with his decisions When your process truly accounts for past present and future considerations and you manage them effectively you can create exploitable scenarios Welcome to poker heaven Alex Outhred is a poker coach and poker player with more than 500 000 in live and online poker tournament winnings He has cashed in more than a dozen WSOP events Follow him on Twitter alexpokerguy
