<TITLE>Editorial: State progress in graduation rates is no triumph</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Oregon’s graduation rate rose incrementally for the class of 2016. While this certainly isn’t bad news, it’s hardly reason for wild celebration. The state still has a long way to go. 
 
The state Department of Education’s announcement tried to stay positive. 
 
“Oregon’s graduation rate continues to climb according to data released today,” the news release said. “More importantly, the graduation rate for almost all historically underserved student populations grew at a faster rate than the overall graduation rate.” 
 
Despite the improvement, about 25 percent of Oregon high school students don’t graduate from high school. And at least by the measure of graduation rates, Oregon schools are some of the worst in the country. Oregon has the third lowest graduation rate in the United States. 
 
In Central Oregon, some districts did see bigger changes. Redmond School District went from a 71 percent graduation rate in 2014-15 to 79 percent in 2015-16. Crook County School District leapt up from 46 percent to 68 percent over the same time period. Part of the explanation in Crook County is that Insight School of Oregon was not included in the Crook County data, according to a story by Bulletin reporter Kailey Fisicaro. 
 
Some districts basically stayed the same. Bend schools stayed at 77 percent, though the number ticked fractionally upward. 
 
Educators say they are not satisfied with the state’s performance. Neither should you be.
