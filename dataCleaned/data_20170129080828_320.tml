<TITLE>Yakima County gang court fizzles after little success</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Jump started by a 300 000 grant Yakima County courts embarked five years ago on an ambitious program intended to deter youths from gangs and set them on a more promising path But the gang court program is set to close in May when its sole current participant is expected to graduate Several factors led to the demise of the program The original two year 300 000 Gates grant wasn t renewed and finding willing and qualified participants was tough at best said county court consultant Herald Delia who helped start the program in 2011 Of the 234 juvenile cases considered for the program a mere 28 were accepted Of those only eight completed the program and only two stayed out of trouble When we started we thought Wow this is going to be something kids and parents are going to latch onto but they just didn t Delia said You can bring them to the water but you can t force them to drink Several factors undermined participation in the yearlong court program said Juvenile Court Administer Candi Shute Qualifications to enter the program were narrow and the program required a significant commitment Youths entering the program must commit to several requirements such as substance abuse treatment family therapy intended to empower parents and community service in exchange for having their charges deferred They also have to check in with a probation officer daily and attend court weekly during the first several months of the program requirements that taper off as they make progress Those allowed into the program typically face charges that would result in a month s detention and a year s probation Shute said Most who would qualify for the program would rather sit the 30 days in detention and be through with the matter rather than undergo the yearlong program she said And all parties involved the youths parents a probation officer prosecuting and defense attorneys have to agree to the court program And anyone can refuse Shute said Youths who face or previously faced charges involving weapons aren t allowed into the court program nor are those who are deeply entrenched in gangs Shute said The program is for those who are on the fringe of gang life she said The numbers have not been encouraging Of the eight who graduated the program six had offended again Shute said Those eight kids did great things in the program they did everything that was expected she said What happened after they completed the program I don t know But that doesn t mean the effort was a failure she added I don t think it was a failure I think it really opened people s minds to what you can do with kids she said But you look at the numbers and it s not successful The loss of the grant that funded intervention specialists former gang members who moved on to more positive lives was a crippling factor Delia said Every day Yakima Police officers respond to several hundred incidents This app displays details of incidents handled by the Yakima Police Department over the last 30 days SHOW MAP Youths on the fringe of gang life need mentors who have been there and made their way out he said Losing them that was significant Delia said We hoped that the program would be looked at nationally and would receive long term funding Shutes said other priorities for Gates money bumped it Now the juvenile court is looking at reshaping its approach to all youths and making the specialized services available in gang court to everyone said Shute who took the helm two years ago At that time she began probing the program and reasons it wasn t as successful as hoped She found that many services being offered in gang court were already available in general court There was a lot of overlap she said Overall the court will take a therapeutical approach to youths coming into the system requiring family therapy substance abuse treatment and other resources to help youths stray from crime and gangs We re going to put our everything into a court that addresses what gang court did she said We re trying to move in a direction where we pick out all the good things we were doing in gang court and say why not make this available to all youth
