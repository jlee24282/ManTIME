This student - who did not want to be named - says her car was stolen on the UKZN Westville campus in September last year. She says it was later recovered by a vehicle tracking company. 

 
"Personally, I feel this campus is being targeted on a daily basis, or maybe weekly - there are vehicles that are going missing, and it hasn't being brought to the attention of people on this campus. Only when we go to report an incident with our vehicles, then we know a vehicle has been stolen or tampered with," she said.

UKZN spokesperson, Lesiba Seshoka, says campus security has been briefed. 
 
"We are quite hopeful that with the improved security measures we have put in place, we won't have these crimes anymore," he said. 
 
Seshoka has appealed to students to ensure their vehicles are locked at all times, and that their belongings stowed away safely.
