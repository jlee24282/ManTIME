A woman’s dead body was found in Gulshan 2 area of the capital yesterday. 

Rani, 35, was found lying dead in a pool of blood on Road 43 around midnight Friday, Dhaka Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner (Gulshan Zone) Rafiqul Islam told the Dhaka Tribune. 

Police took the body to Dhaka Medical College morgue for an autopsy. Two bullets were found inside her body, Dr Sohel Mahmud, the head of the forensic department, said. 

She was shot twice on the left side of her chest, he added. 

AC Rafiqul said police were analysing video footages collected from CCTV cameras around the spot. 

Lodging of a case was underway at Gulshan Police Station, he said. 

Rani was identified at the morgue by her younger sister Shahnaz. She lived in Kazibari in Kuril Bishwa Road area, Shahnaz said. 

She said Rani worked at night and on Friday she left her six-year-old daughter with Shahnaz, who lives in the Kuril slum. Rani was divorced five years ago, and her son Shanto, 18, lives with the father in Jamalpur. 

The sisters were originally from Jaflong, Sylhet. 

SI Faruk of the Gulshan Police said the body was brought to DMC around 12:45am yesterday. 

“It looked like there was a road accident. There was a lot of blood,” he said.
