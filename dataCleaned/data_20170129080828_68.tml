<TITLE>Curry scores 43 as Golden State blasts Clippers</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Oakland Apparently that Stephen Curry quad injury was no cause for worry whatsoever He had fresh frisky legs and then some on Saturday night and left the Los Angeles Clippers grabbing their own hamstrings Curry had his best all around eye candy performance of the season and the Warriors followed his lead in an absolute 144 98 demolition of the Clippers at Oracle Arena They shot 62 5 percent in exploding out to a 21 point halftime lead then really dropped the hammer and pinned a 45 point third quarter on L A with their two time MVP guard looking every bit the part of lead entertainer and destroyer The Clippers were playing without veteran point guard and leader Chris Paul who is recovering from thumb surgery but it s unlikely Paul would have made that much of a difference on this night even if he d brought Michael Jordan along The Warriors came out smoking from the start and simply took it their alleged rivals at both ends of the floor It was a most impressive way to win their eighth straight against their Southern California foes and also post their NBA best 40th victory against just seven losses But Curry was particularly energized scoring 43 points to go with nine rebounds and six assists over a mere three quarters and he finished the first half with a exclamation point flourish like only he can With just under 30 seconds to go he made a ridiculous baseline bounce pass between the legs of the Clippers Jamal Crawford to Andre Iguodala under the basket for a dunk Iguodala was so wowed by it he couldn t hold back a chuckle Curry was just getting started As time ticked off under five seconds Curry out jumped 7 foot L A center DeAndre Jordan for a rebound raced to mid court and let fly with a 50 footer from the center circle that swished through with 1 7 seconds to go It only added to Curry lore on such miracle shots There s probably a 50 50 chance it s going in and I think that s pretty high said Draymond Green After you see something so many times you just know there s a good chance it s going to go The long bomb gave the Warriors a 72 51 lead and the Clippers were effectively finished But Steph wasn t He continued to light up Oracle in the third with a 25 point quarter that was vintage highest level Curry He made 8 of 11 shots including 5 of 8 3 point tries and was plus 22 just for those 12 minutes alone as the Warriors expanded the lead to as many as 43 Curry outscored the Clippers all by himself in that quarter by two points Curry was so dynamic it allowed starting All Star teammate Kevin Durant to have a quiet 23 point game in which he made 9 of 11 shots with seven assists It was that kind of night Even James Michael McAdoo went for double figures with 10 So Steph about that quad tightness that had everyone worrying you might not even play Since we didn t have a shoot around I didn t know how it was going to react once I got moving and doing basketball activity he said I was pretty confident from the time I woke up that I was going to be able to go but you don t really know until you get out on the court to test it out Already leading by 10 the Warriors small lineup smacked the Clippers with a 17 6 run over the final 2 minutes of the opening half and the rout was on Curry said the half court shot might have had some carryover effect both for himself and his team My coach at Davidson Bob McKillop always talked about big mo going into the half Curry said If you can get a stop or a buzzer beater it usually has a carryover effect for the team Me personally you see a shot like that go in you re obviously thinking about it at halftime and I made my first shot coming out in the third quarter so that just continued the trend Curry joked that his rebound over Jordan was an illusion and that his between the legs bounce pass to Iguodala was from the coach s eyes probably one of those no no no oh good pass situations And speaking of big mo Curry also had a dribble drive layup past ex teammate Marreese Mo Buckets Speights earlier in the game It was a good pick and roll situation and I tried to get him activated Curry said with a grin We can t it easy on him even though we love Mo around here The Warriors didn t take it easy on any of the Clippers playing stout defense much of the night to set up their lethal transition offense A signature play in the first half occurred when Green blocked powerful L A forward Blake Griffin driving to the rim then raced to the end while Griffin was still gathering himself and blasted home a driving dunk I thought Draymond was tremendous said coach Steve Kerr His numbers aren t going to wow anybody but his defense was phenomenal and I thought that block he had on Blake was one of the key plays of the game just to fuel us It got the crowd into it and that s when we broke the game open
