<TITLE>Dvor k Piano Trios Op 65 90 CD review an exemplary</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Trio Wanderer Harmonia Mundi T he Trio Wanderer now 30 years old sounds as sparkling and zestful as ever in Dvor k s infectious Dumky trio Op 90 truly a work to lift spirits though not without melancholy The last of the composer s works for the medium it bursts with Slavonic dance rhythms and lyrical folk melody wonderfully captured by this incisive French ensemble The Op 65 trio is less well known but deserving of attention The passionate big boned style of its opening Allegro brings to mind the style of Dvor k s great friend Brahms though the Scherzo returns to more familiar springy Dvor k terrain and the energetic finale could be by no other composer This is virtuosic playing of a high order
