Newcastle s W League side enter a new era facing philosophical questions Jets women s coach Craig Deans will sit down with chief executive Lawrie McKinna in the coming weeks to chart a course for the W League team after it comes under the A League club s control this year The young Jets bowed out of the finals race after losing 2 0 to fourth placed Melbourne City on Friday night in Coffs Harbour It was the third straight year Newcastle had missed out after playing the fourth placed side in the last round needing three points to leapfrog into the finals Northern NSW Football has run the women s team since Nathan Tinkler reneged on his promise to fund it but the Martin Lee owned Jets will take over before the next W League season The Jets field a W League side heavy on locally produced players and spend about half of the 150 000 salary cap The top teams in the league spend the full cap amount and are littered with Matildas stars I ll have to have a sit down with Lawrie and see where they want to take it and what their focus is going to be on Deans said Whether it s local players still or what sort of connections they might have within women s football There s some good players in China so they might want to look at that sort of thing I think Friday and the last three games we ve had nine Newcastle girls in the squad of 15 on match day That s a pretty high ratio Lots of local players which is good and they re contributing pretty well to the team so I m happy to continue down that path but that s obviously going to take a bit of time because they re all young That s a longer path or you could go down the path of trying to entice some Matildas here which obviously costs you more money Deans said there was a clear correlation between spending and success in the W League where Canberra Perth Sydney FC and City finished in the top four I think Perth would spend a little bit less than others but definitely I think the top three would be Canberra Sydney and Melbourne he said You come back to us who are probably at about 50 per cent of the cap I enjoy trying to develop our own players but I think it s pretty obvious that when we come up against a team like on Friday night that s got five or six Matildas and four internationals you re going to be a fair way off the mark Deans who is keen to coach the team next season said the NNSWF run Emerging Jets program was also a factor in determining how to operate the W League side The argument is that we ve got this fantastic academy program which is producing some good players and we re bringing them into our W League team I don t mind that path It just takes a bit more time and a bit more patience The academy s only been going three years and you re not going to get a mature footballer out of that until your Clare Wheelers and Ash Brodigans and even Grace Macintyre until they get into their early 2
