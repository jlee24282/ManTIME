<TEXT>
Day one is here for the main draw of the 2017 Caterpillar Burnie International and organisers are hopeful a Tasmanian wildcard can impress on court. Day one is here for the main draw of the 2017 Caterpillar Burnie International and organisers are hopeful a Tasmanian wildcard can impress on court. Hobart’s Harry Bourchier will compete in round one of the men’s draw after receiving a wildcard entry to the Burnie tournament and will face the challenge of Matthew Ebden. 

Tournaments and Competitions Coordinator, Luke Lehmann said he hoped to see Bourchier impress on court following the loss of Launceston’s Tom Youl in qualifying. 

“Being from Tassie, Harry Bourchier in the main draw is exciting and I hope a lot of people get down here and get behind him,” Lehmann said. 

“It’s certainly good to see he’s in the main draw as a wildcard.

“Tom Youl was unfortunate yesterday in qualifying but it’s all experience for these guys and hopefully Harry can get through a bit of the draw.”

With so many top athletes on the Coast, Lehmann said the response from the new-look courts had been fantastic ahead of day one. 

“It’s good to have Burnie back on the pro-tour calendar, I think that’s the biggest thing and we are so proud to have it back. 

“With the amount of players we’ve had for qualifiers for both men and women, it shows how much Burnie is loved. We’re excited to have day one for the main draw starting and the response for the place has been absolutely positive.

“There’s been a lot of work put in to get it where it is now and the committee should be applauded for that.”
