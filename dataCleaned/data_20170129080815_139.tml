<TITLE>What the Supreme Court Owes to the Supreme Being</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Perhaps it is spiritually fortuitous that this Sunday’s standard Christian readings thematically dovetail so nicely with current events. 
 
As much of the national news focuses on this week’s expected announcement from Donald Trump about who he will nominate for the Supreme Court, all four readings involve themes of justice, wisdom, judgment, mercy, and kindness. Understood correctly, there are lessons in these readings for both the secular world and the world of faith. 
 
Most sermons this week surely will focus on the famous “beatitudes,” Jesus’ “Sermon on the Mount” in which he laid out his central teachings for how we should understand God’s mercy. We are told, of course, that “blessed are the meek,” the “merciful,” the “pure in heart,” the “peacemakers,” and so on through the familiar litany. 
 
In a much pithier way, a single Old Testament verse from Micah (also in today’s readings) rather well encompasses the same entire message of the Beatitudes: The Lord requires us “to do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God.” (Indeed, if one wants to sum up the entire Bible in just three very short passages, one could probably just cite that Micah verse, and Christ’s two great commandments in Matthew 22:38-39 to love our neighbor and our God, and John 3:16 about God giving his one and only son so that we may have eternal life.) 
 
Yet, while the Beatitudes and the verse from Micah justly command attention (and each could and should inspire numerous, learned, lengthy essays and sermons), one would be remiss in not also pondering the two other readings. Psalm 15 tells us that to dwell on God’s holy hill we should “walk blamelessly, and do what is right, and speak the truth from [our] heart… and stand by [our] oath even to [our] hurt.” And Corinthians tells us that all “the wisdom of the world” is mere foolishness in comparison with the wisdom of God. It goes further still, emphasizing St. Paul’s favorite theme that we are incapable of achieving salvation through our own wisdom and efforts alone – and that therefore God saves us not specifically because we always do the right thing (because none of us ever does the right thing every time) but instead “to save those who believe.” 
 
All of which leads to what appears a contradiction: We are told again and again to do good, act wisely, be humble, be generous, etcetera, but then appear to be told (at first glance) that none of this really matters because salvation comes from belief, from faith, alone. 
 
This is not the place to review the entire “works versus faith” debate, the centuries of discord that it entailed, or the growing realization that faith and works aren’t exclusive of each other but instead can work in harmony with each other. Instead, what is important when considering these readings together is not that one or another path leads to salvation, but that Scripture taken as a whole outlines different prescriptions and different standards for different situations and different realms.
