<TITLE>Not a temper tantrum Millions around the world promoted unity and kindness with the Women s March</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Last weekend millions gathered all over the world in 2017 s Women s March In Moscow alone approximately 2 500 people of all identities came together to bring awareness to a multitude of issues in our society Despite its name I don t believe the Women s March was solely meant to bring attention to a lack of gender equality in society or cry about the nation s new president Donald Trump and his reputation to say mean things No I did not witness a sea of people shedding tears or rioting and burning cars Instead I saw a group of people standing for something standing for equality for the environment for kindness for unity Mihaela Karst Argonaut That was what I went home thinking about after the march I marveled at the possibility that thousands of people from all backgrounds could come together in an attempt to bring awareness to current issues To be clear the Women s March was not a protest against President Trump demanding he steps down from his new position For every anti Trump poster I saw two posters demanding safety for the LGBTQA community three posters demanding gender equality and five posters demanding the world take better care of the earth And for the few posters I did see referring to President Trump I only saw references to his treatment of women in the past not demands that he vacate the White House I saw personal quotes demonstrating verbal abuse to women all in an attempt to bring awareness that this treatment is unacceptable Regardless of opinion President Trump is not going away He is now the President of the United States of America and the nation knows that To me the Women s March was simply a demonstration that we as a country stand as one united against prejudice hate and anger The amount of kindness and strength I felt while walking along the streets of Moscow was unparalleled I felt part of a greater force and it gave me hope that no matter the trials the country may face there is enough good to overcome it It was not a time for crybabies to come together and mourn the loss of Hillary Clinton It was not a time for angry millennials to stomp their feet in a tantrum for not getting their way It was a time for people all over the world to unite and perpetuate a long lost sense of kindness It was a time for people to unite against prejudice and peacefully shout that the country will no longer stand for hate On Jan 21 the world united to send a single message love trumps hate Mihaela Karst can be reached at arg opinion uidaho edu or on Twitter mihaela jo
