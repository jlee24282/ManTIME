<TITLE>Senior Update for Jan. 29</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Rainbow City Seniors Club 
 
Rainbow City Seniors Club closed the month (and year) with a membership of 56. 
 
Meeting room and tables were decorated with a Christmas Tree surrounded by “Toys for Tots” donated by members. Tables held vases of red and white poinsettias and miniature trees. 
 
Visitors for the month were Peter Romersa, Christian Amos, Jon and Mary Costa and Willie Morgan. 
 
Margie White provided the cake for the drawing, with Mildred McCartney as the winner. 
 
Jean Bearden won the Pot of Gold (50/50). 
 
Sue Davis, Era Bush, Nina Teneraani, Sarah Mitchell, Bonnie Foreman, Imogene Wallace and Jim Driskill celebrated birthdays. 
 
Anniversaries for Margie White and Maxine and Tommy Mintz were recognized. 
 
Members James Simpson and Bill Rouse led us in singing Christmas carols. We also enjoyed the CDs of Annie Dixon. 
 
Jon Costa spoke to our group about “Drivers’ Awareness.” We were not aware of many of the points he discussed. Jon encouraged us to register for classes he will teach in January and March. 
 
Officers for 2017 were installed by Deanna Urban. 
 
Winners of the bingo games called by Patsy Duck, Mary Elliott, Linda Farley and Billie Joe Basson were: Bill Rouse, Diana Taylor, Loretta Williams, Patsy Duck, Martha Gardner, Billie Joe Basson, Niokka Pankey and Warren Wheeler, with Mary Fox winning two times. 
 
We are looking forward to the events in 2017.

Lookout Mountain Nutrition Center 
 
Lookout Mountain Nutrition Center held its annual Christmas party. About 25 attended and enjoyed pizza, salad and lots of desserts. Several door prizes were given and visitors were recognized. They were Commissioner Johnny Grant, Director of Rural Transportation Lora Weaver and Administrative Assistant Loritha Anderson. 
 
We would like to invite anyone age 60 or above to come join us at the center, 4567 Lay Springs Road. We’re open from 8:30 a.m. until 12:30 p.m. five days a week and play dominoes, card games and others or just visit with friends and have lunch. This is catered by Valley Foods and donations are voluntary. This program sponsored by East Alabama gives seniors an opportunity to socialize and we have a lot of fun. Come on up.
