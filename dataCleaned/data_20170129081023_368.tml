5:29 AM GMT   
Chelsea will begin their preparations for the 2018-19 Premier League campaign with a preseason match against A-League side Perth Glory. 

 
The friendly, scheduled to be played in mid-2018 at the new Perth Stadium is expected to attract 65,000 fans. 

 
Glory CEO Peter Filopoulos said it was an enormous opportunity for Australian sporting fans to see one of the best and biggest clubs in the world playing in their own backyard. 

 
"This will not only help grow and foster football in Western Australia but will expose Perth Glory's brand to a new market and millions of viewers and fans around the globe," Filopoulos said. 

 
"This will be Chelsea's only match in Australia during the A-League pre-season campaign and will play an important role in Perth Glory's preparations for the 2018-19 season." 

 
The tour will also allow for coaching and community appearances by Perth and Chelsea players. 

 
Ticketing and match details on the Chelsea fixture are yet to be finalised.
