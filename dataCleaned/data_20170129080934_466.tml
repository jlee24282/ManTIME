Donald Trump: US President’s Immigration Policy Sparks Protests In JFK Airport [VIDEO]  

 
Protesters are angry over the refusal of immigration officials to allow immigrants and refugees from Muslim nations into the US. 
 The immigration ban ordered by the United States President, Donald Trump, has sparked protests at the John F. Kennedy International Airport  
Protesters are angry over the refusal of immigration officials to allow immigrants and refugees from Muslim nations into the US, reports say. 
 
Trump, on Friday, January 27, 2017, signed an order putting in place a 120-day hold on entry of refugees to the U.S. 
 
According to New York Times, “Trump’s order also stops the admission of refugees from Syria indefinitely, and it bars entry into the United States for 90 days from seven predominantly Muslim countries linked to concerns about terrorism. Those countries are Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen.” 
 
This order apparently has not gone down well with most Americans, who have blasted Trump for his policies. 
 
Even the United Nations Organisation (UN) had to caution the US President on his latest immigration policy. 
 
Facebook CEO, Mark Zuckerberg also came out against President Trump's executive orders on immigration policy in a lengthy post on his Facebook page Friday, Business Insider reports. 
 
According to AFP, French President Francois Hollande has vowed a "firm" response to Trump’s policies.
