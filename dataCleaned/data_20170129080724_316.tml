RUSTON - COURTESY LA TECH SPORTS INFORMATION 

Ty Petty and Alex Johnson combined for 49 points and Middle Tennessee scored 34 fourth quarter points to down Louisiana Tech 79-65 Saturday afternoon in Conference USA action at the Thomas Assembly Center. 

The Blue Raiders (12-8, 7-2 C-USA) snapped LA Tech’s three-game winning streak in a game that saw the Lady Techsters (10-10, 5-4 C-USA) lead by three with just over six minutes to play before Middle Tennessee rallied. 

“I give Ty Petty a lot of credit,” said Tech head coach Brooke Stoehr. “She made some plays late and Alex Johnson is a tough match-up inside. Petty is a very experienced senior guard and she was a big reason for their finish. Middle is an experienced team that has won a lot of games during the last decade. 

“I thought we did a pretty good job against Johnson for most of the game, but she is so tough inside. I said she was the best post player we have faced this year and she showed people why. It’s a game where we put ourselves in position but just didn’t make the plays late. 

“They had about 10 straight possessions (in the fourth quarter) where they either scored or got to the free throw line. We didn’t do as good of a job making Petty use the screen and she hurt us. I thought the three-pointer (Charity Savage) hit was big for them.” 

After trailing by as many as 13 points in the first half when Abbey Sissmon’s three-pointer gave the Blue Raiders a 35-22 advantage with 2:41 to play before halftime. However, Tech scored the final seven points of the half including Kierra Anthony’s runner off the glass as the first half buzzer sounded to cut the deficit to 35-29 at the half. 

Anthony scored 15 of her career-high tying 23 points in the first half keeping the Lady Techsters in the game, a contest that saw 51 fouls called and 48 free throws shot.
