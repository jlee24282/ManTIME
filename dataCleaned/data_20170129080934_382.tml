<TITLE>Commentary Let s take a walk together</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Orlando R Barone is a writer in Doylestown Let s take a walk We all know what that means I am inviting you to go out with me on foot and the arriving is entirely secondary to the walking It makes every bit as much sense to take a walk to the store as it does to take a walk around the block right back to where we started Pope Francis is a big fan of walking He said When you are walking anything can happen It s catching on too One of the most famous walks in the world the Camino de Santiago in northwestern Spain attracts more pilgrims than ever and the 500 mile trek has existed for more than a thousand years I was there a few years ago my wife s family is from Galicia and marveled at the mishmash of humanity ambling to the end point the Cathedral of St James Walking is an attention getter If your boss says Come to my office you sense something formal or instructive is about to be related If instead the boss comes up to you and says Walk with me you might detect an imminent moment of intimacy revelation even vulnerability A walk is an empty thing We fill it as we go That squirrel crossing our path grabbing an acorn and scurrying up a nearby tree could not have been planned You simply encounter it feel it perhaps try to figure out a meaning for it Even walks with purpose have this quality of emptiness a waiting container that will be filled by whatever stands in the path A friend who attended a political march and rally was rocked not by the affirmation of her reason for being there but by the overwhelming encounters with so many different people and passions A walk is also about the future You may glance side to side at your companion maybe and you might even look back for a second but your eyes are forced forward Your orientation is toward where you are going not where you are In the Boy Scouts I sometimes took night hikes in which my only illumination was a measly flashlight trained on the ground directly in front of me It s all you need Mr McCusker would say correctly Walking is a deceleration of life I slow down to a walk I don t speed up to a walk That means I am choosing to invest precious time and effort to the trip It can be momentous If I am walking the 10 miles to work instead of driving I am doing something astonishing If I commit to the 470 mile Camino across Spain or a portion of the 2 200 mile Appalachian Trail I am likely making a life altering investment Walking is a shedding Ask any college student about the care it takes to strut around campus all day making sure that backpack is not too cumbersome When you walk you ask seriously and not frivolously Do I really need to take this with me It s no wonder that many religions make walking sacred The Hajj The Kumano Kodo The Camino de Santiago the Stations of the Cross One of the most revered speeches of our history Dr King s I Have a Dream speech took place after a walk When we humans want to memorialize a cause or an event as often as not we do it by walking from the Thanksgiving Day parade to the Walk to Defeat ALS Ultimately walking is a gift To fully realize this imagine a doctor saying you ll never walk again or helping a loved one rehab a knee replacement or witnessing a child s first step So let s take a walk you and me You ll meet your future squirrels and all You ll be fascinated bored excited confused exhausted exhilarated and finally at rest Anything can happen Like life for instance orby114 aol com
