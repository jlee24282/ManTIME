<TITLE>UFC on Fox 23 Highlight Video: Watch Francis Ngannou Lift Andrei...</TITLE>
<TEXT>
[embedded content] 
 
There was some that thought that maybe, just maybe, former UFC heavyweight champion Andrei Arlovski would pose a serious threat to rising contender Francis Ngannou or at least give him a tough test. As it turned out, Ngannou is better than expected and Arlovski has been tumbling down the wrong side of the hill for a while. Just as their duel was getting warm, Arlovski missed a wild overhand right, only to get clipped by a loopy left hook and a right uppercut. The second punch floored the Belarusian, allowing the France resident to pound away with punches from on top while Arlovski turtle up. The end came just 92 seconds into the fight.
