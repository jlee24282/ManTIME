<TITLE>Downtown Mount Dora shops help each other succeed</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Downtown Mount Dora is known for its unique and eclectic shops, but sometimes small businesses can face challenges when competing with larger franchises. That’s why many business owners in the area are working together to create a one-of-a-kind experience. 
 
“When you’re working together, I think everyone flourishes,” said Kelly Davant, owner of KayDee Kay Gourmet Kitchen Products. “I’m so thankful that the city helps protect us from being taken over from larger chain stores and helps keep our small businesses going. It makes a huge difference.” 
 
KaDee Kay is at the corner of Alexander Street and 4th Avenue, near where a few of the businesses have started integrating services for special events. 
 
Twice a month, KaDee Kay hosts a cooking class featuring many of the gourmet products sold in the store. The class is taught by Alex Gandia, head chef at Pisces Rising, which is next door. 
 
“This is a good thing for both of us,” Gandia said. “Many locals come to our restaurant and want to learn about our recipes and how to prepare these dishes. So we have come together to create a class where people get to learn not only how to cook but the history and health facts surrounding the dish. And then we all get to sit and enjoy a meal.” 
 
Gandia believe in the farm-to-table philosophy, meaning he uses as much locally grown food as possible for the dishes at Pisces Rising. Most of the produce comes from Tavares and Clermont, which helps support local farmers. 
 
Maggie’s Attic has also joined the parnership by providing an assortment of wines to complement the meals. 
 
“We always refer each other and send customers over,” Maggie’s Attic owner Stephanie Abbott said. “It helps promote downtown Mount Dora by keeping that friendly atmosphere.” 
 
Davant said she agrees supporting each other is the only way to survive downtown. 
 
“When a new tenant moves in, we all try to help support one another,” she said. “Locals allow our small businesses to make it through the summer months so it’s very important to build a great relationship with each other. If I don’t have something, I make sure to know who does have it and refer them to their store. It’s how we keep each other going.”
