<TITLE>Athletes Get most out of college</TITLE>

Joe E Cervi by Joe e Cervi Sports A few years ago I walked into the media center of a local high school and was immediately awash in colored balloons and streamers There was a long table with name cards There were dozens and dozens of people There were proud smiles that lit up the room There was confetti There was cake There were speeches about how the best of the best were now ready to take the next step This particular high school had a bumper crop of athletes There were five in particular who stood above the rest They were good in football basketball baseball and track They were big strong fast and agile The losses these athletes experienced in high school mostly came deep in the postseason They were that successful It was fun watching them grow as they won And they won often These were the multisport can t miss kids coaches dream about Together they decided to take their talents to the next level at Colorado State University Pueblo This budding Division II football program was getting the nucleus the heart and soul of one of the most successful prep football programs in the state On that day national signing day five of Pueblo s best declared that they were staying home They wanted to play in front of friends and family They wanted to be a part of the growth at CSU Pueblo They were positive that their winning ways would continue in college Of those five only one stuck with the ThunderWolves That number was a little surprising considering the talent those five possessed But one in five is about right For every five Pueblo kids who sign on the dotted line one sticks it out That is not a scientific fact merely an educated guess from someone who has covered national sign day for more than a quarter century The reasons athletes don t make it to the finish line are as varied as the athletes themselves Kids grow up and acquire other interests They fall in love They get jobs Those who are good enough to earn college scholarships in sports have been playing those sports for so long that burnout is a real possibility Life and all that entails far too often gets in the way If I had a dollar for every kid from Pueblo who signed a national letter of intent junior college NAIA Division II Division I whatever who didn t last their allotted time at said institution I could buy my own damn cake That is not to label those athletes failures Not at all It is what it is especially if those athletes aren t getting enough money to cover college and living expenses It takes a special kind of person not just an athlete to make it in intercollegiate athletics To student athletes who will sign their name this Wednesday national signing day enjoy the moment and embrace the opportunity ahead Smile for pictures that will no doubt add to the bulging scrapbooks Then look beyond the decorations and see the bigger picture Someone is willing to help you financially with your college education Remember that Take advantage of that Whether you are getting a full ride at s a major university or a small stipend to help with tuition and books a tiny school in the middle of nowhere someone saw enough in your abilities your personality and your potential to help you take the next step in life So stay the course Embrace the difficult Work to finish what you started Imagine then just how sweet the cake will taste when you graduate from college Chieftain Sports Editor Joe E Cervi may be reached at 719 544 3520 ext 454 or by email at jcervi chieftain com Follow him on Twitter JoeECervi
