<TITLE>Free trade deal in limbo</TITLE>
<TEXT>
US president Donald Trump has abandoned the Trans Pacific Partnership TPP leaving the ambitious trade agreement in limbo Here are some key questions about the pact which supporters said would write the rules for 21st century commerce What is the TPP It is one of the most ambitious free trade pacts yet negotiated It brings together some of the diverse economies that abut the Pacific Ocean Australia Brunei Canada Chile Japan Malaysia Mexico New Zealand Peru Singapore the US and Vietnam and accounts for a whopping 40percent of the global economy Under former US president Barack Obama it was sold to American allies as a unique opportunity to seize the initiative on worldwide trade and ensure China with its surging economy and growing global importance did not get to dictate the terms Supporters say it would scrap barriers to the free flow of goods services and investment capital They claim it would also ensure a level playing field for all firms protecting labour rights and incorporating important environmental safeguards So why has Trump junked it Critics say the TPP was hammered out during secretive meetings in luxury hotels and will do little other than benefit the usual suspects big businesses Trump s insurgent presidential bid was built in part on a pledge to overturn the trade deals which many of his supporters blame for lost US jobs They say the TPP was another bad deal for America s industrial heartlands allowing foreign manufacturers and food producers tariff free access to the US market meaning US firms and farms whose production costs are higher could not compete What will happen to the TPP Many leaders invested serious political capital in the TPP selling it to reluctant electorates as a way to yoke America closer to the like minded democracies of the Pacific Rim One option is for the remaining 11 members to press ahead and get the agreement up and running Australia said it hoped to recast the pact without the US and opened the door for China to sign up Another possibility is to re open negotiations from scratch which would give Trump the chance to sell an improved deal to his electorate Trump however suggested he would pursue bilateral deals saying he would be going back to those countries one on one to find terms more favourable to the US Are there other options Yes The Beijing backed Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership now being negotiated which brings together the 10 Southeast Asian countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations as well as China India Japan South Korea Australia and New Zealand Something of a mirror image to TPP it includes six of the Washington led grouping s 12 members but not the US and would encompass more than 3billion people The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership is generally seen as less ambitious on issues like employment and environmental protection AFP
