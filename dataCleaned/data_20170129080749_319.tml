<TITLE>Are more additions incoming Brendan Rodgers provides Celtic transfer update</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Brendan Rodgers Celtic side have only completed one transfer in January embedded content Brendan Rodgers has admitted to the Scottish Herald that Celtic have not completed as much business as he had hoped this month Celtic have brought in Kouassi Eboue from Krasnador but they have been unable to complete any other signings Rodgers had hoped to be active in January despite seeing his Celtic side dominate Scottish football since the start of the season The Northern Irish boss felt that now was the perfect time for any new players to settle in ahead of next term Celtic s business is being completed with one eye on next season with the Scottish Premiership title seemingly wrapped up already Rodgers wanted to give any new signings six months to settle in before next term s Champions League qualification process starts up However Rodgers admits that Celtic will not have finalised all the business he wanted to do by the end of the month We won t be as close to having the squad ready for the Champions League as I would want it I don t think by the end of the window he admitted But if we don t get the players that I would want through them not being available then OK I m happy with the players in the squad that we have I ll just have to wait until the summer in order to do the next bit It s through no fault of the club This window is always tough I won t just bring in anyone It has to be a player who s going to improve our squad If that isn t available for whatever reason then there s not much you can do It s not Football Manager on the computer where you just pull them out and transfer them It s a wee bit more than that So if it doesn t happen OK I d want it to but if it doesn t we just have to wait and be patient Celtic are currently sat at the top of the Scottish Premiership 19 points clear of their nearest rivals Rangers embedded content
