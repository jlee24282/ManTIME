MARIETTA — A number of special activities and events are planned for 2017 at The Castle in Marietta, including several new programs. 
 
The activities include lectures, tours, musical programs and historical presentations. 
 
Executive director Scott Britton said The Castle will be entering its third year of a program called “Third Thursday Talks” which are held on the third Thursdays of the even-numbered months. The series features a variety of speakers, most involving history connected to The Castle. 
 
“That seemed to be a real popular thing, not only getting our volunteers and tour guides — our docents — involved in those so that they have a broader knowledge when people come to take a tour of the house, but also brought in some other folks with those interests,” Britton said. 
 
In 2016, The Castle added a “Food History” program which featured two dinners during the year which centered on historical menus and historical cookbooks and recipe books. The programs covered the history behind the foods and their period of history. Britton said two more “Food History” programs are planned in 2017.

Britton is also looking forward to new programming in 2017. This year is the 100th anniversary of America’s participation in World War I and The Castle will be joining with other local history organizations to highlight Marietta’s involvement and how it was impacted by the conflict. 
 
The Castle will also be doing a new program called “History on Trial” with the assistance of retired Washington County Common Pleas Judge Ed Lane and other local attorneys. There will be re-enactments of well-known local historical trials using the laws in place at those times. 
 
Britton said the first will be the “George Washington Henderson vs. David Putnam Fugitive Slave Trial” featuring George Washington Henderson of Henderson Hall in what was still part of Virginia at that time and David Putnam, a noted local abolitionist in Marietta of the period. 
 
“It was a fairly famous local case and involved national law and national people,” he said. 
 
The Castle will also be having an “Art Outside” program in the summer with local artists coming to The Castle to do painting of the historic home and grounds and other subjects. In the fall, a “Top Shelf History” program will look at Prohibition and the impact and presence of alcohol in Marietta during that period, he said. 
 
The Castle provides educational programs and tours of the restored home at 418 Fourth St., along with special musical concerts and hands-on activities for children and adults throughout the year. 
 
The Castle is an 1855 Gothic Revival house which was the home of an Ohio state senator among many others over the years. It has housed some of the Marietta area’s most prominent and influential citizens, including potter Nathaniel Clark and attorney Melvin C. Clarke, who helped add onto the home. The Castle was deeded to the Betsey Mills Corp. in 1992. It opened to the public in 1994. 
 
The Castle’s education program for third-, fourth- and fifth-graders is very extensive. The Castle also exhibits artifacts of the Marietta area. Some of those relate to former owners of The Castle while others come from the Victorian era and from the history of Marietta. 
 
The Castle is closed during the winter, except for special events and reserved group tours. 
 
It will open to the public in April and will be open five days each week through June 1, when it opens for all seven days of the week until the fall.
