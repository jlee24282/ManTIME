<TITLE>Unregulated foreign investment can be harmful</TITLE>
<TEXT>
One of the factors hampering Jamaica s ability to attract foreign direct investment FDI is the xenophobic suspicion that foreign companies doing business here are adversely exploiting workers and resources We feel we have been exploited by the British then the Americans and now the Chinese Unfortunately it is accompanied by an anti business attitude among many Jamaicans who often vilify successful businessmen as rapacious and dishonest and believe their wealth is attributed to ganja exporting This attitude is also part of a wider social envy directed at people who have raised themselves to middle class status Developing countries are perennially short of capital and Jamaica has been able to boost its economic development by inflows of foreign investment notably the bauxite alumina and tourism industries Foreign investment has costs and benefits and the ledger has to be tallied in regard to the net impact on production productive capacity profits employment taxation exports foreign exchange use of local materials worker rights local culture environment and national sovereignty No investor foreign or local is perfect or without fault It is the role of the Government to regulate how investors operate to ensure that while they make a reasonable return the country is the net beneficiary What determines if Jamaica benefits from foreign investments and by how much depends on three key factors First the Government of Jamaica must establish the rules under which foreign investors operate and must negotiate the specific terms and conditions governing the operation of each specific investment project Second investors have to be monitored by the Government to ensure that the laws of the land are being fully complied with and third there is no point just monitoring if there are no consequences for breaches Successive governments of Jamaica have known these requirements but the record of application leaves much to be desired A good illustration is foreign investment in bauxite mining and alumina processing Jamaica benefited tremendously but there are lessons to be learnt The Government did not establish clear and comprehensive conditions possibly because of incompetence or desperation to get the investment hence the low tax revenue from the deal as well as the environmentally unfriendly mud lakes And even when there was some monitoring there were no consequences for not cleaning up the red mud Local investors can also operate in a way which is harmful A good example is the cement company when it was Jamaican owned Anxious to have cement produced in Jamaica the Government of the day allowed the company to be established at Rockfort in East Kingston The company has never been held to account for adding to the pollution of the seventh largest natural harbour in the world and creating an unhealthy fog over Kingston Foreign investment is essential for the economic development of Jamaica but unregulated investment foreign or local can be detrimental to our national interests
