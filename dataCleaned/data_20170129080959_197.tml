<TITLE>The president and others are having trouble accepting facts</TITLE>
<TEXT>
In response to Bonnie Oswald’s Jan. 25 letter (“Subtract California”), the fact remains that Hillary Clinton won the popular vote.

This fact obviously bothers Ms. Oswald as well as our president as it has been reported that he seeks a “major investigation” into unsupported claims of voter fraud. This “investigation” remains to be seen.

The fact is, all Americans have the right to vote and should not be “taken out of the picture” because some disagree with their thinking.

Ms. Oswald may not care what Whoopi Goldberg, Rosie O’Donnell or Meryl Streep thinks and I gather they don’t care what she thinks either. The fact is that everyone is entitled to his or her opinion.
