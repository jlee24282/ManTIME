<TITLE>Tribune Opinion Salida del Sol Academy put our children in danger by investigating sex related compliant without calling police</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Greeley s police department is investigating whether officials at Salida del Sol Academy broke the law by failing to report a sex related complaint involving an eighth grade girl and a male teacher We don t need to wait for the investigation to wonder what the heck Executive Director Joe Melendez and school security guard Anthony Antuna were thinking Melendez and Antuna and apparently members of the school board did one of the worst things school leaders can do by doing their own investigation instead of reporting it to the police They put their school s interests before the safety of our children You probably saw the movie Spotlight right It won an Oscar for Best Picture Anyway the movie was about the brilliant work the Boston Globe did to uncover the damage wrought by Catholic Church leaders who covered up sexual abuse among the priesthood As a result many more kids were abused Mandatory reporting laws exist precisely so something like that doesn t happen again That s why it doesn t matter that Melendez and Antuna are former police officers When they chose to investigate the complaint themselves they showed they learned nothing from Spotlight or any other incident like it We don t know what happened between the teacher and the girl But we aren t soothed by the fact that Melendez and Antuna fired the teacher In our mind this makes the oversight worse This means they released a man they deemed unfit to work at their school out into the world to save the school some perceived embarrassment In fact some evidence shows the teacher displaying a disturbing pattern of inappropriate behavior and possibly abuse He was apparently coached on how to conduct himself appropriately and professionally in order to make sure there weren t any allegations a board member Virginia Rosales said an in email We certainly would have reported it if there was something sufficient enough to do that Rosales said in the email The thing is that s not Salida s decision to make and that s not the decision of Melendez and Antuna That s for law enforcement to decide That is in fact what law enforcement will decide now Only now in our mind it s mostly too late A man who potentially did something inappropriate to an eighth grader and who may have shown a pattern of abuse to children is out there now and it s entirely possible he could be teaching again or working with children in some way Our children are now not as safe as they could be as a result We say it s mostly too late There s still one outcome we hope happens soon It would be inappropriate for us to root for criminal charges but we at least look forward to the police department completing a fair accurate and scouring investigation of the school board Melendez and Antuna Most of all we want it to be as public as possible That s exactly the kind of embarrassment they wanted the school to avoid The only difference now is that they re the ones who caused it The Tribune Editorial Board
