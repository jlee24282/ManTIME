<TITLE>Are you ready to become an inventor?</TITLE>
<TEXT>
The past two weeks we discussed TV news and its dearth of innovations. This was presented in response to readers’ inquiries requesting the clarification between invention and innovation. An invention solves a problem, while innovation studies the situation and tries to improve the performance. In a simpler expression, invention is a “maker” while innovation is a “listener.” 
 
The short series on TV news and its lack of innovation drew a surprising number of reader responses, all of which emphatically agreed with what the columns stated. Here are two examples: 
 
“I am 76 and agree, your comments are right on.” – George 
 
“Hello, I am in such complete agreement with your article about the weather forecast on TV news that I had to write! I am of the generation still watching network TV news and am often so frustrated when I've just watched the weather and still have no clue what the forecast is! 
Well said! Thank you!” – Dianne Ahern 
 
Inventions require excellent and insightful analysis of the problem at hand, while innovation requires deep understanding and careful listening of the silent voice of the market. 
 
As the column stated last week, the vast population increase in the age 65 and older segment of this country necessitates that we as the nation must prepare now to take care of the issues that will rise. Unfortunately, we are starting much later than should have. All sorts of inventions and innovations should be encouraged to deal with this massive nation within our nation of 100 million people of age 65 and older. Are we ready? Not quite. 
 
Invention advice: Three weeks ago, I posted a notice that we will form a committee of volunteer experts from approximately 10 specialty fields. Our readers with invention ideas can submit their concepts to this column and the committee will make comments on the ideas. This column receives a significant number of such ideas from readers seeking advice and I felt we should encourage readers (who wish to invent) to freely request advice. 
 
It turned out many more than 10 people sent in their willingness to assist this volunteer activity and some are highly qualified. I hadn’t thought so many volunteers would respond. But, America still depends on new inventions to make wealth and promoting inventions is a right thing to do. 
 
Our first task is to come up with a NDS+A (non-disclosure agreement) to protect these volunteers from any frivolous lawsuits. Inventors are creative, but they are also emotional (I know it as I am one). They don’t like to hear their idea isn’t any good, or worry that their ides might be copied by someone in the volunteer committee. So this form will protect them. The form is being drawn up by a prominent intellectual attorney with the University of New Hampshire Law School. 
 
The members of the first valuation committee are as follows in alphabetical order: Alessandro Levi-Montalcini: iPhone apps; Joseph Pont: Pharmacology, biopharmacology, green chemistry; Robert Stuart: Maritime sailing and on-board tools, piloting and navigation; Ann Tarlton: Botany, horticulture; Zed White: Contracting, house construction, wood tools; and one solar power expert who wishes to remain anonymous. 
 
I expect the committee to consist of 10 experts. The membership term is one year, and this term will start Feb. 1. 
 
How to send in your invention? 
 
Request our NDA forms (two) to be mailed to your home address. Please return two signed forms to American Invention Institute, P.O. Box 26, New Castle, NH 03854. Email a description of your concept to sasano@gmail.com. Our committee will start evaluating your idea. Their consensus will appear in subsequent columns. 
 
Note: It is important for inventors sending in their idea to know the committee’s evaluation is simply limited to whether the idea works according the initial purpose of solving a problem. The committee does not deal with any issues related to patent and intellectual property issues or marketability issues. 
 
Write your text of explanation as clearly as possible and draw your graphics as clearly and detailed as possible. We do not expect you to draw “patent” drawings, but poorly drawn expressions would easily lead us to misunderstanding. 
 
Once your idea is sent in, give us a month to formulate our reply. Our experts will work diligently and accurately express their opinion and I wish not to hurry them. Our review would start covering previous submissions first. We have a few ideas readers have sent in that haven’t been reviewed. We will look at them first. 
 
Shintaro “Sam” Asano was named by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2011 as one of the 10 most influential inventors of the 20th century who improved our lives. He is a businessman and inven­tor in the field of electronics and mechanical systems who is credited as the in­ventor of the portable fax machine. Write to him at sasano@gmail.com.
