leg spinner Mitchell Swepson Johnson predicted Lyon would lead the attack but said Australia must adapt to the conditions and utilise their considerable spin bowling contingent They Indian pitches are bunsen burners at the moment they ve been turning a fair bit South Africa lost a Test series there Johnson said It s going to be very interesting I don t know whether they go for two or three spinners in a Test I ve just got a feeling we ll see something different something maybe special We ll see a very different side to what we re normally used to we re going to see more spin bowling over there That s a good thing because you ve got to play the conditions in India The stats say that our quicks are better over there but mostly it s the quicks that bowl over there we don t really bowl a lot of spin SHARE Link Crowd favourite Mitchell Johnson says he will return to the Big Bash next summer Photo It was Shane Warne before that and over the last 10 or so years there s been a lot of changes with our spin bowling Australia lost their last Test tour of India 4 0 and not a single member of the Australian team has won a Test in the country Not since 2004 when Warne was rubbing shoulders with Adam Gilchrist Matthew Hayden and Glenn McGrath has Australia won a series in India Johnson played seven Tests there without success before retiring from the longer form of the game at the start of last summer After some significant arm twisting by Scorchers coach Justin Langer the fearsome left arm quick was enticed to have a season in the BBL and his signing proved a masterstroke He saved his best two performances for last claiming a record 3 3 in the semi final win over the Melbourne Stars before finishing with 1 13 in his side s towering nine wicket win over the hapless Sixers It s just a really good tournament I was probably one that never embraced Twenty20 cricket when I was playing international cricket but now that s all I m playing that s very enjoyable Johnson said The crowds are amazing too That was one thing that I probably noticed throughout this Big Bash is the crowd and support and talking to the guys random punters coming up and saying I hope you have a good season to guys that don t have the profile To get that experience and that exposure through the Big Bash it s great for them And icing the cake on the Scorchers third Big Bash title Johnson said he planned on returning to the competition next year I only want to do it if I m going to perform and I guess this year was a bit of a see how it sort of goes Johnson said JL Langer was really good with me throughout he just said Come and have fun mate there s no pressure you re not the No 1 strike bowler we just want you to go and have fun and enjoy it and whatever happens happens It turns out that competitiveness in me is still there so if the body holds up and I m bowling well then yeah It seems like fresh is best
