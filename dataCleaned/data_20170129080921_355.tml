<TITLE>Men's basketball: Yellowjackets collect quality win</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Rochester Community and Technical College was in need of a big win and the Yellowjackets got just that on Saturday in men's college basketball.

Nick Ogren hit a 12-foot baseline jumper with three seconds to play to lift RCTC past Anoka-Ramsey 75-73 in Southern Division play of the Minnesota College Athletic Conference. A-R came into the game ranked No. 2 in the nation among Division III men's junior college teams.

"This was a good win for us," RCTC coach Brian LaPlante said.

"It gives us some life again," he added. The Yellowjackets are trying to earn a high earn division finish to earn a state berth.

Mamadou Ngom had hit a pair of free throws for Anoka-Ramsey to tie the game with 13 seconds left.

RCTC then moved the ball down court. Malik Jones found Ogren open in the corner and the sophomore guard nailed the jumper for the win.

Jones finished with 19 points and nine rebounds for RCTC. Gorg Alhag had 15 points, three assists and five steals while Akeem Smith had 13 points, five rebounds and three assists. Michael Cornelious had 12 points and 10 rebounds and Orgen chipped in 10 points and four rebounds.

Yellowjackets shot 41 percent from the field, were 3-for-13 on 3-pointers and 12-for-17 at the line. A-R shot 38 percent, was 11-for-29 from 3-point ranged and made 10 of 16 free throws. Both teams had 16 turnovers and a key for RCTC, which trailed 50-40 at one point in the second half, was to hold a 50-42 edge on the boards.

"That's an area we hadn't been doing too well," LaPlante said.

The Yellowjackets are now 10-8 overall and 2-2 in division play. They will be at Minnesota West at 7:45 p.m. Wednesday.
