<TEXT>
So much for that shooting slump Seven different players connected on 3 pointers and the Boise State men s basketball team finished with 12 made shots from beyond the arc in an impressive 80 65 road win at Wyoming on Saturday evening The Broncos had lost three of their past four games entering Saturday but bounced back in a big way on the road Wyoming had been 11 1 at home entering Saturday Boise State made just 6 of 24 from 3 point range in a loss to Nevada on Wednesday including just 1 of 12 in the second half but surpassed that total in the first half Saturday in Laramie The Broncos 13 7 6 3 Mountain West finished 12 of 27 from 3 point range for the game The 12 made 3 pointers was their most in the last four games We need to make 3s to be a good offensive team and when we do we re a great offensive team Boise State coach Leon Rice said during his postgame radio interview on The Bronco Radio Network We scored 80 points tonight on the road in a Mountain West game That s pretty impressive Wyoming led 14 13 early in the first half before Boise State ripped off a 22 4 run to take a 35 18 lead The Broncos led by at least 10 points the rest of the game James Reid led the Broncos with 16 points while making his first start since November He was 3 for 4 from 3 point range Paris Austin who came off the bench had 13 points in the first half and finished with 15 points on 6 of 8 shooting Justinian Jessup had nine points on 3 of 5 shooting from downtown and tied a career high with seven rebounds All 10 players that saw the floor scored for Boise State on Saturday and each of them had at least two rebounds We ve got a lot of guys that can play now Rice said I looked out there one time and I had three freshmen out there in a road game in the Mountain West and that defies logic for me That was a team win That was a team that was connected and played the right way Wyoming was just 3 of 21 from 3 point range after entering the game averaging 8 9 made 3 pointers per game The Cowboys didn t hit their first 3 of the game until less than six minutes remained in the second half We take pride in that Rice said It shut out a big part of their offense Boise State improved to 4 1 on the road in Mountain West play It s the third straight season that the Broncos have won at least four road games in Mountain West play The Broncos will remain on the road for a Tuesday game at Colorado State which won at San Diego State on Saturday The Rams have won three in a row and nearly beat Boise State in Boise last month before a buzzer beating 3 pointer from Chandler Hutchison won it for the Broncos Boise State and Colorado State are tied for second place in Mountain West at 6 3 one game behind 7 2 Nevada Tip off on Tuesday night is scheduled for 7 p m and the game will be streamed on ESPN3
