<TITLE>Gardening blog Robert Kennett on the delights of a frost covered winter garden</TITLE>
<TEXT>
All that is gold does not glitter Not all those who wander are lost The old that is strong does not wither Deep roots are not reached by the frost JRR Tolkein Many people won t believe me but I m going to come out and say it I love February There s something about the energy of a fresh start the invigorating cold air and crisp golden winter sun but without all the garden neediness and exertion of late spring and summer Of course the RHS and garden shows will come out with a list of tasks you should be doing in the garden at this time of year but actually I think it s a good time to give the garden a break from meddling and just enjoy it This is where a little thoughtful laziness in autumn comes in hand By not cutting back the flowering stalks of last summer s herbaceous exuberance you get to appreciate the sculptural elements of plants Some are better suited to this approach than others and generally it is the later flowering varieties that survive best For frost covered outdoor artworks look for plants that have rigid stems bulky seed cones or a light airiness that can stand up to rain and wind Those whose wild origins lie in wind drenched prairies and grasslands such as coneflower Echinacea and sneezewort Helenium both from North America produce large dark cones that show up well against lighter colours or grasses The small red pink or white flowers of the Great Burnets Sanguisorbas especially the taller ones look good as they darken to a mass of tiny suspended black buttons Yarrow Achillea is another plant of meadow origin whose dried cloud shaped umbels in winter provide a horizontal contrast to the verticals of say foxgloves or Veronicas Any sea holly Eryngium is sculptural from the word go but I think many of those with pale blue flowers in summer actually look better in winter But the granddaddy of all hoary floral delights has to be to the delicate spent flower clusters of fennel Foeniculum vulgare if only because the crystallised flowers are suspended so high up in the air In my front garden I use the feathery foliage and then bright yellow flowers of fennel to form an ideal backdrop to the rich rust red cones of Helenium Moorheim Beauty Ornamental grasses are also one of the highlights of the winter garden Robust grasses that stand up to battering from wind and rain but retain much of their golden hue through winter such as Stipa gigantea Molinia varieties and Calamagrostis look fabulous when covered in frost in the crisp winter sun To make these golden jewels stand out even more why not contrast them with the bright red and yellow branches of a dogwood Cornus or red leaved evergreen plants such as Berberis Phormium or Nandina domestica To this frosty combination you can add a few evergreens for additional structure The strappy leaves of Crocosmia Phormium or Libertia grandiflora will give further shape And there is a certain appeal in the repeated rounded forms of topiarised box yew or beech if placed in a pattern on open ground they can look a secret gathering of plants in some parallel world Have fun with winter colour but give your garden a rest in February It s sleeping through the bitter cold of winter much like the rest of us would like to Robert Kennett can be contacted on 07968 113546 or via his website robertkennett co uk
