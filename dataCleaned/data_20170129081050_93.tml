<TITLE>Low turnout at Macheso show</TITLE>
<TEXT>
The current cash crisis in Zimbabwe is also biting musicians, this is proved by low turnout at Alick Macheso's show in Concession Mashonaland Central province yesterday (Saturday). 
A survey by Bulawayo24.com proved that many revellers are broke and would prefer to listen from outside since they cannot afford the U$5 charged by Ochestra Mberikwazvo. 

Macheso performed at Dandamera hall in Concession for the first time and got few revellers who met the charge but legions of his fans listened from outside. 

"It is Macheso's first time to perform here in Concession since we do not have money to pay we took this opportunity to listen from outside," said Tendai Kurwa 

Extra basso did not disappoint on stage as he thanked fans from surrounding places like Glendale Bindura Mvurwi and Mazowe who made huge numbers than that of Concession. 

Meanwhile, the sungura ace returns in the capital (Mbare) today (Sunday) though some argue that he is no longer marketable in Harare facing stiff completion from artists like Jah Prayzah and Sulumani Chimbetu.
