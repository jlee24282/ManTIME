<TITLE>Preset signals, countdown clocks part of downtown traffic discussion</TITLE>

Pedestrian and vehicle traffic are an ongoing concern for city officials. 
 
Downtown Newnan gets high marks for being pedestrian-friendly, but continued improvements for smooth pedestrian and vehicle traffic flow in the city’s central business district remain a priority. 

 
Members of the downtown development authority and city officials met with representatives from the Georgia Department of Transportation Friday to discuss trouble spots and potential modifications to existing traffic control. 
 
“I feel like (Newnan) is pretty walkable,” said Tyler Peek, GDOT’s District 3 traffic engineer. 
 
But Main Street Manager Courtney Harcourt said there are crosswalks in the central business district where drivers don’t consistently follow traffic laws, preventing pedestrians from crossing smoothly, and that some of the crosswalk directionals may be out of sync. 
 
Redneck Gourmet owner Casey Smith, who chairs the DDA board, said it’s also not uncommon to see car/pedestrian “stalemates.” 
 
“Cars and pedestrians are both stopped and nobody’s doing anything,” he said. 
 
And while the four signals at the corners of Court Square are automatic – “They’re set up to bring up the pedestrian face no matter what,” Peek said – the outlying and side street signals are triggered by pushing the crossing buttons, which some pedestrians may not realize. 
 
City Manager Cleatus Phillips said any proposed improvements should take into consideration pedestrians who ignore crossing signals, and Smith asked about additional educational pieces or signage aimed toward vehicles. 
 
“I see drivers as part of the problem, too,” he said. 
 
Among suggestions to alleviate persistent issues were countdown clocks and crossing signals preset to match traffic patterns. 
 
Peek said a signal timing engineer will be available, likely in March, to gather data on existing timing and pedestrian needs. 
 
“We’ll be able to incorporate some of these ideas into what he will be able to do timing-wise for the entire corridor,” he said. “As far as countdowns, it would just be getting them ordered and installed as long as the wiring is already there.” 
 
The group also discussed the feasibility of adding a midblock (non-intersection) crossing near the city park on Jackson Street to alleviate issues at Clark/Jackson/Jefferson intersection, with a pedestrian-activated flashing beacon. 
 
“It would flash whenever a pedestrian was present, based on traffic,” Peek said. “It’s single-direction with two lanes, which sounds like a good place for a beacon. It’s something we can look at as an alternative location.” 
 
A recent traffic study revealed that the majority of drivers obey the posted 35 mph speed limit through downtown Newnan. 
 
“The general perception is that traffic is too fast through downtown from a pedestrian perspective,” Phillips said. 
 
Results matched an earlier study, according to Public Works Director Michael Klahr. 
 
“We’ve done two internal studies and determined 35 is an appropriate speed limit through there,” he said. 
 
Smith disagreed. 
 
“It seems a lot faster when it’s three feet from you,” he said. 
 
It’s an ongoing issue that needs to be settled, Phillips said. 
 
“We either need to make something happen or live with this,” he said. 
 
Peek said there’s not much the GDOT can do when state routes run through downtown areas. 
 
“We’re held to keeping the speed limit to the 85th percentile,” he said. “We can’t just arbitrarily drop the speed limit.” 
 
No action was taken during the meeting. Only three members of the DDA board were present.
