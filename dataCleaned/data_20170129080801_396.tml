<TITLE>Lee calls for unity in UNC</TITLE>
<TEXT>
United National Congress UNC chairman David Lee says petty differences among members has been hindering development within the party Speaking yesterday at the relaunch of the UNC s Academy Training Session at the Chaguanas Borough Corporation Chaguanas Lee called for unity as the party positions itself for the 2020 general election Brothers and sisters there is a saying that in unity there is strength and in today s society the fact is as a united force we will be able to achieve beyond our wildest dreams he said For too long we have looked to allow small differences and misunderstandings to divide us which has time and time again led to our downfall If we are to progress we must do it together He added We must all understand that our different qualities make us stronger It is time we end the small bickering and bickering over positions over territorial control over individuals because as we do so the PNM moves ahead Let us remain focussed united determined and we will win we will win Yesterday s session Lee said sought to devise a strategy to take the UNC back into government by enabling enable each one of us to understand to practice and to pass on the philosophy of the United National Congress If we as a family are not able to undertake or enact our party s vision then we would have failed as a group he said Lee said the session focussed on three key components unity mentorship and venturing out of one s comfort zones Regarding mentorship Lee said while many of the party s more experienced members and office holders would say they have been thought these lessons before one of our greatest issues has been the inability to mentor others The inability to pass on knowledge to less experienced individuals Many times new councillors are brought into the local government framework or someone is elected into a constituency executive and instead of passing on what is the correct way of performing their duties we withhold that knowledge The time for those tactics are over It is time we pass on our knowledge and groom others to be agents for change as ourselves so we can truly fulfil our party s philosophy he said Lee argued that unity mentorship and service meant nothing if it cannot be translated to those areas where we must solidify our UNC support to ensure victory For example the councillors within the constituency of Moruga must be given full support if not a tad extra support from their colleagues at the Princes Town Corporation to ensure they can best meet the needs of the electorate allowing us to retake Moruga Tableland in the next general election he said The same can be said about the Pointe a Pierre constituency a marginal seat in the heart of a number of safe seats
