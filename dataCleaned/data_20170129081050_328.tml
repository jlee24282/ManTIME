Many Maitland St residents were forced to have dinner in their cars on Sunday night after police cordoned off the area for about two hours.  
 
"We literally went down the road to have dinner and then come back," Dawson said. 
 
"We were at Burger Fuel going, no, we don't need to get a drink because we've got drinks at home." 
 
Police were searching for a man who had been spotted with a gun.  
 
Dawson said a man had been pulled over by police and taken off on foot.  
 
A person had apparently spotted a man in their backyard in the firearm, he said.  
 
Police left Maitland St after searching the properties and moved the operation to Irvine St, Waikato police Senior Sergeant Ray Malcomson said.
