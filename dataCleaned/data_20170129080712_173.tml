<TEXT>
By As the year ended we published a story on some ways you can get your finances in home buying shape We offered a few tips on saving money and setting goals that would seem overwhelming if you broke that big number into a daily savings goal that seemed more doable One reader commented that the list didn t seem exhaustive enough given the expenses associated with being a first time buyer And that s a fair point We could have easily written a book on the subject that covered all of the struggles a first time home buyer will wade through wait Ilyce already did in addition to spending a lot of ink discussing first time buyer finances While we chose to focus on a few things that you could do to organize your finances for buying a first home this year we d like to share a few other ideas to help you spend less and save more Since the latest studies show that about 60 percent of Americans still don t have 500 in accessible savings here are four other ways to raise that kind of money and more at almost any income level 1 Trade paid entertainment options for free entertainment opportunities Date night can be an expensive proposition If two people go to see a movie have something to eat and hire a babysitter the tab can run in excess of 100 If you do that twice a month that s 2 400 you re spending over the course of a year If you simply trade a paid entertainment option like the movies for a much lower cost one a service like Netflix which costs around 10 month your savings could be more than 2 000 per year And even if you spend some money on ordering in food your savings will still be more than 1 000 per year 2 Elevate your at home cooking skills We re seeing a lot of ads for services that send you ingredients for a complete cooked at home meal While that sounds like fun it s actually far less expensive and more creative to research a recipe online go to the grocery store and pick out the food you need Making your own food is far less expensive than going to a restaurant or even ordering in and it s a far healthier choice In addition you ll really learn how to cook which is a wonderful way to bring people together How much will you save Assuming that a mid level restaurant tab for two people is 40 to 50 cooking at home should save you about 35 to 40 per night If you make that substitution once a month you ll save up to 420 per year or 840 if you eliminate eating out twice a month 3 Plan regular pot luck parties If you have friends you like to see regularly start a regular dinner club Whether you re making pizzas from scratch with salad or grilling steak it ll cost a lot less if everyone chips in rather than meeting at a local bar Expect to save 250 to 500 per year or more 4 Shop your insurance and cell service Regularly checking the rates with competing insurance companies could give you as much as a 10 to 15 percent break on premiums according to the Insurance Information Institute If you have homeowner s insurance check to see if you qualify for reductions because of home improvements cessation of smoking etc If you have auto insurance ask if you qualify for a reduction if your children go away to college or move into their own homes Finally cellphone services are a very competitive field at the moment You may be able to save hundreds of dollars a year simply by shopping cellphone plans with competing companies Contact Ilyce Glink and Samuel J Tamkin is a Chicago based real estate attorney through her website ThinkGlink com
