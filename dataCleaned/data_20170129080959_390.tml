<TITLE>Yemen 'dismayed' by Trump's immigration order</TITLE>
<TEXT>
YEMEN is "dismayed" by U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to temporarily ban its citizens from traveling to the United States, saying that the country was a victim of attacks itself, an official said on Saturday. 
"We are dismayed by the decision to unilaterally ban, even for only a month, travel to the United States for people holding Yemeni passports," said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
