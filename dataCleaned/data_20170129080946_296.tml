the state of Gujarat V Raipur Mfg Co Ltd AIR 1967 SC 1066 It was held that normally to constitute a business there should be volume frequency continuity and regularity in transaction of sale Transaction must be enter with profit motive though profit need not be in fact earned In this case it was held that when a person carry on business is required to sale of fixed assets and discarded goods then he is not constitute business because he does not carry on business of selling of fixed assets To override this decision and cover more transaction in tax net definition of business is expended a Profit motive is immaterial b The definition is very wise as even a single transaction may get covered under the ambit of business c If the main activity is constitute business then ancillary and incidental activity also cover in ambit of business 2 IF THE MAIN ACTIVITY IS NOT BUSINESS THEN ANCILLARY AND INCIDENTAL ACTIVITY CAN NOT AMOUNT TO BUSINESS In case of SRI Velur Devasthanam VS state of TN MAD HC held that dominant activity of assessee is religious and charitable in nature and not business and assessee cannot be treated as dealer in respect of sale of gold bullion offered by the devotee In case of Ruhelkhand Education charitable trust VS CCT UP Tri held that it was settled that main activity of institution is to impart education and is not the business

a conclusion whether a supply has been made in the course or furtherance of business 1 Is the activity a serious undertaking earnestly pursued 2 Is the activity is perused with reasonable or recognizable continuity 3 Is the activity conducted in a regular manner based on sound and recognizable business principles 4 Is the activity predominantly concerned with the making of taxable supply for consideration profit motive The test insure that occasional supplies even if made for consideration will not subject to GST Q An individual buys a car for personal use and after a year sells it to
