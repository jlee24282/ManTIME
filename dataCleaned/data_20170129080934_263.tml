ALSO READ Stretch marks could not stop me Why I bared it all for the camera Irene Wangui Fashion Designer Someone once argued that life is about transactions Think of it like this you give something to get something back Our forefathers transacted business through barter trade Today we transact using legal tender money The system requires that all of us attend school or acquire some skill The whole essence ultimately is to find a niche a balance that allows us relative comfort in life That is why we hold jobs Who has never had trouble finding a proper job By proper we mean white collar and paying six figures There are few But the majority fall on the other side of the spectrum We walk hundreds of kilometres after school certificates clasped in hand We knock on doors and get rebuffed and curse at life and the human condition That s until the smart among us think outside the box They will realise that with the right amount of determination they can make lots of money online Or they will ransack through their minds and find a long forgotten passion which they will convert into something they can do even from home Here are a few people doing exactly this WALTER AKOLO 31 FREELANCE

doubled my income in a month I don t feel the need to be employed now Being a freelancer and businessman was one of the best decisions I ever made Thank God that online work has enabled me to earn a living pay my bills and sustain my family There s great potential online and I believe by 2020 we ll have Kenyans earning seven or more figures per month from it It is my hope to one day own a big
