<TEXT>
26 For consider your call, brethren; not many of you were wise according to worldly standards, not many were powerful, not many were of noble birth; 

27 but God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise, God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong, 

28 God chose what is low and despised in the world, even things that are not, to bring to nothing things that are, 

29 so that no human being might boast in the presence of God. 

30 He is the source of your life in Christ Jesus, whom God made our wisdom, our righteousness and sanctification and redemption; 

31 therefore, as it is written, “Let him who boasts, boast of the Lord.”
