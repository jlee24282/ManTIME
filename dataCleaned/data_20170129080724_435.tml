Darryl was born April 10, 1945 to Selvin and Lucy (King) Hanson in Williston. He was raised east of Williston on the family farm where he learned all there was to know about being a rancher. He was educated in a rural grade school and attended Williston High School until joining the Army. 
   
Darryl married Linda Joy Hanson on October 16, 1964. From this marriage came five children, Gerome, Leslie, Kenneth, Darla, and Pamela. This marriage ended in divorce in 1983. 
   
He later married Alecia Falcon on June 25, 1994 to which joined Alecia’s three children, Michael, Brian, and Alyssa. 
   
Darryl worked various jobs throughout his life, but of all of these, the family farm was dearest to his heart. He retired from the Williams County Highway Department, where everyone knew him as “Dr. Dirt”. 
   
Darryl loved to “talk people’s ears off”. His passions in life were his horses, his dogs and working with cattle and also tinkering and building things in his shop. But most of all he loved the time he got to spend with his children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. 
   
He is survived by his wife, Alecia; sons, Les Hanson, Kenneth Hanson (Julie Melby) and daughters, Darla Morken (Arthur Crumb), Pam and Tim Wentz, all of Williston; brother, Richard Hanson of Williston; step-children, Michael VanderZanden (Jamie Zimmer), Brian and Kelly VanderZanden and Alyssa and Brian Locke all of Grand Rapids, Michigan; eighteen grandchildren and sixteen great-grandchildren with two more expected in March as well as numerous nieces, nephews, cousins, friends and family.  
   
He was preceded in death by infant brother, Lester; his son, Gerome in 1988; first wife, Linda in 2015; daughter-in-law Renae in 2017; parents, Selvin and Lucy Hanson; grandparents, great-grandparents; mother-in-law and father-in-law; sister-in-law; dear friend, Dennis Overstreet; and numerous aunts and uncles. 
   
The Everson Coughlin Funeral Home of Williston is caring for the family.
