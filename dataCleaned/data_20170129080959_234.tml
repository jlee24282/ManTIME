<TITLE>Sunnyside wrestlers take down Davis claim CBBN title</TITLE>
<TEXT>
YAKIMA For Sunnyside s wrestlers Thursday was the emotionally charged home show and Saturday was the business trip The Grizzlies didn t impress themselves Saturday afternoon but they got the job done impressively nonetheless After Thursday s thrilling victory over three time reigning CBBN champion Moses Lake Sunnyside claimed that title for itself Saturday by sweeping Davis and Eisenhower for a 6 0 run through league duals After a big match like the one we had Thursday I was afraid we might be a little flat today and we were said Sunnyside coach George Paulus And we had two matches today which I wasn t happy about and that made a flat day even longer But our goal was a league title and we got that It was a big week for us The ninth ranked Grizzlies knocked off No 6 Moses Lake 32 23 at home on Thursday then dispatched Eisenhower 64 9 and Davis 43 18 in a pair of makeup duals from previous postponements That sets the stage for the postseason which begins next week with the district tournament in Wenatchee Thursday was a great win for us and finishing 6 0 really means something said junior Moises Morales who went 3 0 at 170 pounds in the three duals We put a lot of hard work into this We had to keep our focus coming up here after Moses Lake and we did that s part of our training While Davis finished 4 2 in league and is ranked 11th in the state the Pirates ability to compete with Sunnyside was severely compromised by giving away four forfeits and 24 points The Grizzlies too held out three starters Sunnyside s notable wins came from Morales who bested Chris Huizar 4 2 in overtime at 170 and two time state medalist Josiah Rodriguez who earned a hard fought 7 4 decision over John Sowers at 138 Davis big win and the match of the day came at 126 when sophomore Shawn Abeyta stunned state runner up Elias Romero in overtime Abeyta conceded a takedown in each of the first two periods and trailed 5 1 with less than 10 seconds left But he launched into a takedown that led to two near fall points as time expired then did the same thing 30 seconds into the OT for a 10 5 victory That may or may not be a preview of the district final as Abeyta said he is weighing a move down to 120 or staying at 126 In addition to Morales Sam Guerrero 106 Fabian Ortega 113 and Rodriguez 138 all went 3 0 this week to help Sunnyside earn its first league title since 2013 Guerrero a sophomore sparked Sunnyside s 17 0 start against Moses Lake and provided a 5 0 decision and pin in Saturday s matches Ortega is a freshman with postseason upside who pinned his ML opponent and delivered a 10 1 major decision against Davis We re excited for district because it feels like we re peaking Morales said Sunnyside beat Moses Lake for last year s district title at Davis The seeding meeting will take place Friday in Wenatchee with first round matches to follow and finals on Saturday Regional qualifiers from the CBBN will travel to Curtis for the Class 4A Region III tournament on
