<TITLE>Four Must Watch Anime Of Summer 2017</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Summer 2017 s anime selection is a desert Out of the nearly 50 title lineup Kotaku s Brian Ashcraft detailed in his seasonal guide I found only four anime I can recommend And not all of them are even available in Australia Little Witch Academia It s disappointing There s a special pleasure in breathlessly telling your friends There s this new anime and it will blow your fucking mind Over the last few years I could do that with Mob Psycho Madoka Magica Space Dandy and a handful of others I can t recommend this season s Hand Shakers in which a young girl will die if she lets go of the protagonist s hand Yes he has to wash her I found the novelty of Miss Kobayashi s Dragon Maid where a huge dragon transforms into a big bosomed maid hard to watch despite its moments of good humour to Dragon Maid s credit my housemate loves it With lowered standards I tried out less niche titles like Interviews with Monster Girls It s about a biology professor whose passion is studying demi humans Just moments after he says he s never met any demi humans several happen to crop up in his school and so on It s watchable but not anything to write home about just like Saga of Tanya the Evil about a very small girl who is also a military powerhouse With all that out of the way below are the four titles I can recommend from the summer 2017 anime season It s a deviation from our Five Must Watch series but those are the times we re in Scum s Wish embedded content Studio Lerche Genre Drama Coming of Age Where to Watch Not yet available in Australia Plot Summary Two high school students boyfriend and girlfriend explore their physical intimacy and emotional boundaries The kicker is that they re each in love other other people Hanabi Yasuraoka and Mugi Awaya are open about how each is a replacement for their true love and how they project their desires onto each other for comfort and sanity Why You Should Watch It It s thoughtful but difficult The show tackles coming of age themes with surprising wisdom and tenderness At times long kisses are hard to watch when you know Hanabi and Mugi are each imagining different lovers Little Witch Academia embedded content Studio Trigger Genre Magical Girl Comedy Where to Watch Netflix Not yet available in Australia Plot Summary A rag tag collection of girls at the prestigious Luna Nova Magical Academy learn to fly on brooms and cast spells while using each other as comedic foils and confidants The protagonist Atsuko Kagari Akko went there after being inspired by Shiny Chariot a magical witch whom some consider to be a fraud Akko is not herself a competent witch but after a lot of trial and error learns a few tricks that get her out of sticky situations Why You Should Watch It After the franchise s wildly successful 30 and hour long films Trigger released this TV series on Netflix It s a light hearted series with some hilarious characters and top notch animation Chaos Child embedded content Studio Silver Link Genre Thriller Sci fi Where to Watch Crunchyroll Plot Summary Takuru Miyashiro investigates a string of horrible bloody deaths on internet chat rooms and around Tokyo which was rebuilt after an earthquake He s also a high schooler who runs his school newspaper club Over time he and his staff learn of supernatural occurrences tied to the murders and struggle to wrap their minds around the case Why You Should Watch It s a well paced absolutely terrifying series with just the right amount of gore ACCA 13 Territory Inspection Dept embedded content Studio Madhouse Genre Political Drama Where to Watch Crunchyroll Plot Summary Jean Otus a stoic cigarette smoking inspector is the deputy commander of the ACCA Inspection Agency which roots out corruption in other government agencies Why You Should Watch It First I love the soundtrack Second I appreciate that it s understated Jean is pretty damn aloof but it s definitely fitting for a guy who works in an inspection department Sure it s a little boring sometimes And I wouldn t argue it s a must watch per say But ACCA is a coherent respectable workplace drama that accomplishes what it sets out to do There you have it Let me know your must watch anime or recommendations in the comments
