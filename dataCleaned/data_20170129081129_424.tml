<TITLE>O'Gliss Waterpark Opens in France</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Polin Waterparks has advanced its role as a leading waterpark designer and supplier in France with the opening of the new O'Gliss Waterpark in Le Bernard last June (June 2016). Polin Waterparks' proud partnership with Edsun Loisirs, a leisure park and outdoor recreation design firm, led to the development of the €12 million (US$13.5 million) facility that features an impressive 12 waterslides, including several of Polin's most-popular waterslides: the Kamikaze, Freefall, Turbo Lance and Looping Rocket. With a size of 60,000 square meters (196,850 square feet), O'Gliss waterpark also sets a record as the third-largest waterpark in France. 

An Oasis Next to an Oasis 

The coast of the Vendée area of France extends along more than 200 kilometers (120 miles) of mostly sandy beaches that attract tourists from near and far. Edged with dunes and pine woods, along with coastal mudflats and marshes that attract unusual birds, the beaches are considered an oasis for nature lovers. 

Options increase guests' interests 

Guests' traveling between the four areas of the park can choose from among a wide range of Polin waterslides.: 

For younger guests, Polin offers a pirate-themed waterplay structure that excites young imaginations with tipping buckets, slides, net climbs and water cannons. In addition, kids enjoy mini versions of several of Polin's popular attractions:
