<TITLE>A.J.-less Bruins regroup, win by 11</TITLE>

Just 3:49 into Friday’s showdown, fate unleashed a wallop of bad luck that sent the Bartlesville High School boys varsity basketball team reeling against the ropes. 
 
But, instead of going down for the count, the Bruins displayed to the king-sized crowd at the Phillips Fieldhouse — the old Bruin Gym — they had a strong emotional shock absorber. 
 
They bounced back from the injury loss of senior forward A.J. Archambo to trounce the visiting Jenks High School Trojans, 56-45, in a Frontier Valley Conference showdown. 
 
Archambo — who had to be helped off court, suffered an apparent bad ankle sprain, Bruin head coach Clent Stewart said after the game. 
 
Even with Archambo — who has played virtually every minute this season — banished from action, the Bruins didn’t get upset. 
 
They got reset. 
 
In the quarter-and-a-half following Archambo’s mishap — which occurred when he was knocked down while trying to cash in on a fast break bucket — the Bruins outscored Jenks, 23-17, and led by 10 at halftime, 27-17. 
 
Barron Tanner — with whom Archambo has formed a Dynamite Duo the past two seasons — picked up much of the slack. Tanner scored 19 points the final three quarters — including burying 11-of-13 free throws. 
 
When Archambo left the game, Tanner went to an extra gear of aggression, Stewart said. 
 
“I’ve told Barron, ‘When you make up your mind to be aggressive, there’s no one in the conference who can stop you,’” Stewart continued. 
 
Stewart praised the play off all the Bruins who stepped up to nail down the team’s ninth season win. 
 
Junior guard Andrew Gronigan contributed 13 points — including two back-breaking three-pointers in the third period. His backcourt mate Jake Bilger chipped in with one trey and six points. 
 
Jenks (3-11, 1-7) came into the game on the momentum of a two-game winning streak, while the Bruins (9-7, 4-3) looked to regroup from a loss Tuesday at Muskogee. 
 
The backdrop was the former Bruin Fieldhouse — now known as the Phillips Fieldhouse — in which Jenks and the Bruins had staged some monumental battles prior to Bartlesville’s move, in 2005, to its current facility. 
 
Friday’s encounter was officially known as the Throwback Game — a once-a-year event on the Bartlesville basketball schedule. 
 
The Bruins went to work early. 
 
On their first possession, Bilger lofted a lob pass to the low post while Archambo made a backdoor cut, jumped up like a high-speed elevator and dropped the ball through the net. 
 
After Jenks failed to answer, the Bruins went ahead 4-0 on a 16-foot baseline ‘J’ by Tanner, off a feed from Tayo Dina. 
 
Jenks recorded two more empty possessions. As the quarter neared the halfway point, Jenks turned the ball over and Archambo took off for a transition layup. 
 
But, he collided in midair with a Jenks defender, landed and went to the ground — and, in obvious pain — landed on his right side. 
 
Longtime Bartlesville trainer Alan Mount focused on Archambo’s lower left leg, particularly around the foot and ankle area. 
 
After a few minutes, Archambo got to his feet and two people — one under each arm — helped him walk out the front end of the gym, with 4:11 left in the first quarter. 
 
After the game, he would leave on crutches. 
 
Within 70 seconds of Archambo’s exit from the game, the Bruins threw in four more points — a reverse layup on baseline drive by Tanner and two free throws by Gronigan — to stretch their lead to 8-0. 
 
Jenks then went on a 4-0 spurt — a free throw by Cole Surrett and a three-pointer by Anania Carson — to cut Bartlesville’s score in half. 
 
The Bruins finished out the quarter with two more Gronigan charity tosses and a layup by Dina — off a back cut and pass from Tanner — to carry a 12-4 advantage into the second period. 
 
The tough times for Jenks continued when Bruin guard Matt Simpson dialed in a layup — on another one of those back-cut-and-feed plays — to open the second period scoring. 
 
The Bruins then built a 16-4 lead. 
 
To their credit, the Trojans then made a stand — despite the roaring noise from the Bruin student section, not to mention the homecrowd squeezed together on the bleachers. 
 
Jenks whittled the margin back to four points, 20-16, just past the halfway point of the second quarter. 
 
But, Bilger jump-started the Bruins again when he flushed a three-pointer — with Tanner spooning him an assist from the high post — to widen the gap back to seven points, 23-16. 
 
Bartlesville bumped its lead back to 10 points, 27-17, going into halftime. 
 
Jenks made several rally rumblings in the second half. But, the Bruins repelled every comeback. 
 
About 4:30 into the third quarter, Jenks trailed by just four points, 29-25, after a running hook by Surrett. 
 
Moments later, Gronigan sank a three-pointer. He also canned another trey in the closing seconds of the period to elevate the Bruins to an eight-point lead, 37-29. 
 
By the start of the fourth period, Jenks had ran out of gas — or bullets. 
 
Forty-seven seconds into the quarter, Tanner scored a conventional three-point play to push the Bruins back to a double-digit lead, 40-29. 
 
Jenks never pulled closer than eight points the rest of the evening. 
 
The Bruins led late by 16, 54-38, but Jenks scored a flurry of points in the final minute. 
 
Next up, the Bruins will be home two times this week — on Tuesday and Friday.
