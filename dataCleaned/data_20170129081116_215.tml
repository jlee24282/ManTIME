<TITLE>Auckland City at giant-killing best</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Auckland City FC have beaten Korean club champions FC Seoul in the opening match of an annual four-nation invitation tournament in Hong Kong. 
 
Emiliano Tade finished a slick move he started himself on the stroke of halftime in a keenly-fought clash at the Nike Lunar New Year Cup. 
 
It capped a dominant first-half effort from the Oceania champion club, who came under pressure in the spell from the K-League outfit. 
 
"It's a fantastic result," said Auckland City coach Ramon Tribulietx. 
 
"They're a full time professional team, with a big stadium and big facilities and some guys from Auckland City just a very small club in New Zealand has not only managed to compete but also win the game." 
 
The celebrations were dampened by an injury to captain Angel Berlanga, the defender taken to hospital for x-rays on a facial injury. 
 
Their opponents in Tuesday's final will be host club Kitchee SC, who beat Thai champions SCG Muangthong United in a penalty shootout following a 1-1 draw.
