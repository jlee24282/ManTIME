Some of the skill positions might be lacking in depth but there was one standout there and several good linemen to choose from on the Senior Bowl s South squad offense 1 TE O J Howard Alabama Arguably the top prospect on either team at any position Howard is blessed with tight end size and wide receiver speed Athletically he s as good of a prospect as one will ever scout at the position At 250 pounds he s still thin for his 6 foot 5 frame but he holds his own in run blocking Watching Howard jump offsides and have an easy drop makes one question his focus at times but that s nitpicking when trying to decide just how high he should go in the first round 2 OT G Forrest Lamp Western Kentucky An injury on Day 1 limited him the rest of the week which is a shame because we would have loved to have seen more of him What he showed in that short time however was impressive There might be some concern about his size playing left tackle he s just under 6 4 and 305 pounds but he passed the test on the first day in pass protection When he gets locked onto a defender they don t get away He was beaten once with a swim move He s considered an early round pick for good reason but it will be interesting to see if he ends up at tackle or guard 3 OT Conor McDermott UCLA He is on the other end from Lamp While Lamp is on the shorter end of offensive tackles in the NFL McDermott is on the taller end at 6 8 305 pounds but he can still move He does a good job of keeping his hands inside and riding pass rushing defensive ends wide of their target a lot of defensive ends seemed to end up on the ground by getting off balance and too wide against him He might need to improve his foot quickness some and be careful not to set too wide as he got beat at least once by an edge rusher setting him up outside and beating him inside http www scout com nfl story 1748877 senior bowl south weigh ins measu 4 G C Jon Toth Kentucky Other interior linemen came in rated higher than him by analysts but we like what we saw Is he a guard or a center He actually looked more comfortable at guard where he can anchor down against power defenders and hold his own on most occasions He s good at sliding down the line so we could see him being an effective pulling guard at the next level He always seems to be in position but has to be careful about getting beat by quick swim moves 5 WR Artavis Scott Clemson Scott has the dimensions of a slot receiver at 5 10 and 194 pounds He s strong enough to take the ball inside but he has the body control to play outside and uses his body to play much bigger He comes in and out of his breaks quickly and catches everything near him Not a No 1 but an ideal No 2 or No 3 6 QB Josh Dobbs Tennessee Blessed with the best combination of size arm strength and athleticism Dobbs made all of the necessary throws He was plagued by interceptions at Tennessee and that s going to be a concern for whoever drafts him but in this setting he was the top quarterback prospect on either team 7 G Antonio Garcia Troy He grew on us as the week progressed On Day 1 he seemed to lunge and lose his balance too much but he appeared quicker off the snap and more in control as practices continued throughout the week He has a good anchor can move defenders off the line in the running game and follows the action He may not make the projection of a Day 2 pick in the draft but he should be able to develop into a solid guard for years in the NFL 8 WR Chad Willliams Grambling State At 6 0 and 204 pounds Williams is a strong physical receiver ever who helped his draft stock as much as anyone in attendance Williams not only held his own against big school defensive backs he flourished Williams showed an extra gear with the ball in his hands that led the coaching staff to try and get it to him on reverses and quick hitters 9 WR Josh Reynolds Texas A M Reynolds is 6 2 which gives him a height advantage in this crowd He takes advantage of it with his ability to elevate Reynolds had an early drop in the week but shook it off to have a productive showing and seemed to form a nice combination with quarterback Josh Dobbs 10 TE Evan Engram Ole Miss Engram is a bit of a tweener for the NFL tight end position but he was being used out of the backfield as an h back as well as tight end Looking for comparisons on the field Engram s game shows a lot of similarities to former fourth round pick of the New England Patriots Hernandez was 6 2 and 245 pounds at the NFL Combine and Engram 6 3 1 18 and 236 pounds at the Senior Bowl and should weigh in over 240 at the combine Engram has the size to bully safeties and the quickness to run around linebackers He s a serviceable blocker which is all a team will need when one considers his plus skills in the pass happy NFL Scott Kennedy contributed to this report
