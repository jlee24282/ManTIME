<TITLE>Budget work to test Burgum Legislature</TITLE>
<TEXT>
It wasn t a surprise when Gov Doug Burgum released his budget proposals that called for less spending than was in former Gov Jack Dalrymple s budget Burgum cited the continued drop in revenues for proposing about 160 million less in spending than recommended by Dalrymple Legislators generally seemed pleased with Burgum s plan They weren t however ready to concede that they couldn t find more ways to cut spending I call it a good start said House Majority Leader Al Carlson R Fargo Burgum s budget proposal contains 13 3 billion of which 4 62 billion is ongoing general fund spending This is down from around the 13 475 billion proposed by Dalrymple of which 4 78 billion was in general fund dollars If legislators follow Burgum s budget state employees will notice the cuts Burgum wants about 100 million more in cuts in state agencies than proposed by Dalrymple Burgum seeks to eliminate 633 full time state jobs compared to the 583 proposed by Dalrymple While state officials don t have an exact number it appears more than half of the 633 cuts can be accomplished by not filling dark positions and retirements Burgum also wants to drop a proposed 1 percent state employee pay raise in the second year of the 2017 19 biennium There s also a proposal to skip a 1 percent increase for K 12 education funding in the biennium s second year Inflationary increases for Medicaid providers would be dropped that year as well State employees could be facing changing job assignments and less pay than anticipated That shouldn t be unexpected during leaner times On the campaign trail and after his election Burgum has been calling on everyone to help him reinvent government He envisons a more efficient government one that does more with less money and fewer employees That s the goal of all good businesses How legislators wrap Burgum s proposals into a final budget will be interesting to watch They have ideas of their own on how to make government more efficient Legislators have begun debating a resolution that asks the public to vote on abolishing the state treasurer s office Supporters argue eliminating the office will result in savings State Treasurer Kelly Schmidt counters that her small staff has done a good job of managing the state s money and investments It s a good debate to conduct Legislators may decide they don t want to put the issue on the ballot because the treasurer s office is the best way to do business If that s the case it will be a decision based on a good discussion Everything should be under review for savings but not everything needs to be changed Burgum and the Legislature are going in the right direction The big budget decisions usually aren t made until the end of the session If the new governor and the Legislature develop a good working relationship the final budget could launch North Dakota on the path to reinventing government
