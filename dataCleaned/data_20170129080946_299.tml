<TEXT>
Supreme Court of Iowa STATE OF IOWA Plaintiff v IOWA DISTRICT COURT FOR SCOTT COUNTY Defendant No 15 2151 Decided January 20 2017 Thomas J Miller Attorney General Martha E Trout Assistant Attorney General Michael Walton County Attorney and Steve Berger Assistant County Attorney for plaintiff Mark C Smith State Appellate Defender and Vidhya K Reddy Assistant Appellate Defender for defendant The State seeks review of the district court s denial of emergency response restitution pursuant to Iowa Code section 321J 2 13 b in an operating while intoxicated OWI case The same legal issue is presented in State v District Court N W 2d Iowa 2016 decided today Our holding in that case is dispositive on the facts presented in this case Accordingly we affirm the decision of the district court denying restitution and annul the writ I Background Facts and Proceedings According to the minutes of testimony Davenport Police Officer Michael Stegall was on patrol in the early hours of April 7 2015 Officer Stegall observed a white Ford pickup truck cross the center line of traffic and nearly strike an oncoming vehicle traveling in the opposite direction The other vehicle was able to swerve out of the truck s path and avoid a head on collision Officer Stegall pulled over the truck at which time he also noticed the truck s license plate light was out Officer Stegall approached the pickup truck and identified the driver as Homer Christner Officer Stegall detected an odor of an alcoholic beverage on Christner s breath and noticed that Christner had bloodshot watery eyes and slow speech Officer Stegall asked Christner to step out of the vehicle and perform various field sobriety tests Christner failed these tests and later submitted to a preliminary breath test Officer Stegall arrested Christner and transported him to the Scott County Jail Once at the jail Officer Stegall read Christner the implied consent advisory and allowed Christner the opportunity to make a phone call Christner ultimately refused to submit to chemical testing Christner later pled guilty to OWI first offense in violation of Iowa Code section 321J 2 2 a 2015 Before sentencing the State submitted a request for emergency response restitution on behalf of the Davenport Police Department pursuant to Iowa Code section 321J 2 13 b The form requested restitution for the cost of Officer Stegall s time and the time Stegall s squad car was in use in connection with the traffic stop arrest and processing of Christner A hearing on the restitution request was held on the date of sentencing At the restitution hearing Officer Stegall testified that he pulled over Christner s vehicle at approximately 1 06 a m due to Christner s nearly striking another car head on Stegall acknowledged that Christner did not actually collide with the other vehicle or cause any injuries but the officer testified that he absolutely viewed Christner s conduct as dangerous Officer Stegall finished dealing with Christner at the jail approximately an hour after the traffic stop Stegall then completed required paperwork related to the incident Officer Stegall testified that the emergency response restitution requested by the State covered two hours of the officer s time at an hourly rate of 61 30 and two hours for the time his squad car was out of service during that time at an hourly rate of 18 00 for a total of 158 60 1 Christner resisted the State s restitution request and argued that t he response by Officer Stegall was not an emergency response In a written ruling the district court agreed with Christner and denied the State s claim for restitution The court characterized the present case as only involving services provided by a police department in investigating and effecting the routine arrest and processing of a person for OWI The court therefore concluded T he Iowa Legislature did not intend the routine arrest and processing of a Defendant to be subject to an emergency response restitution claim If the legislature wanted to include nonemergency routine traffic stop activity it would have said the cost of any response and not add the limiting language of emergency The legislature purposefully defined emergency response broadly to capture the often unique responses fire medical and law enforcement must have to these incidents Not every emergency involves an accident although that is typically the case The broadness of the Iowa definition was merely a way to include those unique case specific responses that happen even when there is no accident as a result of the violation It is over reaching to include the routine traffic stop investigation and processing in the definition of emergency response The State filed a petition for writ of certiorari with this court See Iowa R App P 6 107 1 We granted the petition II Scope and Standard of Review We review rulings on questions of statutory interpretation for correction of errors at law State v Olutunde 878 N W 2d 264 266 Iowa 2016 quoting In re R D 876 N W 2d 786 791 Iowa 2016 We also review restitution orders for correction of errors at law State v Hagen 840 N W 2d 140 144 Iowa 2013 In reviewing a restitution order we determine whether the court s findings lack substantial evidentiary support or whether the court has not properly applied the law Id quoting State v Bonstetter 637 N W 2d 161 165 Iowa 2001 III Disposition For the reasons set forth in today s State v District Court decision Iowa Code section 321J 2 13 b does not authorize recovery of the costs of the routine law enforcement activities involved in this case See N W 2d Officer Stegall stopped Christner after he witnessed Christner engage in erratic driving and cross the center line into oncoming traffic There was no accident or 911 call As in District Court we certainly intend no criticism of Officer Stegall s actions in removing Christner from the road However this case did not involve an emergency response by the police within the meaning of the statute and it is not the type of case for which public agency restitution is authorized Accordingly we annul the writ WRIT ANNULLED FOOTNOTES 1 The court also heard testimony from a lieutenant with the Davenport Police Department supporting the department s calculation of hourly rates for its officers and squad cars PER CURIAM
