The Green Bay Packers made most of the big plays during an eight game winning streak During the first half on Sunday they didn t make any against the Atlanta Falcons ATLANTA The Green Bay Packers got blown out by the Atlanta Falcons 44 21 in Sunday s NFC Championship Game And yet there was a feeling of what might have been The Packers had chances to make some momentum changing plays They just didn t make any of them Those are the type of plays that championship teams made and the Falcons made them to advance to the Super Bowl against New England We didn t That s the fact of the matter coach Mike McCarthy said But we feel confident with our offense with Aaron Rodgers that we can go we can score with anybody We needed to do that today and we didn t get that done The Falcons finished with 493 yards including 325 in the first half when they rolled to a 24 0 lead But it s worth wondering What would have happened had Mason Crosby not missed a field goal which would have cut the deficit to 7 3 Crosby had made an NFL playoff record 23 consecutive field goals including the 56 and 51 yarders to beat Dallas last week My job is to make that kick and get us points there on the first drive Crosby said I feel sick about it I wish I would ve hit that through I had a great year This team had such a great run Obviously it hurts What would have happened had fullback Aaron Ripkowski not fumbled around the Falcons 10 yard line and the Packers in position to cut the deficit to 10 7 It s a big momentum swing Ripkowski said You never want to turn the ball over and that was really tough for us to bounce back from I don t know exactly what happen If I had to guess it was just a double wrap by the defensive back He got his hands in there and got it out We ll go in watch the film and figure out what happened What would have happened had linebacker Jake Ryan pounced on a botched trick play in which receiver Taylor Gabriel fumbled at the Falcons 40 With a 17 0 deficit the Packers would have been in position to get on the scoreboard It s frustrating you know Ryan said I was almost there but the ball is 20 inches and it bounces in different ways Stuff like that happens but you ve got to execute when you get those opportunities When you get them you ve got to You ve got to create turnovers What would have happened had either safety Marwin Evans or cornerback LaDarius Gunter come up with interceptions on the Falcons final drive That possession ended with Matt Ryan s third and 1 touchdown pass to Julio Jones that made it 24 0 at halftime It just wasn t happening for us today linebacker Julius Peppers said of the missed opportunities Today just wasn t our day at all Not at all The Packers so resilient during their eight game winning streak couldn t withstand the Falcons assault The Packers who dominated the turnover ledger at plus 16 during that late season surge were minus 2 on Sunday We just played a hot team You ve got to give them credit quarterback Aaron Rodgers said Matt Ryan is playing incredible right now and that s a pretty good offense Their defense played really well last week and did some good things today I feel like we kind of hurt ourselves in the first half more than they really stopped us but no they have a good football team There s a reason they re moving on to the Super Bowl They re going to be tough to stop Bill Huber is publisher of PackerReport com and has written for Packer Report since 1997 E mail him at packwriter2002 yahoo com or leave him a question in Packer Report s subscribers only Packers Pro Club forum Find Bill on Twitter at www twitter com PackerReport
