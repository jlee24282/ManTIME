<TITLE>Unrealised potential on canvas Prasoon Joshi ahead of Uttarakhand polls</TITLE>
<TEXT>
The article below represents a preview only and is not meant for reuse or republishing India Jan 29 I spent early years in Uttarakhand and I have nice memories about state I see a lot of unrealised potential on the canvas called Uttarakhand But there should have been more colours into it I see our people had to travel inside and outside country not necessarily for doing best jobs They are struggling for making two ends meet This is migration just for survival Migration though is not always bad Some states have prospered from remittance and the standards of living have gone up In case of Uttarakhand basic education facilities are lacking and the system fails to meet the expectations of the youngsters There are sectors where one can feel that development has taken place New buildings new roads are visible
