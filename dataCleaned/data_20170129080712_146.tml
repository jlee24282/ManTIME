<TITLE>Jacobson: It’s easy to point fingers, but maybe there is more we all can do to teach our children</TITLE>
<TEXT>
It’s easy to point fingers in all directions when laying blame for failures in public education. 
 
There are plenty of stories every day talking about the deficiencies of school districts, principals and teachers, curricula, testing and the like. 
 
However, the most important factor behind the success or failure of a kiddo often is none of these. 
 
For me, parenting represents the most vital part of any child’s success in school. I am the parent of three teenagers, and I know the difficulties that arise when trying to make the right decision for each of my kids. 
 
These tasks are, of course, exacerbated as each of them are individuals and have their own personality, their own learning style and a unique level of motivation. 
 
I too receive those emails from school about the PAC, PTA, the PTO (if you don’t know what these stand for, you’re probably not a parent), the teacher appreciation dinner, the poinsettia fundraiser for prom, the after prom parent committee, etc, etc.  I can’t do them all; in fact, sometimes I can’t do any.  Or at least that is what I convince myself. 
 
I sit down with one or two of my kiddos at least once weekly and try to show them how I would do algebra, or fill out a family tree. I sign yet another permission slip for another movie on the reproductive process, or do any of a number of other tasks to help my kids learn. 
 
You know what, though? I can do better, and I am asking you to join me. 
 
If everyone who is reading this column can do two more things, or even one more activity, each week to assist a school-aged child, whether it be reading a book with an elementary school kid, talking to a middle-schooler about Desert Storm or Vietnam, or taking a high-schooler out for a Coke at a local restaurant, it would make a difference. 
 
Don’t you think if we all did that the results our children achieve would be better? 
 
I don’t think this idea is a replacement for evaluating school finance and ensuring we are providing the appropriate amount of money to expend on each of our students. I am simply saying if we as parents all did a little more, wouldn’t that help?
