<TITLE>'Mann Ki Baat': What all PM Narendra Modi said in his radio programme</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Cheating is never beneficial, no one must resort to it. If you do it what will you tell your children?: PM Modi 
  
People have told you often but I am saying again- do not cheat. Even if no one caught you, you know that you have cheated in exams: PM

If you form a habit of cheating, there will be no desire to learn. Trying to cheat requires time, creativity. Use it for better purposes: PM
