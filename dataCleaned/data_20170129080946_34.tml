<TITLE>Long finally gets his playoff shot</TITLE>
<TEXT>
FOXBOROUGH Mass There was a time when Chris Long didn t think this opportunity would ever come A time when words like playoffs and Super Bowl seemed like unattainable unicorns that the 31 year old Patriots defensive lineman might never touch Eight years in the NFL spent on underperforming teams and having seasons potholed by injuries have that effect So when the veteran was asked this week whether the chance to earn a ring was on his mind when he signed with the Patriots this offseason he didn t hesitate to answer It s the whole reason I came here he said Everybody wants to win That s the bottom line When you re making a decision as an older player of where you want to be you want to be in situations like this with opportunities like this We ve earned the opportunity Whatever we do with it that s up to us Next week s Super Bowl matchup with Atlanta will also be a chance for him to match the Super Bowl ring won by his father Hall of Famer Howie Long who won a title with the Los Angeles Raiders in 1984 The elder Long will have a unique vantage point to watch his son as an analyst for Fox which has the broadcast rights for the game But Chris said it shouldn t affect him Not a ton It just means he s there he said We ll see each other But we re not big on the sentimental stuff While Howie Long was an integral part of the Raiders defense Chris has embraced being a role player on a New England defense that s really void of any big names More NFL
