<TITLE>Mobile speed camera locations in Dorset from Monday 30th January</TITLE>
<TEXT>
On their website, Dorset Police say: "The team aims to use a combination of enforcement and education to tackle the 'fatal five': drink and drug driving, excessive and inappropriate speed, not wearing a seatbelt, driver distractions such as hand-held mobile phone and careless driving.

"The No Excuse team will deploy to collision/casualty sites with visits to speed complaint/community concern sites as resources allow as per the dates below.

"The team will deal with any offences detected whilst travelling to those locations and will move to new locations not listed below if deemed to be of operational necessity.

"They operate 24-hours a day seven days a week â€“ they could be anywhere at any time."

They will be on the lookout in almost all areas of Dorset.
