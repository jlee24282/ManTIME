<TEXT>
By YREKA Calif More than 100 people attended the last in a series of three meetings Thursday in Yreka seeking public comment on the planned removal of four dams along the Klamath River and the overwhelming feeling expressed by Siskiyou County residents was outrage Many stated that the majority of the county had spoken in favor of leaving the dams in place and believe that the government entities involved in the decision were not listening to them Some threatened lawsuits if the dam removal process moves forward without considering residents concerns Public officials who spoke during the meeting included Siskiyou County Board of Supervisors members County Assessor Mike Mallory and Erin Ryan a staff member for state Rep Doug LaMalfa R Richvale All essentially spoke in favor of leaving the dams in place with Ryan stating that LaMalfa had sent her with a message for Siskiyou County citizens Zinke told me We don t pull down dams we put em up in reference to President Trump s Interior Secretary pick Rep Ryan Zinke R Montana The remark was met with cheers from the crowd Parker Thaler senior specialist for the California State Water Resources Control Board s Water Quality Certification Program provided the meeting s attendees with an overview of the history of the Klamath dams and the legal processes surrounding them over the past years In September 2016 the Klamath River Renewal Corporation a then newly established 501 c 3 nonprofit jointly filed with PacifiCorp for a license transfer application that seeks to divide the Klamath hydroelectric project into two pieces the Klamath Hydroelectric Project and the Lower Klamath Project The KHP would consist of the East and West Side Powerhouses on the Link River Keno Dam on the Klamath River and Fall Creek Dam on a tributary of the Klamath River The LKP would include J C Boyle Dam Copco 1 and 2 dams and Iron Gate Dam If the transfer application is approved PacifiCorp would maintain ownership of the Klamath Hydroelectric Project while the KRRC would take over the Lower Klamath Project The application is pending before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission KRRC also filed a license surrender application with FERC that seeks to decommission sufficient portions of the Lower Klamath Project with the goal of creating a free flowing Klamath River and volitional fish passage According to the Yreka Fish and Wildlife Office Volitional means that fish will be migrating around a dam through an upstream fish ladder or downstream bypass system as opposed to being trapped and hauled around the dam or attempting to move through hydropower turbines where many would be killed Speakers at Thursday s meeting largely were in favor of keeping the dams in place including those who said removing the dams would cause the Klamath to become muddy and smelly during the summer because they believe removal would significantly decrease the river s flow during that time In that same vein concern that the river would flood in colder months was also mentioned numerous times Many farmers and ranchers spoke in favor of the dams tying them to the livelihood they have enjoyed in the agricultural industry Sami Jo Difuntorum spoke on behalf of the Shasta Nation posing the hypothetical that the tribe s ancestors who are buried along the river would be washed away by potential flooding if dam removal occurred Several Copco Lake residents expressed concern for their safety views and property values if the dams come out The 2014 Copco fire was mentioned repeatedly Residents noted that water had been drawn from the lake to protect their homes and hoped the dams would stay in allowing the lake to continue to be used as a fire protection resource Those who voiced support for dam removal included members of the Yurok tribe who believe that removing the dams will restore the Klamath s Salmon population an important resource for their people Konrad Fisher executive director of Klamath Riverkeeper an organization in favor of dam removal said that he believed that people on both sides of the dam argument wanted the same things but disagreed about the way to obtain them He praised the SWRCB s actions thus far and voiced support for the science it had used The SWRCB will be taking comments on the matter through 5 p m Wednesday Feb 1 Written comments can be emailed to WR401program waterboards ca gov
