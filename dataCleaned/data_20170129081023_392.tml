<TITLE>Senior captains lead Badgers in Iowa</TITLE>
<TEXT>
IOWA CITY, IOWA – The Badgers were led by their seniors at the Black and Gold Premier, getting victories from Brandon Mortensen in the heptathlon and Lorenzo Larry in the Elite 60 meter dash in the first two-day meet of the season. 
  
"This weekend went well," Mortensen said. "There were some ups and downs but that's the nature of the multi events." 
  
Brandon Mortensen delivered a sensational performance over the course of the two-day event, winning the heptathlon with a career-best 5,574 points. The senior's performance also placed him fifth on the all-time indoor list for UW, as well as a top 10 mark in the nation for the season. 
  
"Overall I'm happy with my final score," Mortensen said. "There's always room for improvement and that's what makes the multi events fun." 
  
Mortensen won the 60 meter hurdles with a time of 8.21 seconds, along with a stellar showing in the pole vault. He reached a height of 15 feet, five inches (4.70 meters) and used a great start of Friday to capture the victory. 
  
"All of our heptathletes competed well this weekend but now it's time to iron out some kinks and get prepared for Big Ten's," Mortensen said. 
  
Coming in second for the heptathlon was Trent Nytes with 5,466 points. The sophomore just missed out on a new personal best by eight points, but used a third-place distance in the pole vault, 13-9 ¼ (4.20m), to claim his third top-three finish in a heptathlon in the last two indoor seasons. 
  
Larry continued his winning ways with a blistering run of 6.75 in the Elite 60 meter dash. In one of the closest races of the day, Larry earned the victory by six thousandths of a second. 
  
In the shot put, Riley Budde earned second place with a throw of 58-2 (17.72m) while Josh McDonald took fifth with a distance of 56-7 ½ (17.25m). 
  
Freshman Oliver Hoare contributed with one of the top performances of the day, placing second in the Elite mile with a time of 4:07.81. Joe Hardy wound up with a fifth-place finish in 4:10.79. 
  
Junior Cooper Barth ran to a fourth-place finish in the Elite 800 meters with a time of 1:53.62, besting his time at last weekend's meet by over a second and a half. 
  
Wisconsin freshman Zach Lorbeck and Paul Afflitto placed third and fifth, respectively, in their first taste of the heptathlon at the collegiate level. Lorbeck finished with 5,205 points while Afflitto earned 5,019. 
  
The Badgers will head to New York City for next weekend's Armory Collegiate Invitational, a two-day event that begins on Friday, February 3.
