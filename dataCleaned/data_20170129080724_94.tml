<TITLE>Shira Hirshberg Repeal of health care law will add to costs</TITLE>
<TEXT>
In these uncertain times working families need the safety and security of health coverage more than ever Some members of Congress are discussing major changes to our health system including a repeal of the Affordable Care Act without a replacement They are also discussing major damaging changes to Medicaid the Children s Health Insurance Program and Medicare I support our legislators continued efforts to oppose this repeal and encourage them to continue to take a strong stand on this issue Repealing the ACA would leave tens of millions of Americans almost 30 million people including 4 million children without health coverage It would also affect millions more who have benefited greatly from the new law through improvements such as free preventative care In my work as a registered dietitian nutritionist I see many people for preventive care I help them manage their weight which reduces their risk of Type 2 diabetes and heart disease I help women eat the right foods before and during their pregnancies which improves outcomes for both the mother and the baby Preventive care such as seeing a registered dietician nutritionist helps people avoid the huge costs associated with debilitating chronic diseases like Type 2 diabetes This is where we should be spending our money if we want to save health care dollars over the next 50 years We should give people access to affordable care rather than pay for expensive procedures later In order to keep our families safe and our economy and communities healthy we must have quality affordable healthcare Shira Hirshberg Providence
