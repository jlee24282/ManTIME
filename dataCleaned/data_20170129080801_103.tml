Okonjo-Iweala: Former Minister Says She Is Not Running For President [PICTURES]  

 
Okonjo-Iweala recently debunked reports that she will be running alongside Atiku Abubakar in the 2019 presidential election. 
 The former minister of finance, Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, has distanced herself from a social media campaign calling on her to run for President in 2019.  
The campaign which is running on Facebook, also presents the African Development Bank, Akinwumi Adesina, as the former minister’s running mate. 
 
From Pulse News investigation, the Facebook campaign with an official page name: “Okonjo-Iweala/Adesina 2019 Rescue” has 25,263 Likes already. 
 
According to post on her Facebook page, Okonjo-Iweala said she has nothing to do with the campaign. 
 
The former minister posted on her timeline, saying: 
 
Disclaimer 
 
My attention has been drawn to this campaign making the rounds on Facebook https://web.facebook.com/OkonjoIwealaAdesina2019Rescue/… 
 
I have nothing to do with this and I urge those behind it to stop, as I am focused on other things. 
 
While I thank those who want to have my name constantly in the headlines for one important position or the other in the country, rest assured I am fully occupied with my international assignments and loving it. 
 
Best.
