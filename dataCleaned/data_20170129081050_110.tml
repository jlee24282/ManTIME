<TITLE>Perth Glory to host English giants Chelsea in new stadium coup in 2018</TITLE>

A-League side Perth Glory will play host to English Premier League giants Chelsea in a friendly to mark the opening of Perth's new multi-purpose venue next yar.

It will be the second time the Blues have toured Australia in three years, the then Jose Mourinho-coached Chelsea having travelled to NSW to play Sydney in a friendly in 2015 in front of 83,598 fans at the ANZ Stadium. Chelsea won that game 1-0.

Tourism WA and the new stadium operator, VenuesLive, have put the Glory deal together, with the WA Government claiming that the London club, who are favourites to win this year's Premier League title, will attract huge crowds from not just the rest of Australia but also Asia.

"This is an enormous opportunity for not only football fans, but sport fans in general, from around the nation and the Asia-Pacific region, to witness one of the best and biggest clubs in the world to play in our own backyard," Glory CEO Peter Filopoulos said.

"This will not only help grow and foster football in Western Australia but will expose Perth Glory's brand to a new market and millions of viewers.

"This will be Chelsea's only match in Australia during the A-League pre-season campaign and will play an important role in Perth Glory's preparations for the 2018/19 season."

WA Premier and Tourism Minister Colin Barnett made the announcement at the new Perth Stadium in Burswood and said the presence of a team like Chelsea would draw fans from Singapore, Malaysia and China as well as Australian soccer supporters.

He predicted 15,000 interstate and overseas visitors and said that could generate around $15 million for the WA tourism industry.

Glory's next assignment is rather more mundane, as, having lost at the weekend to the A-League's bottom team, Central Coast, they now return to their nib Stadium next Saturday night to host the Newcastle Jets. The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.
