<TEXT>
EXETER On paper it was a matchup that heavily favored the Bedford High School boys hockey team The Bulldogs entered Saturday night s contest against Exeter as the stingiest team in Division I having allowed 10 goals in 11 games Bedford had limited its last nine opponents to a total of five goals Offensively challenged Exeter meanwhile had scored more than three goals once this season So Bedford s 7 0 triumph at the Rinks at Exeter should have surprised no one Bedford led 2 0 after one period and 6 0 entering the third The Bulldogs scored three times in the final five minutes of the second period Running time was used during the final 15 minutes When you re spending so much time in the offensive zone that obviously cuts down on the offensive opportunities for the other team Bedford coach Marty Myers said I stress team defense Exeter s a good team They played aggressive in all three zones and not every team plays us like that I thought we handled that well I thought from the drop of the puck we skated hard as they did I m very happy Senior forward Griffin Gagne senior forward Jay Roberto and junior forward Colin Voloshin each scored twice for the Bulldogs Jake Rioux collected Bedford s other goals The Bulldogs 11 0 1 scored two power play goals and twice while they were short handed Junior Frederick Veloshin made 18 saves to help Bedford earn its sixth shutout of the season We couldn t play them five on five nevermind five on four Exeter coach Jim Tufts said That s a good hockey team There s no holes A lot of us this year have a good first group and then it drops off a little bit Not those guys I think the depth makes a difference with these guys It was a good battle and I thought the kids competed I like my kids and I like how hard they work We have to find a way to win some hockey games Exeter 2 7 0 received 24 saves from sophomore Howie Fraser The Blue Hawks have scored 14 goals in their nine games Bedford has outscored its 12 opponents 72 10 this season The Bulldogs are the only unbeaten team in Division I They re very disciplined and they work hard Tufts said They re the favorite but I wouldn t forget about Concord Hanover and Guertin Those guys are still pretty good rbrown unionleader com
