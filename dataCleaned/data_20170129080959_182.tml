In the 1989 movie Dead Poets Society Robin Williams starred as a teacher in a private boys school The entire movie was profound but one powerful scene has stuck with me ever since when he hopped up on desk while teaching and said I stand upon my desk to remind myself that we must constantly look at things in a different way To be able to look at things from many perspectives is an important life skill Consider the words of author F Scott Fitzgerald The test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function One should for example be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise Today s reviewed books offer different perspectives on three distinct ideas and that is worth reading about Books to borrow The following book is available at many public libraries Tuck Everlasting by Natalie Babbitt Farrar Straus and Giroux 139 pages Read aloud age 8 and older Read yourself age 9 10 and older Sometime things come together in strange ways with no apparent connection But like pieces in a puzzle one begins to see how they fit So it is for 10 year old Winnie Foster the Tuck family and the strange man in the yellow suit Winnie Foster is an only child and doted upon by her mother and grandmother What Winnie really wants is to be by herself for a change do something interesting Fed up with being overprotected Winnie decides to run away just for a little while into the woods It was there that she meets Jesse Tuck The Tuck family had stumbled upon eternal life after they drank from a magic spring 87 years ago From that time on they never aged and couldn t die They are stuck exactly the age they were when they drank that water When Winnie discovers the Tucks secret Jesse and his family are frantic No one must find out about the magic spring and the Tucks must make Winnie understand why that living forever is not the blessing one might think But a strange man in a yellow suit follows Winnie and Jesse and having a different opinion of eternal life tries to cash in on the Tucks long kept secret It s up to Winnie to save the Tucks and ultimately do what she s longed for to make a difference in the world Magnificently written it is little wonder that this classic story continues to be enthusiastically embraced since it was first published over four decades ago Librarian s choice Library Bernville Area Community Library 6721 Bernville Road Bernville Co director Ruth Darling Co director and children s librarian Alicea Rodig Choices this week I m Trying to Love Spiders by Bethany Barton A Wrinkle in Time by Madeleine L Engle Savvy by Ingrid Law Books to buy The following books are available at favorite bookstores Real Cowboys by Kate Hoefler illustrated by Jonathan Bean Houghton Mifflin Harcourt 2016 32 pages 16 99 hardcover Read aloud age 4 7 Read yourself age 7 If someone asked for a description of what a cowboy is like most of us would probably come up with the stereotype we ve been exposed to rough rowdy hardened men or something like that This beautiful book portrays what real cowboys are like Real cowboys are gentle patient peaceful and sensitive Real cowboys can be homesick are as many different colors as the Earth and girls too A warm tribute by Hoefler presenting readers with what a real cowboy is and subsequently teaching kids to be like a real cowboy with the life lessons she imparts this lovely book is perfectly complemented by the evocative illustrations of Bean Are Pirates Polite by Corinne Demas and Artemis Roehrig illustrated by David Catrow Orchard Books Scholastic 2016 36 pages 16 99 hardcover Read aloud age 3 6 Read yourself age 6 7 Through funny rhyming text kids learn that pirates actually have good manners They say please and thanks and although they can be rowdy up on the deck of their ship they use their inside voices when down below Pirates share their treasure equally they don t interrupt one another and they respect one another s privacy and don t go barging in through closed door they always knock first Through these and other things pirates do to be polite kids will laugh along with this zany bunch of pirates that hilariously emphasize that good manners are important Nationally syndicated Kendal Rautzhan writes and lectures on children s literature She can be reached at kendal sunlink net
