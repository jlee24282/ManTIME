<TITLE>Camera tech makes professional effects the hobbyists' domain</TITLE>
<TEXT>
If a picture historically has been worth 1,000 words, recent technological advancements have increased that value tenfold. 
 
Photographers no longer are limited to capturing a human’s-eye view of the world around them. New equipment lets shutterbugs shoot from the skies and in 360 degrees all at once. 
 
And, smartphones — plus or minus a peripheral or two — have become the de facto device through which people chronicle their surroundings. 
 
“The number of people interested in photography keeps growing exponentially,” said Sean MacDonald, owner of Everything Photography Store in Dubuque. “Now everybody from 10-year-old kids with an iPod or an iPhone and Instagram can get into photography.” 
 SMARTPHONES  
Nate Roling works in sales at Everything Photography. The store sells and leases cameras, including digital single-lens reflex cameras, the preferred gear for professionals. 
 
While the market for DSLRs exists and likely will continue to do so, compact “point-and-shoot” digital cameras effectively have been killed off by smartphones, Roling said. 
 
“Basically, the smartphone is people’s camera now,” he said. “Anything you were doing with your camera you are now doing with your smartphone.” 
 
Popular smartphones like the iPhone and Samsung Galaxy series boast cameras with up to 12 megapixels. They have built-in filters and settings to adjust for low-light and no-light scenarios. 
 
If that’s not enough, smartphone photographers can supplement their devices’ capabilities through add-ons, Roling said. Lenses can be clipped on to provide “fish-eye” effects, optical zooms or upclose “macro” photos. 
 
SLRs have the edge in some respects, according to Roling. 
 
“You can’t get some of the visual effects that you can from a full film camera,” he said. “The shallow depth of field, historically, has been the domain of the SLRs.” 
 
However, phone manufacturers are making strides in simulating some of those effects. 
 
“Professionals will always use professional cameras,” Roling said. 
 
However, “it’s going to become a hobby, much like film photography has become.” 
 EYE IN THE SKY AND BEHIND YOU  
Consumer drones with cameras have been around for years. However, as they get more advanced, they’re becoming more operator-friendly. 
 
“The newest ones with GPS are almost dummy-proof,” MacDonald said. 
 
Roling agreed. 
 
“They almost fly themselves,” he said. “They do fly themselves.” 
 
Some models can be deployed and assigned to follow a specific target with a few button presses, Roling said. They can automatically fly around obstacles and avoid collisions without input from a pilot. 
 
Virtual reality is the newest frontier of photography. Cameras that capture images and video from 360 degrees are becoming more prominent and affordable. 
 
Early models required photographers to “stitch” together footage from multiple camera angles to create the 360-degree effect, MacDonald said. Newer ones are doing that automatically. 
 
“The race is on to find one that is the most consumer-friendly,” he said. “No one wants to stitch eight videos together in special software before they can view it in 360 degrees.”
