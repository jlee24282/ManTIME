Re Reserve funds key part of plan to balance city s books Jan 25 Reserve funds key part of plan to balance city s books Jan 25 When your only tool is a hammer every problem looks like a nail Sadly Toronto s revenue toolbox includes only property taxes and user licensing fees This makes it an oddity among the world s great cities in not getting stable revenue from an income tax Everyone knows that property taxes are unfair because they have no relation to your ability to pay In Toronto land accounts for the bulk of a home s value so property taxes bear little relationship to the structure families occupy User and licensing fees are just as bad discriminating against those with the lowest incomes Why is Toronto stuck with a centuries old funding model long abandoned by other industrial nations Why does Queen s Park believe that it is acceptable to evict people from their homes by steady increases to property taxes or deny them services through unaffordable fees Article Continued Below Rather than hammering residents at every turn why not share the provincial income tax to fund municipal services based on ability to pay This would address the three major problems we face income inequality crumbling infrastructure and disappearing services without adding the bureaucracy of another tax Toronto doesn t have the tools it needs but there is nothing preventing the province from fixing this problem Gary Dale West Hill Toronto s budget process is like a boxing match between two blind men It looks like we have neither legal nor accounting professionals among our staff of 55 000 For those who failed their high school civics class health and education are among the many responsibilities of the provincial government and property taxes are supposed to fund municipal services The City of Toronto directly funds 25 per cent of public health The City s subsidy to colleges universities hospitals and correctional facilities approaches 1 billion a year City of Toronto property taxes directly fund 50 per cent of school budgets The education tax rate set by the province and applied to commercial properties in Toronto is the highest in the GTA Despite the direct municipal financial contributions to provincial mandates there has been no acknowledgement or official documentation of such municipal funding One should be very leery of any organization that does not document receipts Intentional omissions deceive the public Even Statistics Canada Catalogue no 13 015 X ISSN 1710 9264 p 18 has missed the municipal contributions to health and education posting contributions from municipal governments as zero Equally important all governments have failed to capture any of the more than 150 billion that have been permitted to escape taxation every year That s a lot of subways Regrettably accounting accountability transparency enforcement of legal mandates and logic are all absent in municipal decision making Those who look to the City for municipal services and those who answer for municipal decisions should aim their energies in more effective directions Stella Kargiannakis Toronto Mayor John Tory continues shaving the truth No property tax increase above 2 per cent excluding the half per cent to begin paying for Scarborough s one stop subway That s the best public transportation deal for Toronto s northeast he says Except it isn t and already exceeds 3 billion and counting He asked every city department to cut 2 6 per cent of their budget but skipped Police Services the single largest component Now he says Toronto s solid waste employees earn about what private companies pay their workers Yes if pensions and benefits aren t counted in But hey there s no moral dimension to it he says Bernard Katz Toronto Delivered daily The Morning Headlines Newsletter The Toronto Star and thestar com each property of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited One Yonge Street 4th Floor Toronto ON M5E 1E6 You can unsubscribe at any time Please contact us or see our privacy policy for more information
