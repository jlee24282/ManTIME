<TITLE>Webster s Keanu Neal worked hard to get to Super Bowl</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Webster might not be best known for its weekly flea market much longer It could soon be the hometown of a Super Bowl champion That s a claim residents will be able to make if the Atlanta Falcons knock off the New England Patriots on Feb 5 in Super Bowl LI in Houston And if the Falcons prevail Webster s favorite son will be former South Sumter High School and University of Florida standout Keanu Neal Neal a rookie defensive back with Atlanta will put the finishing touches on a storybook rookie season in the world s biggest football game this year The 17th overall pick in the 2016 NFL Draft Neal has helped transform the Falcons defensive unit from a liability into an asset Heading into the Super Bowl Neal has made 106 tackles despite missing the Falcons first two games with a knee injury Neal also forced five fumbles which is an NFL record for rookies It feels almost surreal right now Neal said on Tuesday I mean every boy dreams of playing in the Super Bowl and I m actually going to do it It seems like only yesterday that I was watching my brother former NFL defensive back Clint Hart playing for the San Diego Chargers against guys like Tom Brady and now I m getting ready to play against him in the biggest game of my life Surreal While playing in the Super Bowl seems like a dream to Neal it doesn t surprise anyone who has known him for years and watched him grow up and mature The only thing that surprises me is that he s playing in the Super Bowl at the age of 21 said former South Sumter football coach Inman Sherman I m not surprised Keanu s playing in the Super Bowl just that he got there so quickly He is the best student athlete we put out at South Sumter while I was at the school A 1 in 100 kid the total package No one ever outworked him on the football field in the weight room or in the classroom Sherman said Neal derives his work ethic from his parents Kathy Hart Neal and Clinton Neal Both of his parents worked in the oranges groves that once dotted the landscape in Central Florida in order to provide for their family By watching his parents grind through each day Neal learned the value of hard work At South Sumter the work ethic ingrained in him by his parents helped Neal become an All State performer and a member of the prestigious Parade All American team In his final two seasons with the Raiders Neal totaled 221 tackles and eight interceptions He was also a complete student athlete In addition to his football heroics Neal compiled a 3 8 grade point average We should ve just given him a key to the school Sherman said He was always there I remember driving by the school one day during spring break and he was out on the football field by himself doing foot work drills in the rain So many people today talk about the problems in public schools but I think KeKe Neal s nickname is proof of the good that can come out of a public school education Sherman believes that not only is Neal the best student athlete to graduate from South Sumter during his 32 years at the school but he is likely the greatest student athlete ever to graduate from South Sumter And if that is true Neal feels that Sherman deserves much of the credit for his success In fact he is so grateful for the impact Sherman had on his formative years that he recently presented the coach and his wife with tickets to the Super Bowl You can t put a value on everything coach Sherman has done for me Neal said He s a big reason I m the man and the football player I ve become He was always there for me and he s been there for every player he s ever coached Without his coaching his friendship and his guidance I don t know if I would ve ever made it to the National Football League Atlanta coach Dan Quinn might also owe Sherman a debt of gratitude After all he was the one who wanted to take Neal with the Falcons first round draft pick a decision that left some pundits and fans scratching their heads However Quinn s faith in Neal proved prophetic as the season wore on Neal s role in defensive game plans increased and he grew into an impact player Neal added an element of toughness to a defense that many felt was soft when the season began Keanu s become our best run stopper Quinn said We play him down in the box a lot and we do that intentionally He s very active and we want him where we expect the action to be He s been somebody who brings the right intent to the field He doesn t try to hit the target the running back or receiver He tries to hit through the target No matter what happens in Super Bowl LI whether Falcons win or lose and regardless of what kind of impact he has on the game Neal insists he will be the same when he returns to Sumter County after the game as was before He ll still be a small town kid who relishes spending time with family and friends Neal doesn t feel as if he is different from any other native of Webster he s just fortunate enough to get to make a living doing what he loves In fact he s not even the first resident to play college or professional football His brother was the first to play professionally and others who went on to play college football include Earl Everett and A J Bryant We always joke about something being in the well water in Webster Neal said It tastes like any other water but I don t know Maybe somebody should bottle it and start selling it That s a debate for a different time Neal is busy right now getting ready for a game A big game One that could put himself and Webster on a much larger map We ve been trying to treat this as just another game and preparing for it like we would any other opponent Neal said But we know it s not just another game It s the Super Bowl The most important game I ve ever played in
