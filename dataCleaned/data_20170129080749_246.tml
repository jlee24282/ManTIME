<TITLE>Letter Remembering the pay vote in two years</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Attention Voters Do not be deceived by the Beacon Hill politicians we recently placed in office who are supposed to represent us the hard working law abiding taxpayers of this Commonwealth Their very first legislative act was to vote themselves an obscene pay increase along with their pensions Really Who pray tell ran their campaign on this promise Thanks to my State Senator Ryan Fattman R along with Senators Anne Gobi D and Michael Moore D and the Republican Representatives for voting NO to this obscene first act on Beacon Hill Now the real test will come when the Governor vetoes this bill and the Legislature overrides it Will those politicians who voted NO take the pay increase anyway I contacted Senator Fattman s office and was told that he would write a letter to the Senate clerk stating that he will not take the pay increase What will the other Legislators do Keep your eyes wide open for the opportunity for hypocrisy will be on full display in the coming days on Beacon Hill And remember we get to vote again in two years Lenny Demers Douglas
