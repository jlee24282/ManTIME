<TEXT>
After a hard decision of demonetization people are expecting a soft and popular budget for the Financial Year 2017 18 to be presented on February 1 2017 by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley But it is a million dollar question whether it will fulfill the hopes of every section of the economy There are hopes that the Finance Minister will rationalize the Income Tax slabs to give relief to middle class people who are the tax payers in general It is also believed that keeping the elections in five states including Uttar Pradesh and Punjab Central Government will not press for the hard budget as it may be counterproductive for the ruling Bhartiya Janta Party BJP According to experts common people have been most affected due to the demonetisation announced by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi on November 8 2016 and they may find special attention in this budget as compensation Micro Small Medium Enterprises MSMEs sector accounts for more than 45 per cent of Country s manufacturing and exports MSME production has dropped significantly too due to demonetization as they have a heavy dependence on cash In Pre Budget Memorandum MSME sector has asked for the low cost funding as a large number of MSMEs are facing huge capital cost and are on the verge of collapse Rationalisation of the Income Tax slabs is too expected from the Finance Minister in the budget as Mr Jaitley has indicated more than one occasion for this He has indicated that either a new slab will be in place or the rates will go downwards The tax relief limit may be enhanced in the budget as various measures taken by the government in the last one year yielded in better tax collections allowing the exchequer to go for Income Tax relief The pension income for senior citizens over 65 years may be made completely tax free This will not only help the elderly but will also reduce operational work for income tax authorities More UNI ADP SHS ADG 1248
