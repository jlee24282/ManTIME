<TITLE>Ex Parliament member jailed for deceiving bank</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Manama :  A former parliamentary member has had his appeal rejected on a two-year-jail-term sentence issued against him for cheating a bank.  
 
The defendant reportedly took a BD44,268, personal loan from the bank in 2014 and submitted 12 cheques in return. 
 
However, the bank later discovered that the cheques submitted by the defendant were not valid as his account did not have any money.
