<TITLE>Pre eclampsia and risk of infantile haemangioma</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Summary Background Infantile haemangioma is the most common tumour of infancy but the association with pre eclampsia is poorly understood Objectives We determined the relationship between variants of pre eclampsia and risk of infantile haemangioma Methods We carried out a retrospective cohort study of hospital data for all live births between 1989 and 2013 in Quebec Canada We identified 14 240 neonates with and 1 930 564 without haemangioma before discharge and determined whether early or late onset pre eclampsia was documented on the maternal chart We used log binomial regression to compute prevalence ratios PRs and 95 confidence intervals CIs for the association between pre eclampsia and infantile haemangioma adjusted for maternal characteristics Results The prevalence of any haemangioma was higher for pre eclampsia than for no pre eclampsia 81 3 vs 72 9 per 10 000 with a PR of 1 15 95 CI 1 06 1 25 after adjustment for maternal characteristics Pre eclampsia with onset before 34 weeks gestation was associated with cutaneous PR 2 32 95 CI 1 68 3 21 noncutaneous PR 3 66 95 CI 2 49 5 37 and unspecified haemangioma PR 2 49 95 CI 1 77 3 49 However the association between early onset pre eclampsia and haemangioma was attenuated once long neonatal length of hospital stays was accounted for There was no association with late onset pre eclampsia after 34 weeks and associations were weaker for other variants including severe pre eclampsia and pre eclampsia with low birthweight Conclusions Early onset pre eclampsia is associated with increased risk of haemangioma at birth but detection bias due to longer hospital stays and closer follow up may be part of the reason
