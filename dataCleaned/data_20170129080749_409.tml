<TITLE>Desert Sun letter Vacation rentals boost Palm Springs</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Buy Photo Palm Springs should be cautious in how it regulates its vacation rental industry a homeowner writes Photo Jay Calderon The Desert Sun Buy Photo We contribute to Palm Springs My husband and I live part time in Australia and part time in Palm Springs Until we win the green card lottery we have a three month visa each year spent actively participating in the community neighborhood association and volunteering at events and festivals We have lovingly restored our home back to its vintage roots and proudly had it included on the Modernism Week home tour To keep our home looking as beautiful as our neighbours and neighbourhood deserve we have gardening pool maintenance pest control and concierge garbage collection services all year We could not possibly afford to keep our Palm Springs home or pursue our dream of retiring to Palm Springs if our house was not used as a vacation rental during our absence In six years we have never had a complaint from our neighbors We have contributed thousands of dollars to the city in fees and taxes I am strongly in favor of strict rules being enforced regarding party houses and noise issues with vacation homes But if we are forbidden from renting our home we will be unable to keep it and our retirement dream will be at an end Jane Guy Australia and Palm Springs YOUR VOICE Read all our letters online Ruiz protest not juvenile Way to go Dr Ruiz There is nothing disrespectful about staying away from a celebration for a fear mongering hate speaking unqualified childish self serving bully even when he is elected to the highest office in the nation Why celebrate with someone who does not have a mandate from the majority of Americans and from even fewer Californians God help us Not going to a celebration does not show disrespect for the office of the presidency nor a lack of willingness to work with the new administration Thanks for having the conviction and fortitude to exercise your right to protest Nothing juvenile about that Ed Denson Palm Springs Rep Ruiz you re fired Where were you I didn t see you at the inauguration As a representative representing me I expected you to be at the inauguration You work for me not the Democratic Party or for yourself You were hired for a job I expect you to show up for the job and part of the job description is attending events like the inauguration Like any job there are things you are not going to like and if you don t show up you get fired It is obvious that you do not want the job of respresentative The only thing for you to do is resign Resigning would be the honorable thing to do It would appear Hillary Clinton made illegal millions in her pay for play scam You are out of touch with the real world and your reasoning for not going is made up of nonsense In the real world things are not going to go your way and you are not going to have the best bosses Get over it You really don t care about all your constituents as your actions so signified So I am firing you as my representative Diana Gomez Indio I d vote to recall Congressman Raul Ruiz s response regarding his not going to the inauguration showed his absolute smallness and I hope those who voted for him will not do so again He actually thinks this was about Trump and about himself He s so wrong This was about us the American people and our traditions and our respect for this wonderful country How self centered can he be to think this was all about him and how he feels about what Trump says and does His job is to represent us and he has failed miserably I wish he could be recalled Marilyn Loewy Palm Desert Rep Ruiz failed test In his letter to The Desert Sun published on Inauguration Day Rep Raul Ruiz states he has unlimited respect for the office of the presidency and the will of the American people and that his decision to forego the inauguration was not based on partisanship He goes on to state he would have proudly attended if any other Republican had won the election So it s personal for Rep Ruiz doesn t like the man his politics or his perceived behavior Respectfully congressman if that were the test do you think the Clintons Carters and Obamas would have attended Your political and personal views caused you to miss the point As you should know the inauguration is the symbol of the orderly and peaceful transition of power that sets our country and our form of democracy apart from the rest of the world Your congressional responsibility and civic duty was to attend Be silent or express your displeasure and disagreement if you wish but attend nonetheless It was a time for you Rep Ruiz to act like a United States congressman and not like a petulant child or politician Allan Starr Palm Desert Ruiz deserves respect too All of you who wrote letters talked about respect But you didn t show much to Rep Raul Ruiz We must remember that the congressman is a human being first an American citizen second and our representative third To fault him for not attending the inauguration would be to tell him to give up his concerns and values How can he embrace a man who belittles veterans our intelligence agencies civil rights heroes free press the congressman s heritage women the handicapped three of our former presidents Obama Bush and Clinton efforts to deal with the climate situation religious minorities and the list goes on What Ruiz did was not a Republican or a Democrat thing What he did was exercise his Constitutional right to patriotically and peacefully protest We believe that we are so lucky to have a congressman who won t sit by and idly accept unacceptable behavior of the leader of this nation Since Ruiz has been in office his actions have always been bipartisan Ken and Dawn Rashid Palm Desert More should ve boycotted Growing up Mom did not say You re a Republican so you must respect everyone She did not say You re a Democrat so you must respect everyone She simply said Respect others and they will respect you Mom also said to Always tell the truth and not be afraid to stand up for what you know is right in your heart Congressman Ruiz must have heard my mother speaking as I did 70 plus years ago His decision to not attend the inauguration of a man who demeans women who misrepresents facts repeatedly who shows racial religious and sexual orientation prejudice who believes Putin can be his friend and who believes he is above all others and need not provide tax returns or divest himself of his business interests should be commended Congressman Ruiz shows he is a man of principle by standing up for those inalienable rights guaranteed to all Americans in the Constitution His decision should be praised as it shows he is standing up for all Americans not just Republicans or Democrats What we need in government are more men and women like him Bonnie Chafe Cathedral City Trump acts justify boycott I support Rep Raul Ruiz and the decision he made regarding the presidential inauguration To attend the inauguration was to normalize a situation and a person which cannot or should not be normalized Donald Trump s reprehensible behavior bigoted remarks misogynistic attitude and apparent inability to tell the truth and or accept responsibility for his actions cannot be considered acceptable behavior of the person chosen to lead the United States Those who wrote in opposition to Rep Ruiz s stating he should have attended to represent the members of his district seem to overlook the fact that many of Dr Ruiz s constituents were the target of Trump s wrath lies and general unacceptable behavior As a member of one of the groups targeted by Trump I thank Rep Ruiz for his bravery and willingness to stand up for his principles and for mine I spent my working life in health care and education I am appalled with Donald Trump s choices to lead those departments I believe Rep Ruiz must continue his vigilance and opposition of policies which will hurt those he represents Perhaps we might agree going forward that we should show Trump the same respect he showed President Obama Mary M Callahan Rancho Mirage Ruiz the right model Rep Raul Ruiz has been roundly criticized on these pages for not respecting the office of president or not supporting a peaceful transition of administrations with his personal decision to boycott the inaugural events for President Donald Trump Our current role model for respectful presidential behavior is a man who has insulted mocked undermined lied ignored and personalized the entire 18 month process of electing a new president of the United States of America Surely Dr Ruiz has a right to act on his lifelong principles for one day without howls of outrage from his critics Lee Colby Palm Desert A courageous example Four living ex presidents attended the inauguration of Donald Trump These men represented the country as a whole and it is fitting that their attendance showed respect for the office they had shared Congressman Raul Ruiz however represents the citizens of his district many of whom are not the white wealthy conservative Christians who are expected to benefit most from the new administration I applaud Dr Ruiz s decision to make a statement by boycotting the inauguration I see this as a measure of respect for those of us who are women minorities immigrants of lower or middle socio economic level LGBT handicapped and or of other faiths Many of us have felt dismissed discouraged and dismayed by candidate Trump s words and tweets and look forward to his presidency with trepidation We are fortunate to have such a courageous and ethical person as Raul Ruiz representing our diverse population and interests in Washington Sharon Miller Palm Desert Ruiz has rights too I congratulate and support Dr Raul Ruiz s position in not attending the inauguration His decision was supported by the millions in the USA and the world who marched to demonstrate against Donald Trump s numerous falsehoods and policies that will have a negative affect on those less affluent than he is Dr Ruiz demonstrated what he believes in Fortunately by living in the U S we are allowed to stand for our beliefs which is in direct contrast to the Russian people who cannot voice their opinions without severe consequences Kay Bell Rancho Mirage I stand with President Trump Enough is enough I have been silent too long to not speak on behalf of President Trump After eight years of unprecedented liberalism in the White House we finally have a president with conservative views Those against President Trump have fought against him before he announced after he announced and again after he scored one of the biggest upsets in presidential elections in the history of the U S A Most celebrities detest President Trump and have not stopped clamoring for his removal There are a number of people who as I support President Trump Some of these people are Clint Eastwood Toby Keith Kirstie Alley Jon Voight Loretta Lynn Terrell Owens Ben Carson Marie Osmond Dwayne The Rock Johnson Jackie Evancho Big and Rich Three Doors Down Lee Greenwood The Rockettes The Mormon Tabernacle Choir partial list I support the above mentioned people and others who voted for President Trump I am proud to be a member of the American Independent Party and a U S Marine I will be forwarding this letter to President Trump and all those listed above Included will be my resume and my commitment to volunteer for our president Matt Monica Palm Desert Demanded vs earned You do not march for respect you earn respect How far we have fallen from the greatest generation to the pampered generation John Beal Indian Wells We re with you Rep Ruiz Rep Raul Ruiz showed deep respect for the office of president by refusing to witness that office profaned by the entrance into it of a man egregious in his disrespect for Blacks Hispanics Muslims women and immigrants a man who cheated vulnerable students and workers out of their money a man who honors a Russian thug over NATO and the entire American intelligence community a man who brags about repeated criminal assaults on women and a man who has indicated he would have refused to concede had the election gone against him and who did all he could to discredit the legitimacy of his predecessor with his lies about President Obama s place of birth Trump s own disrespect for the office he shamefully holds makes many fearful and disgusted as evidenced by the millions who gathered throughout this country and the rest of the world to march in protest Rep Ruiz we re with you on this one Luc Agosta and Bud Sydenstricker Palm Springs It s about service On April 24 1968 I reported to the Oakland Induction Center as ordered by the president of the United States I served on U S soil for five months and saw many of my Army friends being deployed to Vietnam I then decided to volunteer I had not chosen this course but it was my duty my responsibility and my country Congressman Ruiz as distasteful a sacrifice as attending OUR President s inauguration may have been to you it pales in comparison to the 58 000 patriots who gave their lives in Vietnam the 300 000 wounded and more than 60 000 men and women who committed suicide upon returning home to a nation torn with political strife And despite it all our military continues to serve our country undaunted by those in Washington D C who have forgotten the basic meaning of serving a greater cause Carl J Cieslikowski Vietnam 1969 70 Palm Desert A group effort May I appeal to every citizen and every resident of the U S A to offer up The Lord s Prayer each day for our country Our Father which art in heaven Hallowed be thy name Thy kingdom come Thy will be done on earth as it is in Heaven Give us this day our daily bread And forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors And lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory for ever Amen So that God s will will be done on Earth as it is done in Heaven Sissel Johansen Indio Read or Share this story http desert sn 2jByb2
