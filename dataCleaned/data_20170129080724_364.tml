<TITLE>Survey shows support for energy measures</TITLE>
<TEXT>
YORK Maine Recently released results of a town energy survey indicate overwhelming support for measures to reduce the town s reliance on fossil fuels by an average of a 78 percent plurality The survey also shows just 52 percent of those polled favored spending taxpayer dollars to finance these measures Town Planning Director Dylan Smith said the number indicates to him that residents are at least willing to listen to individual proposals Selectmen s Chairman Robert Palmer said he thinks it means people may not want to pay for such projects at all The survey asked a series of 15 questions about the direction the town should take with regard to energy Almost 1 000 registered voters received the survey and 315 responded roughly 32 percent Three of the questions required a written response the remaining 12 asked people to rank response from strongly agree to strongly disagree In nearly all of the tabulated responses a vast majority indicated they agreed or strongly agreed to a series of statements such as York should expand our use of renewable energy such as a solar array on the York landfill or build more energy efficient municipal buildings or adopt energy efficient building codes I think the answers are fairly decisive said Rozanna Patane chairwoman of the town s Energy Steering Committee It says to me that these are issues the town is interested in She said she was particularly heartened by a couple of answers Almost 93 percent of those responding said they believe York should reduce municipal vehicle emissions whenever cost effective She was reminded that voters turned down a capital item last May to purchase a hybrid vehicle We weren t sure how to proceed after that she said But this response says to me that we probably didn t support the question well enough Selectman Dawn Watson said we should have included the benefits of a hybrid vehicle in the statement of fact And she s right Another question asked about promoting environmental science and energy policy in the York School Department with nearly 80 percent supporting such action She said committee members have already reached out to the schools We would like to collaborate with them and they re very interested in doing that she said The response noticeably narrows when people are asked to respond to the statement York should invest municipal financial resources to reduce greenhouse gas emissions Answers to the question were 20 3 percent strongly agreed 28 9 percent agreed 17 1 percent didn t know didn t have an opinion 13 percent disagreed 4 3 percent strongly disagreed Another 14 percent didn t answer the question At a recent selectmen s meeting when the survey was discussed Palmer described his response to that question this way Everyone is for it until they have to pay Only 52 percent want to spend money But Smith said he has a different take What it says to me is that people want to allow the debate to happen when the time comes I think it all depends on the scale of the project There is going to be a different debate when you re talking about a solar farm versus a couple of panels on Town Hall But it s clear in a general way there s support to allow for that debate to occur The survey was conducted at the request of the Board of Selectmen after the Planning Board presented an energy chapter to the comprehensive plan last fall Selectmen said they wanted to get a sense of community support before putting the chapter on the ballot right away There has been a persistent sense by some board members that the Energy Steering Committee has become too independent a sense reiterated by Palmer and Town Manager Steve Burns at a selectmen s meeting early this month They should be an advisor on energy issues and not go off and do their own thing Burns said They can come in and offer stuff but you guys should be the ones to decide They shouldn t be leaders telling us what they want to do which is what s happened added Palmer At the same meeting Jon Speers took a conciliatory tone saying I would like a chance to hear from them about what they think is important There should be give and take on both sides Smith said the survey will be presented to the Planning Board which will take it into consideration while drafting an energy chapter likely for inclusion on the November ballot
