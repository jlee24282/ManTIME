<TITLE>UTRGV women's basketball crumbles in second half of loss to Seattle U</TITLE>
<TEXT>
EDINBURG — UTRGV’s poor shooting in the second half on Saturday had coach Larry Tidwell nearly speechless. 
 
After building a 14-point lead at halftime, UTRGV shot just 12.9 percent during the final 20 minutes. The offensive woes were the driving force in Seattle’s comeback, as UTRGV lost 67-54 in the UTRGV Fieldhouse. 
 
“We shot 13 percent in the second half. What do you say? There’s nothing to say on that,” Tidwell said. “You have to make shots. We had shots right at the rim. It wasn’t anything they did. We just didn’t finish.” 
 
The Vaqueros missed from all over the court, connecting on just 1 of 17 second-half attempts categorized as layups in the official play-by-play. 
 
Overall, the Vaqueros made just 4 of 31 shots during the final 20 minutes. For the game, UTRGV shot 22.7 percent. 
 
“It didn’t get frustrating until we started letting easy layups, and we started missing layups,” senior Shawnte’ Goff said. “I guess that’s when it gets frustrating.” 
 
Goff was UTRGV’s lone bright spot, scoring 27 points on 7-of-23 shooting, plus 10 of 10 at the free-throw line, with 8 rebounds and 6 assists. 
 
She led the Vaqueros in all three categories, as her teammates hit a combined 8 of 43 from the field — an 18.6 percent clip. 
 
“We just encourage people to keep shooting,” Goff said. “We know that we’re not a shooting team. It takes us a couple attempts to get going. And that’s perfectly fine, as long as we play as hard as we can on the defensive end.” 
 
UTRGV’s defense lapsed in the second half, too, allowing Seattle U to shoot 61.5 percent in the final 20 minutes. 
 
Seattle outscored UTRGV 45-18 after half, easily making up the 36-22 advantage UTRGV took into the break. 
 
“We didn’t defend like we did the first half,” Tidwell said. “But we come back and shoot 22 percent in a game when we shoot 13 percent the second half. So how do you win that way? You don’t.” 
 
In conference games, UTRGV ranks last in the WAC at 34.3 percent shooting as a team. 
 
Goff leads UTRGV in scoring on the season at 15.2 points per game and got off to a hot start Saturday, scoring 10 in the opening quarter. 
 
She credited inspiration for her big night to her struggles shooting the last time out: a 10-point performance making 4 of 20 attempts against Utah Valley. 
 
“I look at those things and I say, ‘Man, I’m playing like poo,’” Goff said. “I just got out here earlier and got shots up, and I got up early before the game and got up shots, and I was able to do that. … With any good player, if you let them get hot the first couple minutes, it’s going to be a long game.” 
 
The loss drops UTRGV to 14-9 overall and 4-3 in the WAC, ranking fifth. The Vaqueros are also facing the prospect of moving ahead without forwards Mary Savoy and Lile Havili, who were suspended indefinitely before Thursday’s win against Utah Valley. 
 
The Vaqueros entered the year with conference championship aspirations, having reached the WAC Tournament title game each of the past two seasons. UTRGV was picked to finish second in the conference in both the preseason coaches and media polls. 
 
Goff isn’t ready to back off her lofty goals. 
 
“I’m definitely not concerned,” Goff said. “We’ve had a couple mishaps, of course. What team doesn’t? No team is perfect. And we’re just looking to get better every day in practice. Our team chemistry is going good. Everything is flowing. We just have to come out here and execute.”
