UMD women mentor youth basketball players 
 
Youth players from Salvation Army's Rookie Basketball Association took to the court with the University of Minnesota Duluth women's basketball team for a special practice earlier this month in UMD's Romano Gym. UMD coach Mandy Pearson and her team work to build a positive and encouraging partnership with the youth basketball association. Many Rookie Basketball teams play during halftimes at UMD women's games, and the UMD-RBA once-a-year practice has become an annual tradition.
