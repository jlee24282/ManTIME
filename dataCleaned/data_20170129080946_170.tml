<TITLE>Harry Potter coming to Carson High School for Winterfest | Senator Square</TITLE>
<TEXT>
This year’s Winterfest theme is hanging out with Harry Potter, and the plan is to turn Carson High School into Hogwarts with teachers creating a Hogwarts themed door followed by a door decorating contest. And who posited the Harry Potter Winterfest week? CHS’ own Anya Woodbury, a Leadership student who wants to make sure her senior year is unforgettable. 
 
According to Woodbury, “I mean, I’ve always loved Harry Potter books, so I thought why not have Harry Potter as a theme? Many students have supported the idea, and now it already looks to be a success.” 
 
Winterfest week is Jan. 30-Feb. 4. Classes are as follows: freshman are Hufflepuff (yellow/blue), sophomores are Ravenclaw (black/blue), juniors are Slytherin (green/black), and seniors are Gryffindor (red/yellow). Die hard Harry Potter fans, those who are teachers and administrators, are being asked to dress up as characters. Candidates for Winterfest King and Queen were announced at an assembly during AB55 Jan. 27. They are freshman: Sergio Montes and Olivia Singleton, Bradley Maffei and Taryn Encinas, Mark Anthony Ramirez and Alexis Philippi; sophomores: Garrett Clampitt and Taylor Dawley, Chance Smith and Nicole Hawkins, Jacob Richetta and Jazzlyn Barden; juniors: Adam Lackey and Natalie Rogers, Ramses Carrillo and Hanna Masters, Charly Lawlor and Melanie Proctor; seniors: Luke Myers and Katie Liemandt (red), Tez Allen and Skylar Swartz (blue), Spencer Rogers and Haylee Krupp (green), Luis Pompa and Chloe Dodge (yellow), Jayson Artz and Sophia Ruedy (white), and Italo Da Silva and Shaylin Segura (black). CHS Leadership is going to have a Quidditch tournament as the lunchtime activity for the entire week, and Leadership teacher Ann Britt will have a team of teachers play against the student champs on the last day of Winterfest. Quidditch teams must have seven players, and there must be at least two girls per team, and the Quidditch tournament will start Jan. 30 and continue through Feb. 3 during lunch in the big gym. Winners of the tournament will receive T-shirts and forever be known as the first to participate in a CHS Quidditch tournament. In fact, “Wizarding World of Winterfest” long sleeve T-shirts are on sale at the Student Store for $10.

SENIOR SPOTLIGHT 
 
The featured student for this week’s Senior Spotlight is Christian Okamoto. Christian has taken a total of 15 AP and honors classes throughout his high school years, consistently challenging himself to work harder. Despite the rigor of his schedule he maintains a GPA of 4.7 and is currently working on his final course to complete the engineering pathway and earn his certificate. Through his involvement in engineering, he competed in the AASHTO Bridge Building Competition where, as part of a team, they designed and built a bridge, did a seven-minute presentation for the judges, and tested their final product. The team was awarded an honorable mention for their efforts. Christian has participated and taken leadership roles in many clubs and activities over the years. He is currently the events coordinator for National Honor Society, Public Relations Officer for Interact, and a Link Crew director. He has also participated in Key Club, SkillsUSA, and the golf team. He volunteers his time for various organizations including the Humane Society, the Greenhouse Project, the CHS craft fair, and the CHS blood drive. He has been a math tutor for Solutions and volunteers as a tutor at one of the CCSD elementary schools. In his free time, he plays guitar. Christian wants to attend university to study engineering. He has been accepted to Texas A amp;M, Penn State, and University of Colorado-Boulder; he is still waiting to hear from two others. CHS is certain Christian will find success no matter where he ends up, is very proud of his accomplishments, and wishes him the best of luck in his future.
