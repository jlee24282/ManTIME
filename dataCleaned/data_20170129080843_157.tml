<TITLE>Speed skating Kodaira wins 6th straight World Cup event</TITLE>
<TEXT>
BERLIN Kyodo Japan s Nao Kodaira continued her perfect start to the season with another World Cup win on Saturday making it six from six in the women s 500 meters The 30 year old logged a 37 57 second time to finish well ahead of Karolina Erbanova of the Czech Republic 38 28 and American Heather Bergsma 38 43 but could not match her 37 43 second performance from a day earlier Ideally I would have surpassed the record from yesterday Kodaira said I started off well with the right stance but I then carried on with a calm mindset rather than being battle ready and I ended up adjusting my movements along the way Japan s Maki Tsuji came fourth in 38 44 and Erina Kamiya sixth in 38 58
