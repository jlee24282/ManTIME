<TITLE>New Zealand end Wellington Sevens with defeat to Argentina</TITLE>
<TEXT>
All Black Sevens finish 6th after last minute try leads to 17-12 lose to Argentina. 
  
Sixth has a pretty unpalatable look about it. 
 
Fifth would've been bad enough, but New Zealand couldn't even manage that at the Wellington Sevens, losing 17-12 to Argentina in their final match of the weekend. 
 
A Regan Ware try, set up by Vilimoni Koroi, got New Zealand underway, before a converted Lautaro Bazan Velez try gave Argentina a 7-5 halftime lead. Captain Scott Curry restored the host's lead after the break and then the game ebbed and flowed until Bazan Velez went in again to make it 12-12. 
 
But another New Zealand turnover settle the issue and Franco Sabato won the match for Argentina with a try in the corner. 
 
  
   
  
  
Having won the last three editions of this event, finishing sixth wasn't particularly impressive. However there were encouraging signs in the shape of forward Iopu Iopu-Aso and playmaker Koroi. 
 
Koroi is just out of Feilding High School, but his Wellington cameos suggest the 18-year-old has talent. 
 
Talent of the sort that made Manawatu's Tomasi Cama one of the most feared ball-players on the sevens circuit. Cama is now co-coach of New Zealand and picked Koroi despite him not appearing at the recent national tournament. 
 
"He's probably better than me," Cama said of Koroi. 
  
The teenager produced some magical touches to guide New Zealand to a 24-0 win over England in their fifth-place semifinal and looks to have a bit to offer, having played on the wing for New Zealand Secondary Schools last year. 
 
"This is his first tournament and for a young fella he looks like he's been playing for a few years now. There's always things to work on and hopefully he's going to kick on from now," said Cama. 
 
"When you look at playmakers, obviously they can pass, they can kick. But one thing they do have, they do have time when they have the ball and that's when they look forward and make decisions." 
 
It's Koroi's composure that really excites Cama. 
 
"At this stage I don't have to do a lot. He's got all the talent. If anything it's just the little things we can work on off the field to make sure that he gets out there and does what he does best." 
 
Koroi can't quite believe this is happening. He grew up idolising players such as Cama and team-mates DJ Forbes and Tim Mikkelson. Being picked for Wellington was one thing, but the idea he might play - and play well - was quite another. 
 
"I've been very nervous playing out there. Very nervous," Koroi said. 
 
It's just that he hasn't played like a nervous bloke. 
 
"Just like Junior [Cama] says, when you get out on the field just play your game [and] stay calm under pressure, because you're a playmaker."
