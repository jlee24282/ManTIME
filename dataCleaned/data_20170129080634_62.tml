<TITLE>Dick Pinney s Guide Lines Go off the beaten path to find great ice fishing</TITLE>
<TEXT>
NEW HAMPSHIRE has plenty of opportunities to ice fish open water without roaming onto our neighboring state s borders but there are a few places that have a special attraction for me Having fished these places during the open water seasons I know the shorelines and bottoms pretty well and the chances of catching a huge trophy fish Closest for me is Great East Lake in the Milton Mills area of New Hampshire and Shapley Mills in Maine This lake contains an interesting mix of both warm and cold water species and the fishing rules are under the special border waters regulations that seem to be a bit more liberal than the non border waters What first drew me to ice fish Great East Lake was that its robust population of lake trout or togue which most Mainers call them To fish for any good population of lake trout through the ice or otherwise else meant quite a few more miles to either Merrymeeting Lake or the huge Lake Winnipesaukee Both of these lakes had drawbacks so it was Great East we d head for The lake isn t teeming with lakers but we ve seldom been skunked when ice fishing there And there was also always a chance at hooking one of their huge brown trout that patrol both deep and just under the ice and would make the cover of most fishing mags for size and beauty The lakers generally run right around the keeper size limit so we seldom went home without a fish or two for our efforts The big waters with fewer but larger fish made Great East an interesting and profitable way to spend a day on the ice Recent efforts there have turned up some good crappie fishing as have several other smaller lakes that are in the same watershed as Great East One of them Horn Pond has a direct channel that connects it to Great East and has one heck of a good crappie population Crappies are one fish that we d never pass up both for catching and for eating And ice fishing the Great East Lake watershed gives an easy way to move your gear to other good locations While that is no guarantee you ll bring home the bacon there s a darn good chance you will not have an empty creel Going in the opposite direction and heading north toward the waters in and above the White Mountains fishing Moore Reservoir for both pike and huge brown and rainbow trout is another almost guarantee of bringing home some good eating fish There are parts of the Commerford Dam tailwaters that often don t ice over but fishing them that time of year is fraught with dangers Icy splashover along the shorelines is very slippery and when out on the ice pack you have to drill sample holes before setting gear as the currents can undercut the ice cover and make a very chancy place to drop your bait But the pike can be plentiful and huge and in this particular water the Dickster caught and released the largest brown trout of his life even larger than some of those Lake Ontario browns we ve caught and we caught it on the simplest fishing gear light line and sinker and nightcrawler So if you get bored fishing some of the hard fished and crowded ice of some local ponds or lakes try fishing a border pond It s a fresh experience and one that will stretch out your wings for better things Drop us an email at DoDuckInn aol com and get out there and get you some Dick Pinney s column appears weekly in the New Hampshire Sunday News Email him at DoDuckInn aol com
