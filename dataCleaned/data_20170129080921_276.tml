Digital GPS SpeedometerPLEASE, if there are problems with the app - tell me what is wrong so I can fix it. Don't vote with one star and no comment, thank you. GPS Speedometer - this GPS SPEED application is a free software for Android devices with built-in GPS antenna. It acts as a normal speed gauge, which you may find in any car, showing the velocity of the vehicle you are in in kph and mph - useful when cycling, running, flying, sailing. We try our best to make all readings as accurate as possible, but the accuracy also depends your device's GPS sensor and should only be treated as approximations. This is an ad-supported application. The ads are located on the bottom of the screen.
