<TITLE>EDITORIAL Alternative location is right call for Pine Avenue food center</TITLE>
<TEXT>
There is such a thing as wrong place wrong time It s an appropriate phrase to describe the controversial proposal to open a soup kitchen in the middle of Pine Avenue one of the longest standing and significant business districts in the city of Niagara Falls No one doubts the good intentions of the driving force behind the project Father Jacek Mazur leader of Divine Mercy and St Mary of the Cataract parishes Mazur has for years been involved in worthwhile charitable efforts that have contributed much to addressing the needs of the needy This time around however Mazur s soup kitchen proposal which the Diocese of Buffalo notes is his idea and not something the Diocese is promoting itself does not fit with recent efforts to revitalize Pine Avenue as a center of commerce In fact opening a soup kitchen at the corner of 17th Street where Carmine s Restaurant is now located actually goes against all efforts to push Pine Avenue in the prosperous commercial direction it deserves While there may indeed be a need for the types of services offered by a soup kitchen the operation would send the wrong message to visitors and residents It also could prove to be detrimental to other businesses in the surrounding area many of them small shops and restaurants owned and operated by entrepreneurs and small business people who are struggling to make a living as it is The soup kitchen concept arrives at the worst possible time as it comes mere weeks after the recent launch of the Pine Avenue Redevelopment Project a collective effort to improve the appeal of the commercial strip that is being led by several prominent small business owners in the area Their goal is to enhance Pine Avenue through various public improvement projects and neighborhood cleanup efforts Members are also looking to support struggling business owners and prod those who own property to do more with what they have It s essentially a leadership group for a vitally important business district that hasn t had such a thing since the state of New York forced the dismantling of the old Pine Avenue Business Association many years ago Their effort is to be lauded PARB members have made it clear a soup kitchen is not the sort of thing they are looking to promote as part of their efforts Nor should they Again just to be clear this is not a slight against the poor or the needy or individuals or organizations looking to provide them with food and assistance Unfortunately Niagara Falls has shown for years now that it has a significant population of people who are unable to make it on their own and require to support to live healthier lives Father Mazur s heart is in the right place His project is not City officials including Mayor Paul Dyster and members of the city council as well as representatives from the Niagara County Legislature have already joined PARB members in questioning the wisdom of this plan It would be in the best interest of all parties involved to identify an alternative location where the soup kitchen can run as needed and the Pine Avenue Business District can grow as intended Opening a soup kitchen in a piece of prime real estate in the heart of the Pine Avenue Business District would be a prime example of wrong place wrong time While this may not be an ideal situation it does not have to be another classic Niagara Falls battle where a lot of egos get bruised and nothing productive comes from it We call on city and county officials members of PARB Father Mazur and the Catholic Diocese to work together to identify a viable alternative
