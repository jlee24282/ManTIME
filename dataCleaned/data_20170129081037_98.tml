<TITLE>TV girl’s woes: Is banker cheating on new bride?</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Our sources tell us that the girl who got married at a destination wedding is so antisocial that no one is willing to talk about her womaniser hubby.  
Social media is dishonest and what you see is not necessarily what you’ll get. A high-flying media girl is likely to learn that the hard way. A little birdie has whispered to PowerPlay that this hottie may have just committed to a complete stranger. 
 
The man in question is a banker by profession. Our sources tell us that the girl who got married at a destination wedding is so antisocial that no one is willing to talk about her womaniser hubby. 
 
The man who allegedly sleeps around, pretends around the ever-smitten wifey whom we are told attempted suicide because bae threatened to call off their wedding.
