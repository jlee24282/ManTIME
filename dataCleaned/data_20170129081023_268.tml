<TITLE>BNL places 3rd, Mitchell claims 2 titles at Southridge</TITLE>
<TEXT>
HUNTINGBURG — had a disappointing day individually, but managed to pull off a surprising third-place team finish, while Mitchell had a somewhat disappointing team finish, but managed to claim two individual crowns during Saturday’s Southridge Wrestling Sectional at Memorial Gymnasium in Huntingburg.

Southridge claimed the championship with 284 points, followed by Jasper at 242, BNL and Salem with 116 each, Mitchell at 115, Crawford County at 106, Paoli with 102, Washington at 101 and Forest Park with 38.

BNL advanced just two wrestlers to next weekend’s Bloomington South Regional when junior Jaren Abel finished runner-up at 126 pounds, and sophomore Jackson Ikerd placed fourth at 138. But a bunch of determined wrestlebacks yielded a flurry of fifth-place finishes that allowed the Stars to sneak into third place as a team.

“I’m not real sure how did that, but we had a bunch of fifth-place finishes, and you have to credit all those guys for showing a lot of heart and coming back to win their last matches of the season,” said BNL coach Roy Bruce. “Hopefully, that will build some momentum for those kids heading into next season.”

Abel earned a bye in the first round at 126, and pinned Jasper’s Landon Betz at the 3:27 mark in the third round to advance to the championship match. There he encountered Southridge’s Sammy Schroeder, who got Abel’s shoulders down just two seconds ahead of the first-period buzzer.

Ikerd battled through a sprained knee to earn fourth at 138 and punch his ticket to regional. He got a bye at the outset and was pinned by Jasper Geordan Terwiske in the second round, but received a forfeit and then pinned Crawford County’s Derak Gabbard in 2:28 to gain a spot in the third/fourth place match. Terwiske got him again, but Ikerd advanced (the top four individuals in each class move on).

“Jared was seeded second and today he was the second-best wrestler in his class,” Abel said. “He had a real good day, but he just got caught by the kid there at the end of the first period. He was a little too worried about defending the guy instead of attacking him, and that will get you caught, but he had a nice day.

“Jackson sprained his MCL 10 days ago and I didn’t think he’d even wrestle, but the trainer gave him the go-ahead and we got him all braced up and he was able to go. He couldn’t take a shot because of the leg, but he was able to throw guys, and he was up against a Crawford County kid who had only lost six times all season. But Jackson got him in a side headlock and put him away to get into the fourth-place match. We really appreciate the effort those two guys put forth today.”

The Stars got fifth-place finishes from Chelsey Schofield at 106, Logan Riddle at 113, Derek Hutchins at 120, Ray Lee at 132, Ben Weaver at 182 and Tristan Hanner at 195. Bruce was also proud of his two seniors, Koby Werner and Judah Edwards, both of whom suffered misfortune.

“Koby got the flu on Tuesday and started to recover, but then he got extremely sick again Friday night and just couldn’t go today,” Bruce said. “That’s really emotional for me to see a four-year wrestler who has given us so much, and who was there all summer busting his hump to get ready, and then he doesn’t get to wrestle at sectional. I really hate it.

“Then Judah was wrestling to advance against a Jasper kid, and he was winning the match when he banged his head off the mat and got a concussion. There was no way he could continue, and again I just hate it for him as a senior. It was a really rough way for both of them to go out, but we certainly respect and appreciate all they did for our program.”

Mitchell took just eight wrestlers to the sectional, but wound up with two titleholders as senior Delaney Wade prevailed at 220 and junior Ethan Bohkenkamp captured the crown at 160. Senior Greg Brown was runner-up at 195, senior Caleb Slaughter also advanced to regional by finishing fourth at 182, and senior Austin Kirk moved on via a fourth-place finish at 152. The Bluejackets got a fifth-place finish from Trey Slone at 170

Bohnenkamp (30-4) had a bye in the first round at 160 and blitzed Paoli’s Chaz Becht in 48 seconds in the second round. He battled to a tough 12-8 decision over Salem’s Damien Miller in the semifinals and slammed Washington’s Sam Smith in 1:54 to take the title.

Wade (28-1) didn’t have to wrestle until the semis because of byes and forfeits, and he disposed of Southridge’s Jose Chavez in 2:41 to reach the final. There he met Salem’s Aaron Hollen, and it was no match as Wade got a pin in 1:20 to collect the big hardware.

Brown (29-4) suffered a heartbreaker at 195, dropping a 3-1 overtime decision to Southridge’s Jack Michel (43-2) in the championship match.

Timmy Burton (35-4) of Paoli punched his ticket to regional by placing second at 152, dropping a tough 5-2 decision to Southridge’s Tucker Schank in the title match. Will Stroud (22-8) also earned a runner-up spot at 138, falling 7-1 in the final to Southridge’s Drew Dearing in the finale, and Zayne Bartholomew picked up Paoli’s third runner-up finish at at 132 with a 5-3 overtime setback to Southridge’s Chanler Balsmeyer in the championship bout.

The Rams’ James Beavers advanced to regional with a third-place run at 285, and Kain Yother finished fourth at 113 to earn another week of competition.
