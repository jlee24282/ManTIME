Mixed emotions as kids head back to school on Monday, from both students and parents. 

MIXED emotions surround heading back to school on Monday, from both students and parents.

While Monday marks the return to school for hundreds of students across Griffith, a number of youngsters will be heading into classrooms for the first time.

Among them are five-year-old neighbours Dean Salvestrin and Pippa Curasi, who will be joining their older siblings at St Mary’s Yoogali.

Years one through to six will be returning o Monday while kinders will have their first day on Thursday, February 2. 

Pippa said she is looking forward to going to school and excited to follow in her big sisters footsteps.

“I am excited to make lots of friends and learn,” she said.

“And I really want learn to read so I can read mum a nice story on Mothers Day.”

Dean, whose big sister Laura already attends St Mary’s Yoogali, has some apprehensions about leaving preschool behind but looks forward to making new friends and going to the canteen with his year-six buddies.

Kindergarten students each have a year six buddy who acts as a guide and helps them with any first-day jitters.

Along with the buddies, preparations for the first day have been underway since last year when students went to an orientation at the school.

Mum Gabbi Salvestrin said she is certain Dean’s nerves will pass especially once he makes friends and gets used to the routine of school.

Dean’s big sister Laura will also be looking out for her younger brother and helping him adjust to school.

Laura said she has her new shoes and stationary ready, all name-tagged, and is excited to see her friends on Monday.

Pippa’s sisters Summer,10, and Maggie,9, are both excited about new teachers, sport and arts and crafts.

Mrs Salvestrin with fellow mum Bronwyn Curasi said getting the children back into the school routine can be a challenge for both parents and children

One of the challenges are packing a healthy lunch the children will enjoy,Mr Curasi said. 

“Because finding a healthy lunch the kids will enjoy can be a challenge, we have stuck to a very similar each day,” she said.

“We stick to a Vegemite sandwich, fruit and yogurt and it always seems to work.” 

Most schools first day back on Monday, however, the start date can vary depending on school and year.
