A blood donor can be the one person out of the 7 billion on the planet needed to save another human life.

“These people bring something so special for free,” said Thapelo Maroane. “I felt the need to donate and it helps others,” Demitra Gray said. 

Demitra, her sister, Mikayla and their mother Dana, always make donating blood a family outing. They said that the staff make them feel so comfortable that it feels like you are in the comfort of your own home.

Danie Hofman told the News his donating journey started when his father donated blood. He himself has donated more than 100 units and he plans to keep on donating.

“I’m part of a cycling group that cycles for children with cancer and my blood can save them,” Danie said.

According to Thapelo Maroane, the clinic manager, the blood bank’s stocks are still very low and they need people to come and donate blood.

The donors praised the staff at the centre and told the News that you would not find a better person to assist you than Thapelo. Celebrate your heritage by donating blood Blood saved her life
