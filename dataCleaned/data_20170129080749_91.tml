<TITLE>Coalition looks to make difference</TITLE>
<TEXT>
I was going to write this letter regarding the cabinet nominations then I was going to write about that farce of a press conference but as the news has been so fast and fluid every day I decided to go in a different direction My name is Barbara Davis and I am a founding member of the Jefferson County Progressive Democratic Coalition We started this organization after the election in November as we felt the real and honest values of our party and of democracy were under attack We are not only focused on local issues and candidates but also those on the national front As I m sitting here the day after the inauguration and as I m watching the massive marches around the world of the people standing up for the rights of all people I m hopeful that in six months when the cameras aren t focused on them that those people marching today will still be willing to do the hard work that is ahead of us If you are concerned about the future of our little neck of the woods and would like to be a part of our organization that is endeavoring to get real progressive forward thinking candidates into office to help move our valley into a world where everyone has equal rights and opportunities if you want to help shape the conversations that our leaders not only local but state and national need to hear to build a great democracy for all people then please join us your friends and neighbors in this important work Our next meeting will be at 6 p m Feb 10 at 136 N Fourth St in Steubenville When just a day after taking the oath of office the new administration silences the voices of a government agency the National Parks Service when it erases civil rights health care and LGBT rights from the WhiteHouse gov website it is imperative that all good and decent people stand up and shout that we the American people will not allow our voices to be silenced The road ahead may seem dark but we can be the light and hope for others to follow Barbara Davis Wintersville
