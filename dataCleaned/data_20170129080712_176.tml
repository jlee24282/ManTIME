<TITLE>French guitarist strums his way to international acclaim</TITLE>
<TEXT>
By French guitarist Thibaut Garcia is just 22 years old, but his bona fides are impressive.  
 
At 16 he began studying at the Conservatoire National Superieur de Musique et de Danse de Paris and earned his bachelor of arts degree with honors. He won first prizes in Spain’s Valle de Egues international competition in 2008, Germany’s Ana Amalia contest in 2011, Romania’s Terra Siculorum contest in 2013, Spain’s international competition in Sevilla in 2013 and Jose Tomas contest in 2014, and finally the top prize in the Guitar Foundation of America 2015 International Classical Guitar Competition.  
 
That prize won him a 50-concert world tour, including performances at Carnegie Hall and, on Saturday, the opening concert in GuitarSarasota’s 11th annual international classical guitar season.  
 
“It’s great,” said Garcia in a phone interview from Vancouver, British Columbia, earlier this month. “The Guitar Foundation of America is the most important guitar competition in the world. Thanks to that I have this big tour. It’s huge, a great opportunity to begin a career.”  
 
His program will be “very eclectic, from Baroque passing through Romantic music to contemporary music. I will play a piece by a contemporary American composer and another by a very good friend in Toulouse,” Garcia’s hometown.  
 
Three years ago, Vincent Jockin sent Garcia a copy of Moment Musical, Op. 26, No. 4, the composer’s first work for solo guitar. Garcia didn’t know the composer or his work, but was impressed by the piece, and the two became friends. 
 
“I hope he will continue to compose for guitar,” said Garcia. “He’s very local for me. For my city I’m very proud.” 
 
Garcia, who began playing guitar at age 7, comes from a musical family. His father also plays classical guitar while his mother enjoys singing. 
 
“When I was a child I heard the classical guitar in the house and I loved that,” he said.  
 
He’s never swerved from that instrument. When he began his conservatory studies, “you have to discover all the instruments, and you have to choose the one you want to play.” And it was always the guitar. 
 
His performance in Sarasota will include selections from his recently-released recording, “Layendas,” with music by Albeniz, Falla, Rodrigo, Tarrega, Manjon and Piazzolla. The program also includes Donald Crockett’s “Fanfare Studies.”  
 
While his concert tour is a solo act, he often collaborates with other musicians in chamber music performances. “When you’re a soloist, you have your space; you can create your own atmosphere on stage. What is really exciting in playing chamber music is you share the experience with other people on stage, which creates a fantastic atmosphere as well, lots of energy.”
