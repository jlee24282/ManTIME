<TITLE>Museum Exhibit Challenges Notion That Wood Is an Antiquated Building Material </TITLE>
<TEXT>
For centuries wood was civilization s primary construction material but as the use of concrete glass and steel grew wood was largely relegated to flooring and interior paneling An exhibition at the National Building Museum in Washington challenges that narrow use It suggests that tomorrow s buildings will or should be constructed of wood The exhibition Timber City highlights the wide range of benefits offered by cutting edge methods of timber construction showing that wood is a modern strong and versatile material Winners of Tall Wood Building Prize The show highlights the two winners of the Tall Wood Building Prize sponsored by the U S Department of Agriculture One in New York City and one in Portland Oregon are two premier cross laminated engineered pre fabricated timber buildings going up right now said the exhibition s curator Susan Piedmont Palladino They re similar structures Both buildings are using this material in slightly different ways but the goal is to build right in the middle of the city And that s what makes timber the perfect choice in a busy district like New York s Manhattan where construction speed and efficiency are vital Buildings go up very quickly The materials for the building the walls and the floors and the ceilings are manufactured off site They come on a truck pre fabricated Piedmont Palladino said So a work crew armed with power screwdrivers can basically assemble the building extremely quickly There s no long term curing of concrete needed Information panels in the exhibition explain that concrete manufacturing is the world s third largest source of greenhouse gases and that harvesting timber a renewable resource has a lower environmental cost than mining the materials needed to make steel and concrete New manufacturing techniques make cross laminated timber stronger Piedmont Palladino compares it to giant sheets of plywood placing her hands at 90 degrees on top of each other to demonstrate how it s made So it is layered one layer this way another layer that way another layer that way and that way she said It s what we called dimensionally stable It doesn t move around And it can be manufactured from small trees that otherwise have very little economic value Fire resistant wood The curator also says layered timber resists fire better than unprotected steel which weakens faster than wood when heated A recently constructed fire station in Oregon covered with blackened wood from a local flame damaged barn demonstrates how a charred exterior actually protects wood from fire In addition Piedmont Palladino pointed to a psychological benefit of wood construction There s this concept of biophilia that is the theory that we are attracted to and relaxed by and in general our mental and physical health is improved by being in proximate condition to nature or the elements from nature she said Timber may not be the best building material in every situation but the National Building Museum predicts that soon there will be a lot more wooden buildings around the world The National Building Museum s Timber City exhibition runs through September 10 2
