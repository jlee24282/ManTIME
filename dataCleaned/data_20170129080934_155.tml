<TITLE>Baby born in Iran after 14-year cryopreservation 7hr</TITLE>
<TEXT>
A child has been born in an Iranian hospital after 14 years of cryopreservation, the process of preserving an embryo at sub-zero temperatures. 
 
According to Dr. Asadollah Kalantari, a founding member of Isfahan’s Fertility  amp; Infertility Center, on Saturday, the child was born in full health, adding that the 42-year-mother was also in a suitable medical condition. 
 
He added that this is the first time a child has been born with the use of an embryo frozen for so long with the last such case in Iran being a period of 11.5 years. 
 
“The newborn’s mother experienced two Ectopic pregnancies 25 years ago that resulted in her inability to get pregnant. In 2003, an embryo was implanted in her womb via in vitro fertilization, or IVF, but the baby did not survive to be born,” he added.      
 
Kalantari also said that there are currently 100,000 fertilized frozen embryos being kept in the facility in Esfahan.
