<TITLE>EPA moves concerning</TITLE>
<TEXT>
According to Reuters, the Trump administration has instructed the Environmental Protection Agency to remove the climate change page from its website. The website provides links to important global warming research and detailed data on emissions. As of this writing, the page was set to go down Jan. 25. 
  
The Trump administration has also instructed the EPA to put a freeze on any contracts or grants pending review and to limit its communications with the media and the public. All this in addition to nominating Scott Pruitt, the Attorney General of Oklahoma, to be EPA Administrator. Pruitt has sued the EPA 13 times and has had a political career intricately intertwined with fossil fuels and soaked in fossil fuels money. 
 
This is not just a conservative Republican president nominating another conservative and making some routine changes at the EPA to go his own way; this is a deliberate attempt to delegitimize the clear and unequivocal global scientific consensus on anthropogenic (human-caused) global climate change. Trump has already expressed his desire to expand on fossil fuels infrastructure — he has signed an executive order pushing to proceed with the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines, as one example — and suppressing the EPA and other agencies while feeding nonsense to the public on climate change smoothes his way. 
 
At Mid-Ohio Valley Climate Action, we have built and continue to build a strong catalog of important climate change science, including paleoclimate data, observational data, and the finest modeling data detailing the past, present and future status of our earth affected by climate change and clarifying human impacts. We meet every third Thursday of the month at First Christian Church, 1400 Washington Ave. in Parkersburg at 7 p.m. We hope you will join us in our efforts to combat the global threat of climate change. As our slogan states, we must “Save the Grandchildren!”
