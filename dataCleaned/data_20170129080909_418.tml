<TITLE>Us Them review an evocative retelling of the Beslan school siege</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Dorfman London Carly Wijs s 2016 Edinburgh fringe hit tells the story of the 2004 Russian school siege with clear eyed audacity Us Them hostages and captors Russians and Chechens children and adults heroes on tractors and baddies with their foot on detonators actors and audiences In one of the most surprising productions of the year Carly Wijs has written and directed a show about the Beslan school siege It was created for Bronks a Belgian theatre company specialising in work for young audiences String marks the tripwires of the terrorists and the tiny spaces in which the captives manoeuvre In 2004 Chechen terrorists held 1 200 people captive in a school in North Ossetia Russia After three days during which some captives drank their own urine and ate flowers that had been brought in for teachers 385 adults and children were dead Footage from the siege shows people running half naked towards safety bodies on stretchers gunfire fear But in Wijs s production Gytha Parmentier and Roman Van Houtven playing two of the children explain the events with the earnest concentration of kids recalling the rules of a particularly absorbing game Mercurial Gytha Parmentier and Roman Van Houtven in Us Them Photograph www fkph net The stage looks like a playroom Parmentier and Van Houtven chalk out the layout of the school on the floor Facts are scrawled on the blackboard String marks the tripwires of the terrorists and the tiny spaces in which the captives manoeuvre the entire stage is enclosed in a cat s cradle Balloons are burst with the effect of explosions There are no tears no screams No cuteness The gaze on what is happening is steady though the pair s movement is mercurial they dance some feelings and actions slipping under and over the wires In the background occasional bursts of sonorous Slavic music hint at reverberations on the outside It is an impressive evening evoking the effects of trauma rather than the causes of the siege It was one of the hits of last year s Edinburgh fringe I wish I had seen it then unprepared for its clear eyed audacity forewarning lessens the impact
