<TITLE>Voice of the People Jan. 29: Child victims, cell phone thief and the wall</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Who will speak for ACS victims?  
Rockaway Park: Wow, this one is unbelievable. Mayor de Blasio stated “from what we’ve heard so far from the medical examiner, it may be a health situation, not anything related to abuse or neglect” (“ ‘Health situation’ may have caused death of Queens boy, 5,” Jan. 25). Is he for real? 
 
Those two so-called parents checked on Little Mikey (they say) at 2:30 a.m. with breathing problems but the mother Phyllis Reinoso said that he seemed fine and then not again for 14 hours, I assume when they decided to wake up — clearly proving extreme neglect! That would be at 4:30 that afternoon and to top it all off, the child had health problems! That’s not neglect. Are you kidding me? 
 
We caring parents would, first, never have 13 prior ACS cases; would not leave all those children alone for the 15-year-old to be held responsible day-in and day-out; sleep all day; leave children unsupervised — and we would constantly check in on them, especially little Mikey because of his health issues. 
 
Clearly, this was a total case of abuse and neglect from two people who should never have children under their watch again, ever. They deserve to be in jail and I pray that those poor innocent children will eventually be in the care of loving and responsible guardians. ACS failed them and I hope that the case workers are held responsible and fired, as well as those two so-called parents. And where were the extended family, neighbors and school officials? Not one person cared enough to do the right thing for these innocent victims. 
 
So please, Mr. Mayor, do not stand there and try to defend the utmost incompetence of ACS just to cover yourself. Sickening and outrageous! Connie Scalice 
 ACS’ rap sheet  
Briarwood: How many more children must die whose families were under investigation by the ACS? Mikey Guzman (Tuesday’s paper), Zamair Coombs (Friday’s), Jaden Jordon in December, Zymere Perkins in the fall. How could this be allowed to continue? Take ACS out of the mayor’s control! Donald Trump, please step in, create a national agency overseeing child protective services for all our cities. Please help the children who need your help so desperately. Patricia Nuzzi 
 An even longer rap sheet  
Plainview, L.I.: Given the decade-long series of child murders that New York City’s Administration for Children’s Services has repeatedly failed to prevent — including Nixzmary Brown, Elisa Izquierdo, Myls Dobson, Zymere Perkins, Jaden Jordan, Mikey Guzman and Zamair Coombs — I feel compelled to unofficially re-name ACS with the following: Asses Committing Serial-killings. Sure, the physical murders were actually “administered” by these children’s monstrous mothers, fathers and mothers’ boyfriends, but they were all virtually enabled by a series of ACS commissioners and workers, (not to mention mayors who also bear much bucks-stop-here responsibility). If every one of these murders had in fact been committed by an actual serial killer, could we ever punish him enough? But none of the many ACS employees who played any (negligent but not negligible) role in any of these deaths have shared in the immense suffering of these young victims in the hours, days, weeks, months or years leading up to their deaths. Mayor de Blasio should be ashamed and angry enough to finally put an end to cases like these that do not have to continue happening. Richard Siegelman 
 Repairs needed now  
Manhattan: City Council Public Housing Committee Chairman Ritchie Torres is right in his demand for a larger upfront capital commitment from the city for NYCHA developments (“Mayor de Blasio’s pledge to allocate $1 billion over 10 Years to replace roofs at NYCHA,” Jan. 24”). NYCHA residents cannot wait another 10 years for roofs to be fixed. Leaky roofs lead to mold, exacerbate chronic illnesses such as asthma and cause damage to building structures. The city needs to invest $1 billion upfront now so that NYCHA can make the necessary repairs that it has been forced to defer for years. It is time for the city to protect the health and safety of its residents, more than 600,000 New Yorkers. In our new reality, New York City cannot wait for federal dollars to make these major improvements, we must preserve this essential affordable housing now. Lucy Newman, The Legal Aid Society 
 Calling out a thief  
Yonkers: To the person who found and kept my cellphone: Thanks for nothing. I dropped my Samsung phone in front of a small restaurant in the Bronx on Jan. 17 or 18 of this year and you had a chance to show me that there are still decent, honest people out there. Instead, when I called that night and spoke with you, you immediately asked for a reward. While I spoke to you, I used my computer to track it to Harlem near W. 129th St. You seemed to agree on returning it but requested that I call you back the next day. I called the phone the rest of week and you never responded again. I’m still paying for that phone. Instead of showing me an honest person, you elected to turn thief. If I had found someone else’s phone, I would’ve gone out of my way to return it — without requiring a reward. But I guess that’s the difference between you and me. Francisco Matos 
 Freedom to march and work  
Huntington Station, L.I.: One of the more distasteful things shouted at my 85-year-old mother as she sat in a lawn chair, holding an anti-war sign with other members of her Catholic pacifist group, was “Get a job!” It is time for people on all degrees of the political arc to stop accusing those who take the time to stand up for their beliefs of goofing off. I know folks from the hard right to the far left and all of us under 70 are working and paying taxes. People don’t always work 9 to 5, Monday to Friday. With flex time, tele-commuting, etc., we have much more freedom to protest than we used to. Please find some truth-based insults to fling. Ann Rita Darcy 
 Double Don  
Williamsburg, Va.: President Trump is the reincarnation of both George Patton and Douglas MacArthur — all blood and guts and someone who knows how to manipulate the press. Trump should keep up the pressure on all his opponents and keep them guessing as to his next move. He is showing significant strength and Vladimir Putin has to be in awe. It will certainly strengthen America’s hand when it comes time to negotiate with Russia. John Lemandri 
 No more neo-cons, please  
New Rochelle, N.Y.: Cloaked with humanitarian largesse, Charles Krauthammer continues to push the ultra hawkish neo-conservative ideas that are the prime factors for American recession and chaotic global instability (“Under Trump, America recedes,” Jan. 27). Acting as world policeman with vast military involvement is no longer sustainable and was never wise. Foreign entanglements have detrimentally impacted our middle class economically, as well as with a very serious problem with PTSD and a failed Veterans Administration. Can we please put the neo-conservative agenda where it always belonged — in the dustbin of history, and move on with President Trump’s vision of American exceptionalism rather than global mediocrity? Patrick O’Connor 
 Wall payments  
Staten Island: I can tell you exactly who’s going to pay for the wall — the American consumer! The U.S. will put fees and tariffs on goods from Mexico, and those will be passed along to the consumer. Marion Hodgman 
 Importing taxes  
Hicksville, L.I.: So Don the Con is having trouble getting Mexico to pay for the wall and his answer is to try imposing a 20% tax on Mexican imports. This, of course, means that the American public will be paying for the wall twice — once in taxes and again when the purchased goods arrive from Mexico because, as conservatives love to remind us, corporations don’t really pay taxes; they merely pass them through to their customers. Joe Squerciati 
 Bad friend  
Queens Village: After one week in office, Trump managed to tick off Mexico and sour relationships. I wonder what will happen after the visit from England’s prime minister? Gloria L. Catalanotto 
 Stay out of jail for free  
Manhattan: So what I got out of the mayor’s speech was if you’re an illegal alien who committed a crime or crimes, come to New York (“Mayor de Blasio vows to fight Trump’s anti-immigration order threatening to pull funding for ’sanctuary cities’ like NYC,” Jan. 25). We are a sanctuary and will protect you from the government. Michael Wishner
