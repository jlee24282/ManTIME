<TITLE>Davis overcomes slow start downs West Valley</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Mired in another of their oddly ineffective starts Davis boys did what all offensively potent teams do They shot their way out of it The Pirates not only trailed after the first quarter for the third straight game but they committed 10 turnovers in the first half of Saturday s CBBN clash with West Valley and found themselves sputtering to a 23 19 deficit at halftime on their home floor I guess you might call it our little glitch in the system said Davis coach Eli Juarez We told the kids Look if you want to be an elite team you can t wait We had some energy at the start tonight but we didn t hold it then we started turning the ball over At halftime we got back to the plan go inside out And that did the trick The seventh ranked Pirates erupted for 27 points in the third quarter hitting 11 of 16 shots with four 3 pointers and built a 16 point lead in the final period en route to a 60 51 victory With leading scorers Collin Kelley and Alexzander Delgado limited to single digits a pair of sophomores came forward to supply the offense Ivory Kimble came off the bench to score 13 points on 6 for 6 shooting to go with his seven rebounds both team highs and Brock Williams hit two of his four 3 pointers in the big third quarter for a season high 12 points In the first meeting at West Valley three weeks ago Davis dominated inside with its height advantage as 6 foot 5 Aaron Meza broke out for a career best 22 points But Meza was slowed some by a sore back on Saturday and he and interior teammate Michael Gordon picked up some early fouls limiting what the Pirates wanted to do inside Enter Kimble Known mostly for his rebounding the 6 1 sophomore typically spells either of the senior bigs and he made the most of his chances Saturday I m mostly a rebounding guy The coaches always tell me there s more to being productive than just points Kimble said But tonight we needed some scoring and it was my time to step up We had a lot more energy in the second half We were just a lot better as a team After managing just eight field goals in the first half the Pirates doubled that in the first 5 45 of the third quarter They made six of their first seven shots with three treys and then added a 12 2 run later in the period We went back to working inside out and we passed much better Juarez said of the third period burst We got the ball inside we kicked it out hit some shots and penetrated better It was nice to see Ivory and Brock play well and that s what we tell them contributions can come from anyone Those kids really held their own tonight West Valley also held its own too considering the Rams were without injured senior David Lindgren and his 16 point scoring average Justin Van De Brake scored a game high 22 points taking his career total to 996 Dallin Cluff had 13 points and five rebounds and Spencer Bailey netted 10 points Davis 8 1 14 3 owns a one game lead over Moses Lake with three games left The Pirates only game next week is a visit to Eisenhower on Friday West Valley 5 5 12 6 has just two games left and both are at home Moses Lake on Friday and Eisenhower on Feb 7 WEST VALLEY Justin Van De Brake 22 Spencer Bailey 10 Caffrey 0 Dallin Cluff 13 Sieber 3 Sabari 0 McDonald 3 Totals 18 45 11 16 51 DAVIS Kelley 6 Delgado 7 Hooper 0 Brock Williams 12 Guerrero 7 Chavez 3 Michael Gordon 10 Ivory Kimble 13 Meza 2 Totals 25 50 3 8 60 West Valley 11 12 13 15 51 Davis 9 10 27 14 60 3 point goals WV 4 15 Van De Brake 2 Cluff Davis 7 18 Williams 4 Kelley Chavez Guerrero Rebounds WV 23 Cluff 5 Davis 33 Kimble 7 Kelley 5 Delgado 5 Gordon 5 Meza 5 Turnovers WV 14 Davis 16 Fouls WV 13 Davis 15 Fouled out None
