<TITLE>State retirement contribution bill heads to NH House</TITLE>
<TEXT>
CONCORD A House committee recommended a bill this week that would have the state once again contribute to retirement costs for teachers and first responders The House Executive Departments and Administration Committee voted 10 9 to support House Bill 413 in a hearing at the Statehouse Wednesday morning The bill seeks to have the state pay 15 percent of contributions of the retirement system for teachers police and firefighters It will now go to the House floor for a vote The state once contributed 35 percent to the retirement system for teachers and first responders but the Legislature abolished the state s contribution in 2011 leaving towns and cities to pick up the cost The bill s main sponsor Rep Renny Cushing D Hampton said the legislation is vital for municipalities who each lost hundreds of thousands of dollars in aid from the state in 2011 Hampton received between 600 000 and 700 000 for teachers and first responders retirement each year from the state before aid was cut in 2011 Portsmouth received more than 1 million a year from the state in retirement contributions for teachers police and fire The state began paying 35 percent of the retirement system cost for police firefighters and teachers in 1977 when the Legislature and governor passed that fixed percentage into law In 2009 the state lowered its commitment to 30 percent Rep Jackie Cilley D Barrington was a state senator in 2009 and recalled Gov John Lynch stating the decrease in contribution was meant to be temporary as the state was struggling through the recession at the time Cilley said the Legislature underwent massive turnover in 2010 and Republicans wiped out the state s contribution to the system the next year Cushing along with other proponents of bringing back the state contribution have said the state made a promise in 1977 to contribute to the system and lawmakers went back on that promise six years ago The state had a role in supporting public education and public safety Cushing said It made a promise to communities it would partner and support retirement costs for teachers police and fire Cushing said he proposed the state contribute 15 percent because he believes that would be more likely to pass than a request for the state to return to 35 percent A cost analysis provided by the New Hampshire Retirement System states the bill would have the state contribution increase by 40 81 million in fiscal year 2018 and that number would increase slightly in the following three years It s a claw back in its attempt to hold the state accountable Cushing said One of the committee members who voted against recommending the bill Rep Steven Beaudoin R Rochester said he understood local taxpayers would benefit from the state contributing to the system However he believes the state should not be funding pensions for any town or city employees and questioned whether tax dollars raised from small towns should be used to pay for employee pensions in larger cities Beaudoin also was concerned about where the money would come from saying adding 40 million per year to the state s expenses is a tough nut to crack Cushing said no funds specifically have been identified to pay for the contribution but he believes it should be the state s responsibility to pay that cost based on the Legislature s intent in 1977 to help fund pensions Cilley said the state demonstrated how much it valued reserving state dollars for the retirement system when it amended the state Constitution in 1984 to require money in the system solely be used for that purpose At the time she said there was interest in raiding the funds for other uses If they want to do any one thing that will help the property taxpayers in this state it s to go back to the promise they made to pay their contribution Cilley said
