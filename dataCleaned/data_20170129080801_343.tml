<TITLE>Jonathan Milne With just one pupil decision to keep Linton Country School open is a bold one and the right one</TITLE>

David Unwin Stuff Linton Country School has one student enrolled for 2017 OPINION Six year old Cruiz Strickett is one special kid They say it takes a village to bring up a child and that s exactly what s happening in the small semi rural farming neighbourhood of Linton in the Manawatu Not much had gone right at Linton Country School Already declining incomes and living conditions in the area saw the school plunge down the decile rankings Last year challenges with the school governance and leadership provoked the Ministry of Education into sending in a limited statutory manager to take control of the board of trustees Principal Bill Kaandorp had to stand down due to ill health and ultimately resign And for good measure the school hall suffered a severe fire in October Natasha Baker hopes to send her three year old son Michael to Linton Country School She s set up a parents group to support the school The community might have been forgiven for turning their back on the school Some did There were 12 pupils at the end of the last year who headed off to their summer holidays under the cloud of a series of crisis meetings about the school s future Some went off to high school Some moved to other schools Linton Country School has suffered more than its share of troubles By ast month it was on the brink of closure On Wednesday this week one will return That s Cruiz Cruiz is the sixth generation of his family to go to Linton Country School they weren t going to let go easily After 127 years serving the district the school came oh so close to closing at Christmas The statutory manager Laura Snowden challenged the community You want to keep your school Well step up Cruiz Strickett s dad gardened painted and cleaned in a last ditch bid to keep his son s school open And they did Cruiz s dad Aaron Strickett fixed the sandpit tidied up the gardens cleaned the drains and put up bright yellow school signs Natasha Baker and other mums with pre schoolers swung in to offer their help too They fought And the Ministry of Education agreed to let them keep the school open at least for now Because there is if course a question of real public interest here Should the taxpayer continue bankrolling a school that has just one child on the roll The school will get 158 000 in salaries and operations funding this year you could put Cruiz through a degree at an Ivy League university for that kind of money Ultimately the answer must be no It serves neither the public purse the community nor Cruiz himself to continue propping up a failing school That is the ultimate answer But the immediate answer is a resounding yes The Ministry of Education has rightly given the school and its community a chance probably a last chance to prove themselves School rolls go up School rolls go down But communities endure Once you ve shut down a school it s hard to open it again The graffitied burned out shells of closed schools around New Zealand are evidence of that And a good school isn t just an educational provider it is the heart of a community The people of Linton have shown us that
