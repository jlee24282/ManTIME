<TITLE>Just a Thought: MTAL closing in on merger with MBL</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Just one more hurdle needs to be cleared for the Mission Trail Athletic League to become a member of the Monterey Bay League for all sports. 
 
By all accounts, a vote on March 9 among administrators from the three southern conference leagues in the Central Coast Section appears to be no more than a formality for the move to be approved and go into effect in 2018. 
 
In others words, it’s going happen barring a change in opinion from roughly two thirds of the voters who are in support of the merger. 
 
There will be at least a three-division tier, not likely to be altered until the 2018-2019 season. It could be four divisions for football, if the six teams from the Santa Cruz Coast Athletic League that joined the MTAL after the SCCAL disbanded in the sport choose to remain in the league. 
 
Change always scares people, particularly in a league that has been around for more than 50 years. Yet, the majority of the MTAL is pushing this plan. 
 
The hope is to create more of a competitive balance for the two leagues. Clearly, we don’t have that right now in the MTAL, as the same teams continue to dominate certain sports. 
 
Need an example. 
 
Carmel has won eight of the last nine MTAL football titles. Pacific Grove is headed towards a fourth straight boys basketball title. Santa Catalina has won four consecutive track titles. King City has four straight boys track titles. I can go on. 
 
This is not a bad thing. Yes, there needs to be change in some capacity in both leagues. At times equity among the MBL’s Gabilan and Pacific Division has worked. On more occasions, however, it has hurt a program with its building process. 
 
Moving reigning Pacific Division-champion Alisal into the Gabilan Division for girls basketball has left them winless this winter. That’s not what this is intended to do. 
 
Were the Trojans prepared to make the leap? Was this thought out enough? Because there is a significant difference between the two divisions in the MBL for all sports. 
 
Winning a league title should not automatically constitute a move up. And it doesn’t. Case in point is the Trojans boys basketball program, which went undefeated in the MBL-P last year and did not move up. 
 
That likely won’t be the case next year as Alisal is currently undefeated in the MBL-P, with five sophomores making an impact. Two consecutive titles warrants a move up, particularly when the cast is coming back — five of them for the next two years. 
 
The biggest argument in the MTAL’s merger with the MBL comes from football coaches. Concerns about safety are valid. 
 
 
No program in the MTAL has a freshmen football program. Every team in the MBL-G does and most programs more than double the size of any MTAL roster. Don’t think that’s not a significant advantage in a physical sport. 
 
Yet, lets keep this in prospective: For an MTAL team to get bumped into the MBL-G, it would first have to be moved into the MBL-P and win that league. 
 
With this merger not slated until 2018, that’s at least two more years before that possibility exists. Personally, I don’t think any MTAL football program has any business in the MBL-G. 
 
But there is no guarantee that will ever happen. My hunch would be that if an MTAL team won a MBL-P football title, it would have to duplicate the feat to warrant consideration. 
 
Merging the MTAL with the MBL makes sense with most sports. The real issue — which has little to do with the purposed MTAL merger — is finding balance among teams that are pushed into the MBL’s Gabilan Division from the Pacific Division. 
 
The first five teams in the MBL-G for most sports are usually stacked. It’s the bottom two that often take a beating. History backs that. 
 
Hence, we see them often dropped to the MBL-P for two sacrificial lambs. A year or two later, the new arrivals often end up back in the MBL-P. 
 
I don’t know if it’s fear of jumping to a new league that cripples a program before the year begins. Or just bad decisions. I mean there is a reason the Gabilan is ‘A’ division and the Pacific and MTAL are ‘B’ divisions. 
 
Is there a solution? Well, you can’t have a five-team division. Someone has to go up. So are the right teams going up? 
 
Alisal and Christopher are winless in the MBL-G in girls basketball this winter. One may drop, but not both. But there’s not a team in the MBL-P today that could contend in the Gabilan. 
 
Christopher had no business in the MBL-G for football this past fall. Yet, despite an 0-6 mark in 2015, it was left in the league and promptly went winless again. 
 
Its lone win all year came against Gilroy, which reached the CCS Division IV finals coming out of the MBL-P. 
 
That’s a true indication of how different those divisions are in competitive balance — for most sports. 
 
Christopher will be competitive next year in the MBL-P for football. Seaside’s promotion will be scrutinized, particularly since it lost its two best offensive weapons and Pacific Division Defensive Player of the Year. 
 
No one is trying to penalize a program for success. Teams from the MTAL that ultimately get bumped to the MBL-P will be fine. The MBL-G is another story. But that’s a ways down the road, if ever. The real issue isn’t the MTAL merging. It’s finding the right two teams that can jump into the MBL-G and at least be competitive. The idea is to build programs back up, not shatter their confidence.
