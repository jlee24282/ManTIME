<TITLE>The Watch Of Life</TITLE>
<TEXT>
The old Pocket Ben had been handed down for years. It was believed that the owner of this watch was protected from death so long as he or she owned it and it was ticking. This was never proved unequivocally. However, the President of the United States declared it to be a National Treasure and had to be confiscated from its owner, Effie McFadden. Effie objected. This story tells what happened.
