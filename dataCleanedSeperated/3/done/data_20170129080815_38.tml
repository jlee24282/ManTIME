<TITLE>Third edition of Spanish language programme to be rolled out</TITLE>
<TEXT>
The Colombian government is further investing in Barbados’ public service.  
 
Ambassador of the Republic of Colombia, Jaime Alberto Acosta Carvajal disclosed his government’s plan to continue its Spanish language programme for Barbados’ public servants in 2017 “due to the significant success of this course”. 
 
His announcement came as he addressed Friday’s graduation ceremony for the second edition of the programme at the Horatio Cooke Auditorium, National Union of Public Workers (NUPW) headquarters. On this occasion, 58 persons from across the government service graduated from the course. This figure is an increase from the 40 individuals who graduated when the course was first offered. 
 
Carvajal explained that the programme was “implemented to promote Colombian culture through the teaching of Spanish. To us, this has strengthen our bilateral relationship because it is based on collaboration and mutual corporation. So far we have replicated this programme in other countries in the Caribbean such as Guyana, Grenada, Jamaica, Suriname and for the first time in Trinidad and Tobago.” 
 
He added, “The Spanish courses in Barbados are in fact one of the most successful stories since the beginning of our programme of the promotion of the Colombian culture through the teaching of Spanish.”  
 
The Ambassador also highlighted the benefit of public servants and locals learning Spanish as a second language. 
 
“The teaching of Spanish to public servants seeks to strengthen the importance of the learning of Spanish in the region and to fortify the ties between the Caribbean and Latin America. We as a region need to enhance the knowledge our languages to be able to act and collaborate as a block. Our culture is similar in many ways, our challenges too but it is the mutual corporation and elimination of the small barriers that separate us from each other that will make us strong.”
