<TITLE>Cardinals roll past State Fair for 23rd straight win</TITLE>
<TEXT>
SEDALIA, Mo. – Lamar Morgan made his first three shots in the opening minutes, and the unbeaten Mineral Area men’s basketball team never trailed on the road Saturday night. 
   
The fifth ranked Cardinals reached the midway juncture of Region 16 play with a convincing 79 52 triumph over State Fair, avenging a season ending loss from last year. 
   
Morgan netted 16 of his game high 18 points in the first half. Devin Thomas grabbed seven rebounds, and equaled Shawn Roundtree with 12 points each for Mineral Area (23 0, 4 0). 
   
Sophomore center Mark Laros keyed a 9 0 run off the bench with seven straight points, including a steal and slam, and finished with nine overall. 
   
Consecutive offensive putbacks by Thomas and Morgan restored a 25 16 advantage, and Mineral Area only pulled farther away from there. 
   
Morgan dunked in transition off an outlet pass from Amar Miller, and Roundtree drained a deep jumper as time expired at halftime for a 38 23 cushion. 
   
Onteral Woodson scored 17 points to pace State Fair (11 11, 0 4), and knocked down a couple of late triples once the contest was well beyond reach. 
   
Zac Cuthbertson entered the game shooting 46 percent from 3 point range, and went 3 of 4 against the Roadrunners while ending with 11 points.

Mineral Area will continue Region 16 action at home against MSU West Plains on Wednesday before traveling to Moberly next Saturday. 
   
Colton Kolowski scored 13 points and Corey Mendez had nine for State Fair.
