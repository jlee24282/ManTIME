<TITLE>Georgetown Raiders ground Orangeville Flyers 5-0</TITLE>
<TEXT>
After losing two games in a row for the first time in this Ontario Junior Hockey League season, the Georgetown Raiders got back into the win column Saturday with a 5 0 home victory over the Orangeville Flyers. 
 
Nicholas Latinovich stopped all 34 shots for his third shutout of the campaign, with single markers going to Jack Jacome, Jake Payette, Jonathan Hampton, Matthew Thom and Colin Rigney. 
 
The 39 5 1 1 Raiders finished up a busy stretch on the schedule in which their 11 game win streak was broken up by one goal losses this week to the Oakville Blades and Burlington Cougars. 
 
On Friday night in Burlington in a matchup of the West Division’s top teams, both appeared to be in playoff mode in a tight checking contest, with the netminders stealing the show. 
 
The first scoreless OJHL game of the season through regulation went into the extra time before Cougar defender Matt Watson notched his 21st on a spectacular individual effort in the 4 on 4 first overtime period. 
 
Burlington’s Mario Cavaliere made 35 stops for the shutout while Raider Josh Astorino blocked 36 shots. 
 
In the only other meeting between the clubs this season, they played to a 2 2 draw in Georgetown on Oct. 29 and will clash twice more in the next couple of weeks. 
 
With eight games remaining in the regular season, the Raiders remain in first place overall in the OJHL standings, four points up on the Trenton Golden Hawks. 
 
A rematch of last year’s league championship series, won by the Hawks in five games, is set for Trenton on Feb. 17. 
 
Next up for the Raiders is a trip to Port Credit Saturday to take on the Mississauga Chargers at 8 p.m.
