<TITLE>MAC women unable to sustain good start</TITLE>
<TEXT>
SEDALIA, Mo. – Khiandra Perry finished a successful cut to the basket to give the Mineral Area a 20 15 lead as the first quarter buzzer sounded on Saturday. 
   
But an ideal start on the road eventually faded, and State Fair dominated the second half to prevail 72 53 in Region 16 women’s basketball action. 
   
Ahjana Oakes and Ren’Cia Rolling scored 16 points each, and the Roadrunners (14 6, 4 1) used a massive 52 26 margin in rebounds to take control. 
   
Mineral Area also got a transition layup by Olivia White on an outlet pass from Hayley Winter as time expired at halftime to stay within 33 30. 
   
State Fair limited the visitors to eight field goals over the last 20 minutes, however, and built a double digit lead when Alexis Cowan was fouled on a made 3 pointer and sank the ensuing free throw. 
   
Rolling pushed the margin to 67 45 with a steal and layup in the fourth quarter, and the Roadrunners finished 12 of 15 from the line. 
   
Perry tallied a team high 12 points off the bench for the Lady Cardinals (10 11, 1 4). Her energetic play resulted in three early baskets, including a slashing layup for a 12 8 edge. 
   
The lead changed hands six times early, and Maya Brewer put State Fair ahead to stay from the corner at 24 22 after MAC freshman Allie Golden sank a tying mid range jumper.

Cowan scored 12 points and Brewer had 11 in the victory. 
   
Mineral Area went 5 of 24 from 3 point range. Shelby Moon raised the percentage with two perimeter shots while scoring eight of her 10 points over the final 90 seconds. 
   
Jolee Carswell and Hayley Winter matched Golden with eight points each. The Lady Cards will travel to Arkansas Baptist on Wednesday.
