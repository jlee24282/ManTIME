<TITLE>Deja vu as Snedeker shares Torrey Pines lead</TITLE>
<TEXT>
WHILE the ultimate Torrey Pines specialist, Tiger Woods, bowed out of the tournament on Friday, another with a great record over famed Southern Californian layout, Brandt Snedeker, shares the lead with Patrick Rodgers heading into tomorrow’s final round of the Farmers Insurance Open. 
 
Snedeker has twice won this event and on four other occasions been inside the top three and tomorrow he stands a great chance of adding to that stunning record. 
 
Rodgers has yet to win on the PGA Tour, his best being when runner up at the Wells Fargo event in 2015, but he opened up the possibility of that sought after breakthrough win with his round of 67 today. 
 
The pair lead by one over Tony Finau and Taiwanese PGA Tour rookie, CT Pan. 
 
MARC LEISHMAN PUTTING FAMILY FIRST: 
 
Australian Marc Leishman, another with a great record at Torrey Pines having finished runner up on two occasions, is in a share of 5th position and just two from the lead following his third round of 68. 
 
Given his record at the venue and his very solid recent form the chances of a second PGA Tour title look good for the Victorian.   
 
A massive 23 players are within four shots of the lead heading into tomorrow’s final round, however, suggesting Sunday over the South Course will be some sort of shootout.    
 
Of the other Australians, Cameron Smith is 42nd, John Senden 58th and Cameron Percy 69th.
