<TITLE>Iraq's Kurdistan to offer 67 tourism projects to investors</TITLE>
<TEXT>
By Majda Muhsen 
 
Iraq’s Kurdistan intends to offer 67 tourism projects in various parts of the governorate to the private sector this year as part of a drive to increase non oil revenue, an official told Zawya Projects. 
 
“Kurdistan cannot afford large projects because of the present financial crisis, so it is relying on the private sector to carry them out,” said Nader Rousti, a spokesman for Iraq’s General Board of Tourism of Kurdistan. 
 He added that  
“The designs for the projects are ready,” he said without disclosing the project details. 
 
The Board is funding other tourism projects using revenue from the 20 per cent fee imposed by the government on tourism companies in the governorate. 
 
The projects include development and completion of services for nearly 20 tourist sites in the governorate. 
In another statement, the board’s chairman Mawlawi Jabar said Kurdistan has allocated around 100 billion Iraqi dinars ($85 million) for 400 tourism projects in the governorate for execution until 2025.
