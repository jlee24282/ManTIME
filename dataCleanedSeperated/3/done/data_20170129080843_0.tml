<TITLE>Which emerging market will perform best in 2017?</TITLE>
<TEXT>
By Ian Woodcock 
 
For those not familiar with the term, ‘Frontier Markets’ refer to equity markets (usually in smaller nations) that are at earlier stages of political and economic development than larger, more mature emerging markets. 
 
Typically, frontier equity markets have modest market capitalisation and limited liquidity, but possess favourable demographics and have very good opportunities for long term growth. 
 
Overlooked by many investors in recent years in spite of improved economic performance, frontier markets are still a segment of the equity model that is traditionally missing from most portfolios. 
 
However, many frontier funds are still trading at a discount to both emerging and developed markets, meaning now could be the perfect time to buy.  Below, I have provided a brief summary of the better known frontier markets, and what 2017 could bring. 
 
Argentina 
 
Recent political changes have helped pave the way for an economic resurgence in Argentina, although even the president himself admits a complete recovery will take some time. 
 
A country with an abundance of natural resources and wealth but a history of wastefulness and miss management, it seems the foundations may finally be in place for Argentina to re emerge as a powerhouse in Latin America. 
 
Economists expect inflation to be vastly reduced in 2017, and GDP to grow by as much as 3%.  After a long period of foreign investors climbing over each other to get money out of the country, we are now finally seeing capital moving in the other direction again, and the finance ministry has tallied over $32 billion in foreign corporate pledges. 
 
From an investment perspective, valuations are still relatively cheap, and now is the time shrewd investors will enter the market before domestic growth accelerates further and valuations rise. 
 
Vietnam 
 
Vietnam boasted domestic growth of almost 7% in 2016, making it among the fastest growing markets in the world.  In a relatively subdued global economy, perhaps domestic demand is king, and Vietnam is combining this with a huge influx of foreign investment to very good effect. 
 
A bold socio economic plan for 2016 20 is targeting a continued 7% annual expansion, meaning it is set to out perform most of its peers.  In addition, new regulatory and structural reforms are helping to add depth and liquidity to the markets, and 2017 looks to be another strong year. 
 
Pakistan 
 
Although Pakistan continues to suffer from security and corruption problems, as well as from power outages, the IMF has indicated that the government has succeeded in pulling the country out of recent crisis and stabilising the economy. 
 
Interest rates are still way down, meaning positive news for risk based assets, and 2017 could see the country upgraded to emerging market (EM) status.  I would expect to see some setbacks during the course of the year, but, overall, 2017 should still see exciting times and continued growth. 
 
Frontier Europe 
 
Frontier markets in Europe could see improved fortunes in 2017, although much of this depends on improving eurozone growth and the stability of relations with Russia. 
 
A positive Russian market could add liquidity and reduce volatility to a very reasonably priced and neglected market, but I would be wary of sudden and explosive changes sparked by geo political events. 
 
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) 
 
The general consensus seems to be that all six GCC countries will experience a continued slowdown in 2017.  The United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Qatar should outperform their neighbours due to a lesser dependency on oil (UAE), and continued public sector spending ahead of the FIFA 2022 World Cup in Qatar helping to drive domestic growth. 
 
Analyst company BMI Research predicts average oil prices for 2017 to average around only $57 per barrel, and large budget deficits in Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Oman will ensure they lag behind, dragging overall GCC performance down. 
 
If oil price projections turn out to be too conservative, the region could experience much better than expected performance.  Otherwise this is a frontier market to be cautious of, certainly for the next 12 months. 
 
In summary, frontier markets could well hold the key to some of the best opportunities for growth in 2017, although, as always, you should carefully consider options before investing.  Low market valuations in key sectors indicate great potential entry points to the market, and there is no reason why frontier funds could not play a part in a well structured portfolio, particularly with a longer term investment view.
