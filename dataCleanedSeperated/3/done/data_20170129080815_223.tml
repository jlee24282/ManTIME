<TITLE>Girls bowling: Bay warms up for regional with strong finish at Dixon Invite</TITLE>
<TEXT>
DIXON – Katyln Bay aced the dress rehearsal, and now she’s ready for big show. 
   
The Dixon senior bowler pieced together five good games among six and finished fifth overall at the 40th annual Dixon Invitational on Saturday at Plum Hollow Lanes. The event comes exactly 1 week before the Oregon Regional, and Plum Hollow is the host house. 
 
Bay opened with games of 240, 209 and 190 for a 639 morning series, then came back with 235, 149 and 245 for an afternoon series of 629. Her 1,268 total pinfall was a season best by about 60 pins. 
 
“Being able to come back with a 245 was super awesome,” Bay said. “I haven’t been doing super well this year. I wasn’t doing bad, but I haven’t been doing as well as I’d like to be. So being able to bowl a good series right before regionals, that’s good.” 
 
There was an adjustment period for Bay as the lanes began to dry out in the afternoon. 
 
“I’m used to bowling in the morning when the lanes are oily and wet,” Bay said, “and then you get to the afternoon, things dry up, and we’re not used to that. We have to adjust just as much as any other team does.” 
 
The Duchesses finished eighth as a team with a score of 5,478. Mackenzie Kavanaugh (1,145), Alyssa Bonnette (1,036) and Melissa Bates (990) also rolled six game totals. 
 
Oregon placed fifth as a team with a total pinfall of 5,556. Leading the way for the Hawks was Victoria Barnhart, who had a 6 game total of 1,216, good for ninth place overall. 
 
Barnhart rolled games of 183, 195 and 225 for a 603 morning series, then had 214, 207 and 192 for a 613 in the afternoon. 
 
“I mostly kept it in the middle, because nobody was throwing there,” Barnhart said. “I really had to work on my arm swing to keep it straight, and really trust my ball to go out left, and not pull it.” 
 
Abi Scheidecker (1,179), Ali Scheidecker (1,120) and Caitlyn Kaltenbrun (1,000) also had 6 game scores for the Hawks. 
 
Sterling wound up 17th in the 22 team field with a score of 4,989. Leading the Golden Warriors was Kyleigh Glazier with a 6 game score of 1,122. She was backed by Hannah Stout (1,062), Zoey Paone (1,012) and Jamie Riley (956). 
 
Lockport defended its team title with a total pinfall of 6,286, well ahead of runner up Sycamore, which had 5,795. Guilford (5,594) and Moline (5,584) rounded out the top four teams. 
 
Lockport has now won invitationals at Palatine, Prospect, Lockport, Plainfield North, Fenton and Dixon this season. 
 
“We’ve been all over,” Porters coach Art Cwudzinski said. “That’s why we go to a lot of different tournaments, so we are adapting to all of the different shots all over. They’re really good at it. Our girls practice all the time, and they’re reaping the results.” 
 
Lockport’s Marissa Ramirez (1,313), Bailey Delrose (1,283) and Dana Ackerson (1,278) claimed spots 2 4 overall. They were looking up at Sycamore freshman Morgan Kolberg, who posted a 1,350 total. 
    
Kolberg, who also won her own team’s invitational, rolled games of 193, 209 and 244 for a 646 morning series, then turned it up a notch with 256, 243 and 205 for a 704 afternoon series. 
 
“I just had to stay calm, figure out the lanes, and make sure that I was throwing good, consecutive shots, and picking up my spares,” Kolberg said. 
 
Kolberg and the rest of the Spartans will return to Plum Hollow on Saturday to compete in the Oregon Regional, and she’s brimming with confidence. The top four teams and 10 individuals not on those teams advance to the LaSalle Peru Sectional on Saturday, Feb. 11. 
 
“It really does set a good tone,” Kolberg said. “I’m kind of excited to go on, and hopefully make it to state as a team.”
