Eng is also slated to meet selected CFOs in Dubai and Doha for a roundtable discussion on cost and cash flow management in turbulent times. 
 
“Financial and management reporting and the increasingly competitive global environment puts pressure on CFOs to do the right things in the right ways and ensure our organizations are positioned to not only weather but thrive in these turbulent times,” states Eng.
