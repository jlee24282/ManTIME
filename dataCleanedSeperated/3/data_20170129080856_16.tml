<TITLE>Freezin' for a reason: 2017 Polar Bear Plunge at Sandy Point</TITLE>
<TEXT>
When members of the Maryland State Firemen s Association plunged into the Chesapeake Bay Friday, they weren t thinking about the cold, they were thinking about the cause. The team was part of Friday s Police, Fire  amp; EMS, and Military Plunge. 
 
 No matter the temperature of the water, the warm feeling you feel inside supersedes that,  explained Bruce Bouch, senior deputy state fire marshal and member of the Gamber  amp; Community Fire Department. 
 
The Polar Bear Plunge holds multiple plunges over Friday and Saturday, in addition to the 24 hour Super Plunge. Friday was dedicated to plunges for police officers, firefighters and emergency personnel. There are two public plunges Saturday. 
 
Each participant must pledge at least $75, with Super Plungers aiming to raise $10,000. The money raised goes on to help Special Olympians by funding different competitions and activities, according to the Maryland Special Olympics . 
 
Bouch, who dons an embroidered fire safety cape for the event, said the plunge is  just another way to give back.  This year is the sixth time he has participated. 
 
 Before you go in, you stand outside and acclimate to the air temperature,  Bouch said.  When you enter the water it doesn t seem as bad. When you get out of the water, that s when you feel the coldest but you re at the finish point and all you need to do is change into dry clothes.  
  
When participants enter the heated tent after the plunge and start high fiving, Bouch said  you think about doing it again but then go  nah.   
 
 I do applaud those that reach the 24 hour plunger level because they are doing so much good for this group of great individuals,  Bouch said.  If you don t have the time or are that fearful of colder temperatures, you can always donate to the team and bolster our efforts.  
 
Gamber  amp; Community Fire Company member Shawn Chenoweth, of Gamber, is also a member of the MSFA team. He has participated for five years. 
  
 Special Olympics is a great cause and the money goes to support the athletes,  Chenoweth said.  It s fun being with a group of friends and raising money for a good cause.  
 
Chenoweth said the plunge is  something that everybody should do at least once.  
 
Past president of the MSFA Johnie Roth, of Brookeville, also took the plunge. He has participated with his family for seven years and his son, Eric, is a Special Olympian. 
 
 We ve always been supportive of Special Olympics,  Roth said.  When you have someone in your family, you put in an extra effort. Last year we plunged twice.  
 
Roth said being on the beach with hundreds of people helps  psych yourself into it.  
 
 To see these kids and young adults giving everything they ve got is inspiring. I get a kick out of cheering the kids on,  Roth said.  It s all for the Special Olympians.
