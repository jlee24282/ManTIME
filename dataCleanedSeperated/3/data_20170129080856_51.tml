<TITLE>Grace Smith</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Grace Viola (Anderson) Smith, 95, of Bakersfield, California, formerly of Colliers, West Virginia, peacefully entered eternal glory on Wednesday, January 25, 2017. 
 
Grace was born on January 1, 1922, in Brooke County, WV. She was the daughter of the late Jerome and Nancy (Kocher) Anderson. 
 
In addition to her parents, Grace was preceded in death by her husband, Reverend William James Smith Sr.; brothers, Jerome, John, Lawrence, James, Lester, Carl, and Wesley Anderson; and sisters, Thelma Barnhart and June Anderson. 
 
Grace was a charter member of Archer Heights Church of the Nazarene, now known as Ferry Glenn Church of the Nazarene. Her husband, who served as pastor for over 40 years, was often heard declaring “Amazing Grace” was more than song, it was his wife. A faithful servant of the Lord, she taught adult Sunday school class, led the missionary ministry, hosted missionaries on leave in their home, and served on the church board. Her dedication to educating and broadening the perspective of others helped to equip the next generation of leaders and cultivate a safe environment in her community. 
 
Grace was a trailblazer, setting a path for others to follow. In the 1950s she was the first woman in her community to learn how to drive car and soon other women followed. She was the voice during PTA meetings calling for the protection and civil rights for children of color from her community integrating the schools in Follansbee, WV, during segregation. A dedicated wife and mother, she had a strong business sense which included a wallpaper hanging business serving the Tri State Area during the 1970s. In the 1980s, Grace and her husband William went to the statehouse in Charleston, WV, to stand for environmental protection and protest the proposed chemical dumping on their mountainside. 
 
Grace’s creative spirit captured beauty through all her work which inspired generations of women and men watching her. Beauty was clearly seen when she prepared a meal, set a table, planted a garden, or baked a pie. Grace had flair for design evident not only but especially through her collection of hats. She celebrated the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ through a flurry of festive and elegant decorations spreading Christmas cheer. Grace took time and gave thought to how she assembled and presented an offering to ensure it would be pleasing to the receiver. She served with grace and refinement. 
 
Grace laden her cooking and gardening with love, which she always had enough to share. Her fried chicken and pies will forever be remembered as a gift from God delivered by a beautiful soul. She nurtured and cultivated environments to help the living thrive. Her passion for gardening extended from oriental poppies to evergreens and green beans to fruit trees. Like the plants that grew strong and robust in her care, she poured her life into her family and friends who gained ability and strength from her. Children growing up around her will forever remember the treks she led through the mountain in search of wild blackberry patches — good for the body, mind and soul. 
 
Grace is survived by her seven loving children, William James Smith Jr., of Detroit, MI, David Keith Smith, Lila Elaine Wolfram and her husband, John, Deborah  Lee, all of Columbus, OH, Daniel Christopher Smith and his wife, Janice of Shafter, CA, Michelle Marie Jackson of Blacklick, OH, and Melissa Williams and her husband, Jaye of Bakersfield, CA; 12 grandchildren, a host of great grandchildren, and several great great grandchildren; a brother, Ernest Anderson of Colliers, WV; and extended family of nieces and nephews, friends and church family. 
 
Family and friends will be received on Friday, February 3, 2017, from 5 7 p.m. and again on Saturday, February 4, 2017, from 10 a.m. until time of Homegoing Service at 11 a.m. at the James Funeral Home, Follansbee, WV, 304 527 1717, with Pastor Richard Clark, officiating. 
 
Interment will follow next to her dear husband, Reverend William J. Smith, at St. John Cemetery, Colliers, WV.
