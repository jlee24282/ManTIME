<TITLE>India U-19 trainer Rajesh Sawant passes away</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Rajesh Sawant, India s Under 19 strength and conditioning trainer, was found dead in his hotel room in Mumbai early on Sunday (January 29). He is reported to have suffered a heart attack and passed away in his sleep. 
 
When Sawant didn t turn up for the training in the morning, members of the team went searching for him and was found dead in his room. 
 
 What I have gathered so far is he did not report for team activities in the morning, so people started looking for him and eventually he was found to have been passed away in his room,  Amitabh Choudhary, the Board of Control for Cricket in India s joint secretary, told Sportstar.  I have asked Prof (Ratnakar) Shetty to visit the site and keep me updated. 
 
 Sawant didn t report for team activities and when officials tried to check in his room, he was found dead,  Shetty told CricketNext.  In all probability it is a case of a heart attack as he died in his sleep. As of now the police are investigating the matter and once they complete their investigation, the body will be sent for a post mortem.  
 
The Indian Under 19 team is scheduled to play five 50 over games and two four day matches against England Under 19, with the first match set to take place at the Wankhede Stadium on Monday. 
 
Sawant, who had worked with various age group teams of Mumbai Cricket Association, had also gone to serve the Afghanistan national team during Lalchand Rajput s tenure as coach. In recent times, he was with the India A side that played against England and also with the Rest of India during the Irani Cup.
