<TITLE>Radiocentre: See radio differently in Scotland</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Radiocentre is to host its Tuning In: See Radio Differently conference in Scotland on Wednesday 8th March at the DoubleTree by Hilton Edinburgh City Centre. 
 
Tuning In Scotland will bring industry leaders and innovators together for a two hour morning session. The event will give radio stations, agencies and advertisers the chance to hear about the latest trends and opportunities in the evolving world of radio and audio. This falls under the banner See Radio Differently, the strategic positioning campaign launched by Radiocentre in 2016. 
 
New research on brand building, discussion of the economic and public value of commercial radio and insights into the latest audio technology will all be included in the line up. 
 
Radiocentre’s most recent conference took place in Manchester last November. The Radiocentre team say they are looking forward experiencing the buzz of the famously creative Scottish city. Radiocentre CEO Siobhan Kenny: “We always learn a lot when we move out of London and return to Radiocentre HQ both inspired and energised. Edinburgh is a magnet for artists and entrepreneurs and we are keen to share our latest ideas on radio and audio with such an interesting and innovative audience.” 
 
Edinburgh audiences currently have access to 45 national and local commercial radio stations reaching a combined audience of over 750,000 people each week.
