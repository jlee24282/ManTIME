“I know I was playing well, so I went on court believing I can play well,” says Rafael Nadal in a pre match interview with Nick McCarvel. “I didn’t know how far I could go, but I was thinking that I can have some good matches here.”

Nadal says it’s special facing Federer in the final, no doubt. “It’s good that we have a great rivalry all of our careers, so yes, the match is special, but at the end of the day it is another tennis match,” he said. “[Sunday] is going to be a beautiful day, we will meet each other again in an unbelievable stadium, in one of the most important events of the world without a doubt, so that makes the moment more special.” 

“He is able to play so quick, to produce amazing shots—he is a complete player. He has all the shots,” said Nadal. 

Nadal says that he won’t be putting so much stock in the fact that he has won 23 of 34 matches against Federer, and seven of nine at majors. “That’s my feeling,” he said. “I feel that the player who plays better will have the better chance tomorrow.”
