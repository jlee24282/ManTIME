<TITLE>Jurgen Klopp MUST discover some defensive resolve or more Liverpool fans will start losing faith</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Dave, a Liverpool fan, was outraged. Ringing a national radio station after the midweek defeat by Southampton, he called for Jurgen Klopp to be sacked. 
 
With an accent that sounded more Thames Estuary than Scouse, it was difficult to know if it was a gigantic wind up. 
 
“He’s not a trophy winning manager,” said Dave, overlooking the two Bundesliga titles Klopp ­secured with Borussia Dortmund. 
 
“We’ve not won a game in January,” he went on, ignoring the fact that the month isn’t out. And that the Reds eventually triumphed over Plymouth Argyle in the FA Cup. 
 
“Everton are going to be overtaking us at this rate,” was another barb. The difference at present is nine points. Ten if you count goal difference.

Dave was also brassed off that Klopp hadn’t moved to replace Sadio Mane who disappeared on Africa Cup Of Nations duty, the claims of Daniel Sturridge and Divock Origi discarded like a used tissue. What did he want? To sign Cristiano Ronaldo on a one month loan deal? 
 
But in giving Dave the benefit of the doubt that he was more a sore loser than deranged, there was one point which resonated loud and clear. 
 
“He’s not sorted out the defence,” – one whine that hasn’t dulled with age. 
 
And while we can find more holes in Dave’s rant than there are in Klopp’s defence, he does have a valid argument.

This core problem eventually did for Brendan Rodgers. And the way it’s going, it looks like being the German’s Achilles heel too. His backline looked exposed again in the FA Cup defeat to Championship Wolves. 
 
Statistics can prove anything. But while Liverpool are the Premier League’s top goal ­scorers, only one side in the top eight has a worse defensive record. Yes, that’s you, Manchester City. 
 
The manager decided Simon Mignolet wasn’t up to scratch so he brought in his own man – but the credentials of the erratic Loris Karius are already under fierce ­scrutiny.

At the back, Dejan Lovren has as many friends as enemies. On his day he looks a million dollars. Trouble is, no one can predict when those days will be. 
 
Ragnar Klavan was brought in last summer. But why, if the centre back was so good, didn’t other German clubs try to whip him away from Bundesliga side Augsburg.­ 
 
Then we have the mysterious case of Alberto Moreno – and the most damaging evidence against Klopp. Liverpool’s boss had much of last season plus a pre season to lick the left back into shape.

Even part timers such as myself can see that the defender loves charging forward like a manic Spanish bull. But he is not so keen on returning home. 
 
Why wasn’t Moreno pulled to one side and ­reminded of his responsibilities? It’s not a difficult one to solve. 
 
The very best left backs such as Ashley Cole were defenders first and foremost. But they knew when to leave their slot. They were discerning. 
 
The Arsenal and Chelsea man didn’t just think to himself ‘I’m off’ whenever his side were in possession.

In fairness, James Milner has performed well at left back but he was never schooled in that ­position. And he does not possess Moreno’s attacking flair or athleticism. 
 
Starting on Tuesday, Liverpool face Chelsea, Spurs, Arsenal and Manchester City during the course of the next seven weeks. 
 
And unless Klopp discovers some defensive resolve, this season is ­heading again towards one of ­disappointment on the domestic front.

Despite all the attacking verve and domination of ­possession, it doesn’t count for diddly squat if you can’t keep the ball out of the net at the other end. 
 
Dave might have been a lone voice. 
 
But if Liverpool’s boss doesn’t act, he will find more echoing the same.
