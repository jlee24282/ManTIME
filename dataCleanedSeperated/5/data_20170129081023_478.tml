Both players stand to make plenty of HISTORY in the final. 
 

At 35 years, 174 days Federer can become the second oldest Grand Slam champion in the Open era, after Australia s Ken Rosewall. Meanwhile Nadal is bidding to become the first man since 1968 to win each of the four major titles twice. 
 

It will be Federer s sixth Australian Open final and 28th Grand Slam decider in total, and caps a marvellous comeback after the second half of last season was ruined by a knee injury, with his ranking dipping to 17.

The Mallorcan has spent well over five hours more on court than Federer, and has one fewer day of rest before the final after his epic semi final wrapped up in the early hours of Saturday. 
 

Yet Nadal has done it before in Melbourne in 2009, when he pounded out a longer five set semi final against Fernando Verdasco, and two days later conquered Federer in the final    in another five setter. 
 

Perhaps significantly, in five out of the past nine years, the man who has played his semi final second has gone on to win the final.

Nadal appears to hold the edge over his great rival, at least on paper, with a 23 11 win loss record against Federer, 6 2 in major finals and 3 0 at the Australian Open. 
 

But Nadal insists his past Grand Slam supremacy over Federer will have no bearing on the outcome.

Federer, who also needed five sets to get past world number four and fellow Swiss Stan Wawrinka in the semis, spoke of the  magnitude  of his match against Nadal.

 It is special to play with Roger in a final of a Grand Slam, I cannot lie,   Nadal  said, after surviving a nailbiting, five set semi final with Grigor Dimitrov.

Either Federer, 35, will expand his record haul of major singles titles with his 18th, or 30 year old Nadal will close the gap on the Swiss legend by winning his 15th.
