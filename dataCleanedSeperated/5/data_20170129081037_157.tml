<TEXT>
KUALA LUMPUR: Police have arrested four suspects to facilitate an investigation into a night club brawl in Mont Kiara on Saturday, which led to the death of a 22 year old man. 
 
City Criminal Investigations Department (CID) chief SAC Rusdi Mohd Isa said the suspects were arrested in a follow up operation. 
 
 We have arrested four men, in their 20 s, in Kajang. 
 
 We are identifying more suspects and zeroing in on the main suspect,  he said when contacted. 
 
Rusdi said police are still trying to establish the motive behind the attack. 
 
On early morning Saturday, the victim was stabbed and later succumbed to his injuries in a scuffle at a night club in Mont Kiara. 
 
It was learnt that the victim, along with two friends, went to the entertainment centre at 4am. 
 
While they were dancing, the victim accidentally knocked into a man at a nearby table and a fight ensued. 
 
During the brawl, the victim was stabbed in his chest, while his friend sustained injuries on his chest and the right side of his head. 
 
The victim was then rushed to hospital, but the victim was pronounced dead at 9.30am. 
 
A source told theSun the victim also posseses seven previous records and has been arrested 19 times for various offenses. 
 
In July last year, a car jockey and cashier of the same club were slashed to death outside the club while another unidentified victim was in critical condition after being attacked by a mob wearing ski masks and armed with machetes. 
 
Six suspects were arrested following the incident.
