<TITLE>Advancing age more than likely the cause of all this rage</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Has it been a whole decade since I wrote that column about Grocery Store Rage? 
 
Sure was. It was all the way back on Jan. 28, 2007. 
 
 Grocery Store Rage bears many of the earmarks of road rage, without the convenience of traffic lights,  I wrote. GSR is what you feel  when you get cut off by somebody turning into your aisle. When you have near collisions with other shoppers at aisle intersections because the grocery shelves hide your view of them. When you find yourself sandwiched between the slow cart pushers and the fast cart pushers. When people don t even bother to scream an  excuse me  as they practically violate you while trying to slip past you in a tight space. When somebody runs up from nowhere and beats you to an available checkout counter. ... It s enough to make you and Marvin Gaye wanna holler.  
 
Now that I m older and ... well older, I ve come the realization that GSR is just the tip of the iceberg. 
 
Consciously or unconsciously, we fight myriad other forms of Errand Rage    a First World umbrella term for the various must dos that cause us to leave the comforts of home or office and compete with others for life s necessities. (Some of it is more paranoia, but for the sake of smart aleckyness, we ll stick with  rage. ) And yes, increased susceptibility seems to come hand in hand with advancing age. Some examples: 
 
Clothing Shopping Rage. This rage comes from finding that even on the regular price racks, all sizes except yours are present. It comes when you foolishly wait until after Christmas to decide to hunt for tights or over the knee boots, and you re hard to fit. It tries to bubble up when you re at one side of a rack, going through it slowly, and another shopper is on the opposite end, going through the racks three times as fast as you are, their search seemingly heck bent on colliding with your search. It s usually evident when you re in the dressing room and the outfit you loved makes you look like a failed lounge lizard, but is subject to kick in earlier than that when you first look in the mirror and see the underwear clad body you thought had shed a few pounds. 
 
Clothing Clearance/Shoe Sale Rage . Think CSR magnified about 100 times, with 500 times as many fellow customers in your way. 
 
Get Your Car Serviced Rage . The main source of this rage is a given. It s not just the length of the wait ... having today s one step away from being those cartoon Transformers cars serviced or repaired can equal the gross national product of a small country, especially if you have to take your car to the dealership s service department. What really stokes GYCS rage, however, is when you go in for an oil change and the service adviser hunts you down in the waiting area and starts out with,  We noticed your transmission is slipping out of gear ... .  You know then that you re about to owe the equivalent of the gross national product of half the countries in South America. A possible mitigation source for this rage: A waiting room stocked with free coffee, cookies, popcorn, doughnuts and, considering how high your bill is, champagne and caviar. 
 
Pharmacy Rage . Are you fit to be tied, wondering just how long does it take to find the big bottle of pills, count them out into a little bottle and slap on a new label with the information they already have in their computer? A possible mitigation source: Thinking of what could happen to you if they were to get the prescription wrong. 
 
State Revenue Office Rage. Usually, just thinking about the state Revenue Office    the place we have to go to get our car licenses, car tags and driver s licenses bearing our less than flattering likenesses    is enough to cause rage. Forgetting we need to avoid the place on the first or last of the week/month or right before/after a holiday is like playing badminton with hand grenades ... go during those times and the very sight of one of those take a number machines is subject to set off you off. 
 
Bank Rage. Sources of BR are too long to list here, not the least of which is the fact that banks never seem to want to offer any free money samples.
