New York , United States – January 29, 2017 /PressCable/ 

ItsEasy.com, a leading provider of passport and visa expediting services founded by visionary David Alwadish in 1976, is revolutionizing the passport and visa expediting industry with their passport renewal app.

With the 10 year anniversary of the Western Hemisphere Initiative passed in 2007, requiring Americans to have a passport for air travel to and from Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean, the U.S. State Department expects to have approximately 16 million passport renewals in 2016 and 20 million in 2017 – an unprecedented amount. With the ItsEasy app, U.S. passport holders will have the power and convenience of facilitating their passport renewal process at their fingertips at any location – at home, at work, anywhere – with their iPhone/IPad and Android.

“This is truly an exciting time for ItsEasy. We’ve been working on this app for quite some time; perfecting it, adding new components to it and bettering it in general. I wanted to create an app that allowed U.S. passport holders to renew their passport with ease from their iPhone in a beneficial, secure, and easy way,” said David Alwadish, CEO and President of ItsEasy.com. “This is truly an app that all passport holders should have downloaded for free on their iPhones, and Androids. The app is more than a passport renewal app and includes other features such as passport photos, visa requirements, an emergency info button (for travelers who lose their passport or visa while in another country), and a passport renewal reminder feature that will remind users via email to renew their passport nine months before their passport expires.”

The free for download ItsEasy Passport Renewal App is safe, secure, confidential, user friendly, and is based upon the company’s exceptional 40 year reputation. The two primary features of the app include the ability of users to easily renew their passport, and their ability to take passport photos which are then reviewed and approved by qualified ItsEasy passport professionals. Travelers in need of only photos have the option to have their passport photos printed by ItsEasy and delivered by first class or overnight mail, or have them emailed electronically to be printed by the user.

When using the app, prior to the applicant’s passport renewal order being completed, and in addition to the Department of State’s passport fee, ItsEasy charges an honest fee of $29.95 for their services. Considering the value, the price is well worth the investment. The passport photo feature alone saves $10 $15 as well as the savings in time, travel and wait at the post office or drugstore for passport photos. Additionally, the app features trackable priority United States Postal Service shipping label a cost savings of approximately $6.45 and 24/7 customer support plus the peace of mind of knowing you used the correct forms and order status updates. Users are provided with the choice of two renewal processing time frames – standard approximately (6 to 8 week) and expedited (2 to 3 weeks.)

Once the order is completed through the app, ItsEasy will instantly email the customer the correct passport application to be printed and completed, a simple checklist and a secure trackable USPS priority shipping label to send the documents into ItsEasy for reviewing and processing. The professionals at ItsEasy will then deliver all necessary documents to the U.S. Department of State, who issues all passports and passport cards.

Alwadish added, “Why wouldn’t you want an app that saves you precious time and money? Between buying the envelope, postage, passport photos and running around for the errand, if the value of the users’ time saved is factored in then the savings would grow exponentially! We are providing you with peace of mind with government approved and regulated experts handling the entire process—including pre checking of documents, printing the photos, writing the check and gathering what you’d have to go buy yourself – you’re in safe hands and we can advise you every step of the way. I can confidently say that you’ll be aware of where your application is at all times.”

In addition to the 10 year anniversary of the Western Hemisphere Initiative approaching, creating the passport renewal surge, the U.S. Department of State also recently announced the elimination of visa page inserts for U.S. passports beginning this year. Previously, U.S. passport holders had the option to pay for the insertion of additional 24 page visa inserts when valid passports lacked adequate space for entry or exit visa stamps. However, now applicants in need of additional pages in their passports will have to obtain a renewal – making this app even more relevant for U.S. travelers.
