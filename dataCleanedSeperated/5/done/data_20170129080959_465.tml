Mark Johnston still remembers the first time he saw Camp McDowell. A high school friend invited him to a summer camp in its oasis of woods and streams in Nauvoo, at the edge of Winston County, and he immediately loved the place. 
 
And the Camp would later return the favor — Johnston recently celebrated his 26th year as its executive director. 
 
“What I remember more than the Camp, that first time, is the people,” Johnston says. “I was so young I couldn’t figure out why it was so empowering and freeing for me. The first person I met is still one of my best friends. When you’re off somewhere like that, separated from everything else, you build a whole new family here. And I was part of the family. In a most profound way, I began to discover who God was calling me to be.” 
 
Since that first visit, the family has grown to include some 50 full time staff members and more than 75 seasonal staff — some of whom first went to McDowell on camping trips when they were young — and the land has expanded from its original 160 acres to 1,140 acres of fields, forests, trails, canyons, waterfalls, and residential facilities with 770 beds. 
 
Founded in 1947 by the Episcopal Diocese of Alabama, the Camp has become a mecca of varied programs for visitors of all ages — two summer camp areas, a large conference center, the largest residential environmental center in the southeast, the first residential farm school in the Southeast, and the Alabama Folk School, to name just a few. Along the way it’s become the Episcopal camp and conference center with the largest capacity in the U.S. 
 
When Johnston was in school at the University of the South, Sewanee, he returned to work at the Camp each summer at a time when The Rev. Scott Eppes was camp director. “I couldn’t get enough of the place,” he says of those summers. “There was a farm, and I did maintenance work, a lot of work with cows, picked green beans and corn and dug potatoes and hauled pulpwood. All kinds of stuff, and it was really good for me. Working those summers continued to help me figure out who God was calling me to be.” 
 
After Sewanee he worked with programs for inner city children, and then decided to go to seminary at the university’s St. Luke’s School of Theology where he graduated with a Master’s in 1980. For several years he served at small churches along Alabama’s Black Belt and did youth work for the Episcopal Diocese and the National Episcopal Church, before becoming director of Camp McDowell. 
 
Learning in nature 
 
One of the most recent children’s programs the Camp has added is the state’s first Nature School for preschoolers, The Magnolia Nature Preschool for area residents. It’s an educational concept that has been popular in Europe and other parts of the United States for many years. The Magnolia Preschool recently entered into a partnership with Head Start so that more children can afford to attend. “A lot of us grew up playing in creeks and being outside all the time,” Johnston says, “but most kids don’t do that any more. 
 
“At the Nature School they spend almost all day outside, go to the farm, and play in the forest and the creeks. A lot of its lessons are about problem solving, cooperation, those kinds of things. Kids have lost connection with where their food comes from, so we’re teaching them about the science of farming and about nutrition. They’re also building relationships with each other, bonding with their teacher, and getting to know laying hens and goats and broccoli and carrots. They’ll graduate from the school ‘kindergarten ready.’” 
 
Another popular activity is the Alabama Folk School, which just marked its 10th year. Its goal is to preserve old time traditions of the state’s arts, crafts, and music. Workshops have ranged from the famous Gee’s Bend quilters to guitar, fiddle, drawing, cooking, writing, blacksmithing, dulcimer, and harmony singing, including Sacred Harp. 
 
“People have gotten out of touch with their art and heritage,” Johnston says, “so a lot of what the Folk School does is to build community and help people get back in touch with the art of creation and the Creator.” 
 
Another program is called Bethany’s Kids; it brings together handicapped and typical kids at a new, fully accessible summer camp style complex. A new grant from the Appalachian Regional Commission will allow McDowell to partner with Winston County Schools. “The kids will be coming here for farm ed,” Johnston says, “and we’ll be going to the schools and teaching student centered, inquiry based education. It’s the new science standard for teachers. Our teachers at the McDowell Environmental Center and Farm School have been using that means of instruction in our programming since we started. 
 
“We’ve really bonded with the teachers and the administration, and the main question is ‘Why didn’t this happen a long time ago?’ It’ll be great for people to get acquainted with us, instead of saying ‘I wonder what’s down there at the end of that road?’” 
 
New opportunities and initiatives seem to come about almost daily at the Camp. Solar panels are gradually being added, with the aim of reducing the facility’s carbon footprint. A recycling center for the camp is almost completed with a goal of the camp becoming zero landfill. 
 
But throughout the changes, Camp McDowell’s goal has stayed constant, Johnston says. “We have a wonderful community here that welcomes all people with love and joy. I believe in the future we will keep the creativity and the passion and the ability for the Camp to continue to be a place where dreams are fulfilled and a place where people learn who God is calling them to be. We want to make the world a better place. We want to show how the world could be.”
