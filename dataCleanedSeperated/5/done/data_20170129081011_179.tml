Arsenal have made it comfortably through to the last 16 of the FA Cup, following a 5 nil victory against League Cup finalists Southampton with Theo Walcott scoring a hat trick to go with Danny Welbeckâ€™s first half brace. 
 

 
Welbeck, starting for the first time since a knee injury in May, put the Gunners in control of the match with two neat finishes inside the first 22 minutes. 
 

 
The 26 year old striker then set up Walcott who gave Arsenal a 3 nil lead before halftime, with a simple close range strike. 
 

 
The Gunners, with manager Arsene Wenger watching from the stands due to a touchline ban, kept pressing for more goals after the break, and it paid off as Walcott completed his treble to help his side outclass Southampton at St Mary s.
