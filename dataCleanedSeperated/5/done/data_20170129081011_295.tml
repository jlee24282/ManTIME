<TITLE>Jim Alexander: Tammy Gambill’s coaching leaves nothing to chance</TITLE>
<TEXT>
RIVERSIDE  gt; gt; Tammy Gambill has been tutoring figure skaters for three decades, and she has coached champions in plenty of age group levels through the years. But never had she had a weekend quite like the last one. 
 
Karen Chen, a 17 year old, 4 foot 11 sprite from Fremont who trains under Gambill at Riverside Icetown, stunned the figure skating community by swiping the Ladies Senior gold at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships in Kansas City. 
 
The next night, Vincent Zhou, a 16 year old from Palo Alto via Icetown who won the national junior title three years ago as a 13 year old, finished second in the Men’s Senior competition to Nathan Chen, no relation to Karen. 
 
One more level crossed off. It may have been just a matter of time. 
 
“It is a building process,” said Gambill. “I guess that just means we’re on the right track. 
 
“It’s fun because now I’ve had every national champion: Juvenile boy and girl, intermediate boy and girl, novice boy and girl, junior boy and girl, and now senior girl. Karen is my first senior champion, so that makes it special, that elusive senior title. And Vincent was very close.” 
 
Which would make her, um, an overnight success? 
 
“Exactly,” she said with a laugh. “I’m an up and coming coach.” 
 
Gambill, a Redlands resident who declined to state her age but acknowledged her skaters now give her anniversary cards on her birthday — anniversaries of turning 39, get it? — grew up in the Sacramento area and was a good enough skater at 14 to leave home to train, much as her pupils now do. 
 
She began coaching in Stockton 30 years ago. 
 
“The Oak Park Ice Arena,” she recalled. “Then I moved down to Southern California, and had two kids and started coaching down here. My son (Matt) is now 27, so it was 27 years ago that I started down here.” 
 
Her first teaching gig in Southern California was in Palm Desert, at a long, skinny rink in the middle of the Town Center Mall — “called a hot dog rink,” she recalled. Her pupils there included Yorba Linda’s Sandy Rucker and Indio’s Dennis Phan; both went on to win age group national championships, Phan in 2003 and Rucker in 2005. 
 
She later began commuting from Redlands to Anaheim three times a week to teach on a bigger ice surface, and also used the Ice Castle international training center in Lake Arrowhead when it was still open. 
 
 
And then Icetown opened, in 1997, an easier commute with no need to navigate mountain roads. “Perfect,” she said. 
 
The accolades have accumulated over the years. Gambill was named the USOC Developmental Coach of the Year in 2005 — an honor that encompasses all sports — and has been similarly honored by U.S. Figure Skating and the Professional Skaters Association in 2005, 2012 and 2013. 
 
But it’s about her pupils, as it should be. She has coached world or national medalists Richard Dornbush, Shotaro Omori, Tyler Pierce and Caroline Zhang. 
 
Four of her skaters will be competing at either the world championships or world junior championships this year. Chen and Brendan Kerry of Australia will compete in the 2017 World Championships March 29 April 2 in Helsinki, Finland (and both will also compete in the Four Continents competition Feb. 15 in Gangneung, Korea, the site of next year’s Olympic competition). 
 
Meanwhile, Zhou and Yarrick Paniot of the Ukraine will compete in the World Junior Championships beginning March 15 in Tapiei City, Taiwan. Zhou will also be the first alternate for the U.S. at the Worlds should there be an injury. 
 
“I like it when they come in young and I can build them back up again,” Gambill said. “And it’s fun to get some of the older ones. Yaro (Paniot) just came in a couple of weeks ago. He’s super talented, so I’m very excited to see what I can do with him as well.” 
 
She has around 20 skaters total, and her preference is to have everyone on the ice together. She barks orders — her own description — and, along with assistant coach Ryan Berning, gives technical guidance. She doesn’t discourage the idea among her skaters that she has eyes in the back of her head, a fiction that works as long as she can see their reflections in the Plexiglas. 
 
And she listens as well as instructs. 
 
“I’ve been with her for three years now, and I feel like I really do love her as a coach,” Chen said. “She can be strict, but she’s definitely very understanding as well. She listens to my opinion. 
 
“It’s always been something I struggled with in my interaction with my coach, but I feel like I’m getting better. Sometimes if I’m having a bad day or my knee’s bothering me or something, it’s hard for me to speak up and tell her, because I feel like I want to give my 100 percent in training and I don’t want to let this affect anything ... (but) she’s let me know this: It’s important that if I’m not feeling 100 percent today I need to let her know, so she can make adjustments to my training and it’ll be beneficial for us both.” 
 
Chen is one of many skaters who have relocated from elsewhere specifically to train under Gambill. Her mother, Hsiu Hui Tseng, is with her and her younger brother Jeffrey, an ice dancer, in Southern California during the week while her husband, Chih Hsiu Chen, has stayed in the Bay Area. 
 
“I like the way she teaches kids,” Tseng said. “Sometimes you need to be strict. (But) she’s a coach you can communicate with. Some coaches won’t communicate with parents, but she’s willing to listen.” 
 
With more success, inevitably Gambill will field more calls from parents inquiring whether there is space for their prodigies. For the good ones, there will assuredly be room. 
 
“When I first started coaching I taught a little girl whose father was a farmer,” Gambill said. “And he made a statement to me that ‘when my crop is great, I’m the smartest farmer in the world. But when I have a bad crop, due to whatever reason, all of a sudden I’m a very stupid farmer.’ 
 
“It all depends on the crop you have at the time.” 
 
Of course, how well you cultivate it matters, too.
