<TITLE>Kuzma scores 18 points as Utah beats Oregon State, 86-78</TITLE>
<TEXT>
OR had its best chance since Kelly Graves was hired in 2014 to snap its Civil War losing streak. The Buffs controlled the game on the defensive end, holding the Ducks almost 15 points under their season average as well as on the offensive end, becoming just the third school this season to score over 70 points on their defense.  I m not sure if we could have won that game without him tonight . 
 
This year s Oregon Ducks (14 6, 4 4 Pac 12) have struggled with maintaining consistency throughout much of the season. 
 
 I think that s the Colorado basketball team we all know and love that showed up tonight , head coach Tad Boyle said. 
 
The first half would be a play from behind battle. He hit a 3 pointer, finished a three point play after being fouled on a tough layup and found George King with a handsome pass that led to another three point play and a 62 52 CU lead. 
 
Since Collette s return, he s been limited by fouls   an area he said he s trying to improve   but has been on the mark in his offensive game.  We can play better , Zamora said. 
 
Ionescu led the Ducks in scoring with 14 points and six rebounds . Brooks finished with 9 points. 
 
For a while, his stroke of madness seemed to work well enough as the Buffs gained an early lead on the Beavers, but the visitors weren t ready to turn over easily. Utah went on to double OSU s point total, 30 15, following a Kuzma dunk. 
 
Four early turnovers has OR down 14 8 to Colorado. 
 
The Ducks played before 4,370 fans, the largest crowd at Matthew Knight Arena since Graves was hired. 
 
The CU Independent will have a full game report after the game ends . 
 
 The key is not letting teams run, keeping them in the quarter court, defending like insane and being extremely efficient offensively , said Rueck. 
 
The Beavers seized control with an 11 0 run in the third quarter to take a 33 23 lead. 
 
The Utes also get contributions from senior guard Lorenzo Bonam (135 points, 3.4 rebounds , 3 assists ), freshman forward Devon Daniels (11.5 points, 4.7 rebounds , 2.6 assists ) and sophomore guard Sedrick Barefield (11.3 points). 
 
 [Games] go up and down, but keeping the lead we felt pretty comfortable , Collette said.  That s OK because we can change it up . Each has 144 points in eight Pac 12 games. 
 
Oregon State coach Scott Rueck said both teams should be proud of their defensive efforts. 
 
 There is a reason to be up for every weekend, certainly this weekend, without question being Civil War, but I could have told you lots of reasons to be excited about the weekend before that and so on , Rueck said.  It definitely had a rivalry feel .  We were never ready to play and that s on me . Graves said he wants his team to attack the post more on Sunday. 
 
 Credit the defense, they just walled up and made us shoot over top of them ... and we didn t handle it well , Graves said.  We ll get a little creative . 
 
 This whole year has been a learning process for us .  You ve got to play 40 minutes, you can t play 36, 37, 38 minutes and unfortunately that hurts at the end .
