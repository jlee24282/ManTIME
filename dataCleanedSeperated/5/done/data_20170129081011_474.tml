Imagine spending the day shopping with your little ones and all you want to do is to relax and unwind. The Food Fundi Coffee Cafe is a great place to make a stop.   Where gourmet food on the go is prepared    
From humble beginnings, the eatery has grown to be listed as one the top 500 restaurants in South Africa. 
 
“It’s your lucky day girl,” says Melanie Reeder Powell as she welcomes me. “You know, we received the news that we are recognised as one of the best restaurants on Eat Out. I wasn’t even aware when the food critique was here but boom, that’s how it was.” 
 
Qualified chef, Jason Powell and his wife, can attest to people’s perception of the cafe specifically catering for health gurus, as this is not the case. Melanie tells us more: 
 
What is The Food Fundi all about? 
Funny enough, most people who are not familiar with the place often think our food is for diabetics. However, it is home made, wholesome and we offer health options as well. Our food is freshly made and our products are not injected with brine. The menu is quite extensive and it changes seasonally. In short, we offer gourmet food on the go.

Take us through your journey 
We have come a long way! It all started at Absa Square, with a very tiny set up and six years later, we’ve grown and moved to a friendlier environment allowing us to accommodate more people. My husband has travelled and cooked in most parts of the world for famous people including Nelson Mandela and his wife, Graca, while they were in Mozambique with limited resources. There is also a Food Fundi Express at the Lowveld Hospital that offers a limited menu for patients, visitors and locals. 
 
Who is your clientele? 
It ranges from a mix of groups. Mothers, the young and upcoming, couples and gym fanatics who usually come from across the street after a workout. The set up at this centre is child friendly as well. It is your one stop shop. 
 
What distinguishes you from the rest? 
We offer something different and I believe our clients are able to taste the difference in our food. Our bread is home baked by our pastry chef, Antoneitte. We source our products from local suppliers and our packaging is recyclable. We are the only restaurant in Mpumalanga that serves wine and craft beer on tap, and we also offer a selective wine list that is affordable.
