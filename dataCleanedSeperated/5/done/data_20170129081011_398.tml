<TITLE>Kim Kardashian West's daily workouts</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Kim Kardashian West works out every day for an hour. 
 
Although the 36 year old reality TV star works hard to stay in shape, she doesn t usually document her regime on social media like her sisters Khloe and Kourtney Kardashian. 
 
She told her Snapchat followers:  I never Snapchat my workouts, just because... I don t know why   I m just not Kourtney and Khloe. But it s like, if I don t Snap it, then it s as if it never happened. But I work out every single day for over an hour.  
 
And Khloe, 32, who regularly posts videos of her own training sessions and even give tips to her followers on her website KhloewithaK.com, admitted that she and Kim often exercise together but never get around to sharing videos of their joint workouts. 
 
Khloe said:  Kim and I had a really good workout, but for some reason we re not good at Snapchatting our workouts. But just so you know, we killed it.  
 
Khloe shed 40lbs after splitting from Lamar Odom in 2013 after four years of marriage and recently said:  I really needed an outlet mentally. 
 
 I started working out, and the clarity I received from that was so needed, and it was so therapeutic, and as a by product I started losing weight. 
 
 I was like,  Oh, OK, I see a little definition somewhere. Let me try keep this up. Then I got a trainer, and a few months later, a nutritionist. 
 
 My journey has been a long one, but it s a lifestyle change. I m not trying to lose 30 pounds in 30 days to prove a point. I want this to be for the rest of my life.
