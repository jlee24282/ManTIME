<TEXT>
PNN/ Jenin/ 
 
A Palestinian teenager was killed and five others were injured in clashes that broke out after Israeli Occupation Forces (IOF) stormed Jenin refugee camp, Sunday morning. 
 
Local sources said that the events started after a large number of Israeli troops infiltrated into the camp from different sides. 
 
19 year old Mohamed Abu Khalifa died of a severe bullet injury and five others were also wounded one of them seriously, during the skirmishes, the sources added. 
 
They also said that some soldiers were injured during armed clashes with resistance fighters in the camp. 
 
A few days ago, an Israeli military force stormed the house of Abu Khalifa in the camp and kidnapped his uncles Mohamed and Ahmed Abu Khalifa. 
 
They also ransacked other homes and brutalized local residents during that campaign.
