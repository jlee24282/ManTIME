<TITLE>Americans should choose strength over power</TITLE>
<TEXT>
The craving for absolute power and the fear of it both represent a preoccupation with an illusion, because power is never absolute. Any power that can be destroyed, if only by itself, is vulnerable, but power that cannot destroy itself is obviously limited. 
 
The defining quality of the American spirit — with its traditional sympathy for the underdog — is its ability to recognize that strength is greater than power. America will either unite around that principle or else not at all.
