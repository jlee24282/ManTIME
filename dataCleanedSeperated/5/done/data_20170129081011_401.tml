<TITLE>Prep hockey: Warriors fill void, fill net in 8-1 victory</TITLE>

WATERLOO — When leading scorer Kyle Schott went down with an injury to start the new year, the Waterloo Warriors needed somebody to step up.

Saturday afternoon, the entire team took the lead as seven players scored goals in an 8 1 Midwest High School Hockey League rout of Dubuque at Young Arena.

Ben Sinnott got it started 9 minutes, 22 seconds into the first period when he finished off a Dylan Stech slapshot. Then, with just over a minute left in the period, Carter Herbst delivered a top shelf blast from the blue line that found its mark for a 2 0 lead.

“Herbs’ shot was pretty sweet. That one was wild,” said Waterloo senior Cade Saeugling.

The Warriors were far from done finding nylon. In the second period, Nick Samuelson, Jake Beal, Kole Latusik and Saeugling connected to set the six goal continuous clock rule into effect for the remainder of the contest.

Jaxon Doland added two goals in the third period to cap the Warriors’ offensive assault.

Defensively, Waterloo’s Dawson Sturch held a clean sheet through most of the game, making a fantastic 1 on 1 glove save with eight minutes to go. He finally gave up a goal with :26 remaining.

Sturch and the Waterloo defense held the Devils to just 14 shots on goal while the Warriors unloaded 48 on the Dubuque net.

“We had an overpowering offense tonight,” said Waterloo coach Brian Cook. “We just kept it in their zone and worked the puck so much and when we did have a letdown on defense we recovered really quickly.”

Losing Schott has brought out a little more in a lot of the Warriors.

“I think it made us work as a team more,” said Sauegling. “We relied on that one person a lot, but once he went down we had to rely on everyone and we’ve done that.”

The Warriors have won four games in a row without the Columbus senior.

“Once we get Schott back we’ll hopefully be poised to have a good shot at the state tournament this year,” said Cook. “I think we’ve shown that we’re not a one man team, especially with our goaltending and secondary scoring and that will help out even more when we get him back.”
