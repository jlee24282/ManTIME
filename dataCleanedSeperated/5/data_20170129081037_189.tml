BERKELEY, CALIF.:  The Pepperdine men’s tennis team fell to Cal Poly in a close 4 3 battle at the Hellman Tennis Complex to close out the ITA Kick Off Weekend, hosted by No. 3 California.  The Waves fell in doubles action and then eventually dropped a tough 4 3 match to the Mustangs. 

The Waves dropped the doubles point, but rallied back to tie the dual at 3 3 with the sixth court still in action.  Freshman  Dane Esses  (Houston, Texas/Memorial HS) played tough for the clinch, winning the first set 6 4 before falling in the second 4 6.  He and his opponent, Axel Damiens went point for point to a tie break third set, but the opposition had the advantage and edged Esses out with a 7 6 (5) final. 

In doubles action, Waves’ two’s pair senior Guilherme Hadlich ( Balneário Camboriú, Brazil/Colégio Energia ) and sophomore Gabriel Sidney ( Curitiba, Parana, Brazil/Anglo Americano ) picked up the first Waves’ win of the morning with a commanding 6 1 victory over 53 rd  ranked Timothy Tan and Garrett Auproux.  

 Cal Poly’s 21 st  ranked Corey Pang and Ben Donovan then countered with a 6 2 win on court one over  senior Stefan Menichella ( Santa Barbara, Calif./University HS) and sophomore Jack Van Slyke (Toronto, Ontario, Canada/Laurel Springs HS (Calif.)). 

On court three, Esses and junior Pedro Iamachkine (Lima, Peru/Nebraska HS) were going head to head Antoine Noel and Karl Enander to the 5 5 mark, but the Mustangs eventually took the next two games for the 7 5 win. 

With the 1 0 advantage heading into singles, both teams were looking to get some quick singles wins.  The Mustangs struck first, collecting wins on courts four and two to go up 3 0 on the day.  

Pepperdine’s number one single, Hadlich, faced off with 45 th  ranked Ben Donovan, downing the Cal Poly player with a pair of 6 4 sets to start closing the gap.  Iamachkine as the next Wave to take his singles match, felling Auproux in three sets, 6 3, 5 7, 6 3 on court three. 

Van Slyke then tied the match for the Waves, 3 3, with a 6 2, 2 6, 6 0 win over Antoine Noel to put all eyes on court six and Esses for the close bout. 

Next, the Waves return home to Malibu to host Washington at 12 p.m. on February 5 at Ralphs Straus Tennis Center.  Follow @PeppTennis on Facebook and Twitter for immediate updates and go to PepperdineWaves.com for full recaps, results and more.
