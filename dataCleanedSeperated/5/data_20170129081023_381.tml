The Kingdom of Tonga is located just east of the international date line: thus it’s said, that Tonga is ‘the place where time begins’. Blue bays, vibrant reefs, sparkling beaches and ancient stone temples will fascinate you. It is one of world’s top destinations for snorkeling and diving. Get enchanted by the unspoiled nature of the South Pacific paradise. Book your flights and enjoy the stunning natural beauty, spectacular sights and the lush landscapes! Tonga has a year round tropical climate. From November to April temperatures and humidity tend to be higher, especially in the lush tropical rainforests of the northern islands. From May to October the climate is generally milder and drier. 
 
On Samoa you’ll find some of the South Pacific’s best and most pristine beaches, friendly people, flower filled villages and a pace of life that stands out as slow even in this region. Meet face to face with multicoloured coral and other marine life. Some of the beaches are so stunning that they might give you an idea what heaven looks like. Walk around the shallow waters of Samoa’s lovely lagoons or expolore the wild interior of the island.
