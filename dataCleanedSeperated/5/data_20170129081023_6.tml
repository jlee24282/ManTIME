During their high octane performance of   Remix ,  Donnie Wahlberg deviated from the group s synchronized dance number and went into the photo pit where he danced with a few lucky fans in the front row. 
 
The group    comprised of brothers Jordan and Jonathan Knight , Joey McIntyre ,   Wahlberg, and Danny Wood    were introduced by actress Candace Cameron Bure , whose 30 year dream came true when NKOTB appeared on the Netflix revival, Fuller House , for a collaborative sing and dance performance of   You Got It (The Right Stuff) .   
   
Ahead of their performance, NKOTB did a Facebook Live with iHeartRadio during which they played with the world s largest etch a sketch, remembered  80s dance moves over a Simon game, signed Connect Four pieces, and talked about dating in the  80s versus dating in the social media age.  
 
When Jonathan was asked to compare his past relationship with  80s icon Tiffany during a time when social media was nonexistent, to Selena Gomez and The Weeknd  s romance that is being chronicled 24/7 on Twitter and Instagram, he said:   I think everything back in the  80s was so much easier. I mean now everywhere you go, you re being filmed, you re being watched ... Everything s on a phone and you just pull it out.  
  
NKOTB are set to headline their Total Package tour this summer featuring musical guests Boyz II Men and Paula Abdul , who will hit the road for the first time in 25 years. The trek launches on May 12 with a show at the Schottenstein Center in Columbus, Ohio and will run through July 16 with a concert at Hard Rock Live in Hollywood, Florida. 
 
The iHeart80s bill also featured Reagan era acts including UB40 , Men at Work s Colin Hay , Starship , Eddie Money , Night Ranger , and headliner Rick Astley .
