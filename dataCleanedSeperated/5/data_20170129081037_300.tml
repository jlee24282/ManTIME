<TITLE>DSS invites Suleman for inciting comment… To appear in company of 30 lawyers</TITLE>
<TEXT>
The Department of State Services (DSS) has invited Apostle Johnson Suleman, general overseer   of Omega Fire Ministries Worldwide, to its headquarters in Abuja. 
 
The cleric is expected to appear before the secret police by 10am on Monday and is to be quizzed regarding recent inciting comments credited. 
 
In a related development, Phrank Shaibu, communication adviser to the pastor, confirmed the invitation, saying he would honour it. 
 
“Yes, I can confirm to you that he (Suleman) was officially invited and as a law abiding citizen, he will honour the DSS invitation on Monday,” PUNCH quoted Shaibu as saying. 
 
“The invitation, though ludicrous and an afterthought, is a welcome development.” 
 
“Suleman will be appearing before the DSS with about 30 lawyers because we believe that his persecution has become politicised,” the source reportedly said. 
 
The agency invited the fiery cleric after its bid to arrest him failed. 
 
Earlier in the week, DSS operatives trailed him to the hotel where he lodged after a crusade in Ekiti state, but Suleman quickly reached out to Ayodele Fayose, governor of Ekiti, who intervened on his behalf. 
 
Barely two weeks ago, the controversial pastor was reported to have ordered his security aides to kill “any Fulani herdsman that comes into his church premises.” 
 
He said this on the back of information received on a plot to assassinate him.
