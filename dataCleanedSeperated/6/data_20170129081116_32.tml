<TITLE>Polish City to Give Tom Hanks the Car That Put It on the Auto Map</TITLE>
<TEXT>
The Maluch, built in Bielsko Biala from the early 1970s to 2000, has developed a following that apparently includes at least one prominent fan. 
 
Tom Hanks is a fan of the Polish made Maluch, so he s getting one shipped to him with an invitation to visit Bielsko Biala.
