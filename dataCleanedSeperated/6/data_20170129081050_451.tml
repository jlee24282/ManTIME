<TITLE>Colorado beats No. 10 Oregon 74-65, ends Ducks' streak at 17</TITLE>
<TEXT>
BOULDER, Colo. Derrick White scored 17 of his 23 points in the second half, keying Colorado s 74 65 upset of No. 10 Oregon that snapped the Ducks  17 game winning streak on Saturday night. 
 
Xavier Johnson added 13 points as the Buffaloes (12 10, 2 7 Pac 12) kept the Ducks winless in seven trips all time in Boulder. 
 
Payton Pritchard s 19 points led the Ducks (19 3, 8 1), who lost for the first time since Nov. 21 against Georgetown. 
 
White had a pair of 3 pointers early in the second half that put the Buffaloes ahead 45 39 while Colorado s stifling defense was keeping the Ducks out of rhythm at the other end of the court. And he had a 3 pointer, a three point play and two free throws in an 11 1 run that gave Colorado a 64 52 lead. 
 
The Buffs are just the third team to top 70 points against the Oregon this season.
