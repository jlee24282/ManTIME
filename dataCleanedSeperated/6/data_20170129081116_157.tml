<TITLE>Matt Suckling keen but careful about return to Bulldog defence</TITLE>

If dual premiership player Matt Suckling struggles to make the early part of the AFL season it won t be for any lack of work or dedication throughout the arduous and testing summer months. 
 
Speaking from the Sunshine Coast  where the club is in the final stages of a pre season camp, the 28 year old admitted that he was on a  specific program to prevent any recurrence of  the  Achilles injury that cruelly prevented him from being a part of three AFL flags in a row.

The long and penetrating left footer, who left Hawthorn at the end of 2015   for a new start at the Bulldogs, said he and the club had been understandably cautious  during his pre season preparation. 
 
 The Achilles put me back a little bit. I started running just after Christmas and just working through that at the moment. It s a lot of hard work at the moment but looking good,  Suckling said from the Sunshine Coast. 
 
 I suppose when you do get injured you always worry that it s going to happen again but that s why probably over the break you put in so much effort and so much work so you can come back and it won t let you down again.  
 
 It s certainly a lot harder (with the heat) and sessions have been really hard but the boys love getting up here because a few boys like getting a tan so they re very happy with that,  Suckling said. 
  
The Western Bulldogs left last Wednesday for the annual pre season camp and returned late on Sunday night. 
 
And Suckling, who originally was recruited from the Wagga Tigers by Hawthorn, scoffed at suggestions that his missed flag opportunity was being used as a pre season source of motivation. 
 
 Not really. Every pre season you want that (success),  Suckling said. 
 
 Seeing the boys do it last year doesn t make me any hungrier, that s why you play footy, that s why you keep turning up and working hard each day.  
 
Suckling who left Hawthorn as unrestricted free agent at the end of 2015 only played 17 games with the dogs, having already clocked up 102 games with the Hawks. 
 
The Bulldogs will clash with Melbourne in the opening game of the pre season competition at Whitten Oval on February 18.
