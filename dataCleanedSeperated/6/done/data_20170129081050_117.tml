<TITLE>Proteas netballers heartbreak as they lose to England</TITLE>
<TEXT>
:10am The Protea netballers came within a whisker of claiming their biggest scalp since 1995 as they ended regulation time on level terms with England before going down 60 55 in extra time after a gutsy display in the Quad Series in Durban. 
 
South Africa erased a 10 point deficit after half time as they steamrolled their way to a one point lead shortly before the final whistle only to see England level the scores. 
 
England ultimately dealt better with the pressure during the added 14 minutes as they outscored South Africa 12 7. 
 
Playing in front of a vociferous and packed arena, the Proteas made a promising start to their return match against the England Roses but as in the previous game they dropped the intensity to allow the visitors back into the game. 
 
It was a case of deja vu as the Proteas grabbed an initial three point lead but squandered the advantage thanks to some sloppy play in the middle of the court. 
 
South Africa’s lead lasted all of 11 minutes before the English levelled the scores on 8 8 with the visitors then taking control. 
 
The second quarter belonged to England as they ran into the right spaces and quickly added to their score. 
 
The Proteas on the other hand could not convert their chances into points as goal attack Renske Stoltz and goalkeeper Lenize Potgieter (pictured, with ball) experienced some nervous moments with their shots at goal. 
 
Stoltz, who made her national debut against New Zealand in 2016, succeeded with only 40 percent of her attempts in the first quarter while Potgieter’s aim was slightly better with 66 percent. 
 
South Africa only managed to add seven points in the second quarter while the English scored 17 times to give them a 10 point lead going into half time. 
 
Wing attack Izette Lubbe replaced Proteas captain Bongi Msomi in the second quarter for what seemed like a tactical move. 
 
At that stage it looked like the Roses would be running away with the game as was the case in the previous match in Melbourne which they won 57 44. 
 
Like a bolt out of the blue, though,South Africa found an extra set of legs as they scored goals in quick succession following the half time break. 
 
Replacing Stoltz, goal attack Lindie Lombard added a sense of urgency in the frontline as South Africa blitzed to a 8 1 goal advantage in the first five minutes of the third quarter. 
 
Playing with greater confidence and aggression, South Africa looked more organised and more intent than they did in the first half hour of the match. 
 
Going into the final quarter South Africa were feeling bullish as they trailed England by just four points (38 34) and they continued their resurgence in the last 15 minutes. 
 
South Africa surged forward as they enforced the stalemate with 10 minutes left in the quarter before grabbing the lead for the first time since the opening moments of the match. 
 
Holding on to a slender lead, South Africa had to keep a defiant England at bay as the final minutes of the game turned into a tit for tat battle as the lead changed a few times up until the final seconds. 
 
Facing the prospect of only their second victory over England in 22 years, South Africa buckled under the pressure in extra time as they saw the tourists move past them to deny them a piece of history.
