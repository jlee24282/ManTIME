<TITLE>Eicher Polaris Multix First Drive</TITLE>
<TEXT>
In today s time and age, multi tasking is the name of the game. Nowadays multi tasking is an absolute pre requisite in anything you do, anywhere you go. A simple example would be that of the smartphone. 10 12 years ago, you had a mobile phone to make calls, an iPod to carry your music around and a camera to click pictures. The smartphone does it all and how. Something similar was brewing in the minds of the boffins at Eicher Polaris Pvt Ltd. and the result of that brainwave was the Eicher Polaris Multix. The Multix is a 3 in 1 vehicle, which can comfortably seat 5 people, carry up to 20 sacks of flour, couldn t be bothered less by bad roads and can double up as a generator as well, (Yep! It can, thanks to the optional  X Port  attachment that can generate up to 3 kW of electricity).

Our test vehicle was a bright yellow, which more than made up for the lack of sunshine on that day. The design is fairly simple, with the plastic body panels are mounted on a steel tubular frame, in the shape of a breadbox with a cargo bay. It looks like a really small pick up truck. The looks are rather cute and the Multix definitely stands out when on the road. Yes! The Multix is road legal. At least the BS IV compliant variants are.

The Multix is powered by a locally sourced 510cc single cylinder Greaves diesel engine which churns out 9.8 bhp@3,000rpm and 27 Nm@1,400 2,200rpm. The engine is mated to a 4 speed manual transmission. The claimed efficiency is an astonishing 28.45 kmpl. Now, once you start up the engine, there is the familiar clatter of a diesel engine which hits you right away but cabin itself is vibe free and the NVH levels are not deafening either.

As you engage the first gear and press the throttle, you get the surge of the torque right away. This little machine was meant to pull load and the torquey motor suggests that it is more than capable. The Multix was designed to amble around at decent speeds of 35 55 kmph rather than clipping it on the road. The power is delivered to the rear wheels in a smooth manner, which makes driving the Multix, a good experience. Thanks to the tight dimensions, the Multix has a turning radius of less than 4 metres and handles decently enough.
