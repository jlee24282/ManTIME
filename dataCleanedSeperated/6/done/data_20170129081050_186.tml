<TITLE>Bulgaria's Interim Govt 'Preparing to Cut Business Fees'</TITLE>
<TEXT>
The caretaker cabinet of Bulgaria ponders a move to cut administrative fees paid by businesses, daily 24 Chasa reports, citing sources. 
 
The move will help save tens of millions in expenses and will be aimed at putting an end to alleged violations on behalf of the Registry Agency, according to the sources. 
 
The law requires for the fees to cover only costs the administration bears for services. 
 
Interim Prime Minister Ognyan Gerdzhikov hinted at the move on Friday, telling the Bulgarian National Television s weekly show Panorama that such a measure would help small and medium enterprises.
