<TITLE>Boyfriend clutches struggling partner as she dangles from third...</TITLE>
<TEXT>
A boyfriend desperately gripped his partner as she struggled against him while dangling from a third floor window in Boston.

Police officers scaled three sets of stairs and forced their way into a flat to help the man to calm his girlfriend down.

PC Hayley Abraham stayed outside of the building and tried to talk to the woman from the street while PC Iain Bushell grabbed hold of the woman s partner, who was struggling to maintain his balance, to act as an anchor. Constable Abraham eventually joined her colleague in the building and took over communication with the woman managing to calm her down and get her to move to a safer position where they were able to pull her back into the flat.

PC Sean Hanley, who was also communicating to the woman in the flat, then took the boyfriend away in a bid to reassure him after the woman had been pulled in to safety on March 23, 2016.

The three officers were honoured with the Chief Constable s Commendation at a special event held by Lincolnshire Police on Thursday, January 26.

Chief Constable Neil Rhodes said:  When police officers are sent to a scene it is always a unique set of circumstances that they find.

 It is up to them to interpret what s happening use their skills to best resolve or diffuse the situation. In this case the officers  actions were exemplary.

 The outcome could have been very different without their calm, determined, assertive handling of the situation. They are a credit to the force.
