<TITLE>Late steal seals Crowder victory at Jefferson</TITLE>
<TEXT>
HILLSBORO, Mo. â€” Crowder s defense made the game clinching play as the Lady  Riders held on to beat Jefferson 73 72 Saturday afternoon in NJCAA Region 16 women s basketball action. 
 
The Riders (5 18, 2 2 Region 16) led 40 34 at halftime and 57 48 after three quarters. Jefferson battled back in the final 10 minutes and had possession, down one point with 3.2 seconds to play. 
 
However, Crowder s Michaela Mack deflected the inbounds pass, and Brooke Sagely scooped up the ball and held it as time expired. 
 
Crowder suited only seven healthy players, and all seven contributed to the scoring. 
 
Tori Coulter, who hit four 3 point goals, and Zahria White both scored 12, followed by Coley Ickes and Mack with 11 apiece and Sagely with 10. Nine points by Morgan Crawford and eight by Kadesha Cooper completed the scoring. 
 
White also grabbed 10 rebounds for a double double, and Sagely had eight boards. Cooper and Ickes dished out four assists apiece, and Mack made three steals. 
 
Alexian Collie and Dominique Jennings each had 11 for Jefferson. 
 
The Riders are home at 6 p.m. Wednesday against Moberly.
