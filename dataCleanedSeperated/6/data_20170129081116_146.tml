<TITLE>Lewiston's pact with Cable One expires at the end of December</TITLE>
<TEXT>
The 15 year nonexclusive franchise agreement allowing Cable One to operate in Lewiston expires this December. 
 
The agreement gives the city 5 percent of gross revenue, which has equaled about $220,000 in recent years, compared with the city s overall budget of about $64 million, said Lewiston Administrative Services Director Dan Marsh. 
 
It also requires Cable One to provide programming in eight broad categories, but doesn t specify what the channels are. 
 
The categories are news, weather, sports, entertainment, children s shows, education, cultural programming of local interest and governmental programming. 
 
The number of channels is  no less that the number of channels provided  by Cable One at the start of the agreement. 
 
It s not clear how happy Lewiston residents are with service from Cable One. City officials last week were unable to find the results of subscriber surveys that are required by the agreement once every five years. 
 
What Cable One offers has been evolving in recent years. The company dropped Viacom channels such as MTV in 2014. It is not carrying KAYU FOX because of a disagreement over retransmission fees. 
 
Cable One has stated previously it has no intention of leaving the cable business, but it has told stock market analysts it s putting its emphasis on pursuing high speed internet customers. 
 
It s too early to know if Lewiston s elected officials will view negotiating a new contract as an opportunity to influence how Cable One approaches the Lewiston market, said Lewiston Mayor Jim Kleeburg. 
 
Whatever direction Lewiston goes would likely involve cooperation with the city of Clarkston and Asotin County. 
 
Those municipalities have similar agreements with Cable One, but they end at different times. Clarkston s runs through 2019, and Asotin County s ends in either 2023 or 2024 (the current contract lists both years). 
 
Were a company other than Cable One to seek to serve the Lewiston Clarkston Valley, it would likely have to acquire the cable provider s infrastructure, said Joe Poire, executive director of the Port of Whitman County, who spent 11 years in the cable industry. 
 
The public telecommunications network being constructed by the ports of Lewiston and Clarkston wouldn t have the capacity to serve a new company without significant investment that goes beyond what s contemplated, Poire said. 
 
No law requires communities to be served by cable companies, according to the Federal Communications Commission, which regulates the industry. 
 
But the chances of the Lewiston Clarkston Valley ending up without cable services are low, regardless of what happens in the telecommunications industry, Poire said. 
 
 The ... market is big enough it s a viable asset.
