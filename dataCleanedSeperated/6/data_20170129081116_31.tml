<TITLE>Wild boar injures three in Berlin rampage</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Berlin: A wild boar has gone on a rampage in a northern Berlin park, causing minor injuries to three people before being shot dead by police. 
 
A sounder of boars showed up near the city s Tegel Airport about 2pm on SaturdayÂ before one of the male boars moved away from the group to a nearby park, local police said. 
 
The boar then proceeded to attack a number of people, injuring a woman on her leg as well as two other men. 
 
Police shot the animal dead, in order to prevent it from injuring any further passers by. By that stage, the rest of the animals had already moved on, police said. 
 
Meanwhile, in the western German city of Siegen, a wild boar disrupted traffic and smashed down the front door of a hairdressing salon on Saturday. 
 
The animal was also eventually shot dead by the authorities.
