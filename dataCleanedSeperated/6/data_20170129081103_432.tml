<TITLE>Several legislative committees yet to meet</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Four weeks in and there are still eight committees in the House and Senate that haven’t even met once – Senate Elections, Senate Natural Resources, Senate Public Policy, House Commerce, House Employment and Labor, House Natural Re­sources, House Public Policy and House Interstate and International Cooperation. Several of the committees yet to hear a bill are led by new chairmen.

Rep. Ben Smaltz, R Auburn, was appointed to run House Public Policy in November and said that late appointment caused a delay.

He said usually bill authors would be running ideas and concepts past chairmen over the summer and working to draft the bills in a clean form.

“I had to take an extra deep dive on issues that I feel responsible for,” Smaltz said. “These are very weighty issues that deserve a lot of effort.”

Senate President Pro Tem David Long, R Fort Wayne, also said the first few weeks have been complicated by other events.

The State of the State and State of the Judiciary addresses occur every year. But there was also an inauguration of a new governor as well as Vice President Mike Pence, which resulted in several missed session days.

“We really didn’t get traction until this week,” Long said. “We will see all the committees in action in the near future.”

He noted there is still time for them to have three or four meetings before the first deadline of the session. Ultimately work has to be wrapped up by April 29.

Fort Wayne native Marc Lotter has been named special assistant to President Donald Trump and press secretary to Vice President Mike Pence.

Lotter is among five people from Indiana whose appointments to the Trump Pence administration were announced Wednesday.

Lotter, a 1988 graduate of Snider High School, was deputy campaign manager for Pence’s gubernatorial re election campaign last year, then became national press secretary for Pence after Indiana’s then governor became Trump’s running mate.

He previously was director of external communications for the Indiana State Board of Education, communications director for Indi­anapo­lis Mayor Greg Ballard, communications director in the first term of Gov. Mitch Daniels and press secretary for Daniels’ first campaign for governor.

Three people who had worked for Pence when he was governor were named Wednesday to his Washington staff: Zach Bauer, Kara Brooks and Lani Czarniecki.

Bauer is special assistant to Pence; Brooks is deputy assistant to Pence and communications director for Karen Pence; and Czarniecki is the vice president’s deputy assistant for external affairs.

Matt Morgan was appointed Pence’s deputy assistant and deputy counsel. Morgan was a partner in the In­di­anapo­lis office of law firm Barnes  amp; Thornburg and counsel to Pence’s gubernatorial re election campaign.

Churubusco Clerk Treasurer Madalyn Sade Bartl has been elected chairwoman of the 3rd Congressional District Democratic Party.

Sade Bartl defeated Steuben County Democratic Chairwoman Judy Rowe by a 13 6 vote taken Sunday in Bluffton in a special caucus of county Democratic chairs and vice chairs.

Sade Bartl replaces Carmen Darland, who resigned this month after eight years as district chairwoman. Sade Bartl will stand for re election at the party’s March reorganization caucus.

Sade Bartl had been the Democrats’ treasurer. Allen County resident Benjamin Johnson ran unopposed Sunday to replace her.

Johnson works at the General Motors pickup assembly plant in southwest Allen County and is a member of the executive board of United Auto Workers Local 2209.

The 3rd District is a heavily Republican region consisting of 10 counties in northeast Indiana and parts of two other counties.

Sade Bartl, 35, said Monday in a telephone interview that she wants to increase community outreach efforts by Democrats and better recognize the party’s volunteers.

“The volunteer hours are what win campaigns,” she said. “I think making our volunteers feel more appreciated is something that I really want to start doing.”

Darland, who said she announced last April that she would resign after the November general election, will remain vice chair of the Noble County Democratic Party and co chair of the Indiana Democratic Party’s Emerging Leaders Project.

The Indiana House of Representatives is No. 1, according to the American Conservative Union Foundation.

The group congratulated the 100 members of the House – 70 Republicans and 30 Democrats – for leading the country in the effort to enact conservative policy solutions in the 2016 session.

ACU will award the members of the Indiana House our “Most Conservative House of Representatives” Award at a conference in February.

The award is given to the representative chamber with the most conservative score in the country. Indiana’s House received a 75 percent conservative rating. Indiana’s Senate ranked third overall, with an average of 69 percent.
