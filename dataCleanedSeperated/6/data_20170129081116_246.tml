<TEXT>
The lift of sanctions on Sudan by the former US President, Barak Obama has many advantages. The breakthrough has left the newly inaugurated President Donald Trump to complete the process of bringing Khartoum back. 
  
The lift of sanctions on Sudan by the former US President, Barak Obama has many advantages. The breakthrough has left the newly inaugurated President Donald Trump to complete the process of bringing Khartoum back. 

In addition to the economic gains, the decision will lead to full normalization of the Sudanese US relations and pave the way for firm Sudanese European ties and Sudan s ties with the international community. 

The action was long overdue because Sudan has nothing to do with US baseless accusations. The American Administration has come to conclusion that Sudan has a pivotal political and economic status in the region and in the international arena so the move is indispensable amid the changing world. 

Sudan has made no compromise for the lift of sanctions. Sudan has managed to overstep the impacts of the unfair economic sanctions unilaterally imposed by US. 
President Al Bashir has initiated national dialogue to resolve national issues peacefully by engagement of both political and armed groups. The move was appreciated and recognized by international community. 

Moreover, Sudan has cooperated with international community in the fight against terrorism and illegal migration. The move was appreciated by United States which has mistakenly blacklisted Sudan. 

Since the stability of Sudan is the stability of the whole region, the Sudanese army was strong enough to crush the rebel groups in all fronts and restore peace in any troubled area without foreign help. 

Regarding ICC s claims, the Sudanese government has exposed the real intention of the ICC known of its hunt of only African leaders leaving the true predators free. Sudan has unified the African leaders against the Court. This has resulted in unanimous African decision to walk out of the body. 

The African decision is a real blow to the court s credibility and fairness. Nothing governs the International Criminal Court other than the double standard.
