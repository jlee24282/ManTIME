<TITLE>Every third person died in road accidents is a youth</TITLE>
<TEXT>
NEW DELHI: A speeding luxury car snuffing three young lives, including a woman techie and an auto rickshaw driver, in Delhi s suburb on Friday night has once again pointed to how youth continue to be the most vulnerable road users and that speeding is the biggest killer. 
The latest road accidents report of Union road transport ministry shows how every third person killed in road crashes is in the prime of his/ her youth. 

In 2015, at least 48,420 people in the age group of 15 24 years were killed in road crashes. The number was bigger at 79,000 for people killed in road crashes in the age group of 15 to 34 years. This was 54% of all road deaths that India recorded in 2015. The data also show how nearly 42% of people dying on roads was due to speeding beyond the permitted limit. 

It s no different across the globe. The latest global status report on road safety by World Health Organisation says road crashes are the biggest killer of people in the age group of 15 29 years and the numbers are much more than lives lost in suicides, HIV/ AIDS, homicide or lower respiratory infection. 

While increasing penalty for fatal offences such as speeding, dangerous driving, drunk driving and using mobile phone while behind the wheels are key to tame the unruly and risky drivers, experts said what India lacks is the mechanism to ensure every traffic offence, at least in urban areas, is caught. 

â€œUntil there is fear of getting caught everytime you violate traffic norms, most of the people won t mend their ways. States and cities need to take quick steps to monitor every violation, which the Centre is pursuing with them since this is a state subject,  said K K Kapila of International Federation.
