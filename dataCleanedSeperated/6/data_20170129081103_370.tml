Derby County striker Chris Martin might have signed a new contract with the Rams but Fulham are reportedly insisting that he will be at Craven Cottage for the rest of the season   and that they have an option to buy him. 
 
The Scottish international, who is currently on a season long loan with the Championship rivals, has penned terms on a new three and a half year deal which will run until the summer of 2020. 
 
The frontman joined Derby from Norwich City in 2013, initially on loan before signing a permanent deal ahead of the 2013/14 campaign as a free agent.

In total, he has made 160 appearances for Derby and scored on 63 occasions, of which 25 came in 2013/14 as Derby reached the Championship Play Off Final under Steve McClaren. 
 
But, according to news outlet GetWestLondon , Fulham clarified the contractual situation regarding Martin when contacted by Press Association Sport on Saturday evening. 
 

 
And a Fulham spokesman is reported to have said:  The signing of a new contract with Derby County does not impact on the terms of the loan arrangement agreed by both clubs. Chris Martin will be at Fulham for the remainder of the season and the club still has an option to purchase.  
 
The timing of Martin s new contract comes after the 28 year old had hit the headlines for reportedly refusing to play for his temporary employers in a bid to force a move back to Derby.

Speaking about the new contract, Martin said:  I really am excited and happy to be signing this new contract with Derby County. At the start of this season I was not in the previous manager s plans, which is a decision that I completely understood and respected. 
 
 As a result, I had the opportunity to move to Fulham on loan, which gave me the chance to play first team football elsewhere. I am thankful that the board only allowed the move on a temporary basis, because I really didn t want to leave Derby and my family is settled in the area too. 
 
 Derby County is a fantastic club with so many things going for it and driven desire to reach the Premier League. I am very happy that the club and the manager see me as part of the long term future. I am committed to being as successful as I possibly can be with Derby County. 
 
 I enjoyed playing under Steve McClaren in the past and I feel that he got the best out of me, so I look forward to doing so as soon as possible.
