<TITLE>Animation Heaven: Inside the Magical World of Pixar</TITLE>
<TEXT>
In 1906, James Stuart Blackton made a simple short simple film called,  Humorous Phases of Funny Faces.  It was the first animated film in history. In 1937, Disney s  Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was the first feature film that was fully hand drawn. And for the next 50 years, Disney set the standard for animation. Then came Pixar, which was created because George Lucas needed a digital effects division. The Emeryville, California based studio has been creating award winning animated feature and short films for over 25 years.
