<TITLE>Dakin: Giving a voice to cruelty</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Is there no decency in selecting stories for TV news? Who made the decision to show a gang of four teens tormenting a terrified young man into doing something no human being should ever have to do? Which newsroom tycoon decided to give a voice to cruelty? The news is doing precisely the same thing as the gang of four â€” showcasing the bullies in front of an audience of viewers. I say get rid of any sadistic freeloaders to the airways and give us back a sense of dignity in journalism. Furthermore, is anyone going to take responsibility that such stories are fodder for one uppance?
