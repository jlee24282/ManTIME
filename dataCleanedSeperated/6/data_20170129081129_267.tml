Can someone please explain to me why there is a ban ons Muslim refugees from Libya, Iran, Iraq, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen   none of those countries from which terrorists have attacked the U.S.? The 9/11 attackers came from Egypt, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates. The Boston Marathon brother bombers were born in Russia and Kyrgyzstan. The San Bernardino husband and wife shooters were born in Chicago and Pakistan, yet families escaping ISIS are being detained at airports this morning. Could it be that those offending countries actually have business ties with Trump? Perhaps his tax records would shed some much needed light on the subject
