<TITLE>Columbus Regional launching ‘100 Ways of Giving Back’</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Columbus Regional Health is planning a private birthday party Feb. 6 for employees, but a bigger celebration throughout 2017 for the general public. 
 
A year long campaign will see Columbus Regional Health’s 2,500 employees give back to the community. Titled “100 Ways of Giving Back,” the hospital system is partnering with local nonprofits to provide volunteers in a variety of community projects of employees’ choosing. 
 
The focus will be on “paying it forward with every project,” said Kelsey DeClue, the hospital system’s spokeswoman. 
 
The hospital system will also have giveaways throughout the year — from Philharmonic tickets to kidscommons admissions or tickets for golf or Skateland. 
 
Columbus Regional Hospital President and CEO Jim Bickel said this is the hospital system’s way of giving back, particularly in light of the community support through its first century, and also in light of the support the hospital received after the catastrophic flood of 2008, and the hospital’s efforts to rebuild and reopen.
