 Leicester to keep hold of Slimani unless Tianjin go big  Leicester City have reportedly knocked back advances from Tianjin Quanjian for Algerian striker Islam Slimani.  
The 28 year old joined the English champions from Sporting in the summer, and has since netted six goals in all competitions. 

According to Sky Sports News, the Foxes have snubbed a Â£38m bid from Tianjin for Slimani, and they are unlikely to sell unless they receive an extraordinary offer this month. 

Slimani has not been able to live up to his hype at the Premier League holders, but he still remains crucial to Claudio Ranieri  s plans to keep his side in the top flight. 

The Algerian international recently returned from the African Cup of Nations after his country s exit, but he is unlikely to play for some while due to a groin problem. 

Tianjin have already recruited the likes of Axel Witsel and Alexandre Pato from Zenit St Petersburg and Villareal respectively this month.
