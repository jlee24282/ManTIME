<TITLE>Bristol pays tribute to screen legend John Hurt</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Tributes have been pouring in from friends, fans and admirers of the legendary actor John Hurt.

The 77 year old, who starred in a series of ground breaking films and TV shows, had battled with both cancer and an intestinal complaint in recent years.

One of the first to pay tribute to the great man was Harry Potter creator JK Rowling.

The Yate born writer was one of the first to pay her respects. She said:  So very sad to hear that the immensely talented and deeply beloved John Hurt has died. My thoughts are with his family and friends. 

Recently, he starred as wandmaker Mr Ollivander in the Harry Potter series and an incarnation of Doctor Who in a 50th anniversary special of the series in 2013.

Hurt appeared in a number of the Harry Potter films but was best known for his roles in 1984, Alien and I Claudius.

He made his name in The Elephant Man and in the ground breaking portrayal of Quentin Crisp in The Naked Civil servant. Bristol University student David Walliams was a huge fan of the actor. He said: Sir John Hurt changed the way we thought and felt with the truth and depth of his acting. The Naked Civil Servant and Elephant Man especially. 

His on screen comedy partner Matt Lucas simply added  Peerless .

Meanwhile the Bristol Old Vic tweeted

The star s latest film Jackie, the Oscar nominated biopic of President John F. Kennedy s widow, is currently showing in cinemas.

After rising to fame in A Man For All Seasons, some of his most famous roles include the 1979 blockbuster Alien, the TV series I, Claudius in 1976 and starring as Winston Smith in the adaptation of George Orwell s 1984.

His screen death in Alien has been voted one of the most memorable in cinema history.

While battling pancreatic cancer in 2015, Sir John   the son of a clergyman   said he did not wish for an afterlife, saying:  I hope I shall have the courage to say,  Vroom! Here we go! Let s become different molecules! 

He also said:  I can t say I worry about mortality, but it s impossible to get to my age and not have a little contemplation of it. We re all just passing time, and occupy our chair very briefly.  

Among those to pay tribute to Sir John was Mel Brooks, executive producer of  The Elephant Man .

He tweeted that he was a  truly magnificent talent. 

 No one could have played The Elephant Man more memorably. He carried that film into cinematic immortality. He will be sorely missed,  he added.

Last July, Sir John was forced to pull out of a production in the West End after advice from his doctors.

He had been set to play the role of Billy Rice in The Entertainer but was taken hospital with an intestinal complaint and told by doctors it was  too soon... to undertake an arduous stage role, .

In a statement, he said at the time:  It is therefore with great sadness and disappointment that I must withdraw. 

In October 2015, he was given the all clear after revealing he had been battling pancreatic cancer four months earlier, saying:  I am overjoyed, I am thrilled. It all looks great for the future, it s fantastic. 

He received his knighthood in July the same year, and said of the honour:  It does make one inordinately proud.  Notorious for his wild lifestyle, he was reportedly fond of saying his career track record  isn t bad for an old drunk .

But in 2008 he said he d been without drink for several years, and noted:  Times change. You change.

 When it no longer seemed to help, creatively, I mean, as it unquestionably had helped at one stage, it seemed time to give it up.

 Besides, attitudes to drinking have changed. Would Churchill have been able to get away with his drinking if he had been a politician today? 

He married his fourth wife, film producer Anwen, 51, in 2005,and described the pair as being  wonderfully married .

But previously, he was notorious for his tumultuous love life.

During his career, Sir John picked up two Academy Award nominations   for The Elephant Man and Midnight Express.

He won four Baftas for films including An Englishman in New York and The Naked Civil Servant.

He once described how his friend Sir Laurence Olivier, passed on advice to him, describing:  I remember Olivier, when I was playing the Fool in his King Lear, saying:  When it comes to the obituary, they ll only ever mention three things, probably two, but if you re lucky three. 

 And of course when he died, they mentioned Richard III, Henry IV and either Marathon Man or Wuthering Heights.

 I mean, if you write your own obituary, I don t know, they d take the things that got awards wouldn t they? So it would be Midnight Express, it would be Elephant Man and Naked Civil Servant probably.
