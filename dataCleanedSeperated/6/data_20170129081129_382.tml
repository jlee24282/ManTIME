<TEXT>
Center Chorale  amp; Pacific Chorale  amp; Symphony Orchestra    
The mature Johannes Brahms wrote “A German Requiem” in 1868, and it has remained as one of the most important musical works of the 19th Century. The Center Chorale is joined by the Pacific Coast Chorale, full symphony orchestra, and soloists Caroline Nelms and Clifford Derix for a performance of this glorious masterwork.
