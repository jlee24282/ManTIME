<TITLE>Taking the plunge</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Big V neck is back and lower, the better. But it s just one nip slip away from wardrobe malfunction. Here s how to bare right... 
 
There seems to be a celebrity cleavage competition going on. Recently, our most successful western export Priyanka Chopra took the  golden  in Golden Globes literally by donning the shiny shade in a Ralph Lauren gown. Back home, Hollywood hopeful Deepika Padukone put the X in  xXx  by following suit in a Naeem Khan. Even as the jury is out on who wore it best, many Indian celebrities have taken a leaf out of Kim Kardashian West s stylebook by wearing the daring neckline. If new mommy Kareena Kapoor Khan wore it post baby bump in a sedate avatar, wunderkind Alia Bhatt styled her sternum in a golden blazer. And obviously our self proclaimed fashion icon Sonam Kapoor had to show how it s done in a near naked Yanina Couture gown. 
 
 BARE BASICS 
Celebrity stylist and fashion designer Esha Amiin calls it  the  big trend for the red carpet   national or international.   The plunging neckline is all about being sexy and sensual,   she says and adds,   However, one walks on a thin line with it as it could either swing towards a memorable look or towards vulgarity depending upon quite a few factors.   Now the style is spilling over (ahem!) to everyday fashion too. Fashion and lifestyle blogger Akanksha Redhu says,   You can even wear a top or bodysuit with a plunging neckline along with jeans.   
Amiin advises:   If you are planning to wear a daring neckline you need three things   confidence, body type and, of course, double sided tape.   In fact, there are numerous tutorials on how to boob tape it, up a la Kardashian, available online for pointers. 
 
 OFF YOUR CHEST 
Amiin is all for wearing it casually.   Just use a deep neck body suit or lace ups and pair with denims. This look has the potential to go from a day look into a night look,   she says. Bodysuits also work best as they keep the neckline pulled down and it doesn t get a chance to loosen up from anywhere and lead to a wardrobe malfunction. Redhu says that the best way to rock this look would be to accessorise it with a black choker, deep red lips, black booties, huge silver earrings and a bohemian cover up,   because we are in India and the men don t know how to control themselves here  . Point taken.

 SUIT YOURSELF 
The plunging look works best on women with a more modest chest like Kangana Ranaut s. Rock a low cut for a day occasion by opting for a blazer minus 
the shirt. 
 
 BLING IT RIGHT 
Don t clutter or hide your neckline under some statement necklace like Priyanka Chopra. Best is to go for a choker or statement earrings so that the neckline gets the attention it deserves. 
 
 BARE CHEST, BARE FACE 
Keep the makeup dewy or nude with just a hint of colour on the lips. A wet look with open hair like Alia Bhatt s, or hair tied up in a bun, works best. 
 
 KEEP IT MINIMAL 
A plunging neckline is a statement in itself. Go with minimal accessories, maybe just a pair of elegant earrings and rings. But wear it with confidence and don t fumble like Deepika Padukone. 
 
 CONTOUR RIGHT 
Contour your chest to take the entire look to its full potential   like Kareena Kapoor. A plunging neckline is pointless if you have a pasty chest. If you have bumps or acne, cover it up with makeup. It will make the photos come out million times better. 
 
 TAPE IT WELL 
A near nude look like Sonam Kapoor s requires a sound knowledge of boob tape and pasties.
