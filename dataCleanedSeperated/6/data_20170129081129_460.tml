<TITLE>'Nothing wrong with players seeking more money in China' - Luis Enrique labels criticism of CSL moves strange</TITLE>
<TEXT>
The lure of the CSL has proved too strong recently with Oscar and Carlos Tevez joining the growing list of stars in the Chinese Super League

Tevez moved to Shanghai Shenhua in a deal reportedly making him the world s highest paid player while Oscar completed a Â£60 million switch to Shanghai SIPG from Premier League leaders Chelsea Barcelona s Arda Turan has also been subject to interest from CSL clubs and while some believe the money being spent is bad for football Luis Enrique questioned the criticism of players  I think it s fantastic that players can decide to go to China and earn more money  he told reporters

 In every profession including yours the press people change jobs and earn more money and nothing is said   in fact your friends congratulate you  It s great but when you are a footballer You re a traitor a money grabber It s strange  I think it s fantastic and I applaud those who do it but it s odd the way it s badly seen in football  Luis Enrique s Barcelona are away to Real Betis in La Liga action on Sunday
