<TITLE>Dodgers' bullpen seems settled, but it doesn't mean team isn't still looking</TITLE>
<TEXT>
LOS ANGELES  gt; gt; The heavy lifting was done in December when the Dodgers were able to re sign in house free agents Kenley Jansen, Justin Turner and Rich Hill. Just this past week, the Dodgers’ front office concluded their winter long search for a second baseman when they traded for Logan Forsythe. 
 
That just leaves one thing to worry about — and it’s the same thing Dodgers president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman says always worries him. 
 
“I don’t think you ever get to a place with the bullpen where you feel like you’re done,” Friedman said Saturday at Dodger Stadium. “It’s something that every year, heading into the season, it scares me. ... It’s obviously a very tricky part of roster construction.” 
 
Friedman joked that the seasons when he was most worried about the bullpen usually turned out to be the years when his bullpen performed best — and vice versa. 
 
Even if an ‘under construction’ sign remains permanently fixed to any bullpen in Friedman’s mind, the Dodgers’ current relief corps looks to be largely settled with spring training just over two weeks away. 
 
General manager Farhan Zaidi offered that there are “some interesting guys still out there” on the free agent market. But the relievers in that group — veterans like Joe Smith, Fernando Salas and Sergio Romo — appear to hold little interest for the Dodgers. Veteran Joe Blanton (who surprisingly emerged as the Dodgers’ most reliable setup man last season) remains unsigned as well and “it’s not lost on us what a significant part of our bullpen he was last season,” Friedman said. 
 
But that successful 2016 (a 2.48 ERA and 1.01 WHIP in a team high 75 appearances) might have pushed the 36 year old Blanton’s market beyond what the Dodgers are willing to pay after extending themselves farther than expected (a combined $192 million) to re sign Jansen, Turner and Hill. The same financial restraint has probably kept the Dodgers from bidding aggressively for other bullpen options. 
 
“Obviously we committed significant resources (to re signing their in house free agents),” Friedman said. “I think it impacts everywhere, just how you allocate. It obviously has trickle down effects.” 
 
Zaidi pointed out that the Dodgers’ bullpen performed “at the top of baseball” last year and can look forward to full seasons from players like Josh Fields and Grant Dayton who emerged as key pieces late in the year. The only additions to last year’s group figure to be of the type already signed — former Tampa Bay Ray Steve Geltz and former San Diego Padre Brandon Morrow both of whom signed minor league contracts with non roster invitations to spring training. 
 
“I think the arms are there,” said Dodgers manager Dave Roberts who made a major league record 606 pitching changes in 2016. “It’s more of a situation where somebody’s gotta emerge, sort of what Joe Blanton did for us last year. 
 
 
“We’ve got a lot of options. It’s more about who’s going to step up and pitch those innings.” 
 Weighty matters  
Outfielder Yasiel Puig lifted his shirt onstage to show the crowd at Dodger Stadium for Saturday’s FanFest how well he is doing in satisfying the Dodgers’ request for him to get leaner in 2017. Puig has hired a nutritionist and a chef, Roberts said – though they didn’t appear to be part of the entourage throwing ‘YP’ logo hats to the crowd as Puig made his FanFest appearance. 
 
Catcher Yasmani Grandal, meanwhile, has cut meat from his diet this winter and expects to report to spring training 10 pounds below his usual playing weight and 20 pounds lower than he normally starts spring training. Grandal said he is “a little worried” about being too light and will probably add meat back into his diet this spring. 
 
Fitness and diet aren’t the only issues for Puig this season as he tries to bounce back from a disappointing 2016 that included a month long demotion to Triple A and serial attempts by the Dodgers to trade him. 
 
“It was not a good experience going to Triple A,” Puig said, conducting his interview in English. “But that was my fault – coming in late, not going to meetings on time with my teammates and coaches. That was the reason.” 
 
Roberts said he has spoken with Puig multiple times during the winter and “he’s in a great state of mind right now.” 
 Notes  
Utilityman Kiké Hernandez plans to play for Puerto Rico in the World Baseball Classic. Outfielder Joc Pederson, however, said he turned down an invitation to play for Team Israel. As a minor leaguer four years ago, Pederson was the youngest player on Team Israel during the qualifying rounds for the WBC. ... Roberts said 20 year old left hander Julio Urias will definitely have an innings limit in 2017 — “he is still a young man.” Roberts has mentioned the possibility that Urias will stay behind in Arizona for extended spring training after the Dodgers break camp as a way to save those innings for later in the year. “It’s a team decision,” Urias said through an interpreter. “I’m just going to get ready and wait for their decision. I’ll respect it whatever it is.” … Friedman said he is “cautiously optimistic” about reports that Hyun Jin Ryu has already been throwing off a mound. If Ryu can make a comeback from shoulder and elbow surgeries that limited him to one start in the past two years “it would be a real boon to us,” Friedman said.
