<TITLE>Erik Lukens column: Oregon landlords could use a Dorothy English</TITLE>
<TEXT>
A dozen years ago, Oregonians staged a property rights rebellion. It went by the name of Measure 37, and it passed in 35 of the state’s 36 counties. It even won in famously liberal Multnomah County despite opposition from a who’s who of public employee unions, environmental groups and Democratic politicians. 
 
The measure was a crude weapon aimed at uncompensated property “takings,” which in plain English means regulations that reduce a property’s value for which the owner isn’t compensated. Aimed at Oregon’s restrictive land use system, the measure allowed property owners to develop their land under rules in effect at they time they bought it. Otherwise, they were entitled to compensation for lost value. 
 
The face of Measure 37 was an elderly woman named Dorothy English, who bought dozens of acres in the Portland area in the 1950s but was prohibited from developing it fully by the state’s subsequently adopted land use system. English died at the age of 95 less than four years after Measure 37 passed. 
 
Measure 37 had problems — big problems — and Oregonians voted to scale it back a few years later. Still, it was a valuable reminder to lawmakers of Oregonians’ deep appreciation for property rights and their eagerness to right wrongs. 
 
It’s impossible to know how long those lessons lasted, but the collection of bills lying in wait this year for property owners known (often disparagingly) as landlords suggests that the lessons of Measure 37 are little more than a dim memory in Salem. For some, anyway. 
 
Housing costs are high in many places around the state, including Bend. A number of factors contribute to this problem, including high development charges imposed by cities, the scarcity of buildable land exacerbated by the state’s land use system and, surely the most significant, Oregon’s popularity. Lots of people want to live here, and the result is a mismatch in some places between the demand for housing and the supply. 
 
Ameliorating a problem this complicated isn’t simple, but you wouldn’t know that by reading some of the ideas proposed by legislative leaders this year. 
 
Buckle up, landlords. 
 
Consider House Bill 2001 , sponsored by House Speaker Tina Kotek, D Portland . It would allow cities and counties to control rents, allowing landlords “a fair rate of return,” whatever that means. It also would prohibit rent increases above 5 percent except under certain circumstances. And if a landlord did qualify for one of those circumstances — to pay for necessary repairs, for instance — a tenant would have the right to terminate his lease and receive relocation expenses equivalent to three months’ rent. 
 
And then there’s House Bill 2004 , co sponsored by more than a dozen lawmakers. The bill would prohibit no cause evictions for month to month leases except under certain circumstances. For longer tenancies, landlords would be required to offer tenants an opportunity to renew for a period at least as long as their existing leases. The bill would effectively lock landlords into their relationships with tenants, whose rents — if HB 2001 passed — might be controlled by their local government. 
 
The net effect of this legislation would be that of an uncompensated taking, a seizure of some of the value of private property for public benefit. Few people would argue that the rental market should be completely unregulated, and even fewer would argue that all landlords are fair and reasonable people. Still, there comes a point at which the desire to help strapped renters can devolve into the scapegoating of landlords and encourage an unjustified assault on their property rights. In some corners of the Oregon Legislature, that point has been passed. 
 
So dismissive have some lawmakers become of landlords, in fact, that a couple of representatives think nothing of subordinating their property rights to the consumer choices of their tenants. House Bill 2511 , sponsored by Democrats Phil Barnhart and Ken Helm , would allow residential tenants to install electric car charging stations on their landlords’ property even over their landlords’ objections. This bill may well die, but the fact that it’s even thinkable really says something. 
 
What it says is that at least some lawmakers seem to have forgotten the lessons of Measure 37, assuming they learned them in the first place. To be sure, there’s little reason to believe that abusing landlords in the way some might like would fuel another property rights rebellion. Dorothy English was a much more sympathetic figure than your average landlord, after all, and most Oregonians are probably more likely to feel sorry for struggling renters in any case. 
 
Still, the property interests of unpopular people deserve protection, too. It’s too bad some legislators seem to think otherwise.
