<TITLE>Natalie Portman pays tribute to Sir John Hurt</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Natalie Portman has paid tribute to Sir John Hurt. 
 
The 35 year old actress co starred with John, 77, in  V for Vendetta  and  Jackie  and paid an emotional tribute to him following his death after a battle with pancreatic cancer. 
 
She said:  I m so extremely sad to hear of John s passing. I was lucky enough to make two films with him   both of which were taken to the next level because of his performances. He was the most talented actor, and also a deeply good and funny and poetic and smart and warm human being. I send my love to his family at this terrible time, and join his fans in watching his films that we are lucky enough to have forever.  
 
 Jackie  director Pablo LarraÃ­n added to Entertainment Weekly:  John was invincible. Unflinching. Eternal.  
 
A number of other stars have also paid tribute to the star, with Mel Brooks tweeting:  I was terribly sad to learn of John Hurt s passing. He was truly a magnificent talent ... No one could have played The Elephant Man more memorably. He carried that film into cinematic immortality. He will be sorely missed. (sic)  
 
Bonnie Wright, who played Ginny Weasley alongside Hurt s wand making alter ego Garrick Ollivander in  Harry Potter , simply wrote:  John Hurt. What an acting legend. Rest in peace dear Sir. Wand shopping won t be the same without you. (sic)  
 
David Schneider starred alongside Hurt in 1999 s  You re Dead  and said he was so taken by him he forgot his lines. 
 
He wrote:  Sad re John Hurt. I was in a film with him and he was so mesmerising I kept forgetting to act and just watched him. A genius  amp; lovely man (sic)  
 
 Lost Boys  star Kiefer Sutherland said:  My deepest sympathies to John Hurt s family friends and fans. He was a dear friend. (sic)  
 
Sharon Stone said:  God speed to John Hurt, a legendary and good human being (sic)  
 
And 59 year old screenwriter Richard E. Grant wrote:  So so sad to have lost such an extraordinary talent and friend. Sir John Hurt R.I.P. (sic)
