<TITLE>MORE HYPOCRISY: Obama Banned all Iraqi Refugees for 6 Months in 2011 – Liberals SAID NOTHING!</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Via Billy Protests on Saturday after incoming refugees were detained by customs and border patrol agents following Trump’s executive order from 7 Muslim countries.

Of course, back in 2011 when Barack Obama banned Iraqi refugees for six months the far left said nothing!

In 2011 the US discovered Al Qaeda terrorists living as refugees in Kentucky.

As a result of this discovery the Obama administration blocked all Iraqi refugees from entering the US for six months.

There were no protests.

The left said nothing. reported
