Les Ferdinand  has told the London Evening Standard that he has not been at all surprised by Harry Winks’ rise at Tottenham Hotspur. 
 
Winks started this campaign as a promising youngster, who had barely received any game time. 
 
However, Mauricio Pochettino has shown great faith in the 20 year old in recent weeks. 
 

 
Winks has gone on to make 23 appearances in all competitions for Spurs this season, and he has regularly been brought off the substitutes’ bench in crucial stages of the Lilywhites’ Premier League matches. 
 
Pochettino clearly feels that Winks is now an important member of his first team squad. 
 
And, although Ferdinand did not work with Winks while he was coaching at White Hart Lane, the former Spurs striker is not at all shocked by the England youth international’s progression. 
 
 No [I wasn t surprised at his development],” Ferdinand said. 
 

 
 Harry [Winks] didn t really work with us but we saw him in the system and we knew he had the ability to become a very, very good player. 
 
 And now he s proving it and getting his chances in the first team.” 
 
Winks’ latest performance for Spurs came against Wycombe Wanderers in the FA Cup, as Pochettino’s men narrowly avoided an upset. 
 
Spurs fell behind twice in the contest, but rescued the victory with a 97th minute strike through Heung Min Son.
