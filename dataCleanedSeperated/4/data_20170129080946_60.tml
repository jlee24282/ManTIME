<TITLE>Chiral quantum optics is a new research field with bright perspectives</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Recently, surprising physical effects were observed using special microscopic waveguides for light. Such  photonic structures  currently are revolutionizing the fields of optics and photonics, and have opened up the new research area of  Chiral Quantum Optics . Physicists from Copenhagen, Innsbruck, and Vienna, who are leading figures in this field, have now written an overview on the topic which just appeared in the scientific journal Nature. What one learns at school is that light oscillate...
