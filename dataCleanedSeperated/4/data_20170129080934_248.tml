<TITLE>Where Is The Most Practical Location In A Car For A Fire Extinguisher</TITLE>
<TEXT>
I have searched NL Car Talk, but didn t find a previous thread on this. FRSC officers here present, I have decided to relocate my extinguisher from the trunk to underneath the driver s seat, in hope that I have the presence of mind to remember in an emergency.Most burning cars (fuel, not electrical) begin either in front of or behind the car cabin.Valid point
