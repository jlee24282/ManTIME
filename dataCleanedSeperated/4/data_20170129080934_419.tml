<TITLE>Police photo analysis uncovers reflection of suspect in victim's eyes (2017/1/29)</TITLE>
<TEXT>
TOKUSHIMA    Analysis of the photo of a victim on a smartphone seized by police in western Japan last year uncovered a reflection of the suspect in the victim s eyes, providing valuable evidence, it has been learned. 
 
An investigator noticed the reflection and sought the assistance of Koichi Naniwa, a 43 year old member of the Tokushima Prefectural Police Identification Division. 
 
 There s something like a human shadow. I want you to take a look at it,  the investigator told him. 
 
The photo, taken by the suspect on their phone, showed the face of the victim. In the past Naniwa had analyzed reflections in mirrors, but had never heard of analyzing reflections in the pupils of someone s eyes. He was initially doubtful that he would find anything. 
 
Zooming in on the reflection, he found the background was lighter and clearer than the person s image, but after repeated image correction, he was able to see a reflection of the person holding a smartphone, with an outline of their face and hairstyle. 
 
Naniwa was delighted to hear his boss tell him the find was top evidence. 
 
Naniwa regularly analyzes security camera footage and takes pictures of fingerprints and footprints, but it is apparently rare for a reflection in someone s eyes to be picked up as evidence. 
 
 Unlike in the dramas, things often don t go well. This experience helped me realize anew the importance of observing things right down to the smallest detail,  Naniwa said.
