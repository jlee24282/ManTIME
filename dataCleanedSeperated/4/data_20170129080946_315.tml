<TITLE>Chuck Landon: Wrestling with MU's loss to UTEP</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Imagine professional wrestling on a 94 foot long, 50 foot wide wooden court. 
   
That s what Marshall s 91 68 loss to UTEP before 6,781 disgruntled fans in an often raucous Henderson Center resembled Saturday night. 
   
Nobody got hit with a steel chair. 
   
And no one was suplexed through a wooden table. 
   
But otherwise? 
   
It looked like a game played in the  squared circle.  
   
It was physical, physical and more physical. That didn t bode well for an under sized, height challenged Herd trying to deal with the tag team of 7 foot 1 Matt Willms and 6 11 Kelvin Jones. 
   
The result? 
   
Willms had 25 points on 11 for 15 shooting, while Jones had five points, five rebounds and two blocked shots. But it wasn t just about their production. The big, bigger and biggest problem was Willms  amp; Jones  intimidation. 
   
 It was real physical,  said Marshall s Austin Loop, who had two of MU s paltry total of only three 3 point field goals.  Their bigs were tough. 
   
 We re a little undersized. When guys like that are playing physical, it s tough for us.  
   
Think  Legion of Doom.  
   
Why, UTEP coach Tim Floyd even performed a fairly good impression of  Precious  Paul Ellering, as he ranted, raved, gestured and even charged three quarters of the way out on the court at one point. 
   
How he wasn t whistled for a technical foul is beyond me. 
   
The combination of UTEP s skyscrapers inside, tremendous quickness and athleticism on the perimeter and the fact the officiating allowed both teams to play physical ball was simply more than Marshall could overcome. 
   
If Marshall is poison, then UTEP is the antidote. 
   
The Miners were the absolute worst case scenario for Marshall on Saturday night. 
   
 We re not a physical team,  said a somber Danny D Antoni, during the Marshall third year coach s postgame press conference.  We have to play clean.  
   
There was very little cleanliness in this rough and tumble game, which included two technical fouls although that total easily could have been doubled or tripled. 
   
Why, Mr. Clean himself would have been hit with a technical foul in this game. 
   
That s how unclean it was. 
   
This Marshall team simply can t cope with that. As a result, Jon Elmore was 2 for 12 from the floor, including 0 for 7 on 3 pointers and scored only 11 points. Backcourt mate Stevie Browning struggled even harder, scoring only three points on 0 for 7 shooting, including 0 for 5 from beyond the arc. 
   
Imagine the  Rock  N  Roll Express  taking on the  Four Horsemen.  
   
Under the circumstances, it was that lopsided. 
   
Yet, D Antoni insisted on giving UTEP credit rather than choosing a convenient alibi. 
   
 They deserved the win,  he said.  They were a lot closer to their game than we were to ours.  
   
When a team that is built on 3 point shooting goes a head shaking 3 for 25 from behind the arc for 12.1 percent shooting ... well, it doesn t get any worse than that. 
   
Again, worst case scenario. 
   
The only glimmer of positivity was the play of Terrence Thompson, who led MU with 25 points and 10 rebounds. 
   
That s a step in the right direction on a night full of miss steps. 
   
Where was Captain Lou when Marshall needed him?
