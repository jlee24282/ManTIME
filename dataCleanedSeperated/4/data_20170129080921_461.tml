STEUBENVILLE — Cookie West still mourns for her son, Lee Alexander West, as only a mother who lost her 15 year old in a fatal house fire can. 
 
“I never forget Lee. Every time I am with family or attend a sporting event or see one of his friends who are now in college, I think of Lee. This is something I think about every day. But I know Lee is looking down on us and encouraging us to move forward. I will never stop loving my son and missing him very much,” Cookie West said quietly. 
 
“That’s why we are continuing with our fifth anniversary memorial and awards service at 6:15 p.m Tuesday at the Tower of Power Church on Maryland Avenue. We will have a 15 minute pictorial of Lee and then 15 minutes of silence to reflect on our lives and Lee’s life,” said Cookie. 
 
“Following the reflection, we will honor two Steubenville High School teachers who were nominated by students who wrote essays on the teachers who have the most impact on their lives. Eliza Kelley and Toni Wukelic will receive the teacher awards, while the village impact award will go to Pastor Bobbyjon Bauman, Brenda Ware and Glenda Young Jones. 
 
“This is the second year for our village impact award, and God put this on my heart to recognize these three wonderful people. Bauman is always working with kids and doing everything he can to help them. Ware raised her own daughters but plays an important role for the young kids involved in the Steubenville Tigers organization. She is a mother to all of those kids. And, Young Jones works at Jefferson County Children Services, helping the young people who may not have anyone else in their lives,” declared Cookie. 
 
“Many people knew Lee as a great athlete, but Lee was an excellent student as well. He was an honors student at Steubenville High School. There were several teachers who helped shape Lee into the young man he had become,” said Cookie West. 
 
“Lee was in transition at Steubenville High School. He was becoming a man. Lee loved all sports, but he was also very passionate about his education. Lee’s dream was to become an engineer and he was already checking out colleges and universities that offered engineering courses,” recalled Cookie West. 
 
“I believe Lee is looking down from Heaven. I believe Lee is always with me. I know I will see Lee again. I understand and respect God’s plan. He needed Lee. God has comforted me. My tears are tears of joy because Lee is in heaven, and they are tears of sorrow because I miss him,” Cookie West stated. 
 
“I am inviting the community to join us at the Tower of Power Church for a positive evening,” she added. 
 
“I can’t thank Pastor Everett Mitchell and the Tower of Power Church community enough for their prayers and support since Lee died. God and the church are everything to me because if I didn’t have them I know my life would be very different. That support has helped me to be joyful and help others and to move forward. If I didn’t have that support I wouldn’t have made it this far. I am grateful to have people who have supported me through these challenging times,” stated Cookie. 
 
“Lee loved people and never met a stranger, and now he continues to give to others. We are very thankful we have the opportunity to do something that impacts others. My daughters and I are impacted by not having his presence around us. My daughters grieve in their own ways because their brother and best friend is not here. Lee may be absent from our lives but he will never be forgotten,” remarked Cookie. 
 
“We want to make this community a safer and viable place for young people to hope, dream and aspire to be better than they thought they might be,” she said. 
 
Cookie said the service is open to the public.
