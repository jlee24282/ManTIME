<TITLE>Find places and tours that cater to outdoor activities</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Name: Outbound   The Best Local Outdoor Adventures. 

What it does: The app directs you to places and tour providers that cater to outdoor interests, such as backpacking, camping, hiking, kayaking, fishing, kite boarding, mountain biking, running, skiing, stand up paddle boarding, surfing, yoga, photography, and more. 

Available: In the App Store, requires iOS 8.0 or later. Compatible with iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch. 

Cost: Free 

What s hot: I tested the app while on a trip to Charleston, S.C., and although I ve been to that city more than 10 times in as many years, I was impressed that it turned me on to activities and destinations I never knew about, such as a day trip to Congaree National Park. There are a lot of ways to use the app; for far reaching inspiration, go to the home page and  Search by Activity    click on an interest, such as swimming, but instead of a specific location, click on  Anywhere  and see where the app takes you. The results took me to La Laguna, Nicaragua; Slide Lake in Wyoming; and a blue hole in Grahamsville, N.Y.   places I might never have known about or considered when researching a summer adventure. Yes, you can sort by season, too. 

What s not: The app sometimes crashed when I clicked into deeper pages. That didn t bother me too much because the quality of the content was so high. I was testing it on an iPhone 6 Plus Version 1
