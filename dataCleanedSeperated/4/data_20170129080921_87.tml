<TITLE>Vic to swelter on Monday amid fire fears</TITLE>
<TEXT>
With temperatures set to soar across the state, fire authorities have issued a total fire ban across Victoria. 
 
The entire state has a severe or very high fire danger rating on Monday, meaning no fires can be lit or be allowed to remain alight in the open air, the CFA says. 
 
Temperatures are tipped to hit the low 40s in the northwest of the state while Melbourne can expect a top of 36C.
