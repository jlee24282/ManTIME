<TITLE>X Games Aspen 2017: Elena Hight Winning Run Women’s Halfpipe...</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Elena Hight has notched a few, very impressive X Games NBDs, including the first 900 in women’s competition (2003) and the first double alley oop backside rodeo in the pipe, ever (2013). Elena has medaled five times, but until 2017, the top of the podium in Aspen had elluded this incredibly talented pipe rider. No longer, though, as on Saturday, January 28th, with a mass of spectators lining the decks of the pipe and a screaming, excited crowd at the bottom, Elena put down two stellar runs in a halfpipe that was challenging to begin with. Elena deftly combined style and technical riding, beginning her run with a kicked out method and tied up her first place finish with back to back nines and an alley oop rodeo. Congrats on the X Games Aspen gold, Elena!
