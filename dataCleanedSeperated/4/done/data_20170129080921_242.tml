ORLANDO, Fla. — When 1971 Lisbon High School graduate Dave Ward was attending college at Mount Union, he was trying to decide what he wanted to do the rest of his life.

He thought back on all the coaches who made a positive impact on his life and knew he wanted to follow the same path

“I got into coaching for the relationships you build,” 

Ward, who is the brother of Lisbon Hall of Fame coach Mike Ward and who was inducted into the Lisbon Athletic Hall of Fame in 2014, dedicated 28 years of his life to being a teacher and assistant football coach at Cloverleaf High School in Medina County, Ohio. This weekend, one of Ward’s former players is showing his gratitude.

Baltimore Ravens fullback Kyle Juszczyk, a 2009 Cloverleaf graduate, has invited Ward and his wife Kathy to be guests for his first Pro Bowl, which kicks off at 8 p.m. today at Orlando’s Citrus Bowl.

As part of an NFL initiative to promote the positive impact football can have on peoples lives, the league granted each the 88 Pro Bowl participants the opportunity to invite a former coach to Orlando for an all expenses paid trip.

The itinerary involves a player coach luncheon on Saturday as well as a youth football clinic that Ward and the other invited coaches helped work. Ward will also be granted sideline access before the game.

“This weekend is all about celebrating Kyle and his tremendous accomplishment,” 

Ward first met Juszczyk when he had him as a student in his seventh grade science class. In addition to his unquestionable football ability, Ward also took note of Juszczyk’s studious demeanor.

“I remember he was an excellent student and that he was mature beyond his years,” 

As Juszczyk entered high school, his relationship with Ward continued to grow. When he began attracting attention from colleges, Ward frequently accompanied him on visits. Juszczyk continued to excel in the classroom and received scholarship offers from several Ivy League schools. At that point, Ward said the NFL wasn’t really on anyone’s mind.

“He was always our best player, but nobody really thought he would be in the NFL,” 

The two continued their strong relationship after Juszczyk accepted a scholarship to Harvard. Over the next few years, Ward attended a couple of Harvard Yale games and watched as Juszczyk developed into an NFL prospect. As a senior, Juszczyk was a unanimous first team All Ivy League selection as a tight end. The Ravens drafted him in the fourth round of the 2013 NFL Draft. Juszczyk slid into a starting fullback role before his second season and has been a mainstay in the Ravens lineup ever since.

This season, Juszczyk led all fullbacks with 266 receiving yards on 37 receptions, while also rushing for 22 yards on five carries.

“Kyle has put in a ton of hard work to get himself to this point he kept improving each year from high school onward,” 

These days, Ward is retired and lives in Cuyahoga Falls. He remains in close contact with Juszczyk. The two text every Friday during the season and Ward watches the Ravens on TV every week.

“When we talk, it’s usually about subjects other than football,” 

Ward retired from Cloverleaf feeling very fulfilled not only from his relationship with Juszczyk, but also with the dozens of other players he has worked with over the years. He views this weekend as a celebration of all the special bonds that come about due to football.

“So many of these individuals don’t take credit for what they do, they do it because its the right thing,”
