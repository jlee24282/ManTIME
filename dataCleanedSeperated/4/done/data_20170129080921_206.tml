Pretty Little Liars star Shay Mitchell is best known for Pretty Little Liars, but just a few years ago, she was an unknown actress doing bottle service in a restaurant in Toronto. 

Shay Mitchell can currently be seen on Pretty Little Liars 

In a new interview [while promoting the fourth season of Pretty Little Liars], Shay discusses her transition into the limelight, explaining,  It s still really crazy. I walk down the street in Yorkville [in Toronto] and the restaurant/bar where I used to do bottle service    I remember it, I see myself hustling on that little patio. It s really cool to then come back here and see my cover [of Elle Canada]. It s just really cool and it s been such a blessing from the show to get to do all these things that I m doing and have all these experiences. It s really fun.
