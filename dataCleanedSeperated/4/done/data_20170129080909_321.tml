<TITLE>Narration, pioneers, songs combine in ‘Dream of the Pacific’</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Amarillo Opera’s production of “Dream of the Pacific” marries an influential piece of American history with sophisticated music. 
 
The opera, which is sung in English, details the story of Lewis and Clark as they search for a water route through unmapped American wilderness to the Pacific Ocean. 
 
“We begin with Sacagawea telling the creation of the world,” director Linda Hughes said. “We’ve taken a Native American approach with a mythological opening in a way.” 
 
The opera has been described as sort of a historical musical that combines narration, opera and accessible storytelling. 
 
Daniel Hill, the Amarillo native portraying Lewis, serves as narrator. 
 
“Lewis takes exact passages out of the journal that he wrote while they were on this expedition,” Hughes said. 
 
The opera follows the journal entries, starting at the mouth of the Missouri River and ultimately leading them to their guide, Sacagawea. 
 
As a well known story in U.S. history, the opera is accessible to people of all ages and varying levels of opera experience. 
 
“It kind of leans toward musical theater,” Hughes said. “It’s a good opera for any age.” 
 
The cast consists primarily of local singers, many who are students from area schools, Amarillo College and West Texas A amp;M University. 
 
Amarillo Opera also chose two out of town professionals to portray Sacagawea and Clark. The duo are a husband and wife. 
 
“We don’t get to sing together as much as we like,” said Shannon Dooley, who performs as Sacagawea.“It’s a perk when it gets to happen.” 
 
Dooley and husband John are traveling from North Carolina to portray the two historic explorers. 
 
Although Dooley has performed across the nation, including in the Metropolitan Opera in New York, she said “Dream of the Pacific” is especially challenging. 
 
“The opera isn’t done very often,” Dooley said. “There are some really beautiful moments musically, but it’s also very challenging (and) maybe one of the hardest things I’ve learned in my career.” 
 
Hughes said every singer has exceeded the taxing requirements of his or her role. 
 
“It has challenged the kids, but they are amazing,” she said. “They really have stepped up to the plate.”
