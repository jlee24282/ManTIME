<TITLE>Edo Bye-Election: APC candidate in early lead, Oshiomhole predicts victory</TITLE>
<TEXT>
By Simon Ebegbulem, Benin City 
MR Johnson Oghuma of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in yesterday’s House of Representatives bye election in Etsako Federal Constituency is cruising to victory ahead of the PDP candidate, Jude Imagwe, of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). 
 
From the results declared at press time, the APC candidate won nine wards out of ten in Etsako Central while the PDP candidate won only one, which is the ward of the state Chairman of the PDP, Chief Dan Orbih (Kulukulu 1). 
 
Meanwhile, low turnout of voters and malfunction of card readers marred the election  conducted in the three local governments of Etsako Central, Etsako West and Etsako East. The election, which commenced at about 8:30am, was peaceful and devoid of rancour. 
 
Former Governor Adams Oshiomhole cast his vote at about 11am at his Iyamhu polling unit, saying: “I have no shaking at all. APC will clear the three local governments because we are on ground while the PDP are strangers in these areas.”
