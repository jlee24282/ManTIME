The intention is here to tax works contract(Includingany transfer of property in goods in the execution of contract) related to immovable property as supply of service.Works contractas well as saleof under construction apartment shall besubjected to GST. Currently servicetax charge on 40% of project value,thus the effective servicetax rate is 6%, similarly effectivevat rate around 1% chargeon project valuein different state. We should waitfor what will betax rate on work contractin new tax regime. 2. Now, question arises in mind what will betreatment of composite contractrelated to movable property, the concept of compositesupply and mix supply has been insertin GST Law Nov, 2016. 3. Once it is clear thatwork contractwill be tax in GST as goods or service, the distinction between goods and service is relevantonly for Placeof supply and Pointof Taxation. 4. The transaction of sale/purchaseof immovableproperty shall beoutsidethe ambit of GST and shall beliableto stamp duty and property tax under state law.  2. A transaction of works contract,is now, sometimes, taxed twice; firstly as saleby the State Government and secondly as serviceby the Central Government. Works contracts can straddletwo taxableactivities asper the current law.There is of coursesupply of goods. Then, due to the very nature of the contract, there is supply of services. As of now, the supply of goods is taxablein the form of Value Added Tax (VAT), whilethe services element is taxableas servicetax. In law, there have been differingviews of the Supreme Court and the High Court’s on the applicability of this theory. The final word of the Apex court in BSNL and Others vs. Union of India (SC 2006) was that the aspects doctrinepertains to legislativecompetence and not the application of taxation on the same components of a transaction. At present, State VAT laws havespecific provisionsfor taxingworks contracts.To avoid taxingthe services element, these laws and associated rules providefor either separation of labour and materials or percentage deductions in transaction value.Another method is of prescription of a lower rate of tax in a composition/lump sumscheme for works contracts.The servicetax lawhas also provided for similar treatment to avoid taxation of saleof goods as partof a works contract. The overarching concept in a GST is one of supply which subsumes the concepts of sale of goods, provision of services and manufacture. In GST Model, goods as well as services will be taxed on a uniform rate. Therefore the dispute whether a transaction is subjected to VAT or Service tax comes to end. After article 246 of the Constitution,the following article shall be inserted, namely:—  246A. (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in articles 246 and 254, Parliament, and, subject to clause (2), the Legislature of every State, have power to make laws with respect to goods and services tax imposed by the Union or by such State. (2) Parliament has exclusive power to make laws with respect to goods and services tax where the supply of goods,or of services,or both takes place in the course of inter State trade or commerce. In article 366 of the Constitution,— (i) after clause (12), the following clause shall be inserted, namely:— ‘(12A) “goods and services tax” means any tax on supply of goods,or services or both except taxes on the supply of the alcoholic liquor for human consumption;’; All supply of goods or services or both will attractCGST (to be levied by Centre) and SGST (to be levied by State) unless kept out of purview of GST. GST will beapplicableeven when the transaction involves supply of both (goods and services).In effect, woks contracts will also attractGST. As GST will be applicableon supply ‘the erstwhiletaxableevents such as manufacture‘, sale‘,provision of services etc. will losetheir relevance.
