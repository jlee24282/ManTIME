<TITLE>Angela Simmons Stuns Fans With Post-Baby Photos As She Shares Weight Loss</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Angela Simmons isn’t letting the fact she’s a new mom slow her down when it comes to her workouts. 
 
The 29 year old Simmons welcomed her first child, a son named Sutton, in September and immediately started working on getting her pre baby body back. And it seems she’s managed to do just that in the four short months since giving birth. In fact, Angela shared images from her first time back in a bikini, and fans loved seeing the new mom’s physique in the two piece. 
 
Her followers left supportive comments on the post as they called her radiant and said she looks beautiful. 
  
“Look amazing!! You go girl!!”

TMZ  reported on the January 11 photo as the site called Angela a “hot momma.” The article detailed Angela’s post baby weight loss journey as she eats healthy and works out. 
 
“On Wednesday, Angela took to Instagram to reveal her post baby bikini bod while on vacation. Let’s just say it’s clear the new mom has been working out and eating healthy!” 
 
The site ended by stating Simmons is an inspiration to others as she shares her intense training regimen after having given birth just months before. 
 
“Wow, Angela looks great! We’re so happy to see the momma feeling confident and happy about her body. Way to inspire others to get healthy in positive ways, girl! You’re an inspiration.” 
 
Indeed, it seems as if Angela’s fans view her as an inspiration as they comment on her social media posts. Simmons also shared a beach photo two weeks ago that garnered the admiration of her fans and followers.

People took to commenting on how Angela is a natural beauty who achieved her figure through hard work and not plastic surgery. 
 
“All natural at its best” 
 
“You look absolutely amazing” 
 
“It’s called natural beauty. People so use to seeing fake a**** and forgets what a real a** looks like. She’s beautiful.” 
 
Angela has been open about her dedication to training as she loses the baby weight. She shares gym photos on a regular basis as she posts during boxing sessions and with her trainer. While Simmons is working at getting her pre baby back, the mother of one also stayed active during her pregnancy. She reportedly was into yoga while pregnant as she maintained her fitness. 
 
“…Angela Simmons’ pregnancy style also included a sporty look. The new mom says she kept active during pregnancy and enjoyed yoga on a regular basis.”

The Foods4BetterHealth site also stated Angela didn’t use yoga for weight loss, simply for staying healthy throughout her pregnancy. 
 
“Simmons also emphasizes that yoga isn’t for weight loss during pregnancy, but simply for staying healthy.” 
 
It seems this worked in her favor as Simmons has managed to drop the baby weight in the few months after giving birth. She isn’t shy about showing off her hard work, either. Angela is constantly posing for new photos to share with fans as she updates them on her progress. 
 
The Daily Mail also commented on Angela’s bikini body as she gets back in shape. The site said while taking some time away from her mommy duties, Angela took time to show off her incredible figure. 
 
“The 29 year old showed off her incredible figure in a patterned bikini and a sheer cover up – less than four months after giving birth to son Sutton Joseph.” 
 
The site also included photos of Simmons wearing a thong swimsuit as she put her booty on display. And while some of the comments on the article are less than friendly, it seems Angela’s fans support the new mom as she continues to post on social media.
