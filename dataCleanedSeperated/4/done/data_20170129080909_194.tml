<TITLE>Evaluating QBs an inexact science</TITLE>
<TEXT>
MOBILE — Coming into the week, Josh Dobbs understood the challenge ahead of him at the 2017 Senior Bowl.

It was the same challenge former Mississippi State quarterback Dak Prescott faced a year ago before he translated a MVP performance in the game into a fourth round NFL draft selection and one of the more surprising rookie campaigns since former third round pick Russell Wilson.

But while players making the rise from a second  or third day pick to a successful NFL starting quarterback are few, they show how picking quarterbacks is an inexact science.

“Quarterback is a different position than any other position, really,” Dobbs said Tuesday during Senior Bowl media night. “You’re evaluating college quarterbacks that all come from different schemes and have a different understanding of the game, and you’re trying to figure out which one can help your organization be the most successful in the shortest amount of time possible. So it’s a different animal.”

The biggest challenge is trying to determine if a quarterback’s skills — which are usually highlighted within the college game’s spread offenses — can translate to pro style systems.

“It’s definitely a different game. Even if you look at the (Senior Bowl) practice field, there’s three sets of hashes — high school, college and professional — so that creates a different type of football game,” Chicago Bears head coach John Fox, whose staff is coaching the North Team, said Tuesday. “From the quarterbacks and the systems, we had to spend 20 minutes last night working on the quarterback (being) under the center to be able to snap the ball. So that part’s different.”

But the challenges run deeper than snapping, a fact made evident by the varying amount of progress made within the most recent quarterback class.

Of the 15 quarterbacks drafted last year, only four attempted more than 85 passes in the NFL this past season — Los Angeles Rams’ Jared Goff, Philadelphia’s Carson Wentz, Cleveland’s Cody Kessler and Dallas’ Prescott.

Prescott was the surprise of this year’s class after being drafted in the fourth round, leading all rookies with 23 touchdowns to just four interceptions.

“It’s kind of like Tom Brady being a sixth round pick,” Fox said Tuesday. “If (the Patriots) knew he was going to be Tom Brady, they might not have waited until the sixth round, and it’s the same thing for Dak.”

Meanwhile, Goff and Wentz — the No. 1 and No. 2 overall picks — had completely different rookie seasons, with Wentz starting from Week 1 and finishing with a rookie best 3,782 yards. Goff started the final seven games but never looked comfortable, throwing seven interceptions to five touchdowns while completing just 54.6 percent of his passes.

“I think we put so much pressure on it, we promote those guys — you pump up Jared Goff, you bump up Carson Wentz — because you need one,” former Green Bay Packers assistant director of personnel Marc Lillibridge said Wednesday. “You know, if you want to have success, you’ve got to find a guy.”

In 2012 four quarterbacks were taken in the first round, but only No. 1 overall pick Andrew Luck and No. 8 pick Ryan Tannehill are consistent starters.

Washington’s Kirk Cousins — a fourth round pick — led all fifth year quarterbacks with 4,917 passing yards this season, while Wilson, a third round pick, led the Seahawks to their fifth straight postseason appearance.

“That’s the thing, you get mesmerized by certain (attributes), you put a guy in a box and you think he’s got to be this to win for us, but he doesn’t,” said Lillibridge, a former NFL scout and agent who now works in the private sector. “That’s why Seattle’s doing so well because they took a chance on a guy in Russell Wilson who doesn’t check a lot of boxes, and neither does Drew Brees.

“But they have some kind of moxy, something that works for them. And it’s tough — trust me, I’ve done a lot of quarterback reports, and I’ve missed on more than I’ve hit.”

But the one thing that separates the top quarterbacks from the rest is the ability to maintain poise and maneuver within the pocket, especially when faced against the speed of NFL defenses.

“Pass rush gives quarterbacks a lot of issues in the NFL. You’re seeing it with Jared Goff … that’s the toughest thing for quarterbacks,” said CBSSports.com senior NFL Draft analyst Dane Brugler. “The best in the NFL do it really well — Aaron Rodgers, obviously, Tom Brady, those guys do a great job of dealing with pressure and delivering downfield, and that’s something a lot of college quarterbacks don’t have to do.”

Whether a player like Dobbs, who started for the South in Saturday’s Senior Bowl and finished with 104 total yards and an interception on 12 of 15 passing, has what it takes to handle that is yet to be seen.

But as the 10th ranked quarterback in this year’s draft class — according to CBSSports.com’s positional rankings — and a third day option, Dobbs won’t face the same pressure to contribute early as expected first round options such as Clemson’s Deshaun Watson, North Carolina’s Mitch Trubinsky or Notre Dame’s DeShone Kizer.

“You don’t know what’s in a guy’s heart, you don’t know how he reads defenses,” Lillibridge said. “You try to put them through every scenario you possibly can. … But a lot of times you don’t know the competitive spirit in a guy’s head.”
