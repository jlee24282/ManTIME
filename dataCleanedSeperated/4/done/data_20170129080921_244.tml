An Academy spokesperson has criticised President Donald Trump s travel ban which could prevent Iranian filmmaker Asghar Farhadi, who is nominated for an Oscar, from attending next month s ceremony is Los Angeles. 
 
 The Academy celebrates achievement in the art of filmmaking, which seeks to transcend borders and speak to audiences around the world, regardless of national, ethnic, or religious differences,  the statement said.

US tech leaders alarmed over immigration 
 
The leaders of US technology companies have expressed alarm at President Donald Trump s sudden executive order on immigration. 
    
 As supporters of filmmakers   and the human rights of all people   around the globe, we find it extremely troubling that Asghar Farhadi, the director of the Oscar winning film  A Separatio n, along with the cast and crew of this year s Oscar nominated film  The Salesman , could be barred from entering the country because of their religion or country of origin.  
 
Trump signed the executive order on Friday to suspend entry of refugees to the US for 120 days, and imposed an indefinite ban on refugees from Syria. 
 
A 90 day ban was also placed on citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. 
 
The 2017 Oscars will take place on February 26.
