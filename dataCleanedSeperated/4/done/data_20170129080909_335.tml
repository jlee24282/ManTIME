<TEXT>
:29 
 
A draw seems the most likely outcome when play resumes on the fourth and final day of the Sunfoil Series match between the Multiply Titans and the BuildNat Cape Cobras in Centurion on Sunday. 
 
Live Scoring: Titans v Cobras 
 
With most of the match being plagued by rain and bad light the hosts will continue their second innings on 20 without loss, still needing 111 runs to make their opponents bat again at SuperSport Park. 
 
Openers Aiden Markram and Heino Kuhn will pick up their knocks on 6 and 14 respectively.
