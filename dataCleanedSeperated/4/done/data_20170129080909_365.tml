Tomorrow, Saturday, two weeks after Birna Brjánsdóttir went missing after a night out in Reykjavik and found washed ashore last week after having been murdered, thousands of Icelanders will be walking down Laugavegur with candles in her memory.  
 
The march for Birna starts at Laugavegur no.31 where she disappeared, at 4 pm towards Arnarhóll, the hil in the city centre  where the statue of Viking Ingólfur Arnarson is situated. Candles will bbe placed at Arnarhóll and there will be one minute of silence.  
 
Organisers of the march did not know Birna s family but received the family s permission. Icelanders as a whole have been enormously touched by the tragic course of events.  
 
As to the where the investigation is currently situated, police say that nothing points to the fact that Birna was hit by a car but would not disclose what the coroner s investigation has revealed about the cause of death.  Police have previously stated that Birna was indeed murdered.  
 
The two suspects are still in isolation custody.
