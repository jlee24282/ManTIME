<TITLE>Iran Responds To Trump's Muslim Ban, Also Bans US Citizens</TITLE>
<TEXT>
In response to President Donald Trumps executive order restricting entry of travelers from seven Muslim majority countries including Iran the Iranian government has responded announcing it would also not allow Americans to enter its country 

On Saturday Iran’s Foreign Ministry released a statement on state run media saying 

 While respecting the American people and distinguishing between them and the hostile policies of the US government Iran will implement the principle of reciprocity until the offensive US limitations against Iranian nationals are lifted The restrictions against travel by Muslims to America are an open affront against the Muslim world and the Iranian nation in particular and will be known as a great gift to extremists  Iranian President Hassan Rouhani condemned President Trump’s actions in an address at a tourism conference in Tehran televised live on Saturday on state television 

 Today is not the time to erect walls between nations They have forgotten that the Berlin wall fell years ago 

 To annul world trade accords does not help their economy and does not serve the development and blooming of the world economy This is the day for the world to get closer through trade  he said
