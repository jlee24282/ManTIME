United States 
    Rooftop solar demand was already fairly weak in 2016, leading to all rooftop solar companies to cut back on installation growth projections. At this point, it s unlikely there will be much installation growth at all in late 2016 and early 2017. That s why any pressure on demand will be a negative, even if it starts in states like Indiana and Wyoming, which have very little solar.  
To Mr Know it all aka Solarman: this proves your an A hole. How many times did you say the Residential Market is not 
Down ? Read my lips Mr Know It all: 
  Rooftop Solar Demand is Weak  . Repeat it ten times and mark it on your Tin hat with a Magic Marker !!!! Your so caught up in your BS you can t see a Mack Truck if it was in your face !!!!
