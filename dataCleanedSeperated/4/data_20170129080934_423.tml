<TITLE>Cafe starts morning comedy skits for people going to work (2017/1/29)</TITLE>
<TEXT>
A Tokyo branch of cafe restaurant chain Pronto has begun holding morning comedy skits to lighten people s moods before they head to work. 
 
The skits at the eatery s Kanda store in Tokyo s Chiyoda Ward were planned to boost morning sales, which are already doing well. For about 25 minutes starting at 8 a.m. on Jan. 18, around 50 people watched three comedy skits performed by professional actors in a space on the shop s second floor. 
 
Sayaka Tomita, 31, from Nagareyama, Chiba Prefecture, said,  The topics of the skits were everyday and funny, so I think it d be easy to come to this even for people who aren t used to live performances.  
 
The morning skits come with a start the day set that includes coffee, toast and salad, a drink certificate usable at night when the cafe becomes a bar, and the morning edition of the Mainichi Shimbun newspaper, for 1,000 yen, tax included. Chikako Hirose, the head of the Pronto Corp. s PR department, says,  We want people to charge their batteries and go to work feeling good.  
 
The skits will be held on Tuesdays and Wednesdays through Feb. 14. For tickets and inquiries, the Kanda cafe can be reached at 03 3254 8202 (in Japanese language only).
