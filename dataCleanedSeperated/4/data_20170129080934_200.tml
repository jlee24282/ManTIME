<TITLE>Michigan City Marquette ekes past Winamac</TITLE>
<TEXT>
WINAMAC â€” This one could ve been described as a championship prize fight instead of a basketball game. No, there were no fisticuffs in this one but you could say that each team traded punches throughout the entirety of the contest. When the final horn sounded it was a solid Michigan City Marquette Catholic squad escaping with a 58 55 win over an equally solid Winamac. 
 
 Rebounding and transition were the two areas that really did us in tonight,  Winamac coach Kyle Johnson said.  Many of their offensive rebounds were eventually turned into baskets and that hurt us. I liked how our guys competed and I like how our younger guys came in and did some good things but our rebounding tonight hurt us. But we knew coming in Marquette was going to do that.  
 
From the opening tip it was apparent that these two teams were going to battle. Both squads were playing a tight man defense while both offenses were looking to attack. In the first quarter both teams were able to claim a four point lead over the other before the other would come back to tie the game up. At the first break though it was Marquette squeezing out a slim 14 12 lead. 
 
By the 5:00 mark of the second quarter the Blazers had claimed a three point lead over the Warriors. A long 3 pointer by Max Willoughby extended their lead to six, their biggest lead up to that point. With their next possession though Winamac s Sam Griffeth answered with his own bomb to again make it a three point game at 21 18. 
 
Moments later an amazing shovel pass from Jack DeGroot to Calvin Larkin ties the game at 22 22. Then for the rest of the quarter both teams traded blows. A Marquette basket was followed up by a jumper from Austin Brandt to tie it at 24 24. Another Blazer score was then followed up by a pair of free throws by DeGroot to tie it at 26 26 with :24 left before the half. 
 
With one last chance to claim a lead before the break, Marquette held for the last shot. With time winding down Buddy Jaffee dialed long distance but his shot was off the mark and the teams went into halftime knotted at 26 26. 
 
The first two minutes of the third quarter is where the Warriors let this one get away from them. Winamac was simply outhustled in transition as Marquette went on a 8 0 run with their points coming in transition. 
 
Johnson called a timeout at the 6:04 mark to re focus his team and the ploy worked. Coming out of the break the Warriors responded by getting the ball inside to Caleb Smith for two points to end the run. Winamac kept fighting, and moments later DeGroot drained a 3 to get Winamac to within five at 38 33. 
 
Following a Blazer turnover Smith drains two free throws to get his team to within three at 38 35. Winamac got to within a single point with :44 left in the third when Larkin too connected on a pair of freebies. Christian Cruz answered the free throws with one from behind the arc before the buzzer to give Marquette a 43 39 lead going into the final quarter. 
 
Marquette opened the fourth quarter similar to what they did in the third by going on a short run. This time a 4 0 start gave the Blazers an eight point lead before DeGroot would get Winamac on the board again. The Blazers would extend their lead to nine points before Winamac started chipping into the lead. By the :24 mark DeGroot again hits from long range to make it a 54 50 game. Marquette answered with a pair of free throws to go back up six at 56 50. DeGroot again answered with a three to make it 56 53 with :10 left to play. Winamac quickly fouled Colin Kenney and the sophomore calmly hit both free throws to make it a 58 53 game with :08 left. The Warriors final points came with :01 left in the game when Larkin was put on the line for a pair to make it the 58 55 final score. 
 
 We talked all week in practice about convergence and we did that poorly tonight. We got beat in transition, a lot. They just outhustled us to start the third quarter and that will not happen again,  said Larkin. 
 
Marquette (12 6) was led in scoring by Willoughby with a game high 19 points. Jaffee, Chandler Goodwin and Kenney each finished with eight. 
 
Winamac (12 3) was led by 18 points from DeGroot. Larkin tossed in 14 followed by Smith with 10 points of his own. 
 
The Winamac JV squad also had a battle on their hands in the opening game against the younger Blazers. A close first half saw the Warriors enter half time with a 22 18 lead. During the break adjustments were made and when play resumed in the second half Winamac began to slowly pull away. By the 1:02 mark of the fourth quarter Marquette had gotten to within five at 46 41. Winamac outscored the Blazers 6 0 the rest of the way to claim the win 52 41 to remain perfect on the season at 15 0. 
 
Sam Griffeth led the Warriors with 16 points while Thorn Loehmer pitched in nine and Austin Brandt added eight.
