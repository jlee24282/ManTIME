<TITLE>Commentary: Christians, donâ€™t be fooled: Trump has deep religious convictions</TITLE>
<TEXT>
There is nothing, in Trump s view, Americans cannot accomplish as long as we believe in ourselves and our country. But Christians do not believe in ourselves or our country. We believe in God, but we do more than believe in God. We worship God. Nothing else is to be worshipped.

Christians have a word to describe the worship of that which is not God: idolatry. Idolatry, of course, can be a quite impressive form of devotion. The only difficulty is idolaters usually end up killing someone for calling into question their  god.
