<TITLE>Geo-tracking starts PMAY housing in</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Tripura Urban Development Minister Manik Dey today claimed that the state has become the first state to conduct Geo tracking successfully to implement Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) housing. He said as many as 7000 Geo Tracking has been completed in the state so far and fund deposited to the accounts of 5000 beneficiaries. The beneficiaries will get Rs 1.5 lakh at five phases from the central government under the project. Dey said the state government will provide Rs 16.66 lakh to the beneficiaries. The beneficiaries will get Rs 30.000 from Centre at each phase. The next phase will be sanctioned after completion of work by the fund from previous phase. The project cost for each house is Rs 2.71 lakh. It seems that the beneficiaries will have to spent large amount to complete the house under the project. The funds for PMSY are being approved by the State Government after receiving bond signature to stop misappropriation of fund under the project. Altogether 42,896 houses approved for the state and houses are being approved to the beneficiaries irrespective of political identity. Meanwhile higher officials under Ministry of Urban Development visited the state and appreciated the initiative of the State Government to implement PMAY project. UNI BB KK
