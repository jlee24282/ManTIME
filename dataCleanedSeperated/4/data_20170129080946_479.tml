New Delhi: U 19 Indian cricket team physical fitness trainer Rajesh Sawant (40) was found dead in a private hotel in south Mumbai. A day ahead of the team’s first ODI against England U 19s. 
 
When Sawant did not report for the team’s training activities in the morning, his room at the team hotel was checked and he was found to have passed away in his room, reportedly in sleep. 
 
“What I have gathered so far is he did not report for team activities in the morning, so people started looking for him and eventually he was found to have been passed away in his room,” Amitabh Choudhary, the Board of Control for Cricket in India joint secretary, was quoted as saying by Sportstar 
 
India’ U 19 team, coached by Rahul Dravid, is scheduled to play five 50 over games and two four day games against England Under 19, beginning on Monday at the Wankhede stadium. 
 
Sawant had been part of the Afghanistan coaching staff in the past and worked with the India A teams that played the England XI in the two List A matches earlier this month. The 40 year was also with the Cheteshwar Pujara led Rest of India team that defeated Gujarat by six wickets in the Irani Cup.
