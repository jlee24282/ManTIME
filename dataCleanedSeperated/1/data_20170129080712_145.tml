<TITLE>Serena to play fewer tournaments to aid grand slam quest</TITLE>
<TEXT>

MELBOURNE, (Reuters)   Serena Williams plans to play fewer tournaments in the future to aid her quest to win more grand slam titles, according to her coach Patrick Mouratoglou. 
    
The 35 year old American won her 23rd grand slam title on Saturday at the Australian Open, breaking the open era record she held jointly with Germany’s Steffi Graf. 
    
Serena will now manage her schedule as she chases down the all time leader Margaret Court, the Australian whose record of 24 grand slam titles straddled the amateur and professional eras. 
    
 Mentally she has to stay fresh and mentally excited when the grand slams start, because they are the goal,  Mouratoglou told a group of reporters after Serena’s 6 4, 6 4 victory over her sister Venus Williams gave her a seventh Australian Open title. 
    
 So we have a lighter schedule – not lighter than last year, which would be difficult (when she played just eight events and did not play after September)   but lighter than the year before (11 events).  
    
At one stage in 2016, Serena held the world number one ranking based only on seven events over a 52 week period. 
    
Germany’s Angelique Kerber overtook her when she won the U.S. Open last September but Serena will return to top spot when the rankings are updated on Monday. 
    
Serena has traditionally played fewer tournaments than most top players, but since she usually reaches the final, she is able to pick and choose.
