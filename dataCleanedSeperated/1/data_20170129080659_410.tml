<TITLE>Lynn Classical edges Beverly boys hoops in clash of titans</TITLE>
<TEXT>
By The two top teams in the Northeastern Conference squared off on Friday night and didn’t disappoint. 
 
Leader and undefeated Lynn Classical took a 68 65 victory over Beverly on a night where the Rams hit 10 3 pointers. 
 
Lynn’s offense proved to be too strong for the Panthers, as the hosts were playing from behind the whole night. 
 
The Rams were led offensively by the Solis brothers, who combined for 32 points, most coming from beyond the arc. The Rams also had a massive effort from Deontae Plouffe, who chipped in 16 points and nine rebounds. Lastly, Dyrell Rucker had 13 of his own. 
 
Lynn Classical’s high scoring and athletic offense kept them in front by a large margin for most of the game. 
 
Beverly, having played from behind, made things interesting late. The Panthers had a monstrous effort from senior captain Patrick Gavin who scored a game high 30 points and five rebounds. 
 
Junior guard Luigi Derrane also had a great night, connecting on three 3 pointers and 17 points. Hugh Calice provided some muscle down low as he quietly had eight points and five rebounds. 
 
The Panthers put up a great fight as the home crowd helped bring them back into the game, erasing a 16 point deficit in the fourth quarter. With 10 seconds left, Beverly had a shot to tie the game as Derrane’s 3 point effort fell short and the Rams came out on top to remain undefeated. 
 
Lynn Classical’s athleticism and quick ball movement was the key to success for an undersized but versatile team that only features three seniors. With the win, Lynn Classical moved to 9 0 in the conference and Beverly fell to 7 3. 
 
The Panthers could take away quite a few positives from this effort as Gavin had a career day and Beverly would not go down without a fight. 
 
Both of these teams are poised for postseason runs as the offense behind the arc will keep them in any game. Beverly proved they are here to stay even with the narrow loss to the league leaders.
