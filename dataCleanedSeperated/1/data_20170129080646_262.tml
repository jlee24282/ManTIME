<TITLE>Is This €60m Bundesliga Superstar The Perfect Replacement For Alexis Sanchez At Arsenal?</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Arsenal are on the verge of a decent season (yet again) but they’re once again falling short of their championship goals, mainly due to Antonio Conte’s team incredible surge. So they’re probably going to focus their efforts in the UEFA Champions League until the end of the season. 
 
Nevertheless, they have other issues that need to be fixed in order to face the next campaign, as they’re in a big danger of losing two of their most important players and they need to be planning ahead if they don’t want the next season to become a nightmare from start to finish. 
 
And over the course of the last few weeks, the rumour that states that Marco Reus is the main priority on Arsene Wenger’s agenda and is just getting stronger and stronger, and it seems like the Gunners are keen to make a €60m bid for the former Borussia Monchengladbach star. 
 
Even if he hasn’t been able to contribute for his team on a regular basis over the course of this season, it seems like the extremely talented, yet extremely injury prone Borussia Dortmund and Germany star Marco Reus is once again on Wenger’s team radar. 
 
Apparently, the veteran boss wants Reus to be a potential Alexis Sanchez replacement if (when) the Chilean star decides to leave the Emirates Stadium, as Sanchez has been strongly linked with a move to the Italian Serie A , where he already thrived playing with Udinese before making his great jump to FC Barcelona. 
 

 
Reus is arguably the most versatile offensive player in Germany since his surge at Monchengladbach, with the ability to play on either flank of the pitch, as an offensive midfielder and even as a pure striker, being a lethal player wherever his boss decides to use him. 
 
Over the course of the year, Marco has only been able to step on the pitch 5 times and has scored 1 goal to go along with 3 assists, showing no signs of rust and demonstrating that value and incredible talent that once made him one of the most scouted players in the world. Of course, he has had his injury issues, but whenever he is on the field, he is a threat 
 
During Klopp’s Dortmund spell, Reus was probably the most important player in a team that also featured Mario Gotze, Matt Hummels, Robert Lewandowski, Shinji Kagawa and Nuri Sahin, but unfortunately, injuries stopped him in becoming one of the top 3 players in the world, even missing the last World Cup where Germany took the trophy back home. 
 
Reus could totally be a more than capable replacement for Sanchez, or for every single star in the world, as a matter of fact, considering how extremely talented the forward is with both feet, his ability to make plays and his outstanding pace, as well as his breathtaking passing and finishing abilities. 
 
Nevertheless, considering his long and sad history with several injuries, Arsenal is on the verge of making one of the riskiest signings in history, so let’s hope it all works out fine for both parties.
