<TITLE>France bans free soft drink refills over obesity and diabetes</TITLE>
<TEXT>
France has banned restaurants from offering free soft drink refills over the risk of obesity and diabetes. The ban which was first passed in April 2015, took effect on Friday, January 27, 2017 after the government said no restaurants should offer unlimited refill of soda and other sugary drinks for free.
