<TITLE>Clippers notebook: Marreese Speights no longer shy from long range</TITLE>
<TEXT>
OAKLAND  gt; gt; It’s hard for Doc Rivers to believe there was once a time when reserve big man Marreese Speights had to be encouraged to shoot the ball. 
 
“When Mo gets it –we have a theory – he’s shooting it,” Rivers said. “He shoots anything leather. Throw a chair, a shoe (at him), he’s going to shoot it.” 
 
But there once was a time where Speights wouldn’t drift beyond the 3 point line, a place once reserved for the league’s guards. 
 
But when Steve Kerr got hired to coach the Golden State Warriors and Speights, he decided to see if the 6 foot 10 big man had a little Larry Bird in him. 
 
“I went to him and said, ‘Do you think you could take one more step out and become a 3 point shooter?” Kerr remembered. “I watched a ton of tape of him when I got the job and he was making one 22 footer after another. He was a pick and pop guy. He had a big Game 7 against the Clippers the previous year and had 10 or 12 points in limited minutes and hit some huge shots. But, he was never outside of that line. 
 
“I just asked him what he thought.” 
 
In the first year after they spoke, Speights actually took 13 fewer 3’s than he did the season before. But last year, his second with Kerr, Speights launched 62 3’s – a new career high. And after making 38.7 percent of them, he signed with Clippers and got the greenest of lights. 
 
Prior to Saturday’s game back in Oakland, Speights had taken 166 3 point shots — more than he attempted over his entire career. 
 
“It’s been natural for him,” Rivers said. “Three’s aren’t a hard shot for him. You can see it. It’s a natural shot. ... Telling Mo to shoot is not that hard to do.” 
 
The increased volume hasn’t come with a dip in efficiency, with Speights making over 40 percent from deep this year. 
 
“I think he spent a lot of time in that offseason two summers ago, really working on his 3 point shot. He just seemed to get more comfortable with it last year, and this year, he’s automatic.” 
 DJ an ‘automatic’ All Star  
Prior to DeAndre Jordan turning in kind of a stinker Saturday night, the Warriors’ head coach sure made it seem like he voted to include Jordan on the Western Conference All Star team. 
 
“He absolutely deserved it,” Kerr said. “He was, to me, one of the automatics when you consider what he does night in and night out.” 
 
Kerr said he loves the way the Clippers’ defensive minded center plays. 
 
“We used to always say you know guys of value on the other team, offensively or defensively,” Rivers said. “There are certain guys who you know bother your team when they’re on the floor. When D.J. is on the floor, he bothers the other team.” 
 
 Quick hits  
Doc Rivers continues to battle an undiagnosed illness. “It’s hasn’t been fun,” he said. “It’s been three weeks now, so it’s not been a fun stretch. I’ll get through it. I just want to find out what the hell it is to be honest.” ... Jordan attended a funeral for a cousin he called “his older brother” early Saturday in Texas before meeting the team in the Bay Area before the game. ... Raymond Felton, the shortest active Clipper, led the team with seven rebounds.
