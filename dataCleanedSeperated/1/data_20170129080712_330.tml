<TITLE>More high school students take classes through universities</TITLE>
<TEXT>
SIOUX FALLS, S.D. | South Dakota students aren t waiting for graduation to start college. 
   
The number of high school students taking classes through state universities more than tripled since 2014. 
   
The surge is helping state universities pad what otherwise would be declining enrollment numbers. If the rapid growth continues, the program s success could threaten its sustainability. 
   
State leaders are happy to see the dual credit program succeeding after a multi million dollar investment. South Dakota started the program in 2014, allowing high school students to take discounted college courses for high school and college credit, the Argus Leader ( http://argusne.ws/2jQVzWF ) reports. It s aimed at making college more affordable. 
   
Regents say the pool of eligible students would likely run dry before the program becomes a financial burden, but if it doesn t, or if state funding stagnates, regents would need to consider changes. 
   
 We ll continue supporting it for as long as it makes sense to do so,  said Randy Schaefer, president of the Board of Regents. 
   
Gov. Dennis Daugaard has been a voice of strong support for dual credit courses, and in his recent budget address he proposed increasing funding for the program. 
   
When the state first began the program, demand overwhelmed initial projections. 
   
 There was far more interest in the program than we ever anticipated,  said Paul Turman, vice president for academic affairs for the regents. 
   
Dual credit costs the state $2 million, but it brings $4 million in savings to South Dakota students and families, said Tony Venhuizen, the governor s chief of staff. 
   
Maia Gabrielson, a 17 year old Roosevelt High School senior, is one of about 80 students in the Sioux Falls School District taking dual credit courses. 
   
 I wanted to get a head start on my college courses,  Gabrielson said. 
   
She completed algebra and composition classes and is enrolled in speech and government during the spring semester. The goal is to get generals out of the way so she can focus on her physical therapy major when she enrolls in the University of South Dakota this fall. 
   
Gabrielson maintains a 4.0 GPA, works two jobs and participates in varsity cheerleading. She said many of her friends take dual credit courses, and all of them are equally involved and hard working. 
   
 A lot of teachers encourage us to take these classes because they are cheaper and they know we can do it,  Gabrielson said. 
   
High school students pay only about $48 per credit hour, compared with close to $300 for other students in the state s four year colleges. The state kicks in another $105 per credit as part of a special negotiated tuition rate with state universities. 
   
That s money well spent to Schaefer. He said the number one priority for regents is affordability, and the affordability of dual credit  far outweighs  any potential loss or gain in revenue. 
   
So far, the regents haven t lost money on dual credit courses.

The potential revenue lost through the lower tuition rate nearly balances out the money paid in by the state and dual credit students with a net gain of more than $35,000, according to a report presented to the Board of Regents in October. 
   
If the program continues to grow at the current rate, though, revenue losses could become a problem. 
   
For now, dual credit students are filling open seats in existing course sections, meaning that the fixed cost of offering the class isn t changing. If enough students enroll and require schools to offer additional courses, costs would go up. 
   
Dual credit tuition also doesn t account for general education versus high level courses. A 100 level sociology course uses fewer materials and expenses than a 300 level chemistry course, but dual credit tuition doesn t vary to account for those differences. 
   
 We may need to assess whether or not in the future 300  and 400 level courses need to be at a higher rate to pay for themselves,  Turman said. 
   
It s too soon to tell how any potential monetary concerns will affect the sustainability of dual credit classes in the future, he added. 
   
For now, though, the benefits outweigh the costs. 
   
Having high school students participating in college classes benefits the instructors too, said Michael Card, associate provost and dean of distance education at USD. 
   
 By adding high school students to our existing sections of courses,  Card said.  We get a degree of enthusiasm in an online course that you ordinarily wouldn t get.
