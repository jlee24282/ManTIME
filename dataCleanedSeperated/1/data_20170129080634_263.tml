<TITLE>Chiloquin pedophile goes on 'Dr. Phil'</TITLE>
<TEXT>
By Authorities say a Chiloquin man committed no crime when he admitted to being a pedophile during an episode of  Dr. Phil  Monday, despite calls for action from some in the community. 
 
Gary Gibson, 65, described himself as a “virtuous pedophile” while appearing on the CBS program and said, though he is attracted to young girls, he does not act on his impulses. 
 
Gibson said he came forward to offer help to those in similar situations through groups such as nonprofit Association for Sexual Abuse Prevention, founded by Gibson and others in 2015. But many Chiloquin residents have said they see Gibson’s admission as a threat to their community. 
 
“People need to know this disgusting filth lives here,” said Alisha Hansen in a Facebook comment to the Herald  amp; News. 
 
“There should be an investigation going on with this pedophile, and any information shared would be of great value in putting this guy away,” said John Shaw on the Chiloquin Community Watch page. 
 
However, Klamath County Sheriff Chris Kaber said, unless Gibson is suspected of a specific crime or a victim comes forward, his agency has no grounds to open an investigation. 
 
“Someone merely admitting he has attractions or impulses toward any criminal activity is not enough for the sheriff’s office to investigate,” said Kaber. 
 
After the episode aired, Kaber said his office was contacted by at least one person wishing to voice concerns, though Kaber said he had not yet seen the interview himself. While he understands why people may be upset, Kaber said Gibson’s admission alone does not give the sheriff’s office reason to take action. 
 
“We investigate suspected crimes or actual crimes ... but not thought crimes, for lack of a better word,” said Kaber. 
 
Gibson has been accused by at least one alleged victim: former foster daughter Jazzmyne Holden, who accused Gibson on the show of raping her while she was in his care roughly 10 years ago. Holden, now 20, said she and her sister stayed with Gibson and his wife, Tabitha Abel, for three months before being removed after Gibson was accused of molesting girls in his care, according to Holden. 
 
Abel also appeared on the show in support of Gibson and said she believes her husband when he said he has not abused any children. Abel has known of Gibson’s attraction to girls since 2011 and helped him found ASAP. 
 
Holden said she did not remember specifically what happened but recalled “pain where I shouldn’t been having pain.” On air Gibson said, if Holden believes she was abused, he does not deny it happened but said he was not the one who abused her. 
 
Klamath County District Attorney Rob Patridge confirmed Holden’s allegations were investigated in 2011 by the Multidisciplinary Task Force of Oregon State Police, who determined there was not enough evidence to bring charges. Patridge said Gibson volunteered to take a polygraph test during the investigation, but later declined on the advice of his attorney. 
 
Patridge said he has seen Gibson’s segment on  Dr. Phil  and said, based on statements made by Gibson and others during the program, there is no reason for his office to file charges or reopen the 2011 investigation. 
 
Kaber also said, since authorities are in no position to take action, it would be unwise and possibly illegal for residents to conduct their own investigations or attempt to take Gibson into custody. 
 
“If they take some sort of criminal conduct against a citizen that has not committed any crimes, then that would be foolish,” said Kaber. 
 
He added Gibson has lived peaceably in the community for a number of years, and his admission of pedophilia should not make a difference in his behavior. 
 
When interviewed by the Herald and News, Gibson said he is not surprised by a negative response within the community and said he has received death threats since the episode aired. 
 
“My wife especially is feeling threatened,” he said. 
 
But Gibson said he does not regret coming forward, as it is still his goal to help those struggling with pedophilia. 
 
“We understand people’s anger but they’re misunderstanding that pedophilia equals child molestation,” said Gibson. 
 
Gibson said, while he believes the episode depicted some of his statements out of context, he believes he was given “a fair shake” overall and appreciated an opportunity to speak out.
