<TITLE>The agony of life minus football, pt. 1</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Now is the second worst time of the season for pro football partisans.  
I am speaking about the annual 2 week break between the conference title games and the Super Bowl. 
 
The worst time is the time period after the Super Bowl, when you have no football (I’ll wait and see as to what happens with the new Chinese League and the Independent League forming as we speak for this spring). 
 
All you will have is the usual comings and goings of players, who will retire, who will come back, who is rehabbing such and such an injury and so forth. 
 
One wonders if the trend to retire early due to fears about concussions and such will continue this off season. 
 
I know there is the NFL Draft — aka the National Holiday — in late April that will stoke lots of interest (with the NFL Combine being a huge part of the workup to it) but it isn’t the same. 
 
I know more than a few people throughout our nation have stopped watching football for this reason or that one — one of the biggest was the Colin Kaepernick fiasco and the reaction to it; I have gotten on some forums and fan sites and have read the comments — but by no means was it the only one. 
 
I don’t know if this is a continuing trend, either, or if the fans who left will flock back or if more fans will join the leavers. 
 
One never knows for the future but the NFL better wake up to the idea that they are not too big to fail, that they are too big for their britches. 
 
The NBA, either. 
 
I’m not predicting the demise of any league or such but they’d better be careful or people just may take issue with what some coach or player says about something and they are done. 
 
Especially in this day and age’s social media, that stuff can grow like wildfire and if more than a few people pick up on it and keep spreading it, it can ruin lives. 
 
This is especially true if people start realizing how much our professional athletes really make — not just from contracts but endorsements and other ways — and how far removed many of them are from you and I. 
 
Where many of them come from poor backgrounds, they only “know” of places they could only dream about before.

Back to the 2 week period between the conference championships and the Super Bowl (Now you know why I call it “Musings”). 
 
I have never been a fan of this break. I understand that much of it has to do with the build up to the Big Game and the chance for tons of media personnel to dig through every nook and cranny of a team and its players to try and get “the story.” 
 
The Super Bowl has become a big international event. 
 
I can still remember the fiasco with The Beast, Marshawn Lynch, and his repeated answer a couple of years ago — “I’m just here so I won’t get fined.” 
 
The fact that media people kept asking him anything leaves me to wonder about them as media people. 
 
Then when he “breaks his silence” after his Seahawks got beat by basically ripping his coach for not giving him the ball on the goal line at the end, saying the only reason he didn’t was they didn’t want him to be the MVP, that got me thinking maybe that is the reason he doesn’t like to talk to the media. 
 
He has nothing of value to really say. 
 
I understand it can get boring and tiring to be constantly asked questions about this or that but, hey, you are well paid to be playing this game and you ARE playing in this game. 
 
Be thankful anyone cares! 
 
Many of us wish we could have had the opportunity to play at such a high level but we weren’t born 6 7, or didn’t have the quickest first step or could never run a 4 3 4
