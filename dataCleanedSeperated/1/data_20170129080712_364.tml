<TITLE>'I have to slow them down rather than push them' - Koeman in awe of English youth hunger</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Everton manager Ronald Koeman has urged Premier League clubs to give English youngsters a chance to succeed in the first team, admiring their hunger to succeed. 
 
Sane, Sterling  amp; Jesus hint at bright Man City future 
 
Most of England s top sides have the luxury of luring foreign talent to England but Koeman wants more time invested into home grown youth. 
 
Impressed with the attitude of emerging youngsters in the country, the Dutchman indicated he has grown even more aware of the quality of youth since moving to England in 2014. 
 
And he believes the nation s youngsters boast a unique hunger and approach to the game not typical of even the famed academies in the Netherlands. 
 
 Clubs in the Premier League have bought many foreign players over the years and I acknowledge that sometimes it is necessary,  Koeman told reporters. 
 
 But here in England, my admiration for the bulk of talent in the academies has grown massively. I admire the attitude, the spirit and the values of young English footballers. They have an incredible desire. 
 
Liverpool are closing in on crisis territory 
 
 I have no worries about their motivation and I feel I actually have to slow them down rather than push them forward. 
 
 Young British players have a spirit, which I don t see in the Netherlands or other countries where I used to work. 
 
 There is a different culture here. The problem is that managers here wait a long time before they launch young players. 
 
Welbeck shows he can be Arsenal regular 
 
 If a player has the talent, my motto is that you must give him the stage to show it. 
 
 But maybe it is because I am Dutch and I am used to throwing the boys in at the deep end.  
 
Everton are seventh in the Premier League, seven points adrift of the European places after 22 rounds.
