<TEXT>
More than 350 travelers have been blocked from entering or traveling to the United States a day after President Donald Trump signed an executive order covering seven Muslim majority countries, Reuters reported Saturday, quoting officials of the Homeland Security Department.

A federal judge on Saturday issued an emergency stay temporarily blocking the U.S. government from sending people out of the country after they have landed at a U.S. airport with valid visas, it said.

The department said 375 travelers had been affected by Trump s order, of whom 109 were in transit and denied entry, and 173 were not allowed to get on flights abroad, according to news reports.
