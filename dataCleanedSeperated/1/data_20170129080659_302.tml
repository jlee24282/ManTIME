<TITLE>OUR VIEW: Hope for the homeless</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Why did The Neighborhood Center succeed? Because like Hope Place, it had its ducks in a row.

Last week, the local leaders responsible for Hope Place, a new facility in Daytona Beach for homeless families with children, held a groundbreaking ceremony at the former Hurst Elementary School. It was symbolically important, not just for what it means for Hope Place, but also for showing the community what can — and must — be accomplished with regard to other sectors of homelessness.

The dozens of community volunteers, social service administrators and elected officials crowded into a small, former classroom represented the collective support that was required to make Hope Place a reality. Forough Hosseini, founder and chair of Food Brings Hope, a local organization that helps feed needy families, was the driving force who had one goal in mind: that no child should be homeless. She enlisted the help of Mark Geallis, executive director of Halifax Urban Ministries, which will run and operate the shelter, as well as others to create a plan and draft a proposal.

They knew they needed the approval of the school district and School Board to sell the Hurst building and property, as well as financial support from Volusia County. Hosseini spent months negotiating behind the scenes, laying the groundwork. She initially asked County Manager Jim Dinneen for $1.5 million to acquire renovate the former school, but he said once he was sold on the project he convinced her the county needed to give $3.5 million to do Hope Place right.

That came with one major caveat: It would be a one time appropriation. Under no circumstances would the county provide operating expenses.

So Hope Place has had to persuade several municipalities to pitch in $200,000 every year in addition to what Hosseini hopes to raise from private donors. Local hotels are donating furniture, and businesses are donating building materials.

Hope Place is an ambitious project with a lot of moving parts. That it is advancing toward fruition while other proposed homeless solutions have stalled is explained in part by the fact that families with children are an easier sell with a higher chance of success. Most are temporarily homeless because they are down on their luck, and are eager to get back on their feet and become independent again. They are not the chronic adult homeless who hang out in public areas and panhandle, many of whom suffer from mental illness and/or substance abuse. Those cases are more difficult to treat.

But Hope Place also received so much community support because its sponsors had a well conceived plan and demonstrated strong leadership and commitment. To prove that success is not limited to families in need, the County Council recently unanimously approved giving $1.13 million to construct a 5,000 square foot expansion of The Neighborhood Center of West Volusia in DeLand. The nonprofit will add 20 shelter beds and provide the homeless with services. In December, the DeLand City Commission approved spending $50,000 annually for five years on the shelter. The city’s support was crucial to securing the county’s contribution.

Why did The Neighborhood Center succeed? Because like Hope Place, it had its ducks in a row.

Meanwhile, Daytona Beach, the county, other municipalities and the social services community continue to be fractured over a solution for the hardcore homeless, such as whether it should be a comprehensive shelter (and where it would be located) or a housing first approach. Plenty of ideas have been batted around, but there’s been no consensus. No leader has emerged to rally stakeholders around a strategy, and until that happens there will be no funding available.

As its name implies, Hope Place provides optimism for those in need. But it also provides the prospect that its template can be used to effect positive change in other areas of homelessness.
