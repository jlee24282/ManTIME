<TITLE>US Homeland Security will comply with judges</TITLE>
<TEXT>
The US Department of Homeland Security has said in a statement it would  comply with judicial orders  but that President Donald Trump s executive action restricting entry into the country from seven Muslim majority nations remains in place. 
 
The statement was issued hours after a federal judge in New York blocked the deportation of dozens of travellers and refugees from those countries who were stranded at US airports. 
 
 These individuals went through enhanced security screenings and are being processed for entry to the United States, consistent with our immigration laws and judicial orders,  the Homeland Security statement said. 
 
In an executive order signed on Friday, Mr Trump halted the arrival of refugees for at least 120 days and imposed tough new controls on travellers from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen for the next three months. 
 
 It s working out very nicely. You see it at the airports, you see it all over,  Mr Trump told reporters yesterday, after travellers from those countries were stopped from boarding US bound planes, triggering angry protests at airports. 
 
His comments come after two Iraqis with ties to US security forces filed a lawsuit against Mr Trump after they were detained at New York’s JFK Airport hours after the executive order was signed by the president. 
 
In a lawsuit filed in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, the men challenged the directive on constitutional grounds. 
 
The suit says that their connections to the American forces made them targets in their home country and the pair had valid visas to enter the United States. 
 
The lawsuit highlights some of the legal obstacles facing the new administration as it tries to carry out the directive.
