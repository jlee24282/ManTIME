<TITLE>TT needs rehab</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Crime continues to plague our country and despite the changes in administration every election, no government seems to establish a solution to this problem.

As a result, annually millions of taxpayers monies are used to sanitise the symptoms of this disease and not the root cause. If this cycle continues, then we are no different from an addict satisfying his or her craving for a high fix rather than admitting that he or she has a problem and requires rehabilitation. 

The short term solution is always easier, but it never truly alleviates the underlying problem that exists. 

It is time for us to admit that Trinidad and Tobago has evolved into a lawless society and we are all somewhat responsible for this occurrence. However, there is still hope. The rehabilitation process must start. An excellent place to start is with the effective socialization of our children. This is the responsibility of not only parents but all agents involved in the development of our nation’s children. 

As an educator, it alarms me to see the monsters we have and are continuing to create as a result of poor policy formation and rules created by individuals who have never taught in a classroom environment. 

The school is an environment where a child learns not only academic information, but is taught to obey rules and regulations that governs that institution. 

The skills acquired from school lays the foundation for good citizenship beyond the parameters of the classroom. However, in recent times this is not the case. Slowly the school is unconsciously evolving into a place that encourages lawlessness among students. 

Incidents of male students sexually assaulting female teachers is an example of this, with no retribution for the teacher. In addition to this, the teacher will be blamed for her attire and should not make any attempt to defend herself. If she does, this would be seen as inflicting violence towards a child and would be disciplined according to the law. Thus an environment that encourages disrespect for women is created. 

The irony is that we are surprised when we hear of heinous crimes committed against women ignorant to the fact that we have been supporting this behaviour from the get go. 

We live in a contemporary society, where children are exposed to a variety of uncensored data via social media. This, merged with a host of social and economic issues, makes the task of socialization quite problematic. 

Consequently, the school must be seen as a back bone for instilling values that are synonymous with integrity and diligence, and must therefore act as a catalyst for invoking positive change. At no time must a laissez faire attitude towards wrongdoing be perceived or entertained. 

This technique would not only zoom in on the irate children but would provide an avenue for effective rehabilitation and restoration. 

The benefits of this approach can be far reaching however it requires all stakeholders to be united, from the policy makers to the man on the streets, each one of us must do our part in saving our country.
