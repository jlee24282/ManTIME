<TITLE>Young fisher's success at annual Wynyard Quarter event</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Micaela Kimber, 7, holds her 40cm snapper high. 
   
Families lined Wynyard Quarter on Sunday morning for the annual Kids Gone Fishin  event. 
 
While most of their efforts yielded nothing more than a few nibbles, one young girl came away smiling. 
 
Less than an hour into the family event, which is run by New Zealand Blue Light, Micaela Kimber, 7, caught herself a 40cm snapper. 
   
It was mostly nibbles for all the fishing kids but that didn t stop everyone enjoying the sun on Sunday morning. 
   
Kimber said her dad was going to cook the fresh catch up for her Sunday dinner. 
 
  
   
   
   
 
 My dad is the best cook,  she said.  
   
A good turn out for  Kids Gone Fishin  in Auckland in Wynyard Quarter. 
   
Toni Helleur s kids Roman, 5, and Tristan, 3, also caught a couple of fish, but they were too small so they threw them back into the harbour. 
 
 It was good, we got one on each rod,  she said.  
 
Simon Wills, who was fishing with his family, said they only had a  few nibbles, but that was enough . 
 
Wills said it was good to get kids out into the fresh air and away from the computer.  
   
 It s a brilliant event, and great to see everyone supporting it. You ve got the fishing, the food, and they even provided sunblock.   
 
Blue Light charity patron and fishing legend Graeme Sinclair said it was a  record  turn out, the biggest he had seen in the last four years. 
 
New Zealand Blue Light runs activities throughout the year to keep young people free from drugs, alcohol and violence.  
 
The event, which provided a free sausage sizzle, bait, handlines, face painting and spot prizes was held on Saturday and Sunday from 10am 12pm.
