India cricketer Ravindra Jadeja and his wife Reeva Solanki were involved in a road accident on Friday in Jamnagar, according to reports. 
 
Reportedly, Jadeja s car hit a two wheeler. A girl named Preeti Sharma, studying at Jamnagar s Vidyasagar Institute, was riding the vehicle. 
 
Television reports said that Sharma sustained minor injuries. However, it wasn t clear if the accident was due to the cricketer s fault.
