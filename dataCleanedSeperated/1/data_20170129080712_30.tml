<TITLE>Welcome to the jungle: Steve Price hasn't seen TV show he's on</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Steve Price has made his living from offending liberals and feminists alike on programs such as The Project and Q amp;A.

But don t think that s all there is to the 62 year old conservative radio shock jock, who is ready for Australians to see a softer side of him. After lobbying his bosses at 2GB, Price is headed to the jungle for season three of Channel Ten s I m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!

According to the talkback star, there s more to life than just politics, and a jungle camp with nine other celebrities just might be the change he needs.  I think doing the job that I do, particularly radio but also on The Project, it s dependent on having interesting things to talk about. If you lead a boring, protected life, you don t have as much to talk about,  he says.

Signing on to the show was a  pretty tough  decision – while providing some convenient cross promotion for Ten – but Price says it was an opportunity too good to pass up.  I explained to them I thought it was a once in a lifetime chance to take you out of your comfort zone.

 I had to convince the people who pay me to let me go for an unspecified period of time, which is pretty unfair on them. No one at work knows except the executive chairman.  Alongside Price will be former Olympic swimmer Lisa Curry, 54, an accomplished athlete with 15 gold medals under her belt. 

Price is used to people challenging his politics on The Project, but how will he go spending up to six weeks with celebrities from across the political divide?  Clearly, the producers of the program are going to put people in that create some sort of conflict, but I don t have to apologise for or explain my views,  he says.  I don t want to bore everyone at 7.30 at night by giving a political lesson, though. The different side they ll see of me is that I want to talk about more interesting things than politics.

 I m paid to, and have for a long time managed to get people to tell me things about them, and that s what I m hopefully going to do with these other nine people.  Being in a confined environment with nine people you probably don t know for up to six weeks, you ve got to make it interesting, not just for the viewer, but for you in there. 

The thing he dreads the most? Not being in control.

 I m going to be wanting to be in charge but there will be other personalities within this group who won t want me to be in charge. They ll want me to just be one of the group. That s going to be a difficult thing for me because I like to run things. 

As one of the oldest celebrities this year, Price knows the experience will be no cakewalk but is pushing ahead regardless.

 I deliberately didn t want to watch the show because I don t think I would have done it. If I d done that I would have said no, I think.

 So I m going in thinking,  Oh well, I ve got a few weeks off work, I m hanging out in the African jungle .
