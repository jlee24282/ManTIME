<TITLE>Opinions still spewing on both sides after election</TITLE>
<TEXT>
It seems as if there is no escaping the negativity surrounding the presidential election and recent political activities and events. More than ever, it seems that no matter which political party people identify with, there is an abundance of controversy and unrest. 
 
As a military family, we have lived in six different states over the last 20 years. We have friends in each of those states – Washington, Alaska, Michigan, Indiana, California and North Carolina. We also have many friends who are stationed in numerous other states around the country. 
 
Many of our friends are fellow Coast Guard families, and others are locals from the different areas where we have been stationed. These people have diverse backgrounds and a wide range of opinions and beliefs – especially when it comes to politics. 
 
I know people who attended the Presidential Inauguration. I know people who attended Women’s Marches. I know a military spouse who attended the inauguration as a journalist and covered the event for a military publication. I also know people who were involved in events related to the inauguration, and who attended in military uniform, as part of their job. 
 
Military members are entitled to their own personal opinions and beliefs, but when it comes down to it, they ultimately work for president of the United States. He is their boss. As the Commander in Chief, President Trump is the top civilian and military authority in the nation.. 
 
All members of the Armed Services, from the newest recruits to the most senior officers, work for the president. The highest ranking officers from each of the military branches report directly to the president, including the Commandant of the Coast Guard, Adm. Paul Zukunft. During the inauguration ceremony Zukunft was seated near other Service Chiefs behind the former presidents and their spouses, including Bill and Hillary Clinton. 
 
Many people watched the inauguration and related events with a special interest in seeing the involvement of their friends, relatives, co workers and neighbors – those in uniform. Military families move around the country often, and live within communities with vastly varying political climates. Like many people, I appreciate the diverse opinions we are exposed to, but do not enjoy the intense controversy. 
 
As a journalist, I embrace freedom of speech, and the press, and encourage people to get their information from reputable media outlets. Much of what is posted on social media is not based on hard facts from identifiable sources, and that misinformation can lead to unnecessary conflict. 
 
I have seen enough negativity – especially on social media, to last a lifetime. Whether people support our country’s new president or not, I think we all need to work together to find positive solutions to problems, and respectful ways to address the issues we are passionate about. 
 
In some ways, I wish we could go back to a time when people didn’t feel the need to share every opinion about every situation with everyone they meet. My grandmother used to say there are two things you should never discuss with people you don’t know very well – religion and politics. I can only imagine what she would have to say about the things people are posting on social media.
