<TITLE>Parent Network Of WNY Releases Acronym List</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Parent Network of WNY has recently released an updated list of acronyms which will assist special education and disability parents and caregivers. 
 
The Parent Network of WNY is a provider and education resources for families of individuals with special needs and professionals. Acronyms can sometimes be confusing for parents and caregivers, but the acronym list will be helpful for those involved. 
 
The list is developed using a crossed system language with the understanding that families aren’t just in communication with the schools, said Tonia Weichmann, the Transition Coordinator for Parent Network of WNY. 
 
“A lot of our families are working with community agencies and going through different eligibility processes, so I think this list is a great resource for them to take with them to their child’s IEP meetings and any other meetings that involves coordination of services,” she said. “Reviewing it ahead of time will help in better educating themselves and becoming a better advocate for their child.” 
 
The list includes acronyms such as WIC, or the Women Infants and Children program; the OTDA, or the NYS Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance; and PCP, or person centered planning. In addition to the list of acronyms, the organization also offers a support group director, a military and veteran family resource guide; a recreation director; WNY Family Support Directory; and other information. 
 
The network serves about 10,000 people a year, and almost 12,000 individuals have developmental disabilities and are in need of support. Likewise, about 30,000 students receive special education services. Parent Network of WNY hosts over 300 workshops a year that serves about 5,000 people. 
 
The network, which is based out of Buffalo, provides 1 on 1 support and education through resources, workshops and support groups to assist families of individual with disabilities to understand their disability and navigate the support service system.
