<TITLE>Labour's Tudor Evans answers your questions on bins, libraries,...</TITLE>
<TEXT>
 You re asking me a lot of questions about Jeremy Corbyn.  
 
For the first time in five years, I feel like I have got Tudor Evans on the run – and it s all thanks to The Herald s readers. 
 
They have been sending in teasers for the Labour leader all week, on topics ranging from Brexit and Trump to bins and libraries. 
 
Some of them are quite on the nose. 
 
For example:  When are you stepping down to give someone else a chance at providing an effective opposition?  
 
 I don t really agree with the premise of the question,  Cllr Evans says. 
 
 I m in my 50s. A lot of leaders don t become leaders until they are in their 60s. I have devoted my whole adult life to working on the council and trying to make Plymouth a better place. 
 
 I ve still got the appetite for that, definitely still got the ability, got the passion, still got the enthusiasm.  
 
So he s committed to carrying on until 2022? 
 
 You re inviting me to sound like Margaret Thatcher here,  he says. 
 
 I m not going to do that. The Labour group will tell me when they ve had enough.  
  
Your questions for @CouncillorTudor . Thanks to everyone who took part. Answers soon. pic.twitter.com/EcrURIDs7h

A reader wants to know whether Cllr Evans likes Jeremy Corbyn. 
 
He says he has only met him once, on a street corner in Brighton two years ago. 
 
What does he make of Corbyn s performance in Westminster? 
 
 William Hague used to win Prime Minister s Question Time every week,  he says. 
 
 He used to wipe the floor with his opponents, and he ended up losing. I m not sure I d pay too much attention to that. 
 
 What s really important is how healthy the party is. In Plymouth, we re in a really good place.  
 
Mr Corbyn has instructed his MPs to vote for a Bill on triggering Article 50; several have already resigned from the shadow cabinet in protest. 
 
Cllr Evans still believes the UK should stay in Europe, and admits the vote will  put people in conflict . 
 
If he were in the House of Commons, how would he vote? 
 
 That s a really difficult question to answer,  he says. 
 
 The question on the referendum was  Do you want to leave the European Union?  
 
 Most people in Plymouth said they would like to leave. But I talk to people now who say  I didn t realise it means tariffs going up and blah, blah, blah. 
 
 It would depend what the question is. The question is not as straightforward as they re trying to make out.

Next question:  When did you last borrow a book from a library?  
 
 Oh gosh, a long time ago,  Cllr Evans says. 
 
 Probably when I was a kid, if I m honest. 
 
 I go into the library because there are other things happening.  
 
The council is proposing to close ten of the city s most  under used  libraries , and Labour are campaigning hard against it. 
 
If he was still in power, would he keep all 17 libraries open? 
 
 We had begun to talk about a transformation programme,  he says. 
 
 We thought we could change the way we were doing it. We could move libraries rather than closing them. 
 
 Like North Prospect which was in a bad location, with an old and tired offer, move it up the road and reimagine it, and you ve got a success story on your hands. 
 
 This is different. Proposing to close 60 per cent of the library network in one go is not a transformation programme. It s barbaric. We wouldn t be doing it like this.

Four years ago, Labour had a six seat majority over the Conservatives. 
 
That lead has slowly eroded, to the point where last year the parties ended dead level and the Tories took the chance to form a coalition with UKIP. 
 
A reader asks:  What will Labour do to return to power in 2018?  
 
 The manifesto we prepared for last year s election needs looking at,  Cllr Evans says. 
 
 What we normally do is have a series of conversations with the public, with party members, with stakeholders, with people in the community to try to imagine a programme that will excite, amaze and entertain, and also be popular.  
 
Is a re think required to regain control? 
 
 We know what we ve got to do,  he says. 
 
 We ve got to defend what we ve got and take back a couple of seats. If we want a working majority, we ve got to take a couple more. 
 
 But with elections in thirds, there are only so many places that can happen. 
 
 The task is always difficult, but it s over a year away. A lot can happen in a year in politics.

Back to Westminster for the next question, which will surely resonate with many traditional Labour voters across the city:  How do you plan to sell the far left policies of your leader to middle income earners?  
 
Cllr Evans is clearly uncomfortable talking about Mr Corbyn. 
 
 The national stuff is the job of...we don t do that,  he says. 
 
 The Labour Party operates in a different way from other political parties. 
 
 For example, the Labour Party wouldn t tell us how to sell the local manifesto to the community. Wouldn t design the campaign, wouldn t interfere. 
 
 The national stuff is handed down, like national campaign days. The Labour Party will send us materials. 
 
 It isn t a question of how we would sell anything. We do our own local programme.  
 
He is distancing himself from Mr Corbyn, but the fact remains people vote in local elections based on how the party appears in the media. Doesn t that cause a conflict? 

 
 You re quite right,  he says. 
 
 A lot of people s voting behaviour is determined by what goes on nationally. Local government never gets on the television. 
 
 But we re still spending £200million of local taxpayers  money on local services. That is nothing to do with Westminster. How we spend that money is entirely determined by us down here.  
 
When Labour is out canvassing for support, how many residents say they can no longer support Labour because of Mr Corbyn s views? 
 
 Very few people actually cite the leader as an issue on the doorstep,  Cllr Evans says. 
 
 I can tell you, hand on heart, they used to complain to me about Kinnock, they used to complain to me about Miliband, Brown and Blair. They always have. 
 
 If they don t want to vote for you, they will always find a reason. There s no point in arguing about that. I don t think unlikeability is unique to Jeremy Corbyn.

Speaking of which, when Donald Trump was elected President of the USA, Tory leader Ian Bowyer invited him to Plymouth to celebrate the Mayflower anniversary in 2020. 

 
If Cllr Evans is in charge by then, will he stand on the Mayflower Steps and shake President Trump s hand? 
 
 That s a very good question,  he smiles. 
 
 I d probably leave it to the Lord Mayor. 
 
 I don t think he s going to have a very successful Presidency, and a number of people who voted for him will very shortly discover that a lot of the promises he made to them will not materialise.  
 
We take a quick whip through the rest of the questions. 
 
 I voted remain and believe Brexit will be a disaster for the UK. Should I vote Lib Dem?  
 
 No. No, no, no. I don t think you should do that,  he says. 
 
 The reason we had the referendum was the Lib Dems propped up the Tory government. 
 
 If they hadn t done that, there wouldn t have been David Cameron and there wouldn t have been a Brexit vote.  
 
 Do you regret the decision to give the lease on the airport to Sutton Harbour Holdings?  
 
 The thing is, 12 years ago Plymouth was a few hours away from not having an airport at all,  he says. 
 
 So I saved the airport. Sutton Harbour Holdings then is a different beast to the company now. None of the personalities are the same. 
 
 The point is we had an airport for nearly 10 years longer than we might otherwise have had if that had not been done. 
 
 The deal was negotiated by my predecessor and officers who are no longer here. When I took over in May 2007, I was given a final sign off on the deal with Sutton Harbour. 
 
 So basically, I signed the deal. I think I will always have the blame, but I ll never get the credit for taking that decision to keep it open.

 Given your party s opposition to cuts, what would you do to address the £40million budget shortfall over the next three years?  

 
Cllr Evans points out his  three pronged programme  – transformation, growth and stopping services as a last resort – saved £65million from 2012 to 2016. 
 
Does he think Labour would be able to balance the books without cutting public services? 
 
 No, I don t. I think it would be incredible to say you could do it without any cuts. What bothers me is that Ian Bowyer has blamed my finance person, and then blamed the Government. 
 
 I m sure at some point he s going to man up and take some responsibility. The choice of where to cut and how to cut is his.
