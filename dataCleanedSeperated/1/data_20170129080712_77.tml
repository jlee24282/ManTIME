<TITLE>Serena to play fewer tournaments to aid grand slam quest (Yahoo Sports)</TITLE>
<TEXT>
By Simon  cambers  MELBOURNE, (Reuters)   Serena Williams plans to play fewer tournaments in the future to aid her quest to win more grand slam titles, according to her coach Patrick Mouratoglou.  The 35 year old American won her 23rd grand slam title on Saturday at the Australian Open, breaking the open era record she held jointly with Germanyâ€™s Steffi Graf.  Serena will now manage her schedule as she chases down the all time leader Margaret Court, the Australian whose record of 24 grand slam titles straddled the amateur and professional eras.
