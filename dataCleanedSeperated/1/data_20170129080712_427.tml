This week, Magic Kingdom Park – and a bevy of football fans – celebrated the NFL players who are set to participate in tomorrow’s Pro Bowl. Denver Broncos receivers Demaryius Thomas and Emmanuel Sanders, Carolina Panthers tight end Greg Olsen, Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker Ryan Shazier and Tennessee Titans tight end Delanie Walker appeared in a special football themed parade at the park on Friday, January 27. 
 

 
The players were joined by Mickey Mouse and his pals, NFL cheerleaders and other special guests for their ride down Main Street, U.S.A.
