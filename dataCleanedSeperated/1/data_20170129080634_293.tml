<TITLE>"Pray for Peace" installation takes aim at school shootings</TITLE>
<TEXT>
A local artist has created an installation representing school shootings that have occurred since the start of the 21st Century. 
 
Deprise Brescia marked 185 mixed media lunchboxes with the likeness of bullet holes. 
 
The large bullet holes represent deaths, while the smaller ones represent injuries. 
 
 For me as the artist, when I m drilling holes in these that signify a life, it s sad,  Brescia said.  And I want people to see it, I want people to feel it, I want people to remember that we need to work on this. And the fact that this has gone up 500 percent in the beginning of this century is disturbing and it should be disturbing to everybody and we should get together and fix it.  
 
Each lunch box bears the date and location of the shootings. 
 
Brescia said the  Pray for Peace  installation is meant to be interactive: Visitors are encouraged to touch the installation. 
 
 Pray for Peace  is part of the  Guns in America  show on display at Studios on the Park in Paso Robles. It runs through Sunday.
