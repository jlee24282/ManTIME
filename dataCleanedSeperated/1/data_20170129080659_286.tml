<TITLE>Letter to the editor: We must understand the evolution of freedom</TITLE>
<TEXT>
In light of recent political events, I find myself thinking at length about what makes America great.

America is not just great; it is exceptional. The hallmarks of American democracy are its tolerance for diversity of thought, its foundation in the rule of law and consent of the governed, and its protection of the rights of the individual and the rights of the minority.
