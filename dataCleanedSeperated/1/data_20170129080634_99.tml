MANCHESTER   Manchester police tracked down a local motorist and charged him with drunken driving after police said his truck struck a utility pole and he left the scene. 

David Leblanc, 33, of 79 Phillips St., was charged with drunken driving and leaving the scene of an accident after a single care crash at Mast Road and Bernard Street at 1:24 a.m. on Saturday. 

A witness saw a dark colored Ford truck crash into the pole, splintering it and causing the utility wires to fall across Mast Road. 

Police got from the same witness the license plate of the truck leaving the scene. 

Manchester Officer Rob Megrowen followed a fluid trail to Leblanc s address on Phillips Street and found a black, Ford F 150 heavily damaged in the driveway. 

Manchester police said there was no information on Leblanc s bail status or his bail date.
