<TITLE>Langer justifies Jhye Richardson's tricky selection</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Jhye Richardson, the Perth Scorchers pacer, wasn t going to be a part of the Playing XI until early morning of the final of the Big Bash League. With Mitchell Johnson set to lead the attack, and Tim Bresnan and Andrew Tye being certainties for their spots, coach Justin Langer was left deciding between Richardson and left arm pacer Jason Behrendorff for the fourth pacer s spot. 
 
Behrendorff was in with a chance making a surprising return to the line up from injury, having not played competitive cricket since November last year. While the 20 year old Richardson was young and fitter, Behrendorff brought with him a lot of experience. Nonetheless, with the Scorchers coach unsure of the left arm pacer s fitness, he decided to eventually play Richardson in the all important clash. 
 
The move paid off richly as the bowler returned with three crucial wickets   Moises Henriques, Brad Haddin and Jordan Silk, apart from effecting the brilliant run out to send Nic Maddinson back to the dugout. 
 
 It was just such a dilemma, I reckon I asked at least 50 people their opinion about whether we should go Jason Behrendorff or Jhye Richardson,  Langer said after the Scorchers  convincing nine wicket win over the Sixers on Saturday (January 28).  It s hard to leave someone like Behrendorff out, he s been our most influential bowler of the last three or four years. 
 
 But it came really clearly to me this morning when I was meditating. If we were talking about being fit to play and to perform, then as good as Behrendorff is, I just left he hadn t played enough cricket. Richardson was battle hard and his fielding   if he didn t take one wicket today, that run out of Maddinson earned every cent of his wage tonight.  
 
 He was pumped. I had to make two tough phone calls, but I wussed out and called Jhye first,  Langer added. Not surprisingly, Richardson was ecstatic on receivingthe call from the former Australian opener on Saturday morning. 
 
It was a tough season for the Perth Scorchers with three front linepacers   Nathan Coulter Nile, Joel Paris and Behrendorff not being able to play due to injuries. However, with a player from the recently graduated Under 19 batch being able to stand up and deliver in big matches comes as good news. He played eight matches in the recently concluded season and took 11 wickets. 
 
 It s unbelievable. At the start of the season I couldn t have even dreamed of it,  Richardson said.  I m speechless. 
 
 I was probably a bit lucky with injuries throughout the squad (to play as many games) but I had to trust myself and hard work I ve done and it paid off.
