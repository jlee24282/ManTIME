<TITLE>Greene County aviation group to offer flight classes</TITLE>
<TEXT>
A Greene County group of pilots will offer a series of classes beginning in February for those interested in aviation or would like to learn to fly.

Support Our Aviation Resources (SOAR) will hold the classes starting at 6 p.m. on Feb. 6, and the classes will run every subsequent Monday at 6 p.m. for two hours for 10 and 12 weeks at the Old Curry Home, located at 931 Rolling Meadows Road in Waynesburg.

“We offered the class two years ago with another instructor and always seem to have good participation,” Halliday said. “Our hope is that the participants will eventually become a member of SOAR, a 501(c)3 organization.”

Halliday said the classes will be based on the King Kew 140 Online Training Aid. In addition to the training aid, participants must also have the E6B Flight Computer, a Flight Plotter and a Detroit Sectional, an aviation road map).

“Each week, we will review elements from the training aid and use power point presentations and lectures by our instructors to give participants a well rounded knowledge of the subject matter,” said Jeff Halliday, flight instructor and retired aviation safety inspector/air worthiness for the Federal Aviation Administration.

The King items can be ordered online at kingschools.com or by calling 800 854 1001. The E6B ($25), the Flight Plotter ($15) and the Detroit Section ($10) can be ordered on the SOAR website, soarofgreenecounty.org. Registration for the classes is $50.

Halliday said the classes will utilize the E6B flight computer used to calculate time, distance and fuel consumption on one side and wind drift correction and ground speed on the other.

Instructors other than Halliday include John Peters, a commercial pilot with a flight instructor rating, and John Armel, a certified ground and instrument instructor. All three are from Greene County.

After taking the series of classes, participants will be able to get authorization to take the written Private Pilot Test. Those that pass will have two years to complete their private pilot rating. However, they are able to fly at any time with an instructor to work on their skills and proficiency.

SOAR has approximately 30 members who meet the first Tuesday of each month at the Greene County Airport. While several members have their own planes, others are just interested in the subject of aviation.

To register for the classes or for more information, call 724 998 6973 or visit soarofgreenecounty.org.
