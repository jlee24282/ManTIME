By The high cost of electricity is one of the biggest concerns of business people in New Hampshire, said Kevin Flynn, director of communications and public policy for the Business and Industry Association. 
 
 Whether it s a business looking to come here, or a business looking to expand, it remains a big challenge,  Flynn said.  Month to month, we remain 58 percent higher than the national average.  
 
Newington gun maker Sig Sauer announced in May that it s locating an ammunition making operation at a  permanent site in Jacksonville, Arkansas,  after location scouting for several years. In an announcement about the move, Dan Powers, president of the Sig Sauer ammunition division, said Arkansas offered  exceptional economic incentives  and company officials later said electricity costs in Arkansas are half that of New Hampshire s, with Sig s savings exceeding $1 million a year. 
 
According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, Sig s cited electric rates are right on the money. 
 
The federal agency reports residential electric rates for consumers in New Hampshire were 18.93 cents per kilowatt hour in October 2016, compared to 9.85 cents per kilowatt hour in Arkansas. Commercial electric rates for the same month were 14.57 cents a kilowatt hour in New Hampshire and 8.09 cents in Arkansas. 
 
Speaking for BIA members, Flynn said high electricity costs are due to supply limitations and additional transmission costs. He said he s heard from members, who he declined to identify, that are contemplating leaving the state, or if they re planning expansions, launching those out of state, because of the electric rates. In addition to a statewide workforce shortage, Flynn said, the cost of electricity is a top concern for the state s business community.  
 
 Electric bills are high,  said Jim Teetzel, owner of Wilcox Industries, another Newington gun maker, but he calls it  the cost of doing business.   
 
 When I hear a company is moving a plant solely because of energy, it just doesn t make sense,  he said.  We spend over $50,000 a month on electricity because we have a lot of machinery. That s just not a factor we consider and we probably chew up more electricity than anyone in the area. Would I like lower bills? Of course. Who wouldn t.   
 
Teetzel said the cost of electricity is not enough to drive an established business out of state, but would be a consideration when planning a new business. Electric rates are a business consideration, he said,  but not a reason to move.  
 
He said he s in favor of power supplier Eversource s Northern Pass project, which would bring hydropower to the region from Canada, while acknowledging the execution is  challenging.  Opponents continue to fight the plan and it remains in a prolonged period of regulatory review. 
 
Flynn said the BIA is urging its members to speak out about high electricity costs to  raise awareness  of the fact that  what you re paying here is a lot more than in other states.  He said it s possible to bring rates down by increasing supply across New England.  
 
Gov. Sununu s spokesman, David Abrams, responded to an inquiry about energy and business in the state with the following statement the governor made in December at the BIA s New Hampshire Energy Symposium. 
 
 Now there are lots of pieces to that puzzle,  Sununu was quoted.  There’s renewable energy. What are we doing with our current infrastructure? We have new plants that are going offline. We have Northern Pass coming in. We have the potential for natural gas, but it has to be done the New Hampshire way. The right way.” 
 
Also at BIA s New Hampshire Energy Symposium in December, Robert Michalski, vice president of operations for Stratham chocolate maker, Lindt  amp; Sprungli, was quoted by the New Hampshire Union Leader saying the company pays more than $5 million a year for electricity and expects that to rise by another half million dollars this year.  
 
 The concerning part for us is that we are at this point, the company is not willing to grow any more in New Hampshire,” Michalski was quoted by the Union Leader. “The only way that we’re going to be able to grow in New Hampshire further is by finding ways to reduce our energy, our energy costs in this state.” 
 
A spokeswoman at Michalski s office said last week that he no longer works for Lindt. Asked for someone else to speak on behalf of the company about energy costs, she said no one from the company  is allowed to be quoted in the media.   
 
Energy demand on the Seacoast has been cited by Eversource as growing twice as fast the rest of the state. To meet the demand, Eversource currently seeks approval for construction of a new 13 mile transmission line, to run between existing power stations in Portsmouth and Madbury. The state s Site Evaluation Committee is expected to respond to the application this year, while Eversource says it hopes to complete the  Seacoast Reliability Project  in 2018. That project is also facing strong opposition from those concerned about the environmental impact of the line. 
 
Behind the scenes, said Don Kreis, a staff lawyer and consumer advocate for the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission, Eversource is fighting in the New Hampshire Supreme Court to try to have its customers pay for a new gas pipeline. Kreis said the PUC denied Eversource s plan to pass the pipeline cost onto to consumers and Eversource recently filed an appeal with the state s highest court. 
 
The PUC describes its mission as  vested with general jurisdiction over electric, telecommunications, natural gas, water and sewer utilities as defined in RSA 362:2 for issues such as rates, quality of service, finance, accounting and safety. It is the PUC’s mission to ensure customers of regulated utilities receive safe, adequate and reliable service at just and reasonable rates.  
 
Kreis explained that New England is farther away from cheaper fossil fuels, which has historically been coal, which drives up the cost. Natural gas prices are low and New England is close to sources in Pennsylvania, New York and Ohio, which has led to electric companies arguing there s a need for more gas pipelines to move more gas, he said. 
 
 We have more than adequate supplies of natural gas, but when it s really cold, natural gas generators, without firm contracts, say they supposedly don t have enough to go around,  Kreis said. 
 
In 2014, Eversource, when it was known as Public Service of New Hampshire, purchased land at 445 Route 1 Bypass in Portsmouth for construction of a new electrical substation. In an application to the city to build the substation, PSNH reported it was needed to meet an increased demand for electricity, as well as new development driven demand. With anticipated new demand for electricity, due to Portsmouth  projects under development, or in the planning stages,  PSNH informed the city three years ago that demand for electricity would exceed capacity by 2016, without new infrastructure such as the new bypass substation, that s now in operation. 
 
Kreis said expanded infrastructure throughout the region, paired with energy conservation, are the solutions to the area s energy challenges. With that, he said, prices would lower. 
 
He said businesses can and should conduct energy audits and consider ways to retrofit their operations to reduce energy consumption and affiliated costs. He said energy providers have budgets for a program that offers energy audits and can, as an example, identify parts of a factory using the most electricity and offer suggestions, like more efficient motors. Food factories and businesses, he said, should explore more energy efficient refrigeration units.  
 
Kreis explained that electricity is traded by the independent group ISO New England and the rate varies every five minutes. ISO brokers the electricity markets, to retailers who sell to customers and from companies that generate electricity. Peak demand for electricity in New England, Kries said, is generally on a hot August afternoon.  
 
ISO spokesman Matt Kakley explained that his organization manages the electricity market like the stock market and doesn t set prices. He said natural gas is the predominant fuel used to create electricity in New England and,  When the natural gas pipelines transporting gas into New England have room left over after heating customers are served, that cheap natural gas can make it into New England. When the pipelines are running full just to serve heating customers, natural gas prices spike and then wholesale electricity prices go up, too.  
 
Kakley said at times the pipelines carrying gas into New England aren’t sufficient to transport enough natural gas to meet demand. 

 
 We see this especially on very cold winter days when heating demand for natural gas is high, which coincides with high demand for gas for electricity production,  he said  Constraints on the natural gas pipelines can push up the price of natural gas, which can also increase the price of wholesale electricity.  
 
The Nothern Pass plan would reportedly create more energy via a 192 mile transmission line bringing hydropower from Canada, but has met resistance. Kreis said Sununu  has a lot of influence,  but it s up to a state s Site Evaluation Committee to decide whether to move that forward.  
 
Flynn said the BIA does not take positions with regard to specific infrastructure projects, but is  trying to advocate against legislation  that would make it harder to build new energy infrastructure. The BIA s website  EnergizeNH  calls the situation an  electrical energy crisis  and calls for  state and regional policies and initiatives that enable the development of low cost, reliable sources of energy, including expanded natural gas pipeline capacity and increased electrical transmission, into the region.  
 
The BIA reports it is  concerned about the high cost of electricity because it makes New Hampshire less competitive, jeopardizes current and future jobs, and threatens the state’s economy as businesses grow (or relocate) operations and employment outside New Hampshire and New England.  
 
Kreis said,  Speaking as a citizen, we need to find ways to strengthen our economy and not rely on persuading employers not to leave. There s always going to be another state with a better deal. It s true, we have high energy costs, but we have other things that make it a better place to be in business.
