<TITLE>House plan:  Outdoor living, even in chilly weather</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Lovers of the outdoors will rejoice to see this open plan design that sports a barbecue porch, lanai, columned front porch, and a screened breezeway to the optional garage. A kitchen island supplies extra prep room and a snack counter for casual bites. 
 
Other mealtime options: the bayed breakfast nook and the formal dining room with plenty of windows. 
 
Head back to the private master suite, complete with porch access and a large walk in closet. Two additional bedrooms sit near the front. 
 
For more room, take advantage of the huge bonus space upstairs.
