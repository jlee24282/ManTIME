<TITLE>The people’s architecture</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Most people who hire architects for houses and other private structures have a lot of money and are willing to spend it to get things just right. But the architecture that often has the biggest impact on a community — found in public places and spaces — comes at a relatively little cost to those who use it. 
 
When was the last time you went to the new Sarasota County beach pavilions at Siesta, Caspersen, Lido or Manasota beaches and thought to yourself, “My, they spent a lot of my tax dollars on these buildings”? 
 
Instead, beachgoers just use the pavilions and may not even notice the design. But architects and civic project managers strive not to be wasteful, and there is pressure on the designers to make sure their work — the people’s architecture — serves the public good. 
 
The importance of public architecture is the topic of an exhibit open through March 10 at the Center for Architecture Sarasota’s McCulloch Pavilion, at 265 S. Orange Ave. “Architecture in the Public Realm,” an exhibit of posters and models of public projects by local architects, is open from noon to 5 p.m. Tuesdays through Fridays and noon to 2 p.m. Saturdays. 
 
The program also will include lectures by architect Guy Peterson and landscape architect David Young on Feb. 1; architects Sam Holladay, Dale Parks and Joe Farrell on Feb. 8; and Julian Norman Webb and Gary Hoyt, with landscape architect Jessica Heinz, on Feb. 22. Admission to the events is free. 
 
Just as it is for most public architecture. Rich or poor, nearly everyone is served by these buildings — even tourists who have paid no taxes toward their construction. The buildings must be all things to all users and do it with a style that reflects the aesthetic values of the community. 
The 20:20 catalyst 
The “Architecture in the Public Realm” program was developed in response to the Bayfront 20:20 project, in which a citizen’s committee is exploring ways to make the most of 42 city owned acres around Sarasota’s Van Wezel Performing Arts Hall. An exhibit and lecture on the topic were one of the best attended events in CFAS history. 
 
“There are a lot of great public works done by architects in this community,” said Martin Gold, director of the University of Florida’s CityLab Sarasota, which shares the McCulloch Pavilion with CFAS and is one of the organizers of “Architecture in the Public Realm.” 
 
“One of CFAS’ core missions is to bring the diversity of architects together. This is an outreach effort to get everyone to send us public projects and let’s talk about them,” Gold said. 
 
Successes of those structures can inform the Bayfront 20:20 committee, Gold said. “They will have to make a lot of decisions. Can we facilitate community engagement in the public realm as an important investment? The city owns the land, so for it to be done well, it will require a lot of civic and public support. We are hoping to be part of that part of the equation.” 
 
The CFAS exhibit spotlights such local public buildings as the recently built county beach pavilions designed by Sweet Sparkman Architects, the Palm Avenue Parking Garage and the security barrier at Sarasota High School’s Building 4 by Solstice Architects, the Sarasota County Bus Transfer facility and the G. Wiz renovation by architect Dale Parks, and the to be built South Florida Museum by Fawley Bryant Architecture. 
 
At recent architect lectures in the series, Gold discussed his “Archer Braid,” a 10 mile long pedestrian/bicycle path that twists, turns and roughly parallels Archer Road in Gainesville. Carl Abbott described the Summerhouse Restaurant and St. Thomas More Church projects, and Todd Sweet told the story of the county beach pavilions. 
The public s investment 
“The public has an investment in and participates in the process” of designing community buildings, Gold said. “Sweet Sparkman had workshops and charrettes, with people explaining what their needs were, and those guys did an outstanding job translating that into great public space that we can be proud of.” 
 
The buildings have brought people to our beaches, he said.  The balance of tourism and the economy is a tough one, but if we bring more people to the beaches, everyone does better in the community. 
 
“It is an extension of the respect that the beaches belong to the public,” Gold added, noting that much of the coastline has limited access except at the large public beaches. “You can’t own the beach. The beach is a public infrastructure and we do need everybody to have the best access they can get.” 
 
At his recent lecture, architect Sweet said the pavilions were planned when the economy was in the Great Recession and builders were hungry for work. So was his young firm, which, until that point, was known for the Courthouse Center building at Main Street and U.S. 301 but was mostly being hired to build carports. 
 
Sweet said he wouldn’t stop pestering the county for some kind of design commission. “To shut us up, they gave us some bathrooms” 
 
Fortunately for Sweet Sparkman, they found they had a friend in John McCarthy, who was then director of Parks and Recreation for Sarasota County. McCarthy is also known as a local historian and an enthusiastic booster of Sarasota’s architectural heritage and community. 
 
“We have a strong history of public park and beach architecture that John McCarthy was very familiar with,” Sweet said. “He wanted iconic beach restrooms, where tourists and citizens could identify those buildings as county buildings, to show that we care about the architecture we put out there. 
 
“We were a young firm and had nothing to lose. There was a lot of young energy, and McCarthy was excited about it. He was able to convince people at the county that this is what we wanted to do. We came to the next meeting and presented something like this.” 
 
He held up a photograph of one of his beach pavilions, with the distinctive vertical rods forming a sort of curtain around the access ramp. 
 
“We looked at each site looking for things that (could inform) the architecture of the buildings,” he said. “The challenge was how to take a restroom building, with a ramp that could take up more space than the restroom, and make it look like one cohesive structure.” 
 
The result was the “abstract concept of sea oats” that was “very coastal.” 
Community identity 
“It is not a prosaic sort of architecture,” architect and historian Joe King told the Herald Tribune in 2013. “When it is done well, it helps you in the transition from ordinary life to enjoying the sand and the Gulf of Mexico. These buildings are about community identity, too. They are variations on a theme, and are all about county branding.” 
 
The successful beach pavilions project — four of the five designs have been built — has led Sweet Sparkman to other important projects, including the new Venice Library and the Basch Center at Ringling College. 
 
“And we are probably still doing some carports,” Sweet said. 
 
He noted a big difference between public architecture and private architecture: The clients. 
 
“Public projects today are so scrutinized because of the tax spending,” Sweet said. “There is a much more thorough selection process and meetings along the way. On the Venice Library, there were 20 public meetings to make sure that the public was informed and knew what was being spent and how it affected them as citizens. 
 
“With a public project, you are dealing with a project manager who is a county employee. They don’t have the emotional ties to the project that you have with a private residence. A lot of times, (architect) Jerry Sparkman will play therapist because there is such emotion when you are designing somebody’s house that you don’t have when you are sitting across from a county project manager.”
