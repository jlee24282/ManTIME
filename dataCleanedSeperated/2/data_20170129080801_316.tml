VISAKHAPATNAM: Andhra Pradesh, the Southern India state that secured top rank in World Bank s ease of doing business apart from double digit growth, has signed memorandum of understanding for Rs 10.54 lakh crore of investments, announced chief minister N. Chandrababu Naidu . 
Addressing the 23rd CII Partnership Summit at Visakhapatnam on Saturday, Naidu thanked administration that strived hard towards stabilising the economy through improving various performance parameters, helping the state more than double MoUs from last Summit. 

During the last Summit, the Southern India state had signed 328 MoUs for Rs 4.67 lakh crore of investments and claims to have succeeded in converting over 40 per cent of them into reality. 

The top firms that had signed MoUs this time around include ONGC , GAIL , HPCL and REC. Others include IOCL, GMR, Ramco, Essel Infra, IL amp;FS, LEPL Ventures, Next Orbit, NSL Mining, Drone Defence, Ceat, Apollo Tyres , Tata Chemicals, Wipro , Hindustan LNG, Shree Cement and Chettinad Cement among others. 

Naidu said the latest 665 MoUs singed during the two day Summit should help generate over 22 lakh new jobs. Thanking the investors for overwhelming support, he hoped to further improve the state s performance in attracting investments during next year s investor summit. 

 This shows the inherent strengths of Andhra Pradesh and the confidence of investors on our governance,  said Naidu, vowing to strive towards further improving Andhra Pradesh s ease of doing business rankings to emerge among the top 10 global destinations soon. 

The chief minister assured quality and uninterrupted power, water, land and infrastructure to the industries, apart from corrupt free governance and all approvals within 14 days.
