<TITLE>Xyrania-Dev - A small start for something big.</TITLE>
<TEXT>
. 
Well, everything seems normal, just a normal day.. not much happening today. 
I m just working on my project, EXARUNA. A project I have been working on for a few weeks. 
This week, I have made an IndieGoGo campaign , a GameJolt page , and wrote about the game on the GameDev forums . 
Everything s been going smoothly  til now. 
It s good to start slow 
I hope everything will be going well until the end.. and unlike my other cancelled project, I hope this one succeed.
