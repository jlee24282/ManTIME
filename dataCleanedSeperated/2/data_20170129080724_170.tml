The 2016 17 campaign goal of $830,000 has reached 70 percent. 

PARKERSBURG — The 2016 17 campaign is in full swing at the United Way Alliance of the Mid Ohio Valley where the agency is under new leadership leading the same mission. 
 
Stacy DeCicco was named interim executive director of the agency upon the departure of Andrea Shirey. 
 
“I feel privileged to have the opportunity to lead this organization,” DeCicco said. “I am so proud of the work that we are doing and the increased impact that we have been able to have.” 
 
With about three months left to go in the 2016 17 campaign, the United Way Alliance is at 70 percent of its goal of $830,000 and concludes on March 31. An online donation can be made at uwamov.com or by mailing it to the United Way, which funds more than 40 programs in 10 counties, at 935 Market St. 
 
“Our programs build a stronger community for everyone. We help to put people in crisis back on their feet and then we go a step further  we help to prevent future problems” DeCicco said. 
 
“We have a unique ability to work across complex issues with hundreds of community partners.” 
 
DeCicco joined the United Way last year as the community impact coordinator. Previously she was a regional coordinator of The Gabriel Project that helps pregnant women and families with children 2 and younger. 
 
The experience with the Garbriel Project is a benefit for the United Way, according to Tony Dunn, chairman of the board of directors of the United Way. 
 
“The board of directors for the United Way Alliance of the Mid Ohio Valley has the utmost confidence in Stacy to lead our organization through this transition period. Stacy understands the United Way mission and is dedicated to continuing the great work that is currently being done in our community,” Dunn said. “Her past experience with The Gabriel Project and her outstanding work as the community impact coordinator for our United Way make her uniquely qualified to effectively lead our organization.” 
 
Shirey, a graduate of Parkersburg South High School and West Virginia University, joined the United Way in 2014. Saying she wanted to spend more time with her family, Shirey ‘s last day at the agency was Dec. 31 and she went to work parttime as the events and marketing coordinator for Downtown PKB, a group dedicated to the development of downtown Parkersburg. 
 
“We want to thank Andrea Shirey for her superb leadership as our Executive Director and wish her only the best in everything she does,” Dunn said. “She was a terrific asset to the United Way and we expect great things from her wherever life takes her.” 
 
Shirey made the United Way a better group, DeCicco said. 
 
“This organization is bigger than one person, so while Andrea’s departure was something I hated to see happen, I know that her time here made us a stronger, better organization,” DeCicco said. “I worked alongside her with a shared vision for this community; that vision will continue and the growth of our organization will continue to march forward.” 
 
This is a transition period, Aaron Stone, past board chairman, said. 
 
“I have been a member of the Board of Directors at United Way for nearly six years. Organizations go through periods of transition, and effective leadership during those times is essential,” Stone said. “Stacy was the natural choice for us to continue the forward momentum in our organization. She has been an integral part of the recent growth and understands the importance of continuing to advance the mission of the United Way Alliance.” 
 
The United Way also is confident with the annual campaign. 
 
“We are more than half way through our current campaign and the community is once again showing what kind and generous people we have in this valley,” Dunn said. “We are confident we will meet, or exceed our ambitious goal and continue the much needed support in our community.” 
 
Supporting the United Way is the single most effective way to help the entire community, DeCicco said. 
 
“Our funded programs are fiscally responsible,” she said. “We monitor trends, identify gaps in service and coordinate broad responses to ensure that the gifts made get the maximum results.”
