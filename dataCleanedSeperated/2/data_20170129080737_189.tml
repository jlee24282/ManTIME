<TEXT>
is a stone building near Homestead, Florida. Its builder, Edward Leedskalnin, left Latvia after being jilted by his fiancée the day before their wedding. As he left, he developed terminal tuberculosis which miraculously healed, for which he praised the power of magnets. Still hoping to impress his ex fiancée, he worked on for over 28 years. He began building Rock Gate Part in Florida City around 1923. At the time, Florida City was an isolated community. In 1936, Leedskalnin moved himself and his castle 10 miles north to its present position in Homestead, where he continued to work on it until 1951. The enduring mystery of the Castle is how one man could carve and move the massive stones used. The stones are made of Oolite, a sedimentary rock commonly found in southern Florida. They are carefully placed one on top of the other, with no mortar to seal them. The craftsmanship is perfect – connecting stones around the perimeter wall are uniform in height, and despite the lack of mortar, the stones sit perfectly against one another. Even the devastating 1992 Hurricane Andrew failed to destroy the castle. Leedskalnin’s living quarters were in a two story castle … The post appeared first on . is a journalist, speaker and author of “Written In Stone: Decoding The Secret Masonic Religion Hidden In Gothic Cathedrals And World Architecture.” The book uncovers a lost Wisdom Tradition that was practiced globally in antiquity, found memorialized in pyramids, Triptychs, and identical images worldwide. The central tenets of this tradition have been perpetuated in Western Secret Societies. The most visible of these is the so called “Masonic Fraternity,” an age old chivalric Order whose ranks have included Europe’s Gothic cathedral builders and America’s Founding Fathers.
