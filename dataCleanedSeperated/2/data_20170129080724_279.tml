<TITLE>DEL STONE JR.: The past is a blast … and it’s smaller</TITLE>
<TEXT>
By | Northwest Florida Daily News  
I have not been to Annette P. Edwins Elementary School since Debra McElwy successfully dodged my follow up gift to her Christmas present, Mr. Soapy bubble bath which came in a clown shaped bottle that would give today’s children nightmares and have me answering to DCF abuse charges. 
 
That was 1965, and I was in fifth grade. I don’t remember having such a hard time finding a parking spot. 
 
But I am here today because it’s Dad’s Lunch Day and I am Auxiliary Dad No. 2 to Mr. Julian, Tracey’s 10 year old. I feel like I should be Auxiliary Granddad, and indeed, I am the only white haired, pot bellied codger in the line of dads stretching out the office. But I am an alumnus, dammit, so that should count for at least cuts in the milk line. 
 
I came prepared to be surprised. That’s what happened when I visited Choctawhatchee High School about 15 years ago to speak to a class of young journalists about their futures and how they should focus on a career that would allow them to actually pay bills — oh and so people wouldn’t accuse them of underestimating the size of the inauguration crowd. 
 
When I walked into Choctaw, I was surprised that I couldn’t just walk in, which was perfectly acceptable in 1972. Osama bin Laden could have walked in carrying an atomic bomb and several plague infected rats and nobody would have said anything, except maybe, “Hey man, cool rats.” 
 
I was also surprised at how low the ceilings were. I could never have jabbed a pencil into the ceiling tiles in 1972, but now, if I wanted, I could lift the tile and hide a plague infected rat inside. 
 
So when I pulled into the Edwins parking lot, I was amazed to see that the playground and fields beyond were much LARGER than I remembered. I thought, “There’s got to be an acre of property out here — and no condos. I’ve got to take a picture of this.” 
 
I checked in at the office and headed to the cafeteria. I was struck by two things: (a) The cafeteria was almost exactly like it was in 1965, except it was tiny. (b) Turnips. 
 
Yes, it was on a day in this very cafeteria that I was so hungry I ate the turnips on my lunch tray — and I loved them. So everyone else gave me their turnips. 
 
There was the stage up front where the firefighters gave their safety presentations and played the song “Sparky’s a Fire Dog,” which nobody to this day believes was an actual song but it WAS, dammit. Why won’t anyone believe me? 
 
Julian came in wearing his faux Wayfarers and he was so cool looking I at first didn’t recognize him. But soon we were heading off down the ramp for the last block of classrooms and, as it turned out, the very classroom I sat in during the fifth grade way back in the year of our Ford Mustang. 
 
Lunch was McDonald s — cheeseburgers, chicken nuggets and lots of fries, so many we ended up sharing them with the rest of the class (a practice I wish my co workers would adopt). I got to meet Julian’s teachers and his classmates, including one inquisitive boy who had a conversation with me: 
 
Him: “Are you 49?” 
 
Me: “I wish.” 
 
Him: “How old are you?” 
 
Me: “Sixty one.” 
 
Him: “You look young. You look 49.” 
 
Me: “I’m liking this. Tell me more.” 
 
Nuggets, gone. Burgers, gone. Fries, shared. I looked around the room before leaving. I can see why I thought it was so big way back in 1965 — because it was. 
 
But now, as an Auxiliary Pot Bellied Grandad, it was not so big physically. Just gigantic in my memories.
