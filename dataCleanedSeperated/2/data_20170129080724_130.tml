<TITLE>NH Senate to take up bill to help dairy farmers</TITLE>
<TEXT>
By news@seacoastonline.com  
An amended proposal to aid state dairy farmers is expected to go before the New Hampshire Senate this week. 
 
The amendment, brought forward by the measure’s original sponsor, Sen. Jeb Bradley, R Wolfeboro, will reduce the originally proposed $3.6 million to $2 million, and will greatly simplify calculations and applications for aid. Bradley said it can also provide funds to farmers earlier in spring, “assuring that they can feed their herds until the cows can eat grass again.” 
 
The high cost of cattle feed, coupled with falling federally regulated milk prices, sent 19 state dairy farmers out of the wholesale milk business last year and caused others to sell off many of their cows. Severe drought, especially in southeast New Hampshire, made it impossible for farmers to grow enough of their own feed and sent feed prices soaring. 
 
A stream of supporters, including legislators from the Senate and House, dairy farmers and others, testified at last week’s Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing. Dissent was offered chiefly by representatives of Americans for Prosperity, who said public money should not be used to aid private businesses, and objected that this bill would aid one type of business but give no aid to others also affected by the drought. 
 
In phone interviews, Seacoast senators, Martha Fuller Clark and Dan Innis, both members of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, backed the aid provided by Senate Bill 10. 
 
Fuller Clark, D Portsmouth, who was also on the task force that initially studied the proposed bill and then its amendment, noted that unlike other private businesses, dairy farms cannot raise prices to cover their rising costs. 
 
“There is no doubt,” she said, “that dairy farmers need help.” 
 
While she believes the bill will be passed by the Senate, she urged dairy farmers to call or write their senators asking them to support it. 
 
Innis, R New Castle, said he also supports the bill. He did not record a vote in committee, explaining that he was due to testify elsewhere. But had he been present, he said, he would have voted yes. 
 
“Ordinarily, I don’t support subsidies like this but this is something we ought to do,” Innis said. “This is a special case. It stems from a natural disaster [drought].” 
 
He also believes the bill has a good chance of passing the Senate. 
 
Dairy farmer Harold “Hal” Bodmar III of Kensington is among those who have cut back operations. He sold 370 cows last year, leaving just 40 for him to feed this winter. He said he has seen three consecutive years of drought, with 2016 being the worst. Bodmar doesn’t want to close the dairy farm created by his grandfather and also operated by his father, but he is exploring specialty products such as grass fed beef, and is looking at other sales options. 
 
State Agriculture Commissioner Lorraine Merrill wrote during this summer’s drought: “Cows don’t like hot weather, and they respond by eating less and making less milk.” She also reported severe crop losses among forage crops such as alfalfa, grass and corn. Merrill, whose family operates a dairy farm in Stratham, has recused herself from administering the aid. Should the bill pass, the Department of Agriculture would appoint a staff member for the task.
