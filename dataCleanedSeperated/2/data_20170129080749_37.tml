<TITLE>Kane doesn't deal in redemption</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Black Caps captain Kane Williams says Australians always provide stiff competition in any sport. 
  
It won t surprise many to learn cool headed Kane Williamson doesn t deal in redemption or revenge. 
 
Improvement, learning, being better   these are the catchcrys the captain of the New Zealand cricket team is using as his team prepares to try and reclaim the Chappell Hadlee Trophy they meekly relinquished to Australia less than two months ago. 
 
Given the nature of that emphatic 3 0 series loss across the ditch, one could understand if the Black Caps had steam coming out their ears and their best angry snarls at the ready for the first of three one day internationals in Auckland on Monday. 
 
Perhaps under previous skipper, the more combative Brendon McCullum, we might have been in for that. 
 
  
   
   
   
   
 
With the considered and softly spoken Williamson at the helm, though, the approach to reversing the ledger from that early December demolition in Australia is somewhat different. 
 
 [Redemption and revenge] are not words we speak about,  the world s fifth ranked ODI batsmen said on the eve of the series opener at Eden Park. 
 
 It s about certainly being a lot better. We went to Australia and learned a lot. We came up against a very strong side and we were a young team. 
 
 Although it s a few games ago, there is a number of experiences the guys have had between then and now and it s important to put those into practice. 
 
 Not by trying too hard, by executing plans as best we can.  
 
Their chances of doing just that appear much brighter than they were in 68, 166 and 177 run thrashings in Australia. 
 
The Black Caps have had some confidence restored by a test series victory over Pakistan and T20, ODI and test series wins against Bangladesh. 
 
But the most important factors are undoubtedly being back on home turf and the absence of dangerous Australian batting trio David Warner and Usman Khawaja (rested) and captain Steve Smith (injured). 
 
However, much like experienced batsman Ross Taylor the day previous, there was more than one reason that didn t have Williamson leaping like Warner celebrating yet another century. 
 
 From our perspective, you always want to play the best and all three are highly ranked in all formats, but particularly one day,  he said. 
 
 Naturally it changes their side. They are world class players but Australia aren t No 1 in the world for no reason. 
 
 They have a number of world class players still and very good depth in their country, the guys they ve brought in (Aaron Finch and Shaun Marsh) have a lot of international experience and we know we have to be at our best come tomorrow.  
 
One player who will be under extra scrutiny in that sense is New Zealand s Tom Latham. 
 
Williamson confirmed the opening batsman would take the gloves ahead of the uncapped Tom Blundell after Latham made two stumpings in a tidy display for Canterbury in a domestic one day clash on Saturday. 
 
Latham has carried out the role for the Black Caps in three ODIs and four Twenty20 matches and although the last of those was in 2013, his extra experience and versatility, which allows an extra all rounder to be picked in the middle order, got him the nod. 
 
Williamson also confirmed Neil Broom would bat at No 5 behind Latham, Martin Guptill, himself and Ross Taylor but said they wanted another look at the Eden Park pitch when the covers came off on Monday morning before locking in their 11. 
 
 It looks like another good surface, pretty good for batting,  he said. 
 
 However if you put the ball in the right area on drop in wickets at times it can build pressure. 
 
 Obviously there is the small boundaries but sometimes that can lure players in and we ve seen low scoring, tight games here on good surfaces. 
 
 It will be interesting to see how it plays and how the game unfolds.
