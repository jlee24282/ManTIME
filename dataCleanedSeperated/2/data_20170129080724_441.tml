<TITLE>Carl Frampton beaten by Leo Santa Cruz in Las Vegas</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Tiger s Bay man Carl Frampton suffered heartbreak on his Las Vegas debut as he lost his world title. 
 
Like his manager Barry McGuigan in 1986, Frampton was undone by another Cruz as the Mexican won back his WBA Super world featherweight title to hand the Ulsterman his first pro defeat. 
 
Frampton gave everything, but this time Leo Santa Cruz was too clever as he fought at range to win by a majority decision. 
 
Santa Cruz racked up the early rounds as he outlanded Frampton to build up an unassailable lead. 
 
Santa Cruz deserved his narrow win to avenge his loss to Frampton in New York in July and now the clamour will grow for a third deciding fight. 
 
Frampton accepted the loss with dignity and called for a third fight in Belfast.

 He was clever and he used his reach well,  he said.  I think he deserved to win, being honest. 
 
 I hope we can do it again and we have to it again. He can come to Belfast.  
 
Floyd Mayweather Junior was here at his former home, along with the great and good of Britain and Northern Ireland, including David Haye, Amir Khan, George Groves, James Nesbitt and Northern Ireland boss Michael O Neill. 
 
Frampton came out low at the start of the first to make himself an even smaller target for the taller and ranger Santa Cruz, but was still picked off by the Mexican s jab.

Santa Cruz was disciplined and was keeping out of Frampton s shorter range, making it hard for the champion to fire off any shots. 
 
Frampton had some success on the inside in the third, but it was proving to be tough going for the Ulsterman. 
 
Santa Cruz was giving as good as he was getting in the close exchanges and Frampton slipped at the end of the fourth as he back pedalled out of trouble. 
 
Santa Cruz was outpunching and outlanding Frampton and the champ was falling behind on the scorecards. 
 
The thousands of Irish fans among the 10,085 crowd inside the MGM Grand Garden Arena did their best to lift their man and Santa Cruz was in control.

The skirmishes, when Frampton did manage to get inside of Santa Cruz s jab, were inconclusive and he needed to do something to change the tempo of the fight. 
 
Frampton was only having isolated successes when he came inside and by the end of the eighth, Santa Cruz had outlanded him by nearly two to one. 
 
Frampton finally did better in the ninth and landed more frequently on Santa Cruz, who had slowed down, carrying on this good work in the 10th. 
 
The pair embraced at the start of the 12th in a sign of their mutual respect before Frampton went all out in a sign that he knew he was behind. 
 
It was not enough and in the end judges Dave Moretti and Glenn Feldman scored the contest 115 113 for Santa Cruz, while Burt Clements saw it as a draw 114 114.
