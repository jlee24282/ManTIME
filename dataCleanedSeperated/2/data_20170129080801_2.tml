<TEXT>
NEW YORK STATE POLICE 

  
On Sunday, January 15th, 2017, the New York State Police based in Fonda arrested 35 year old Bryan Cerny of Broadalbin for DWI after a property damage automobile accident investigation. 
At approximately 5:45pm, the State Police were dispatched to a one vehicle property damage automobile accident at the intersection of Maple Avenue and Hagaman Avenue in the Village of Hagaman. Upon arrival, the operator of the vehicle, later identified as Bryan Cerny of Broadalbin, was attempting to start the vehicle, a 2009 Hyundai Elantra, and leave. The vehicle had significant front end damage with air bag deployment. It became apparent to the trooper that the operator was unaware that he was involved in an accident. The trooper observed the odor of alcoholic beverage emanating from within the passenger compartment of the vehicle. Mr. Cerny was requested to perform Standardized Field Sobriety Tests, which he did and subsequently failed. He also submitted to a Pre Breath Test screening which yielded a positive result for the presence of alcohol. 
 
Mr. Cerny was arrested for DWI and transported back to the State Police barracks in Fonda. While at SP Fonda, he submitted to a breath test which yielded a 0.28% BAC. Mr. Cerny was processed without incident and charged with Aggravated DWI due to having a reportable BAC of 0.18% or greater. He was issued tickets returnable to the Town of Amsterdam Court on 01/26/17 and released to a sober third party.
