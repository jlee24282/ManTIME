• Residents worry about a man half frozen in the cold weather. 
 
George Tuttle of Mercer Street was lying in the Youngstown City Hospital in a serious condition from exposure. He was found half frozen and unconscious near the Standard Table Oilcloth Works west of Girard about midnight. 
 
Passers saw the form of a man lying near the P amp; LE tracks and investigation proved him to be unconscious and seemingly badly frozen. 
 
Orr’s ambulance was summoned up from Youngstown and the man rushed to the Youngstown City Hospital. At first it was thought he could not recover but physicians later stated that his condition was not so serious and that he might recover. 
 
George Tuttle, a son, left with Warren’s contingent of 56 men who went to Camp Sheridan. Mr. Tuttle saw the boy off and then went to Youngstown. He was a great walker and often walked 10 or 12 miles. It was possible that he started to walk part way home and becoming ill, he was overcome by the cold. 
 
50 years ago in 1967: 
 
• Flags were flying half staff over Trumbull County and Warren city buildings in memory of astronauts Gus Grissom, Edward White and Roger Chaffee, who died in a Jan. 27 fire aboard the Apollo I capsule at Cape Kennedy. 
 
• Newton Falls police Department released its yearly report. 
 
Police Chief Earl McGregor released the activity report for his department for 1966, showing 53 arrests for civil offenses and 141 for traffic violations for a total of 194. 
 
The largest number of civil arrests was for intoxication, 19; disturbance, 6; and assault and battery, 6. 
 
The report states 771 complaints were investigated, 76 accidents investigated, 39 persons injured, and 30 cases of property damage were reported. 
 
There were also 75 warnings issued, two persons reported missing and twopersons returned. 
 
25 years ago in 1992: 
 
• A township road was reported to have growing pains as state Route 46, also known as Niles Cortland Road, was being widened. 
 
Commercial development along Ohio 46 requires many changes as it stretches through this township toward its namesake cities to the south and north. 
 
And when the winter weather breaks and road widening and waterline installation work begins, the state highway started to look like it was bursting at the seems. 
 
Federal money was used to widen the pavement to four — and in places, five — lanes between U.S. 422 and North River Road, according to William Clark of the Ohio Department of Transportation. 
 
The county also planned to tie into a Niles waterline near Mines Road and Ohio 46 in order to supply customers in Howland. Charles Miller, Trumbull County sanitary engineer, said dialogue was under way between county and highway officials to synchronize the two projects. 
 
Near the Mines water tie in was a 17 acre chunk of land on the west side of the road that was earmarked for the plaza. The land was idle following the sale of 17 to 18 homes on the site. 
 
10 years ago in 2007: 
 
• A new home for Harley lovers in Austintown rated a new name and designation. 
 
The area where the Harley Davidson store was to be built was designated “Bike Town” by the township trustees. 
 
The six acre complex, located next to Quaker Steak and Lube near the intersection of Interstate 80 and state Route 46, will be the new home of Harley Davidson / Buell of Youngstown. 
 
The business is expected to open a 42,000 square foot facility in July of 2007. 
 
Tom Wronkovich, president / CEO of Harley Davidson / Buell of Youngstown, asked trustees for a resolution that would give the complex the official designation of Bike Town. 
 
“We understand this is strictly an honorary designation,” Wronkovich said. “Our intention was simply to ask the township’s help in promoting our facility.” 
 
The store was expected to be half as large as the Canfield Township location and was expected to employ 80 people and offer training to enable new riders to obtain their motorcycles. 
 
“We expect to attract motorcycle enthusiasts from a large area, and that will benefit the township as a whole,” Wronkovich said.
