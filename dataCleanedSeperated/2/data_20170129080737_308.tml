Horan was chatting to the guys over at Heat, when he said,  I ve been doing it for a while. I recorded  What Makes You Beautiful  in my boxers.  What Makes You Beautiful  was the first time I did it because it was really warm in the studio, and I ve done it ever since.  

While many of the One Direction boys have been involved in long term and high profile relationships, Niall Horan has been linked to a number of different women. It was recently claimed that Niall Horan and Ellie Goulding are dating, although both parties have come out and insisted that they are just good friends.
