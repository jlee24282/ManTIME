<TITLE>Kogi lawmaker calls on government to issue OPLs on Ibaji Oil</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Hon Emmanuel Makoji Egwu representing IdahIbajiIgalamela OdoluOfu federal constituency has called on the Federal Government to issue Oil Prospecting Licences on Ibaji oil with immediate effect

He stated this in an interview with DAILY POST in Abuja decrying that government’s inability to issue OPLs was denying itself and the state of revenues

Egwu explained that oil which was discovered in commercial quantity had only one OPLs issued to Orient Petroleum which was being explored but a situation where other areas in Alade a community and other places at Ibaji in Kogi State have been lying fallow was unacceptable

The lawmaker wondered at efforts being made by FG in looking for oil in the Northeast by committing huge sums of money while that of Kogiwhich has been discovered and awaiting exploration was left fallow

 I know of the serious effort which the federal government was making in the North East looking for oil while that of Kogi already discovered has been left fallow  he said

 Only one OPL was issued to Orient Petroleum but those at a community called Alade and around Ibaji in my federal constituency have not been issued with OPLs I call on government to issue out OPLs to oil prospecting companies immediately  he added

According to him the motions and campaigns which he had launched on the floor of the House was to draw government’s attention to the oil and other exploratory activities in the federal constituency which government should carry out in order to beef up economic profile of the nation

He added that a federal road from Ajegwu – Idah – Onyedega the headquarters of Ibaji LGA which was approved a long time has not been constructed saying the road would enhance transportation of mineral resources in the area

 There are other mineral resources to be explored in the area apart from oil and if the road from Ajegwu – Idah – Onyedega which was approved a long time ago is constructed it will ease transportation  Egwu maintained Top Stories
