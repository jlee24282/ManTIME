MONROE, LA   COURTESY ULM SPORTS INFORMATION 

The ULM menâ€™s basketball team could not overcome a second half onslaught from beyond the arc from visiting Arkansas State in route to the Warhawks  eighth straight Sun Belt Conference loss, 73 63 on Saturday afternoon. 

After taking a one point lead into halftime, the Warhawks could not hold back Arkansas State and its red hot shooting from deep in the second half. The Red Wolves went 8 of 14 from three point range in the second half to help them to the road victory. 

Senior guard Nick Coppola led the Warhawks with 19 points on 6 of 12 shooting. Coppola also matched a career high with five three pointers made. He previously knocked down five three pointers back on February 21, 2015, also against Arkansas State.
