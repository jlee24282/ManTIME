<TITLE>Marcel Proust: In Search of Lost Time "volumes 1 to 7" [Classics Authors Vol: 9] (Black Horse Classics)</TITLE>
<TEXT>
In Search of Lost Time (French: À la recherche du temps perdu)— previously also translated as Remembrance of Things Past, is a novel in seven volumes, written by Marcel Proust (1871–1922). It is considered to be his most prominent work, known both for its length and its theme of involuntary memory, the most famous example being the  episode of the madeleine  which occurs early in the first volume. It gained fame in English in translations by C. K. Scott Moncrieff and Terence Kilmartin as Remembrance of Things Past, but the title In Search of Lost Time, a literal rendering of the French, has gained usage since D. J. Enright adopted it for his revised translation published in 1992.The novel began to take shape in 1909. Proust continued to work on it until his final illness in the autumn of 1922 forced him to break off. Proust established the structure early on, but even after volumes were initially finished he kept adding new material and edited one volume after another for publication. The last three of the seven volumes contain oversights and fragmentary or unpolished passages, as they existed only in draft form at the death of the author; the publication of these parts was overseen by his brother Robert.Also Available in Black Horse Classics1   Mark Twain2   Charles Dickens3   William Shakespeare4   Jane Austen5   leo Tolstoy6   Jack London7   Rudyard Kipling8   H.G Wells9   Marcel Proust10   Victor Hugo11   Fyodor Dostoyevsky12   Jules Vernes13   Thomas Hardy14  Joseph Conrad15  Oscar Wilde16  Herman Melville17   Edgar Allan Poe18   Henry James19   Lewis Carroll20   Hans Christen Andersen
