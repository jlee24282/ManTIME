<TITLE>Starting off every day with a smile</TITLE>
<TEXT>
“Start every day off with a smile. At least it’s a good start.” 
 
This is the advice I found in a Chinese fortune cookie recently, and I try to follow it somewhat, but it was hard to do this past Monday. 
 
The Steelers had gone down to defeat with multiple mistakes and the injury of Le’veon Bell. And my “Ralphie onesie” pajamas that I told about wearing for the past two games that brought victory did nothing to save the day. 
 
I wore them during the Miami Dolphin game, and there was a victory and also against the Kansas City Chiefs, although that one was too close for comfort. This time it didn’t work. 
 
I don’t know who I will be cheering for during the Super Bowl as the Green Bay Packers are gone, but I won’t be wearing my flannel onesie, that’s for sure.

Sunday afternoon was a day of smiles, though. I was invited by Joyce Klinger to the 100th birthday of a warm and very chipper lady, Helen Bass Smith, at the Cadiz Presbyterian Church. It was nice seeing people I have known since my days of bringing in the news while stationed at the Cadiz Bureau of the Herald Star, starting in 1980. 
 
Helen is quick to point out that she is not a native of Cadiz because she keeps getting reminded of this by the locals. She came to Harrison County in 1935, after graduation from Toronto High School, the city where she had lived with her parents and siblings. And she did not always attend the Cadiz Presbyterian Church, where she now is noted as a loyal and active member. 
 
She sat in the pews at the Ridge Presbyterian Church on Hanover Ridge Road near Scio for 61 years before becoming a member at the Cadiz Presbyterian Church. That seems like a long time ago, but when you have reached your 100th birthday, it doesn’t seem that long. 
 
Helen was born Jan. 22, 1917, the very day 100 years later when the Cadiz church social room was filled with well wishers who kept streaming over to wish her many more happy years. She was married to Hugh Smith, who died more than 20 years ago. There are no children. 
 
She lives by herself and still drives her car in town and out to the Harrison Community Hospital. It was there that she volunteered her cheerful help for more than 20 years to those who were ailing and needed to see a smiling face. 
 
Her brother, Edward Bass, from Watertown, N.Y., who is a young 94 year old, was present, along with nieces and other family members. 
 
Helen was greeted and given a framed certificate from Mayor Ken Zitko and some very encouraging words from Dale Norris, Harrison County commission president. 
 
Norris read from an outline on the gracious 100 year old saying, “She has been a longtime dedicated ambassador for Christianity as a loyal and active member of the Presbyterian church, steadfast in her commitment to helping others and strengthening the Christian faith of her church members. And she continues to do so while celebrating her 100th birthday,” Norris said. 
 
“Helen has been an exceptional role model for all Harrison County residents, both young and old. She was honored by the village of Cadiz in 2007, on this same exact date, for serving as a devoted volunteer at the Harrison Community Hospital,” the commissioner concluded. 
 
Commissioner Don Bethel wrote the words of appreciation for her love of others and unwavering devotion to Christianity, her Presbyterian Church and members. 
 
It was interesting to note that her brother, Edward, was born above his parents’ C.M.S. Store, a 5  amp; 10 cent business in Toronto. He went to Toronto High School until his freshman year and graduated from what was known as Cadiz High School in 1940. There was a brother two years older, William John, who has passed away. 
 
Ed will be celebrating an anniversary himself on Feb. 2. It will be 75 years since he joined the U.S. Marines in 1942 during World War II. With a big smile, he said, “You know the saying, once a Marine, always a Marine.” 
 
His journey through the 1st Marine Division took him through Parris Island; Quanico; the West Coast; Melbourne, Australia; and ended up in Okinawa. 
 
He plans to go with family to Hawaii in February to see the U.S. Arizona, the battleship that sank at the hands of the Japanese on Dec. 7, 1941. It was at 7:55 a.m. Hawaiian time when 350 Japanese planes bombed the U.S. Naval Base, and more than 2,000 were killed. 
 
“It has been my bucket list to see the sunken battleship for many years. Now on my 75th anniversary from enlisting I will get to fulfill it,” Ed said. 
 
The Cadiz Presbyterian Church ladies decorated a china cake cutter with flowers and Helen’s name and birthdate to be used for the cutting of the three cakes to represent the number 100. She started with the number one and made a generous slice. Joyce Klinger took over after then, as Helen was surrounded with family and friends who wanted to take pictures and talk. 
 
I was surprised to see Sheila Bond, Smithfield fiscal officer, at the dinner party, but even though she works in Smithfield, she is a resident of Cadiz. She said she did not recognize me immediately either. I was out of my territory as well. 
 
There were mylar balloons floating in the air for the celebration, and Helen, who gets around very well and moves with ease, wore the best adornment she could possibly wear, a big beautiful smile.

Char Bell Branch, a former Smithfield resident and daughter of Bob Beall, wrote to tell me that her dad died at the age of 84 on Jan. 8 in Las Vegas, where they moved in 1979. 
 
In Smithfield, he was known as “Slick 50” because of his skillful moves on the football field and his jersey number of 50. 
 
After graduation and marriage to Grace Cooper Beall Webb, they moved to Steubenville, and the family joined the Mount Zion Baptist Church under the leadership of the Rev. Alfred Hunt, and he was a member of the trustee board. 
 
Lamont and I met with Char, Bob and Kara “Cobby” Bright of Smithfield for dinner when we were in Vegas in the early 1990s. Char said that her dad, who was famous for wearing distinctive cowboy hats, boots, western shirts and a big bright smile, always spoke of that meeting. He was the type who could make anyone feel like everything was going to turn out right.

I purchased more than 20 “Spectator” Smithfield High School newspapers that were published during the years of 1951 thorough 1959 at the Smithfield Alumni Association banquet last year at the first auction. I am finding it very interesting to read about the people I knew back then but had forgotten about and the businesses that were in the village during that time and had placed ads in the publication. Can you believe there was an advertising department at the school? 
 
I’ll ask those who still live in Smithfield if they remember any of these mentioned businesses: Doris Smith Johnson Beauty Shop, Lew’s Sunoco Service, Co op Store, E.H. Welday Electric Co., Welday’s Orchard, Thomasson’s Hardware, Woodford’s Shell Service, Buzz Park’s Barber Shop, Slaga’s Florist, Frances Beauty Shop, Ford’s Smithfield Auto and McElroy’s Drug Store. These are the ones that placed ads that week, but there are many others. 
 
I was a feature editor for the Spectator — I think Octa Foster had something to do with naming our paper — and was awarded a Quill and Scroll Award from the Herald Star in 1954 for the best feature columns in area schools. I still have that medallion.

I would like to end this column with a poem written for the Spectator by Clara Hasley McClure, a senior at that time. There is no title but it has loads of meaning. 
 
“It’s not the motto on your wall, 
 
That counts in life, you know. 
 
It is the things you say and do, 
 
It’s what your actions show. 
 
It’s not what you say you are, 
 
That people judge you by. 
 
It’s by your attitude in life, 
 
With what standard you comply.”
