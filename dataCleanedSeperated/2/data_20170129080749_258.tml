<TITLE>Car Talk: Adaptive headlights got inspiration from Tucker</TITLE>
<TEXT>
By DEAR CAR TALK: I remember reading about the Tucker automobile that tried to come out around 1950. It had a headlight in the center of the grille that turned with the direction of the steering wheel. It sounds like a good idea to me. Why hasn t that idea been incorporated in other cars? I would appreciate your comments.   Harry 
 
RAY: The 1948 Tucker (called the Tucker 48) had a bunch of innovative safety features, including a perimeter frame for crash protection, a reinforced roof in case of rollovers, a padded dashboard and a shatterproof glass windshield   all stuff we take for granted today. 
 
But most people remember that  third eyeball,   Cyclops  headlight in the middle of the front grille that turned with the steering wheel. 
 
It was a great idea, and guess what, Harry? You can now get it on a number of new cars, often as optional equipment. Not the third, middle eye, but regular headlights that swivel with the direction of the car. 
 
They re called adaptive headlights, and they usually work with small electric motors that can adjust the aim of the headlights about 15 degrees in either direction. 
 
Like everything else these days, they use computer power to figure out how fast the car is going (so your headlights aren t flying back and forth every time you parallel park), the angle of the steering wheel and how quickly the car is turning. 
 
Based on those inputs, the electric motors aim the lights to try to keep their illumination on the road ahead of you while you re making a turn, rather than lighting up the trees at the side of the road. 
 
Some cars also use a separate  side  pointing light for very low speed turning, like when you re turning off the road into a driveway. That can be helpful, too. 
 
The adaptive headlights we ve tested work really well. They re absolutely a desirable safety feature. I suspect they ll trickle down to more and more affordable cars over the next few years. 
 
But even now, you can get them on certain (usually higher end trim levels) cars as common as the VW Jetta, all new Minis, the Mazda 3 and 6, the 2017 Hyundai Elantra and the Subaru Outback. 
 
Do you really need that truck if you only make one trip to the lumberyard per year? Find out what kind of car NOT to get in Click and Clack s pamphlet  Should I Buy, Lease or Steal My Next Car?  Send $4.75 (check or money order) to Car Talk/Next Car, 628 Virginia Drive, Orlando, FL 32803.
