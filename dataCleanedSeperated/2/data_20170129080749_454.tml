<TITLE>Arrogate wins Pegasus World Cup as Dubai World Cup winner California Chrome fades</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Dubai World Cup winner California Chrome ended his storied career on a disappointing note on Saturday as Arrogate celebrated his new status as the world’s best racehorse with a narrow victory at the $12 million (Dh44m) Pegasus World Cup in Florida.

Hall of Fame jockey Mike Smith piloted four year old colt Arrogate into the lead with a dominant run around the final turn and he pulled away down the straight to win by three and a half lengths.

Arrogate covered the 1810 metres distance at Gulfstream Park in an unofficial time of 1 minute, 47.61 seconds to secure the $7m first prize.

Shaman Ghost finished second, with Neolithic battling home third.

California Chrome, meanwhile, faded down the stretch in the final race of a standout career that included victories at the 2014 Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes and the 2016 Dubai World Cup.

It was a disappointing climax to a much anticipated repeat showdown between Arrogate and Chrome, who had placed one two after a thrilling finish to the Breeders’ Cup Classic three months ago at Santa Anita in California.

 Another incredible performance,  Smith told NBC Sports about Arrogate, who started from the one hole as favourite.

 I was able to use the first turn to our advantage, stayed on the rail ... it was just a matter of getting the trip.

 I looked halfway down the backside and I saw (jockey) Victor (Espinoza) having the nudge on Chrome a little. He had me right where he wanted me but Chrome just didn’t fire his race today at all.

 Believe me, that’s not the California Chrome I know. He would have been on top of me. I was able to tip out and he (Arrogate) was gone after that. I don’t mean any disrespect to the other good horses, but he got to gear down the last 100 yards. 

In a blow to racing fans in the UAE, trainer Bob Baffert has already ruled Arrogate out of competing at the Dubai World Cup.

 I wouldn’t take him to Dubai,  he said.  We bought him for American racing, and with his pedigree we want him to stay in America. 

Chrome, North America’s all time leading money earner and the Horse of the Year in 2014 and 2016, ended his stellar career placed ninth in a 12 runner field, his worst ever finish in his 27th race.
