<TITLE>Good Neighbors marks 57 years</TITLE>
<TEXT>
This and every year, the Wintersville Good Neighbors Association wishes to thank our supporters, area groups and volunteers who were so faithful in helping us make our Christmas 2016 drive a blessing for 74 families, including 160 children, in the immediate Wintersville area. Every year we are blessed with old and new supporters and volunteers. 
 
We wish to thank the members of the Wintersville United Methodist Church for use of their fellowship hall. The church’s members and youth group, along with members of the Word of Life Fellowship and youth group volunteered many hours to organize, pack and distribute food and gifts for families. 
 
Our sincere thanks to our dedicated member, Kitty Ferguson, who once again coordinated our toy drive. She does an awesome job year after year collecting, sorting and wrapping the toys for the children, along with her faithful helpers. 
 
Our sincere thanks to Sis Brannon, who collects toys during the year and donates to Wintersville Good Neighbors for our Christmas drive. 
 
Our sincere thanks to our special friends and supporters — Mary Kay Schuetz, Mrs. and Mrs. Thomas Galbreath and our secret Santa. 
 
We wish to thank the Wintersville businesses that allowed us space for our toy boxes — Riesbeck’s, Kroger, Big Lots, Family Dollar and Dollar General. 
 
Much appreciation goes to Manager Beth Carlson and Dale and Brenda Boyd of the Wintersville Kroger for the timely organization of our large food order. 
 
Our many thanks to Ken Cornish, who coordinates the delivery effort each year, teaming up with many helpers who deliver many boxes to the seniors and shut ins. 
 
Once again, our sincere thanks go to William Davis of State Park Motors, who blesses us with a truck each year to pick up the food and deliver the boxes to the families who are unable to come to the church. 
 
Our heartfelt thanks to the following groups and individuals for their generous monetary support: Wintersville United Methodist Church, Wintersville United Methodist Mens Club, Wintersville United Methodist Women, American Legion Post No. 557, Wintersville Women’s Club, Starkdale Presbyterian Church, Dan and Laura Daily, David and Patricia Daily, Word of Life Fellowship, Wintersville Elementary School, American Legion Post 557 Auxiliary, Wintersville United Methodist Church Youth Group, Jefferson County Christian School, Toys for Tots, Titanium Metals and Mary Beth Allan. 
 
God bless.
