<TITLE>Premiers Canberra United face costly move to Canberra Stadium for W-League semi-final</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Newly crowned W League premiers Canberra United face being forced away from Fortress McKellar to play their do or die semi final and a hit to their hip pocket in the process.

United coach Rae Dower says they ve earned the right to host their semi against Melbourne City at their home ground, rather than have to play it as part of a double header with the A League clash between Central Coast Mariners and Adelaide United at Canberra Stadium on Sunday.

United were crowned W League premiers on Sunday after Sydney FC lost 5 2 to Adelaide United and Perth Glory could only manage a 1 0 victory over the Western Sydney Wanderers.

Canberra requested to play their semi at McKellar Park on Saturday — the day before the Mariners come to town.

A home final would pocket them about $15,000 in gate takings and given the W League team is run on a lean budget, that would be a substantial financial boost.

If they play at Canberra Stadium, then all gate takings would go to the Mariners, but Fairfax Media believes Canberra United would seek financial compensation from the FFA.

It s the second game Central Coast will play at Canberra Stadium this summer, having already played the Wellington Phoenix there in November in front of 5497 fans.

Canberra United were expecting a crowd of at least 1500 for their semi — the perfect number for the boutique McKellar Park.

The FFA met on Sunday afternoon to decide the semi final fixtures, although an announcement was not expected to be made until Monday.

Dower said they d pushed for their semi to be played at McKellar and had earned the right to hold it there.

The sticking point will be Fox Sports will be reluctant to set up television cameras to cover two games at two different venues on different days in Canberra, when they could simply cover them both at Canberra Stadium.

 That s certainly not our preference, our preference is to play [at McKellar],  Dower said.

 This is our home, this is Fortress McKellar so from my perspective a lot of other clubs have had a fair say of where they re allowed to play this year, so I would hope that we got the opportunity to put in our first request and to be granted that as well.

 Especially if you re finishing No.1 or two on the ladder I think you ve earned the right to play at your own home ground.

 It s out of our control, we can t do anything about it. I m not going to stir the hornet s nest, but a number of other teams have had the opportunity to control where they ve played this year. 

Another sticking point is training.

United can train throughout the week at McKellar for minimal cost, but would get limited access to Canberra Stadium.

Last time the Mariners were in town, Canberra played its season opener against Melbourne City as part of a Canberra Stadium double header, losing that game 2 1.

They were unable to train on the ground in the lead up to that match.

United co captain Ellie Brush reiterated Dower s preference, but added they d be ready regardless of where the game was.

 This is our favoured home, but ... we don t really mind where we suit up, we know the crowd will get out and support us. Just two more [wins] to go,  she said.

Dower said Brush s fellow co captain Michelle Heyman was unlikely to be ready for the semi, although she had returned to training with the main group as she continued her comeback from toe and ankle injuries.

The Matildas striker has been out since she rolled her ankle against the Melbourne Victory at the end of December.

 She was back training [Friday], which was a great sight to see her out here at McKellar juggling, jogging laps, kicking the ball around,  Dower said.

 It was really great. Next week might be asking too much, but at least she s back in the frame now and she s running herself around.
