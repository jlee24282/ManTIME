<TITLE>Presidential front-runner warns accusations play into far-right hands</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Paris: Embattled French presidential front runner Francois Fillon warned on Sunday that muck raking against mainstream candidates in the race for the Elysee Palace could end up propelling the far right National Front to power.

 If we continue to try to destroy credible candidates in the presidential election, this is how it ll end,  Fillon told the Journal du Dimanche newspaper in an interview. The conservative former prime minister had seemed odds on to win the presidency in elections to be held in three months  time, until satirical weekly Le Canard Enchaine published a story this week that threw his campaign off track.

The report said his wife had received a salary from fake jobs, including several years as his parliamentary assistant. Fillon has denied the jobs were fake and said his wife had for years proof read his speeches and prepared press reviews. In Sunday s paper, Fillon vowed to fight the accusations  all the way  but said he had never expected the presidential campaign to be so hard.  I had no idea it would be so violent and drop that low,  he said.

An official inquiry into the allegations has been opened. On Thursday, investigators searched the Left Bank headquarters of the prestigious Revue des Deux Mondes She was paid â‚¬100,000 ($141,000) for an 18 month stint at the journal, owned by a billionaire businessman friend of Fillon, according to the weekly, which said it had only found two articles signed under her pseudonym. Investigators have also seized Francois Fillon s file at France s official anti corruption watchdog, which contains previous wealth declarations, the source added.

What French media dubbed  Penelopegate  has rattled Fillon s supporters. It was not clear who could take up the baton if Fillon were forced to drop out of the race. On Friday, Fillon s former rival for the conservative ticket, Bordeaux mayor Alain Juppe, ruled out replacing him should he step down over the scandal.

Seeking to retake the initiative, Fillon will hold a rally in Paris later on Sunday. In the interview, Fillon said he could bring France s unemployment rate, currently hovering around 10 per cent, below 7 per cent by the end of the next five year term thanks to a mix of deregulation, lower taxes on wages and a higher retirement age.
