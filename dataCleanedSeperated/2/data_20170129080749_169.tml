You nique Bou tique, affectionately called  You Bou  by regular clients, opened their new La Porte location in mid May of 2016. The boutique offers brand new fashions and eclectic jewelry for ladies who love to dress and feel unique. Shoes, hosiery, and handbags were also added last year in their own section of the store referred to as  Shu Bou.  Chrissy Berry, Fashion Stylist, commented  Our style is vintage inspired; ruffles, layers, lace and crochet; very feminine and extremely pretty. I love to help our customers pull together a special outfit or suggest an embellished top that works well with a beloved skirt for a fresh new look!
