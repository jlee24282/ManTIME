<TEXT>
Herdsmen in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region held horse and camel racing on Saturday in celebration of the Chinese New Year. 

More than 100 horse-riders raced against each other on a snowfield in the Hulunbeir City of Inner Mongolia despite the low temperature of minus 30 degrees Celsius. The race, organized by 28 volunteer herdsmen's families, consisted of sprints of 2,000 meters and 4,000 meters, and a marathon of 7,000 meters. 

A 10-kilometer camel racing was held in Duolun County, Xilin Gol League, in the region on Saturday, attracting nearly 100 participants and many more spectators. The champion was awarded 20,000 yuan. 

Horse and camel racing is a traditional sport and entertainment event for the Mongol people living on the grassland.
