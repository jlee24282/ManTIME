<TITLE>Neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (Nd:YAG) 1064-nm picosecond laser vs. Nd:YAG 1064-nm nanosecond laser in tattoo removal: a randomized controlled single-blind clinical trial</TITLE>


<TEXT>
Summary  Background  
For decades, nanosecond lasers (NSLs) have been <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">used</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">remove</EVENT> tattoos. Since <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2012">2012</TIMEX3>, pulses of picosecond lasers (PSLs) have been available for tattoo removal. Based on a few observational studies, the claim has been <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">made</EVENT> that PSLs are considerably more effective while <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">showing</EVENT> fewer side effects in comparison with NSLs. 
 Objectives  
To <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">compare</EVENT> the efficacy and side effects of a PSL side by side with an NSL for tattoo removal. 
 Methods  
Twenty one patients with 30 black tattoos were <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">treated</EVENT> with PSL and NSL in a split study design in two sessions at intervals of <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P6W">6 weeks</TIMEX3>. The safety and <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE">efficacy</EVENT> of laser treatments were <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE">determined</EVENT> by blinded observers assessing randomized digital photographs in this prospective clinical study. The primary end point was the clearance of the tattoos <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE">ranging</EVENT> in quartiles from 0% to 100%; secondary end points were side effects and pain. 
 Results  
The average clearance overall as evaluated <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE">showed</EVENT> no statistical difference between NSL and PSL ( P = 1·00). <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE">Using</EVENT> a visual analogue scale (0 = no pain, 10 = maximum pain), a value of 3·8 ± 1·0 was <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE">reported</EVENT> for the PSL, which was statistically different from NSL (7·9 ± 1·1, P  lt; 0·001). Transient side effects were <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE">observed</EVENT>, as well as hypo  and hyperpigmentation, but there was no statistically significant difference between PSL and NSL. 
 Conclusions  
After two treatments of black tattoos with a neodymium <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE">doped</EVENT> yttrium aluminium garnet laser (<TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="1064">1064</TIMEX3> nm), the use of picosecond pulses does not <EVENT eid="e15" class="I_STATE">provide</EVENT> better clearance than nanosecond pulses. However, pain is less severe when <EVENT eid="e16" class="OCCURRENCE">using</EVENT> a PSL.
