<TITLE>Double the fun as school year begins</TITLE>


<TEXT>
It will be a case seeing double for teachers at Linton Primary School and Ballarat North Primary School on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="TIME" value="2017-01-23TMO">Monday morning</TIMEX3>. It will be a case <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">seeing</EVENT> double for teachers at Linton Primary School and Ballarat North Primary School when two sets of twins <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">embark</EVENT> on their <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="PXD">first day</TIMEX3> at school <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-W05">this week</TIMEX3>. 

They will be <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">joining</EVENT> the hundreds of children from across Victoria, <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">pulling</EVENT> on their school uniforms and <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">heading</EVENT> into classrooms for the first time.

But for Linton mother Kelly Dishot, the milestone is all the more special. 

Her five-year-old fraternal twin boys, Liam and Rhys, were both <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">diagnosed</EVENT> as being on the autism spectrum when they were two. 

For us, its a huge milestone, Ms Dishot <EVENT eid="e7" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT>. We were always really proactive about <EVENT eid="e8" class="I_ACTION">getting</EVENT> them a lot of assistance early on to <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE">get</EVENT> to the point where they could <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE">go</EVENT> to a mainstream school with support in place for them throughout their schooling. 

The boys will <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE">start</EVENT> at Linton Primary School on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-01-24">Tuesday</TIMEX3>. 

Ms Dishort <EVENT eid="e12" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT> six of the seven preps <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE">starting</EVENT> at the tight-knit primary school had <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE">attended</EVENT> kindergarten together.

The other children already have a big acceptance of the boys and their differences already, she <EVENT eid="e15" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT>. Its also really great because it has <EVENT eid="e16" class="OCCURRENCE">educated</EVENT> the other children who have <EVENT eid="e17" class="OCCURRENCE">gone</EVENT> to kindergarten with Liam and Rhys from a young age, that all children are different, and not everybody is the same.

Ms Dishort <EVENT eid="e18" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT> she <EVENT eid="e19" class="I_STATE">wanted</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e20" class="OCCURRENCE">send</EVENT> her boys to Linton Primary School because of its inclusiveness and the and the strong educational support system the school has in place.

And, if the boys were <EVENT eid="e21" class="OCCURRENCE">feeling</EVENT> a little apprehensive on their <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="PXD">first day</TIMEX3>, their older sister Tara will be there who is <EVENT eid="e22" class="OCCURRENCE">starting</EVENT> grade two at the school, will be right there beside them. 

Ballarat father David Willison is <EVENT eid="e23" class="I_STATE">expecting</EVENT> the house will be a a lot quieter without his five-year-old twin daughters Ella and Jade. They start school at Ballarat North Primary School on <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-01-25">Wednesday</TIMEX3>.

Its certainly going to be little weird to begin with, he <EVENT eid="e24" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT>. But they are both so excited and really <EVENT eid="e25" class="OCCURRENCE">looking</EVENT> forward to it. They do a lot together, but theyre also very independent and have <EVENT eid="e26" class="OCCURRENCE">opted</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e27" class="OCCURRENCE">go</EVENT> in separate classes <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017">this year</TIMEX3>.
