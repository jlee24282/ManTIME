<TITLE>Village life has a story behind every story</TITLE>


<TEXT>
There exists in Discovery Bay a dossier of the lives, achievements, and contributions of some of its more outstanding citizens, all of whom have had significant impact on the development of their community. 
 
Discovery Bay is not alone in this undertaking. A number of towns and communities all around Jamaica have on occasion <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">come</EVENT> together to <EVENT eid="e2" class="I_ACTION">recognise</EVENT> leading citizens where, in the absence of national honours, they <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">pay</EVENT> tribute in a simple and unpretentious manner to the fathers and mothers of their place of origin. 
 
Recognition has not been <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">confined</EVENT> to age. In many cases the young and the middle age have also been <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">singled</EVENT> out for some outstanding act considered worthy of acknowledgement. These community projects are usually <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">carried</EVENT> out during National Heritage Week at parish council functions or in the inner-city version of our rural districts. 
 
They <EVENT eid="e7" class="I_STATE">constitute</EVENT> the great untold stories of unsung heroes throughout our history who may never be <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE">invited</EVENT> to Kings House for the glitter and glamour of the Governor Generals Awards ceremony. Notwithstanding that, the plaques, the bouquets, the certificates presented at the local level are just as treasured as the Order of Distinction or the Order of Jamaica. 
 
The Discovery Bay <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE">function</EVENT> is <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE">hosted</EVENT> by the Noranda Community Council, one of the community organisations standing beside the Community Development Committee; the schools parent-teacher and past students associations; the church organisations; as well as the football, netball and youth club management committees. 
 
The Noranda Community Council ceremony is by no means unique, as parallel organisations also <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE">recognise</EVENT> their outstanding individuals at annual presentations, achievement days, at funerals, and so on. The council has, however, <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE">kept</EVENT> careful record of the citations <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE">read</EVENT> and <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE">presented</EVENT> which describe in brief the stories of lives spent in voluntary service in the fields of education, agriculture, religion, business, health, sports, youth and community, and (with regard to corporate contribution) the bauxite industry. 
 
The council has <EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE">gone</EVENT> deep into the community to <EVENT eid="e16" class="OCCURRENCE">highlight</EVENT> contributions made by senior citizens, some in their late 90s, where glowing tributes <EVENT eid="e17" class="OCCURRENCE">recall</EVENT> lives <EVENT eid="e18" class="OCCURRENCE">spent</EVENT> in unselfish service and <EVENT eid="e19" class="OCCURRENCE">dedication</EVENT> to district and community development by nurses, midwives, veteran <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3> school teachers, grandmothers, bush medicine dispensers, and educators. Those elders <EVENT eid="e20" class="ASPECTUAL">continue</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e21" class="OCCURRENCE">impart</EVENT> advice and wisdom <EVENT eid="e22" class="OCCURRENCE">gained</EVENT> from their experiences with the younger citizens. They <EVENT eid="e23" class="STATE">have</EVENT> little to <EVENT eid="e24" class="OCCURRENCE">show</EVENT> in material wealth, but are satisfied with the love and respect they have <EVENT eid="e25" class="OCCURRENCE">earned</EVENT> over <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="PXY">the years</TIMEX3>. 
 
At <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017">this years</TIMEX3> presentation the story of Hezekiah Whitehorn, 98 years old, was a revelation to the younger members of the community who were <EVENT eid="e26" class="OCCURRENCE">hearing</EVENT> for the first time that the retired church organist from Queenhythe district <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="X">once</TIMEX3> <EVENT eid="e27" class="OCCURRENCE">sang</EVENT> with the famous East Queen Street Baptist Fraternal, and that his golden baritone voice was once <EVENT eid="e28" class="OCCURRENCE">heard</EVENT> regularly on 
 
Radio Jamaica in the <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="195X">1950s</TIMEX3>. 
 
Perhaps, <EVENT eid="e29" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT> the citation, his greatest legacy to us was when he <EVENT eid="e30" class="OCCURRENCE">formed</EVENT> the famous singing group the Trumpeteers out of the choir of the Grateful Hill Baptist Church in the <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="197X">1970s</TIMEX3> and 80s. Anyone who has <EVENT eid="e31" class="OCCURRENCE">heard</EVENT> the Trumpeteers as they <EVENT eid="e32" class="OCCURRENCE">performed</EVENT> all over Jamaica will <EVENT eid="e33" class="OCCURRENCE">recall</EVENT> the delight and the thrill <EVENT eid="e34" class="OCCURRENCE">felt</EVENT> when those voices <EVENT eid="e35" class="OCCURRENCE">rang</EVENT> out in rich musical harmony. 
 
Anther golden nugget showcased by the council was Daisy Wallace, 99 years old, from Farm Town district, whose love, warmth and congeniality are evident in her daily discourse with others, and who <EVENT eid="e36" class="OCCURRENCE">became</EVENT> a mother, counsellor, and role model to hundreds of persons and generations of years. 
 
The council also <EVENT eid="e37" class="OCCURRENCE">went</EVENT> overseas <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017">this year</TIMEX3> as they <EVENT eid="e38" class="OCCURRENCE">honoured</EVENT> Whitfield Stennett, MBE. Stennett, <EVENT eid="e39" class="OCCURRENCE">born</EVENT> in Old Folly district adjacent to Discovery Bay, has not only <EVENT eid="e40" class="STATE">remained</EVENT> a humble person, always <EVENT eid="e41" class="OCCURRENCE">exhibiting</EVENT> the good manners and deportment natural to Jamaicans <EVENT eid="e42" class="OCCURRENCE">birthed</EVENT> in modest but dignified circumstances, but has also been a stalwart providing cricket gear and sports gear and other charitable donations to his elementary school, Discovery Bay, and to his community. He <EVENT eid="e43" class="I_ACTION">rose</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e44" class="OCCURRENCE">become</EVENT> one of the first black mayors in the United Kingdom. 
 
It was at one of those council <EVENT eid="e45" class="OCCURRENCE">functions</EVENT> that I <EVENT eid="e46" class="OCCURRENCE">met</EVENT> up with and <EVENT eid="e47" class="OCCURRENCE">heard</EVENT> the story of Cynthia Breezy Watkis, midwife, who for countless <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="PXY">years</TIMEX3> has <EVENT eid="e48" class="STATE">been</EVENT> on call to her community for her nursing services, especially in times of dire need. Inez Dulcie Duncan, legendary mother, grand and great mother, who <EVENT eid="e49" class="OCCURRENCE">walked</EVENT> miles across rugged terrain, where no vehicle could <EVENT eid="e50" class="OCCURRENCE">go</EVENT> in <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="PXD">the early days</TIMEX3>, to <EVENT eid="e51" class="OCCURRENCE">transport</EVENT> milk and other basics for families and shut-ins. 
 
And where we <EVENT eid="e52" class="OCCURRENCE">heard</EVENT> the story of Albert Bertie Edwards, who in the <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="195X">1950s</TIMEX3> <EVENT eid="e53" class="OCCURRENCE">took</EVENT> up the fight to <EVENT eid="e54" class="OCCURRENCE">organise</EVENT> the Discovery Bay communities against the landed class that had <EVENT eid="e55" class="I_ACTION">attempted</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e56" class="OCCURRENCE">keep</EVENT> out Kaiser Bauxite from <EVENT eid="e57" class="OCCURRENCE">starting</EVENT> up industry, and subsequent jobs and income generation, in the parish. 
 
There is another rural district in Jamaica, the home of my birth, Four Paths in Clarendon, that has <EVENT eid="e58" class="OCCURRENCE">taken</EVENT> the time and considerable effort to <EVENT eid="e59" class="OCCURRENCE">compile</EVENT> the story of the village in magazine format. 
 
The <EVENT eid="e60" class="OCCURRENCE">publication</EVENT> was <EVENT eid="e61" class="OCCURRENCE">put</EVENT> together by Brenda Black and Lauris Goldson in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2012">2012</TIMEX3>, and as I <EVENT eid="e62" class="OCCURRENCE">read</EVENT> it I was <EVENT eid="e63" class="OCCURRENCE">surprised</EVENT> at the background stories that I was barely familiar with as a young boy <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> being <EVENT eid="e64" class="OCCURRENCE">brought</EVENT> to full life in the <EVENT eid="e65" class="OCCURRENCE">recounting</EVENT> of the facts by those who <EVENT eid="e66" class="OCCURRENCE">witnessed</EVENT> the events. 
 
In the pages I <EVENT eid="e67" class="OCCURRENCE">found</EVENT> confirmation of some of the accounts of life in a village which had only been <EVENT eid="e68" class="OCCURRENCE">learned</EVENT> from elder brothers and friends. Thanks to the writers research, I could <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> <EVENT eid="e69" class="OCCURRENCE">relate</EVENT> more closely to the backgrounds of the original families of Four Paths, the Waddells, the Lawsons, the Vassells, the Davises, the Rickettses, the Baileys, the Shimhues, the Howes, the Christies, the McGlashens, the Shouts, the Pennicookes, the Burrells, the Bacchuses, the Webleys, among many others (condolence to the Vassells on the recent <EVENT eid="e70" class="OCCURRENCE">loss</EVENT> of Carol). 
 
The introduction to the magazine is instructive, as the writers <EVENT eid="e71" class="I_ACTION">explain</EVENT> their purpose in <EVENT eid="e72" class="OCCURRENCE">compiling</EVENT> the stories. 
 
Central to our heritage is the revered institution we <EVENT eid="e73" class="OCCURRENCE">call</EVENT> family. The family is one of societys main and arguably the most important social institution, because it <EVENT eid="e74" class="I_ACTION">serves</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e75" class="OCCURRENCE">socialise</EVENT> individuals to be productive members of society. We all look to our families for guidance, support and a sense of belonging. Sociologists have long <EVENT eid="e76" class="I_ACTION">argued</EVENT> that the family is not only an institution, but is also a social system with norms and values that are <EVENT eid="e77" class="STATE">cultivated</EVENT> over many <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="PXY">years</TIMEX3>. These norms and values are <EVENT eid="e78" class="STATE">designed</EVENT> in order to <EVENT eid="e79" class="OCCURRENCE">guide</EVENT> the <EVENT eid="e80" class="OCCURRENCE">socialisation</EVENT> of each family member with the hope that they will <EVENT eid="e81" class="OCCURRENCE">function</EVENT> effectively in a world that has <EVENT eid="e82" class="OCCURRENCE">become</EVENT> more complex with each passing <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION" value="PXD">day</TIMEX3>. 
 
Black and Goldson chose to <EVENT eid="e83" class="OCCURRENCE">focus</EVENT> on two elements in <EVENT eid="e84" class="OCCURRENCE">recounting</EVENT> the history of Four Paths, places and people. 
 
And similar to the dossier compiled on Discovery Bays personalities and legends, the magazine <EVENT eid="e85" class="OCCURRENCE">describes</EVENT> a village typical of many rural villages across Jamaica, with strong foundations <EVENT eid="e86" class="OCCURRENCE">centred</EVENT> on the church and school, parental values, discipline, and their own unique history. 
 
In the magazine, Four Paths is proud of its history. Where else, it asks, but Four Paths, could a woman have <EVENT eid="e87" class="OCCURRENCE">bowled</EVENT> George Headley on a bet she could <EVENT eid="e88" class="OCCURRENCE">do</EVENT> so within three balls  that woman was Daisy Waddell-Lawson. And where else in Jamaica, can you find a village of the size of Four Paths that could <EVENT eid="e89" class="OCCURRENCE">produce</EVENT> a Miss Jamaica (Karlene Waddell), three parish beauty queens, and a Miss Jamaica Farm Queen? Where else in Jamaica, but Four Paths, could <EVENT eid="e90" class="OCCURRENCE">produce</EVENT> two presidents of the Jamaica Council of Churches: Rev C Evans Bailey and Rev Stanford Webley. 
 
And where else but Four Paths can <EVENT eid="e91" class="OCCURRENCE">boast</EVENT> the records of one family <EVENT eid="e92" class="OCCURRENCE">producing</EVENT> the head of the civil service, a president of the University of Technology, Jamaica, and a minister of finance  brothers Drs Carlton Davis, Rae Davis, and Omar Davis? 
 
I have <EVENT eid="e93" class="OCCURRENCE">learnt</EVENT> a lot about the values of community lifestyles by just <EVENT eid="e94" class="OCCURRENCE">referring</EVENT> to the Discovery Bay profiles and to the stories and legends of the founders of my home district in Clarendon. Those of the first generation <EVENT eid="e95" class="OCCURRENCE">started</EVENT> the process and then <EVENT eid="e96" class="OCCURRENCE">passed</EVENT> on the baton to their heirs and successors with a very important message, Preserve and <EVENT eid="e97" class="OCCURRENCE">protect</EVENT> what has been <EVENT eid="e98" class="OCCURRENCE">given</EVENT> to you.
