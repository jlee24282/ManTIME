<TEXT>
Valdevino Miguel da Silva (pictured, left) and his wife Maria (right) <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">show</EVENT> off their new home. 
 
A retired builder has <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">constructed</EVENT> a completely upside down house in southeastern Brazil. 
 

 
The house, with its roof at the bottom and a garden at the top, has already <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">become something</EVENT> of a tourist attraction as passers-by <EVENT eid="e4" class="I_ACTION">stop</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">take</EVENT> photos. 
 

 
While the outside of the house is totally <EVENT eid="e6" class="STATE">bizarre</EVENT>, the inside is perfectly normal. There is a kitchen and a bathroom on the ground floor while there are two bedrooms upstairs. The entrance door of the 400-square-meter house is behind the house, on the ground floor.
