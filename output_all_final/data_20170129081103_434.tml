<TITLE>Sunday in the Park with George</TITLE>


<TEXT>
With a practically bare, white playing space as a blank 
canvas, Zoetic Stages Stuart Meltzer, his cast and crew have <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">fashioned</EVENT> 
a gorgeous work of art in the award-winning Miami companys <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> 
production of Stephen Sondheim and James Lapines masterpiece 
 . 
 
The Pulitzer-Prize-winning musical, which also <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">won</EVENT> the Olivier Award 
for Best Musical, is <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">playing</EVENT> the Carnival Studio Theater, located in 
Miamis Adrienne Arsht Center through <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-02-12">Feb. 12</TIMEX3>. 
 
This production, the South Florida premiere of the musical, combines 
striking stage pictures, stark lighting by Rebecca Montero, eye- 
<EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">catching</EVENT> video <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">projections</EVENT> by Greg Duffy and top-notch singing voices 
from a talented cast of veterans and younger thespians who <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">nail</EVENT> 
Sondheims complex music. They are <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE">accompanied</EVENT> by a vibrant, live 
orchestra. 
 
Individually, <EVENT eid="e8" class="REPORTING">cast</EVENT> members have rangy, expressive voices. But like the 
painting technique at the center of the musical, the individual voices 
beautifully coalesce, especially to <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE">sing</EVENT> the shows best 
song, the stately <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3>. 
 
On several <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sundays</TIMEX3> during the late <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="180X">1800s</TIMEX3>, French painter Georges 
Seurat gathers at a park on an island in the Seine river to <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE">prepare</EVENT> his 
notable painting A <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29TAF">Sunday Afternoon</TIMEX3> on the Island of La 
Grande Jatte. Sound effects of chirping birds, created by sound 
designer Dan Mayer, <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE">reinforce</EVENT> the serene atmosphere. 
 
Seurat <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE">created</EVENT> the work, considered his most famous, in the form of a 
painting technique called Pointillism. It involves small, separate dots of 
color <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE">applied</EVENT> in patterns to <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE">form</EVENT> an image. 
 
The image mostly comprises members of the French bourgeoisie 
relaxing on lazy, sunny Sundays on the island. 
 
In the show, the paintings subjects spring to life, <EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE">commenting</EVENT> on 
various subjects, including Seurats endless concentration 
while he works to <EVENT eid="e16" class="OCCURRENCE">paint</EVENT> likenesses of the people 
Director Meltzers smart staging includes <EVENT eid="e17" class="I_ACTION">ensuring</EVENT> a separation exists 
on-stage between the aloof Seurat (Cooper Grodin) and the rest of the 
characters. 
 
With his dark hair, beard, black costume, <EVENT eid="e18" class="OCCURRENCE">lowered</EVENT> eyebrows and sharp, 
bossy voice, Grodin <EVENT eid="e19" class="I_STATE">projects</EVENT> a brooding, even dictatorial air. Hes 
<EVENT eid="e20" class="OCCURRENCE">commanding</EVENT> toward those he is painting, particularly his love interest, 
Dot (Kimberly Doreen Burns). Its clear his Seurat is deeply 
<EVENT eid="e21" class="I_STATE">committed</EVENT> to Finishing the Hat. 
 
Grodin projects a dark and serious aura without <EVENT eid="e22" class="OCCURRENCE">making</EVENT> his character 
unlikable. Like his painting, his performance is multi-colored, with 
injections of charm and playfulness. 
 
As Dot, Kimberly Doreen Burns <EVENT eid="e23" class="OCCURRENCE">invests</EVENT> her character with impatience 
and exasperation at Seurats demands and neglect of her. But Burns 
also communicates her characters devotion to Seurat, at one point 
seductively touching his body from the top to the bottom, as though 
hes a work of art himself. 
 
The first act <EVENT eid="e24" class="OCCURRENCE">takes</EVENT> place in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="1884">1884</TIMEX3>, while the second fast forwards to a 
museum in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="1984">1984</TIMEX3> New York City. 
In the latter, Georges great-grandson, named George, is a struggling 
painter trying to <EVENT eid="e25" class="OCCURRENCE">preserve</EVENT> his ancestors painting. With him is Georges 
and Dots now-elderly daughter, Marie (also <EVENT eid="e26" class="OCCURRENCE">played</EVENT> by Burns, who 
<EVENT eid="e27" class="OCCURRENCE">looks</EVENT> too young and <EVENT eid="e28" class="OCCURRENCE">acts</EVENT> too vibrant in the role). 
The importance of art as a family legacy and the challenge of 
producing art are among the timeless themes in Act II. 
George is <EVENT eid="e29" class="OCCURRENCE">played</EVENT> by Grodin with a strong sense of commitment and a 
sense hes burdened by the hard task of producing art. Grodin <EVENT eid="e30" class="OCCURRENCE">makes</EVENT> it 
clear theres a weight on this mans shoulders to <EVENT eid="e31" class="OCCURRENCE">preserve</EVENT> his great- 
grandfathers legacy. 
 
Art isnt easy, are lyrics that are repeated in the song Putting it 
Together. Its <EVENT eid="e32" class="OCCURRENCE">sung</EVENT> by Multiple characters, including George. The song, 
like others in the musical, <EVENT eid="e33" class="OCCURRENCE">showcases</EVENT> Sondheims brilliant rhymes and 
elegant lyrics. 
 
Perhaps the lyrics that really <EVENT eid="e34" class="OCCURRENCE">draw</EVENT> us into the musical are the following: 
White. A blank page of canvasSo many possibilities. 
In Zoetics production, George <EVENT eid="e35" class="OCCURRENCE">sings</EVENT> the lyrics So many possibilities, 
in a whisper, but with an ardent enthusiasm suggesting a treasure 
chests worth of tempting choices. 
Maybe arts infinite possibilities <EVENT eid="e36" class="OCCURRENCE">make</EVENT> it so tempting to <EVENT eid="e37" class="I_ACTION">try</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e38" class="OCCURRENCE">create</EVENT>.
