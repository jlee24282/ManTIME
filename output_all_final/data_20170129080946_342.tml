<TITLE>Hacksaw Ridge review  punchy like a sledgehammer</TITLE>


<TEXT>
M Garfield plays Desmond Doss, a real-life war hero who <EVENT eid="e1" class="I_STATE">became</EVENT> the first man in US history to <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">receive</EVENT> the Medal of Honor without firing a shot. Desmond volunteers to <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">serve</EVENT> his country with the caveat that, due to his personal and religious beliefs, he <EVENT eid="e4" class="I_STATE">refuses</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">touch</EVENT> a gun. This doesnt <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">go</EVENT> down well with his commanding officers (Sam Worthington, Vince Vaughn) who <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE">dont</EVENT> buy Desmonds argument that he can serve as a medic without <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE">bearing</EVENT> arms.

Along with his faith, Desmond is <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE">supported</EVENT> by his fiancee, Dorothy, <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE">played</EVENT> by Australian model and actress Teresa Palmer. With her striking colouring  tawny hair, vivid blue eyes  heightened by the saturated colours of Desmonds prewar, small-town Virginia existence, Palmer <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE">takes</EVENT> on a kind of angelic dream-girl status. Gibson is perhaps overly fond of juxtaposing images that evoke heavenly hosts with those of the visceral hell of the hard-fought Okinawa battle in which Desmond, true to himself and his God, <EVENT eid="e12" class="I_STATE">becomes</EVENT> a hero.
