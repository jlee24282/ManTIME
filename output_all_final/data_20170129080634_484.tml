<TITLE>Court stops Trump from deporting refugees, others</TITLE>


<TEXT>
A federal judge <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">blocked</EVENT> <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> part of President Donald Trumps temporary immigration ban ordering authorities to stop deporting refugees and other travelers stuck at US airports

The decision accompanied growing resistance to Trumps crackdown on Muslim immigration with large protests spreading at major airports across the country

"Victory" the American Civil Liberties Union ACLU whose lawyers <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">sued</EVENT> the government <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">tweeted</EVENT> after US District Judge Ann Donnelly <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">issued</EVENT> her decision

"Our courts <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3> <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">worked</EVENT> as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders"

Trumps sweeping executive order signed <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3> suspends the arrival of refugees for <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P120D">at least 120 days</TIMEX3> and bars visas for travelers from seven Muslim majority countries for <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P3M">the next three months</TIMEX3>

The move which was implemented immediately by US authorities sparked large protests at major airports across the country At New Yorks John F Kennedy International Airport some of the <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2000">2000</TIMEX3> demonstrators there <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">chanted</EVENT> "Let them in let them in"

Large protests <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE">took</EVENT> place at the main airports for Washington Chicago Minneapolis Denver Los Angeles San Francisco and Dallas

Donnellys decision to issue a temporary stay  which stopped short of ruling on the constitutionality of Trumps order  <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE">came</EVENT> after dozens of people were <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE">detained</EVENT> at US airports following Trumps actions

The exact number of those affected is unclear but the judge ordered the government to provide lists of all those detained at US airports since the measure went into effect

Sending those travelers back to their home countries following Trumps order exposes them to "substantial and irreparable injury" wrote Donnelly who was <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE">appointed</EVENT> by Trumps Democratic predecessor Barack Obama

A <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="X">second</TIMEX3> federal judge in Virginia also <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE">issued</EVENT> a temporary order restricting immigration authorities for <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="P7D">seven days</TIMEX3> from deporting legal permanent residents detained at Dulles Airport just outside Washington according to US media

We were prepared 

"We knew that was coming  we were prepared" said Camille Mackler a lawyer who heads legal initiatives at the New York Immigration Coalition one of the groups that quickly mounted the demonstration there

"But we didnt know when and we couldnt believe it would be immediate that thered be people in an airplane the moment the order was taking effect"

The List Project which helps Iraqis whose personal safety is threatened because they have worked for the United States expressed outraged over the move warning it put American lives at risk too

"I cant say this in blunt-enough terms you cant screw over the people that risked their lives and bled for this country without consequences" wrote the projects founder and director Kirk Johnson

The ACLUs legal challenge sought the release of two Iraqi men on grounds of unlawful detention One of them  Hameed Khalid Darweesh who has worked as interpreter and in other roles for the US in Iraq  was in fact released on <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> after being <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE">detained</EVENT> the <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="PXD">day before</TIMEX3>

We must fight 

Democratic Representative Jerrold Nadler who <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE">went</EVENT> to JFK to press for the release of those detained under Trumps measure <EVENT eid="e14" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT> "We must <EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE">fight</EVENT> this executive order in the streets in the courts anywhere anytime We must <EVENT eid="e16" class="OCCURRENCE">resist</EVENT> We must fight"

Trumps pronouncement on Muslim immigration makes good on one of his most controversial campaign promises to subject travelers from Islamic countries to "extreme vetting" which he declared would make America safe from "radical Islamic terrorists"

The targeted countries are Iran Iraq Libya Somalia Sudan Syria and Yemen

Donnellys decision shows that "when President Trump enacts laws or executive orders that are unconstitutional and illegal the courts are there to defend everyones rights" ACLU executive director Anthony Romero <EVENT eid="e17" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT> in leaving the emergency hearing

The ban has triggered political backlash including from Trumps fellow Republicans

Orrin Hatch the most senior Republican in the US Senate spoke of Americas "legal and moral obligations to help the innocent victims of these terrible conflicts"

"I strongly <EVENT eid="e18" class="OCCURRENCE">urge</EVENT> the new administration to <EVENT eid="e19" class="OCCURRENCE">move</EVENT> quickly to tailor its policy on visa issuance as narrowly as possible <EVENT eid="e20" class="OCCURRENCE">delivering</EVENT> on our security needs while reducing unnecessary burdens on the vast majority of visa-seekers that present a promise  not a threat  to our nation" he said in a statement

Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy a Democrat wrote "To my colleagues dont ever again lecture me on American moral leadership if you chose to be silent <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3>"

His tweet was <EVENT eid="e21" class="OCCURRENCE">accompanied</EVENT> by the <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> iconic photograph of Aylan Kurdi a three-year-old Syrian boy whose body washed up on a beach in Turkey in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3> after a <EVENT eid="e22" class="OCCURRENCE">failed</EVENT> attempt to flee Syrias brutal war to join relatives in Canada

 A long battle  

The rapid mobilization against the order suggests a protracted battle is shaping up between migrant advocates and Trump and his administration

"This is the opening salvo of a long battle that will go on in the courts" said Michael Kagan a law professor at the University of Nevada Las Vegas who specializes in immigration issues

He <EVENT eid="e23" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT> the outcome of the legal battle is unclear because "we are in unchartered territory in modern America"

The battle could end up in the US Supreme Court which has not ruled on this type of immigration issue since the <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="1882">1882</TIMEX3> Chinese Exclusion Act

A White House official <EVENT eid="e24" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT> that holders of a green card  which allows permanent residence in the US and often takes years to obtain  who are abroad should first <EVENT eid="e25" class="OCCURRENCE">go</EVENT> to the US consulate to obtain a document allowing return to the US

And green card holders in the US who <EVENT eid="e26" class="I_STATE">want</EVENT> to travel abroad must obtain approval from a consulate official

The State Department has said that people from the seven countries under the <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION" value="P90D">90-day</TIMEX3> travel ban will be prohibited entry no matter their visa status Only those holding a dual citizenship with the US will be allowed to enter
