<TITLE>Revealed: Wenger will leave Arsenal in 2017, talks start with top Serie A boss</TITLE>


<TEXT>
Life after Arsene Wenger 

Can the <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3> Express be trusted

 

Leaving that question for you to decide the tabloid have demanded attention <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-W05">this weekend</TIMEX3> as they claim that Arsenal have begun courting a top Serie A manager to replace Arsene Wenger in the Gunners dugout

 

The news comes the <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="PXD">day</TIMEX3> after Arsenal won 5-0 away at Southampton with Steve Bould taking charge of the team from the sidelines

 

Wenger is currently serving a four game touchline ban after pushing an official v Burnley while the French boss is out of contract at the end of the season

 So whats the story 

The Express have a couple of massive statements in their article beginning with the claim that Arsene Wenger will leave his post at the end of the season

 

Arsene Wengers <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P1E">two decade</TIMEX3> reign at The Emirates Stadium looks set to end when his contract runs out at the end of the season

 

The tabloid stress that Wenger is not in talks with Arsenal about a contract extension while by contrast the Gunners have opened communication with Juventus boss Max Allegri instead

 

Wenger is yet to be <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">offered</EVENT> an extension amid suggestions that he will stand aside and Allegris representatives have been locked in talks with Arsenal hierarchy

 

The <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3> Express understand that those discussions are at an advanced stage but no agreement has yet been <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">reached</EVENT>

 

The truth is that rumours <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">linking</EVENT> Allegri to Arsenal arent that new

 

The Sun have recently tabled a similar story while Allegri has confirmed he is taking English lessons

 

So will this make Arsenal fans happy Or will they start complaining that they want Diego Simeone instead
