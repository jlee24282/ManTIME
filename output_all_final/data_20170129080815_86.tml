This week <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">offered</EVENT> sheer intergalactic delight in the form of <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">breaking</EVENT> Star Wars news. Episode VIII , the next film in the third trilogy, has been <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">given</EVENT> an official title : The Last Jedi . The internet was immediately ablaze following the announcement. What does the title mean? And who is the last Jedi ? And what will he or she <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">do</EVENT>? Amid all the chaos, though, something even more interesting has <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">come</EVENT> to light in reference to the title. When you <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">combine</EVENT> it with the name for Episode VII ( The Force Awakens ), the two titles actually make a complete sentence. Once you <EVENT eid="e7" class="PERCEPTION">see</EVENT> it, you can't <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE">unsee</EVENT> it. And furthermore, if the theory behind it is true, everything could <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE">change</EVENT>.

All this time, it <EVENT eid="e10" class="REPORTING">seemed</EVENT> like Episode VII was making an entirely different statement: that the Force had been dormant for some time, and for some inexplicable reason  a ripple through the galaxy, perhaps  it had <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE">emerged</EVENT> from that state. If this theory is correct, though, it <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE">means</EVENT> two things. For one, maybe the Force was always awake, and in this trilogy, it is <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE">performing</EVENT> that very action and <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE">awakening</EVENT> the "last Jedi." And second, if the first two installments of this trilogy are two parts of a sentence, then there's a strong chance Episode IX will complete it. "The Force <EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE">awakens</EVENT> the last Jedi" . . . to <EVENT eid="e16" class="OCCURRENCE">defeat</EVENT> Supreme Leader Snoke ? To breed a whole new generation of powerful Jedi knights? These seem a little long for an Episode IX title, but hey, it's gotta be something along those lines. Sadly, we'll have to <EVENT eid="e17" class="OCCURRENCE">wait</EVENT> a while for the next installments ; The Last Jedi doesn't <EVENT eid="e18" class="OCCURRENCE">hit</EVENT> theaters until <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-12-15">Dec. 15</TIMEX3> of <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017">this year</TIMEX3>, and Episode IX isn't <EVENT eid="e19" class="STATE">slated</EVENT> until <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2019">2019</TIMEX3>. Settle in, everyone.
