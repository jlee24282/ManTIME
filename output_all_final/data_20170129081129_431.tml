<TITLE>Debut work relies too much on failed tropes of past eras</TITLE>


<TEXT>
FAIRBANKS  In this first historical <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">romance</EVENT> by local author Laurie G. Robertson, a young pioneer woman named Kallie <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">sets</EVENT> out for a new life with her husbands family along the Oregon Trail, only for all her plans to be <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">pulled</EVENT> out from under her when their caravan is <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">attacked</EVENT> and her husband <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">murdered</EVENT>. 
   
<EVENT eid="e6" class="STATE">Taken</EVENT> captive by an Indian warrior, Kallie must <EVENT eid="e7" class="I_STATE">rely</EVENT> on her stubborn inner strength and knowledge of healing to <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE">survive</EVENT> in a strange world of war bands, buffalo hunting and hidden dangers. Her struggle for survival and eventual surrender to passion for her captor, Brave Eagle, <EVENT eid="e9" class="I_STATE">drives</EVENT> the adventure of Crossing at Sweet Grass. 
   
First, the elephant in the room: yes, this entire premise can generously be <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE">called dated</EVENT>. Less generously: racist. Theres a small sub-genre of romances with basically this same plot, following the archaic captivity narrative of the 17th to 19th centuries, and even the best of them toe some very uncomfortable lines of cultural fetishism, imperialist grandstanding and stereotypes. 
   
Crossing at Sweet Grass is not among the best. Its depiction of Brave Eagles generically tribal band is not malicious, but it does <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE">fall</EVENT> into several stereotypical tropes <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE">ranging</EVENT> from noble savage to savage monster that are uncomfortable to <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE">find</EVENT> in a novel from <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3>. That all the Native characters have names like Flaming Arrow, Pretty Shield and Weasel Tail is the least of it. 
   
And, to be fair, the white characters aside from Kallie herself <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE">dont</EVENT> fare much better. Most are flat at best, <EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE">save</EVENT> Kallies shrewish sister-in-law, who is <EVENT eid="e16" class="OCCURRENCE">captured</EVENT> alongside her and often <EVENT eid="e17" class="OCCURRENCE">exemplifies</EVENT> the worst of the decidedly non-civilized civilization theyve <EVENT eid="e18" class="OCCURRENCE">left</EVENT> behind. However, she also seems to have been included in the story just to spare Kallie the worst of the captivity narrative (including multiple rapes) and the narrative spares her little sympathy in that regard. 
   
Its also a self-published book, Robertsons first, and this is unfortunately obvious from certain weaknesses in pacing and style. The first 15pages alone contain enough plot points for the first half of a novel, including the aforementioned massacre, three escape attempts, two bathing voyeurism scenes, at least one rape and a lot of backstory. Each of these are <EVENT eid="e19" class="OCCURRENCE">addressed</EVENT> in a single paragraph at most, <EVENT eid="e20" class="OCCURRENCE">leaving</EVENT> no room for show, only tell. Hardly the most engaging. 
   
On the positive side, the style gets much better as the story goes on. By about the halfway point, the scenes are <EVENT eid="e21" class="I_STATE">allowed</EVENT> to be scenes with pacing and subtly and emotional impact, to the point that a reader can <EVENT eid="e22" class="OCCURRENCE">come</EVENT> to genuinely <EVENT eid="e23" class="OCCURRENCE">care</EVENT> for the main leads despite their rather flat and/or stereotypical personalities. 
   
Also, unlike a lot of romances, theres enough going on that the story feels active and even somewhat dense for a 240-page run. The result is ultimately a more satisfying read than, say, your average Nicholas Sparks novel. Its just a shame that so much of the good is <EVENT eid="e24" class="OCCURRENCE">lost</EVENT> in unfortunate implications and a very under-developed first half. 
   
Crossing at Sweet Grass is available <EVENT eid="e25" class="OCCURRENCE">online</EVENT> or at Gullivers Books in Fairbanks.
