<TITLE>Athletes: Get most out of college</TITLE>

A <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">few years ago</TIMEX3>, I <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">walked</EVENT> into the media center of a local high school and was immediately awash in colored balloons and streamers. 
 
There was a long table with name cards. 
 
There were dozens and dozens of people. 
 
There were proud smiles that <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">lit</EVENT> up the room. 
 
There was confetti. 
 
There was cake. 
 
There were speeches about how the best of the best were <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> ready to <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">take</EVENT> the next step. 
 
This particular high school had a bumper crop of athletes. There were five in particular who <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">stood</EVENT> above the rest. They were good in football, basketball, baseball and track. They were big, strong, fast and agile. 
 
The losses these athletes <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">experienced</EVENT> in high school mostly <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">came</EVENT> deep in the postseason. They were that successful. It was fun watching them grow as they <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE">won</EVENT>. 
 
And they <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE">won</EVENT> often. 
 
These were the multisport, cant-miss kids coaches <EVENT eid="e9" class="I_STATE">dream</EVENT> about. 
 
Together they <EVENT eid="e10" class="I_ACTION">decided</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE">take</EVENT> their talents to the next level at Colorado State University-Pueblo. This budding Division II football program was <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE">getting</EVENT> the nucleus, the heart and soul, of one of the most successful prep football programs in the state. 
 
On that <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="PXD">day</TIMEX3>, national signing day, five of Pueblos best <EVENT eid="e13" class="REPORTING">declared</EVENT> that they were <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE">staying</EVENT> home. They <EVENT eid="e15" class="I_STATE">wanted</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e16" class="OCCURRENCE">play</EVENT> in front of friends and family. They <EVENT eid="e17" class="I_STATE">wanted</EVENT> to be a part of the <EVENT eid="e18" class="OCCURRENCE">growth</EVENT> at CSU-Pueblo. 
 
They were positive that their winning ways would <EVENT eid="e19" class="ASPECTUAL">continue</EVENT> in college. 
 
Of those five, only one <EVENT eid="e20" class="OCCURRENCE">stuck</EVENT> with the ThunderWolves. 
 
That number was a little surprising, considering the talent those five <EVENT eid="e21" class="OCCURRENCE">possessed</EVENT>. 
 
But one in five is about right. 
 
For every five Pueblo kids who sign on the dotted line, one <EVENT eid="e22" class="OCCURRENCE">sticks</EVENT> it out. That is not a scientific fact, merely an educated guess from someone who has <EVENT eid="e23" class="OCCURRENCE">covered</EVENT> national sign <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="PXD">day</TIMEX3> for more than a quarter-century. 
 
The reasons athletes <EVENT eid="e24" class="I_STATE">dont make</EVENT> it to the finish line are as varied as the athletes themselves. 
 
Kids <EVENT eid="e25" class="STATE">grow</EVENT> up and <EVENT eid="e26" class="OCCURRENCE">acquire</EVENT> other interests. They <EVENT eid="e27" class="OCCURRENCE">fall</EVENT> in love. They get jobs. Those who are good enough to earn college scholarships in sports have been <EVENT eid="e28" class="OCCURRENCE">playing</EVENT> those sports for so long that burnout is a real possibility. 
 
Life, and all that entails, far too often gets in the way. 
 
If I had a dollar for every kid from Pueblo who <EVENT eid="e29" class="OCCURRENCE">signed</EVENT> a national letter of intent  junior college, NAIA, Division II, Division I, whatever  who <EVENT eid="e30" class="OCCURRENCE">didnt</EVENT> last their allotted time at <EVENT eid="e31" class="OCCURRENCE">said</EVENT> institution, I could <EVENT eid="e32" class="OCCURRENCE">buy</EVENT> my own damn cake. 
 
That is not to <EVENT eid="e33" class="OCCURRENCE">label</EVENT> those athletes failures. Not at all. It is what it is  especially if those athletes arent <EVENT eid="e34" class="OCCURRENCE">getting</EVENT> enough money to <EVENT eid="e35" class="OCCURRENCE">cover</EVENT> college and living expenses. 
 
It takes a special kind of person, not just an athlete, to <EVENT eid="e36" class="OCCURRENCE">make</EVENT> it in intercollegiate athletics. 
 
To student-athletes who will <EVENT eid="e37" class="OCCURRENCE">sign</EVENT> their name <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-01-25">this Wednesday</TIMEX3>, national signing day, <EVENT eid="e38" class="OCCURRENCE">enjoy</EVENT> the moment and <EVENT eid="e39" class="OCCURRENCE">embrace</EVENT> the opportunity ahead. Smile for pictures that will, no doubt, <EVENT eid="e40" class="OCCURRENCE">add</EVENT> to the bulging scrapbooks. 
 
Then <EVENT eid="e41" class="OCCURRENCE">look</EVENT> beyond the decorations and <EVENT eid="e42" class="I_STATE">see</EVENT> the bigger picture. Someone is <EVENT eid="e43" class="I_STATE">willing</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e44" class="OCCURRENCE">help</EVENT> you financially with your college education. 
 
Remember that. 
 
Take advantage of that. 
 
Whether you are getting a full ride at s a major university or a small stipend to <EVENT eid="e45" class="OCCURRENCE">help</EVENT> with tuition and books a tiny school in the middle of nowhere, someone <EVENT eid="e46" class="OCCURRENCE">saw</EVENT> enough in your abilities, your personality and your potential to <EVENT eid="e47" class="I_ACTION">help</EVENT> you <EVENT eid="e48" class="OCCURRENCE">take</EVENT> the next step in life. 
 
So stay the course. Embrace the difficult. Work to <EVENT eid="e49" class="OCCURRENCE">finish</EVENT> what you <EVENT eid="e50" class="OCCURRENCE">started</EVENT>. 
 
Imagine, then, just how sweet the cake will <EVENT eid="e51" class="OCCURRENCE">taste</EVENT>  when you graduate from college.
