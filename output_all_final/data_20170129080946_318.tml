<TITLE>Kenneth Leighton: Complete Organ Works CD review  a towering triumph</TITLE>


<TEXT>
Stephen Farr (organ and harpsichord), John Butt (organ), Chloe Hanslip (violin), Nicky Spence (tenor)

(Resonus) This is a major achievement. Stephen Farr triumphs in his massive survey of the output of Kenneth Leighton, a towering figure in British <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="X">20th-century</TIMEX3> liturgical music  one who instinctively <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">understood</EVENT> the context of his compositions; how the organ works within great buildings and how its power and myriad colours can <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">contribute</EVENT> to an exultant spiritual experience. Highlights are too numerous to <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">mention</EVENT>, but especially interesting are Martyrs, an organ duet (with John Butt), Leightons epic expansion on a simple Scottish psalm tune; his Missa de Gloria, a powerful exploration of plainchant, which evokes and outshines Durufl; and the Fantasy on a Chorale (Es ist genug), a fascinating combination of violin and organ.
