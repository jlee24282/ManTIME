Rooster is pronounced "ji" in Chinese, similar to the sound of the character meaning good luck. Hence rooster has been <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">seen</EVENT> as an auspicious creature in the Chinese culture. 
 
To <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">usher</EVENT> in the upcoming Year of the Rooster, Beijing's National Museum of China is <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">hosting</EVENT> an exhibition, titled A Crow at the Arrival of <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DURATION" value="PXY">New Year</TIMEX3>, which features some 118 artworks and artifacts in its collection that portray the animal. It is <EVENT eid="e5" class="STATE">ongoing</EVENT> until <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-02-19">Feb 19</TIMEX3>. 
 
Highlights include a piece of embroidery on silk <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">showing</EVENT> a cock under a tree. It is dated to the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) and a fine example of Gu Xiu, a distinguished embroidery technique that <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE">originated</EVENT> from a family surname Gu in Shanghai. 
 
Also on show are two pairs of doucai chicken cups, each of which were <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE">produced</EVENT> to the order of Qing Emperor Kangxi and his son Emperor Yongzheng. The cups were <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE">modeled</EVENT> after stem cups that feature roosters and were <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE">produced</EVENT> during the Chenghua reign of the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644).
