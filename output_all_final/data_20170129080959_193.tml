<TITLE>Corporate offshoring is a form of economic imperialism</TITLE>


<TEXT>
Gwynne Dyers assertion that automation is the cause of unemployment in America is blatant nonsense ( <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-22">Jan. 22</TIMEX3> Forum). If that were true, why would it be <EVENT eid="e1" class="I_STATE">necessary</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">move</EVENT> jobs overseas only to have automation <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">perform</EVENT> these <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">jobs</EVENT>? They just as easily could have <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">kept</EVENT> them here in America.

Further, are these factories <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">transferred</EVENT> overseas <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE">automated</EVENT>? I dont think so. They <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE">give</EVENT> employment to the inhabitants of those countries. The leaders of those countries would not be so <EVENT eid="e9" class="STATE">stupid</EVENT> as to have automated factories, with no real benefit to them.

The underlying premise of offshoring is to have economic power of such magnitude in those countries in order to be able to <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE">influence</EVENT> their political leadership. That way, Wall Street, the City of London and the Council on Foreign Relations could be in a strong position to <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE">influence</EVENT> or even <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE">control</EVENT> the policies of these countries. It is a subtle form of economic imperialism. Gunboat diplomacy is not viable, certainly not as a first resort; it would be too obvious.

Lower prices for American consumers as well as lower production costs for companies are a secondary consideration.
