Name  Madhvendra verma Roll no  1329040058 Mechanical <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DURATION" value="P3Y">3rd year</TIMEX3> section (A) Guided by- Prof. Pradeep Gupta Hod (mechanical department ) <EVENT eid="e1" class="STATE">ABES</EVENT> IT GHAZIABAD 1  2. Contents  Introduction  Types of engines  Engine Component  Working of 6 stroke engine Comparison of 6 stroke with 4 stroke engine  Advantages and disadvantages Conclusion  Reference 2  3. Engine is a device which transform one form of energy into another form. The six stroke engine Using water was <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">developed</EVENT> By Brush Crower in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2006">2006</TIMEX3>. A six stroke engine <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">derived</EVENT> its name from the fact that it is a mixture of two and four stroke engine. The six stroke engine is a type of internal combustion engine based on the four stroke engine , but its additional two stroke make it more efficient and reduce emission. Types of six stroke engines 1. Griffin six stroke engine. 2. Bajulaz six stroke engine. 3. Crower six stroke engine. 4. Velozeta six stroke engine. Six stroke engine 3  4. 4 Actual Prototype of SIX Stroke engine  5. ENGINE IC ENGINE EC ENGINE Types Of Engines IC  Internal combustion engine EC  External combustion engine 5  6.  The internal combustion is an engine in which the <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">burning</EVENT> of a fuel occur in a confined space called  IC ENGINE.  An external combustion engine is heat engine where an(internal) working fluid is compressed and <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">heated</EVENT> by combustion of an external fuel through the engine wall or heat exchanger. 6  7. 7 Component of engine  8. 8 Alternators  it is <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">used</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE">convert</EVENT> the mechanical energy into electrical energy. Camshaft  it is <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE">used</EVENT> to controls the opening and closing of valves. Time belt  a belt <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE">connected</EVENT> to both camshaft and crankshaft <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE">ensuring</EVENT> that they <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE">work</EVENT> in time with each other. Sparkplug  it is a component to <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE">initiate</EVENT> the combustion process in <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE">spark</EVENT> ignition engine and is usually located on the cylinder.  9. 9  10. Working of six stroke engine In first stroke (suction stroke)  Intake of pure air in the cylinder.  The valve is open. 10  11. Second stroke (compression stroke) Compression of pure air in the heating chamber. Both valves are <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE">closed</EVENT> 11  12. Third stroke (power stroke) In this stroke the piston <EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE">moves</EVENT> downward and the power <EVENT eid="e16" class="OCCURRENCE">transmitted</EVENT> from piston to wheel. Both valves are <EVENT eid="e17" class="OCCURRENCE">closed</EVENT>. 12  13. Fourth stroke (exhaust stroke) Exhaust of the combustion gases. The exhaust valve is open. 13  14. Fifth stroke (secondary power stroke) 14 In this stage water is <EVENT eid="e18" class="OCCURRENCE">injected</EVENT> by an Injector in the form of fine droplets and the water <EVENT eid="e19" class="OCCURRENCE">converted</EVENT> into steam. Both valves are <EVENT eid="e20" class="OCCURRENCE">closed</EVENT>.  15. Sixth stroke (secondary exhaust stroke) At this stage water is <EVENT eid="e21" class="OCCURRENCE">injected</EVENT> by an Injector in the form of fine droplets. Exhaust valve open. 15  16. Comparison Of Six Stroke Engine With Four Stroke Engine 16 In otto cylce ,there are two adiabatic processes 1- Adiabatic compression 2- Adiabatic expansion And One constant volume heat Addition process and one constant  17. 17t The dual cycle <EVENT eid="e22" class="OCCURRENCE">consist</EVENT> of the following operations- <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="X">1</TIMEX3>- Adiabatic Compression 2- Addition of heat at constant volume 3- Addition of heat at constant pressure 4- Adiabatic expansion 5- ejection of heat at constant volume The heat is added partly at constant volume and partly at constant pressure; The advantage of which is that more time is available to <EVENT eid="e23" class="OCCURRENCE">fuel</EVENT> for combustion.  18. 18 parameters Four stroke engine Six stroke engine Strokes It consist a 4 strokes . It consist a 6 strokes . ( <EVENT eid="e24" class="STATE">add</EVENT> 2 additional strokes) Thermal efficiency Low high Weight Low High Fuel consumptions High Low Power Low High Example- Car ,buses etc. Motor boat, high cost bikes(ex Ducati).  19. Advantages of six stroke engine  The thermal efficiency <EVENT eid="e25" class="OCCURRENCE">reaching</EVENT> 40-50%.  Fuel consumption <EVENT eid="e26" class="OCCURRENCE">reduce</EVENT> by more than 40%.  Reduction of chemical, noise and thermal pollution.  <EVENT eid="e27" class="OCCURRENCE">Increased</EVENT> torque and power output. 19  20. Disadvantage of six stroke Engine  Complex Head Design  Complex Cam Design For Exhaust (Due to two exhaust strokes).  Heavier Engine (Due to combustion engine).  Manufacturing of essential part is difficult. Weight increases. 20  21. conclusion  In a six stroke engine the fuel consumption is less. Better fuel economy compared with a conventional four-stroke design. Torque is increase by 35% and efficiency <EVENT eid="e28" class="OCCURRENCE">increased</EVENT> by the same. It reduces the weight and complexity of the engines head by as much as 50%. The concept of Six Stroke Engine <EVENT eid="e29" class="I_STATE">seems</EVENT> to be rather eco-friendly and low fuel consuming which can fulfill the needs of <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="FUTURE_REF">near future</TIMEX3>. 21  22.
