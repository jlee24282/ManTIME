<TITLE>Chuck Landon: Wrestling with MU's loss to UTEP</TITLE>


<TEXT>
Imagine professional <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">wrestling</EVENT> on a 94-foot-long, 50-foot-wide wooden court. 
   
That's what Marshall's 91-68 loss to UTEP before 6,781 disgruntled fans in an often raucous Henderson Center <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">resembled</EVENT> <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TNI">Saturday night</TIMEX3>. 
   
Nobody got <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">hit</EVENT> with a steel chair. 
   
And no one was <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">suplexed</EVENT> through a wooden table. 
   
But otherwise? 
   
It <EVENT eid="e5" class="REPORTING">looked</EVENT> like a game played in the "<EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">squared</EVENT> circle." 
   
It was physical, physical and more physical. That didn't <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE">bode</EVENT> well for an under-sized, height-challenged Herd trying to <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE">deal</EVENT> with the tag-team of 7-foot-1 Matt Willms and 6-11 Kelvin Jones. 
   
The result? 
   
Willms <EVENT eid="e9" class="STATE">had</EVENT> 25 points on 11-for-15 <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE">shooting</EVENT>, while Jones <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE">had</EVENT> five points, five rebounds and two <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE">blocked</EVENT> shots. But it wasn't just about their production. The big, bigger and biggest problem was Willms   Jones' intimidation. 
   
"It was real physical," <EVENT eid="e13" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT> Marshall's Austin Loop, who had two of MU's paltry total of only three 3-point field goals. "Their bigs were tough. 
   
"We're a little undersized. When guys like that are <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE">playing</EVENT> physical, it's tough for us." 
   
Think "Legion of Doom." 
   
Why, UTEP coach Tim Floyd even <EVENT eid="e15" class="REPORTING">performed</EVENT> a fairly good impression of "Precious" Paul Ellering, as he <EVENT eid="e16" class="OCCURRENCE">ranted</EVENT>, <EVENT eid="e17" class="OCCURRENCE">raved</EVENT>, <EVENT eid="e18" class="OCCURRENCE">gestured</EVENT> and even <EVENT eid="e19" class="OCCURRENCE">charged</EVENT> <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-Q1">three-quarters</TIMEX3> of the way out on the court at one point. 
   
How he wasn't <EVENT eid="e20" class="OCCURRENCE">whistled</EVENT> for a technical foul is beyond me. 
   
The combination of UTEP's skyscrapers inside, tremendous quickness and athleticism on the perimeter and the fact the officiating <EVENT eid="e21" class="OCCURRENCE">allowed</EVENT> both teams to <EVENT eid="e22" class="OCCURRENCE">play</EVENT> physical ball was simply more than Marshall could <EVENT eid="e23" class="OCCURRENCE">overcome</EVENT>. 
   
If Marshall is poison, then UTEP is the antidote. 
   
The Miners were the absolute worst-case <EVENT eid="e24" class="OCCURRENCE">scenario</EVENT> for Marshall on <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TNI">Saturday night</TIMEX3>. 
   
"We're not a physical team," <EVENT eid="e25" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT> a somber Danny D'Antoni, during the Marshall third-year coach's postgame press conference. "We have to <EVENT eid="e26" class="OCCURRENCE">play</EVENT> clean." 
   
There was very little cleanliness in this rough and tumble game, which included two technical fouls although that total easily could have been <EVENT eid="e27" class="OCCURRENCE">doubled</EVENT> or <EVENT eid="e28" class="OCCURRENCE">tripled</EVENT>. 
   
Why, Mr. Clean himself would have been <EVENT eid="e29" class="OCCURRENCE">hit</EVENT> with a technical foul in this game. 
   
That's how unclean it was. 
   
This Marshall team simply can't <EVENT eid="e30" class="OCCURRENCE">cope</EVENT> with that. As a result, Jon Elmore was 2 for 12 from the floor, including 0 for 7 on 3-pointers and <EVENT eid="e31" class="OCCURRENCE">scored</EVENT> only 11 points. Backcourt mate Stevie Browning <EVENT eid="e32" class="OCCURRENCE">struggled</EVENT> even harder, scoring only three points on 0-for-7 shooting, including 0 for 5 from beyond the arc. 
   
Imagine the "Rock 'N' Roll Express" <EVENT eid="e33" class="OCCURRENCE">taking</EVENT> on the "Four Horsemen." 
   
Under the circumstances, it was that lopsided. 
   
Yet, D'Antoni <EVENT eid="e34" class="OCCURRENCE">insisted</EVENT> on <EVENT eid="e35" class="OCCURRENCE">giving</EVENT> UTEP credit rather than <EVENT eid="e36" class="OCCURRENCE">choosing</EVENT> a convenient alibi. 
   
"They <EVENT eid="e37" class="OCCURRENCE">deserved</EVENT> the <EVENT eid="e38" class="OCCURRENCE">win</EVENT>," he <EVENT eid="e39" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT>. "They were a lot closer to their game than we were to ours." 
   
When a team that is <EVENT eid="e40" class="OCCURRENCE">built</EVENT> on 3-point shooting <EVENT eid="e41" class="OCCURRENCE">goes</EVENT> a head-shaking 3-for-25 from behind the arc for 12.1 percent shooting ... well, it doesn't <EVENT eid="e42" class="OCCURRENCE">get</EVENT> any worse than that. 
   
Again, worst-case scenario. 
   
The only glimmer of positivity was the play of Terrence Thompson, who <EVENT eid="e43" class="OCCURRENCE">led</EVENT> MU with 25 points and 10 rebounds. 
   
That's a step in the right direction on a night full of miss steps. 
   
Where was Captain Lou when Marshall <EVENT eid="e44" class="OCCURRENCE">needed</EVENT> him?
