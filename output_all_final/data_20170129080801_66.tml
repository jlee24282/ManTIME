<TITLE>In Uk: Country returns 'ship of shame' to Russia</TITLE>


<TEXT>
A Russian aircraft carrier used to wage a massive offensive on the Syrian city of Aleppo is on its way back to Russia Britain's defence minister <EVENT eid="e1" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT> <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-25">Wednesday</TIMEX3> calling it a "ship of shame" 

"We will keep a close eye on the Admiral Kuznetsov as it skulks back to Russia" Defence Minister Michael Fallon <EVENT eid="e2" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT> in a statement

The Russian warship <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">travelled</EVENT> through the North Sea to Syria <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3> to help Moscow ally President Bashar al-Assad's troops recapture rebel areas of Aleppo city after <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P4Y">four years</TIMEX3> of fighting there

The offensive forced thousands of civilians and rebels to flee the city after <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="PXY">years</TIMEX3> of intense <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">bombing</EVENT> and clashes that ravaged swathes of Syria's former economic capital

Fallon called the aircraft carrier "a ship of shame whose mission has only extended the suffering of the Syrian people"

"We are man-marking these vessels every step of the way around the UK as part of our steadfast commitment to keep Britain safe" he said

Britain is deploying Typhoon jets and a frigate to shadow the Admiral Kuznetsov which is accompanied by a Russian cruiser and salvage tug the ministry said

Moscow criticised the escort and accused Fallon of hitting out at the Russian navy in a bid to distract the British public

"The aim of this type of statement and the 'show' performed by the naval escort of our vessels is designed to turn the attention of British taxpayers away from the real state of Britain's military fleet" Igor Konachenkov spokesman for the Russian defence ministry <EVENT eid="e5" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT> in a statement

"I would like to point out that in the first place the Russian military vessels did not require this kind of senseless escort they know how to find their way through this stretch of sea

"And secondly we recommend Mr Fallon you pay more attention to the British fleet as the English press have for good reason also stressed" he added

The jibe was in reference to media reports on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3> of a failed test of Britain's nuclear weapons deterrent <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3> which the British government has <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">refused</EVENT> to confirm or deny outright

Russia scales down deployment Russia's military <EVENT eid="e7" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT> earlier <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-01">this month</TIMEX3> that it had begun scaling down its deployment in Syria under a drawdown ordered by President Vladimir Putin on <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-12-29">December 29</TIMEX3>

Aircraft from the carrier hit <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="1252">1252</TIMEX3> "terrorist" targets during a <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P2M">two-month</TIMEX3> mission Russia's main commander in Syria Andrei Kartapolov was quoted by Russian news agencies as saying

The Syrian regime and its allies have consistently referred to all of Assad's opponents -- jihadist or otherwise -- as "terrorist" since a conflict erupted in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2011">2011</TIMEX3>

The fall of Aleppo in <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2016-12">December last year</TIMEX3> was the regime's biggest victory since the war began with anti-Assad protests
