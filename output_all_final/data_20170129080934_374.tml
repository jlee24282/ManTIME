<TITLE>'Really, Really Smart'</TITLE>


<TEXT>
Boys and girls were <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">told</EVENT> the following story. Then they were <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">shown</EVENT> photos of two men and two women, and <EVENT eid="e3" class="I_ACTION">asked</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">guess</EVENT> which person the story was about. By age 6, girls were less likely than boys to <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">favor</EVENT> their own gender. 

"There are lots of people at the place where I <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">work</EVENT>. But there is one person who is really special. This person is really, really smart. This person <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE">figures</EVENT> out how to do things quickly and <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE">comes</EVENT> up with answers much faster and better than anyone else. This person is really, really smart."
