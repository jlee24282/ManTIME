<TITLE>Book Review: 'Birds Art Life' evokes song of meditation</TITLE>


<TEXT>
By Birds Art Life: A Year of Observation by: Kyo Maclear; Scribner (221 pages, $25) 
 
Kyo Maclear <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">took</EVENT> up birding after her father <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">suffered</EVENT> his second stroke. 
 
It had been a tough winter, cold settling in early, <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">snowing</EVENT> often, and between the harsh weather and worries about her father, Maclear was <EVENT eid="e4" class="I_ACTION">feeling</EVENT> unmoored. I had <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">lost</EVENT> the beat, she <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">writes</EVENT> in her strange, lovely, profound little book, Birds Art Life: A Year of Observation. 
 
A friend she calls only the musician had <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE">found</EVENT> peace in his life by <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE">photographing</EVENT> urban birds. The birds he watched <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE">lived</EVENT> in gardens of steel, glass, concrete, and electricity. There was a bird with a plastic frozen mango bag on its face and another bird nesting in a shattered light fixture.  The birds were doing ordinary bird things  <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE">perching</EVENT>, flying, <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE">preening</EVENT>, hunting, nest-building  but there was no doubt that they were of rather than above the mess and grit and trash of the world. 
 
And so she <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE">asks</EVENT> if she can accompany the <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE">musician</EVENT> on a bird walk. I <EVENT eid="e14" class="I_ACTION">wanted</EVENT> to be <EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE">enraptured</EVENT> and <EVENT eid="e16" class="OCCURRENCE">feel</EVENT> I was still inspirable, she <EVENT eid="e17" class="OCCURRENCE">writes</EVENT>. 
 
One bird walk turns into <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3> of birding, during which Maclear meditates on her past, her parents, her marriage, books she loves, the nature of art, death, happiness, climate change and whatever else <EVENT eid="e18" class="OCCURRENCE">comes</EVENT> to her fertile, deeply curious mind. Though <EVENT eid="e19" class="OCCURRENCE">structured</EVENT> as a chronological memoir, hers is not a typical year in the life narrative. Each chapter is <EVENT eid="e20" class="OCCURRENCE">built</EVENT> around bird observations, but her excursions to the urban-bird habitats serve mainly as jumping-off points for her intelligent and thoughtful ramblings. 
 
Her metaphors and verbs are often bird-inspired, but these allusions feel natural, never <EVENT eid="e21" class="OCCURRENCE">forced</EVENT>, and her descriptions are vivid and original: A horned grebe sporting a punky Klaus Nomi hairdo <EVENT eid="e22" class="OCCURRENCE">put</EVENT> on a little show, diving and disappearing. Hooded mergansers have crests resembling Elizabethan bridal hats. They <EVENT eid="e23" class="OCCURRENCE">dove</EVENT> for barnacles while giant ice cubes <EVENT eid="e24" class="OCCURRENCE">clinked</EVENT> around them. A solitary male gadwall <EVENT eid="e25" class="OCCURRENCE">stayed</EVENT> still long enough for me to <EVENT eid="e26" class="OCCURRENCE">fixate</EVENT> on its delicate herringbone feather pattern. 
 
Occasionally she <EVENT eid="e27" class="OCCURRENCE">takes</EVENT> her sons birding with her, and when the younger one grows tired, she gathers him up until he was <EVENT eid="e28" class="OCCURRENCE">folded</EVENT> in my arms like a futon. 
 
On one walk, fairly early on, she <EVENT eid="e29" class="OCCURRENCE">recalls</EVENT> the birds that <EVENT eid="e30" class="OCCURRENCE">smashed</EVENT> into the windows of her elementary school when she was a child. I <EVENT eid="e31" class="I_STATE">remember</EVENT> their little matchstick legs <EVENT eid="e32" class="OCCURRENCE">poking</EVENT> up at the sky, she <EVENT eid="e33" class="OCCURRENCE">writes</EVENT>. I <EVENT eid="e34" class="I_STATE">remember</EVENT> thinking it <EVENT eid="e35" class="I_STATE">seemed</EVENT> cruel that a bird should be <EVENT eid="e36" class="OCCURRENCE">punished</EVENT> for <EVENT eid="e37" class="REPORTING">believing</EVENT> it could <EVENT eid="e38" class="OCCURRENCE">fly</EVENT>. 
 
Maclear, who lives in Toronto, writes books for children, and her prose here is direct and clear, each sentence <EVENT eid="e39" class="OCCURRENCE">carrying</EVENT> as much weight as a line in a picture book, or in a poem. If you listen to birds, she <EVENT eid="e40" class="OCCURRENCE">writes</EVENT>, every day will have a song in it. 
 
This book is a lovely song  a <EVENT eid="e41" class="OCCURRENCE">symphony</EVENT>  for all of us. The musicians bird photographs are at www.smallbirdsongs.com
