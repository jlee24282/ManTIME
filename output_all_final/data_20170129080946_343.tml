<TITLE>Ty Segall: Ty Segall review  an impressively intimate gear change</TITLE>


<TEXT>
(Drag City) Over <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="200">the past decade</TIMEX3>, Californian Ty Segall has been <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">defined</EVENT> as much by his Stakhanovite work ethic as for his knack for <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">melding</EVENT> melody with power to <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">breathe</EVENT> fresh life into garage rock. His first album of <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> has plenty of the sort of fuzzed-up riffs that <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">made</EVENT> 2014s career high-water mark Manipulator so intoxicating, but for <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="X">once</TIMEX3> his best songs are also the most intimate. The tender Talkin and Orange Color Queen have more in common with the late Elliott Smith than the Stooges, both <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">benefiting</EVENT> from the uncharacteristic lack of distorted guitar. Even better is the expansive, unhurried Papers. The meandering <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">midsection</EVENT> of Warm Hands is a slight misstep, but this is another impressive addition to Segalls canon.
