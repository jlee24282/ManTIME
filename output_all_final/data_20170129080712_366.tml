<TITLE>INTERNATIONAL LAUNCH: Mercedes-AMG GT R is a star ...</TITLE>


<TEXT>
Porsches 911 GT3 dominates the big end of track-day town and its adherents are unshakeable. AMG <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">shot</EVENT> its GT and GT S straight at the heart of the 911, <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> it is <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">going</EVENT> after the 911 GT3 with the GT R which is due in SA in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-Q2">the second quarter of 2017</TIMEX3>. And its aim has been surgically precise. Its a solidly stiff road car but an incandescent track car that sounds like an entire Nascar field. Porsche <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">used</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">have</EVENT> this market all to itself. You could <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">spend</EVENT> a bit less and <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">get</EVENT> a BMW M3 of one sort or another or <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE">spend</EVENT> a bit more for a near-pure track car, but to <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE">get</EVENT> something you were happy driving home again, you <EVENT eid="e9" class="I_ACTION">had</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE">get</EVENT> a 911 GT3. You dont have to <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE">get</EVENT> a 911 GT3 anymore. In fact, youd be almost legally culpable if you <EVENT eid="e12" class="I_STATE">didnt</EVENT> have a drive of one of these things before you <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE">turned</EVENT> up at Porsche with a cheque. The GT R takes everything from the GT and GT S programmes and makes it stronger, lighter, more powerful and more precise. Everything from a 57mm stretch in width to how it steers to how it bites at the road to how it makes the airflow massage, it has all been <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE">changed</EVENT>. And its all been <EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE">changed</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e16" class="I_ACTION">make</EVENT> it <EVENT eid="e17" class="OCCURRENCE">go</EVENT> faster, everywhere, all the time. Its not hard to tell this one was a passion project at AMG, which <EVENT eid="e18" class="OCCURRENCE">brought</EVENT> its GT <EVENT eid="e19" class="OCCURRENCE">racing</EVENT> engineers and aerodynamicists into play right from the <EVENT eid="e20" class="OCCURRENCE">start</EVENT>. Everybody from boss Tobias Moers to the lowliest apprentice has been <EVENT eid="e21" class="OCCURRENCE">asked</EVENT> for their ideas to <EVENT eid="e22" class="OCCURRENCE">make</EVENT> the GT S faster and too many dinners were <EVENT eid="e23" class="OCCURRENCE">left cooling</EVENT> on family tables as they <EVENT eid="e24" class="OCCURRENCE">sorted</EVENT> through them and <EVENT eid="e25" class="OCCURRENCE">nutted</EVENT> out the details. Of course, AMG didnt neglect the engine. The dry-sumped 4.0l twin turbo V8 has 430kW of power and 700Nm of torque, which sprint it to 100km/h in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="X">3.6 seconds</TIMEX3>. Thats only a tenth quicker than the GT S (and <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="X">0.2</TIMEX3> seconds slower than the family mans E63 S) but the real reason the GT R exists is that this car is more <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="X">than 20 seconds</TIMEX3> faster than the GT S around the Nrburgrings Nordschleife circuit. With an independent German magazine clocking 7:10.9, its the new holder of the production road car record. That doesnt <EVENT eid="e26" class="OCCURRENCE">happen</EVENT> with just a bit more power. It happens with a bit more everything. Theyve <EVENT eid="e27" class="OCCURRENCE">taken</EVENT> out weight with things like carbon fibre front wings, propshaft and the torque tube to the rear-mounted transaxle, but theyve also <EVENT eid="e28" class="OCCURRENCE">put</EVENT> weight back in with rear-wheel steering and a host of carbon fibre reinforcements, so the net gain for the 1,555kg car is only 15kg. Then there is the stance, which is wider by about 5cm at both ends, <EVENT eid="e29" class="OCCURRENCE">sitting</EVENT> on new coilover springs and dampers, with custom-developed settings, plus a cool nine-step adjustable traction control, which only <EVENT eid="e30" class="OCCURRENCE">works</EVENT> in the Race mode when the skid-control is turned off. Then the aero coves joined in, <EVENT eid="e31" class="OCCURRENCE">adding</EVENT> a flat, carbon fibre undertray behind the fixed splitter that <EVENT eid="e32" class="OCCURRENCE">drops</EVENT> down 40mm to <EVENT eid="e33" class="OCCURRENCE">create</EVENT> a venturi effect above 80km/h in Race mode (or 120km/h in girlier modes). It reduces the front ends lift by 40kg at 240km/h, though its work is added to by a set of louvres that open and close to <EVENT eid="e34" class="OCCURRENCE">change</EVENT> the cars downforce levels to <EVENT eid="e35" class="OCCURRENCE">add</EVENT> grip in corners and <EVENT eid="e36" class="OCCURRENCE">reduce</EVENT> drag on straights. Theres also a massive double diffuser at the back; the primary job is to <EVENT eid="e37" class="OCCURRENCE">use</EVENT> underfloor air to <EVENT eid="e38" class="OCCURRENCE">suck</EVENT> the back end onto the ground, while the second part <EVENT eid="e39" class="OCCURRENCE">borrows</EVENT> an idea from the Braun Formula 1 team to <EVENT eid="e40" class="OCCURRENCE">do</EVENT> the same thing with redirected radiator-cooling air. Theres also an adjustable rear wing and besides all of these pieces <EVENT eid="e41" class="OCCURRENCE">reducing</EVENT> lift all over the car (dont believe anybody who tells you they <EVENT eid="e42" class="OCCURRENCE">give</EVENT> the GT R "downforce" because they dont), they actually <EVENT eid="e43" class="OCCURRENCE">reduce</EVENT> its overall drag.It <EVENT eid="e44" class="OCCURRENCE">gets</EVENT> bigger boots, with 275/35 ZR19 front and 325/30 ZR20 rear tyres, while implausibly light alloy wheels and carbon ceramic anchors are both optional and save another 4kg of unsprung mass per corner.Yes, this car is the five-alarm chilli of the AMG world and, combined with the E63 its just <EVENT eid="e45" class="OCCURRENCE">launched</EVENT>, it clearly <EVENT eid="e46" class="OCCURRENCE">represents</EVENT> a turning point for a company that could have easily <EVENT eid="e47" class="OCCURRENCE">slipped</EVENT> into building profit-rich, mildly warm versions of all the Mercedes-Benz production cars and SUVs.This is AMG at its most focused, more surgical than it has ever been, <EVENT eid="e48" class="OCCURRENCE">producing</EVENT> a car thats neither the most expensive nor the most powerful its ever <EVENT eid="e49" class="OCCURRENCE">made</EVENT>, but easily the most precisely targeted. It <EVENT eid="e50" class="STATE">has</EVENT> all the usual built-in multimedia niceties of the stock GT, including navigation, a Burmeister sound system, air conditioning, a head-up display, connectivity for smartphones and a seat choice between electric sports seats and lighter manually operated hard-core sports seats. Theres even a track pack, with a half-cage behind the front seats (which can be <EVENT eid="e51" class="OCCURRENCE">painted</EVENT> in the bodys colour), a four-point harness and even stickier tyres. The thing is, its hard to <EVENT eid="e52" class="REPORTING">know</EVENT> which of these areas <EVENT eid="e53" class="OCCURRENCE">stands</EVENT> out the most. Its obvious while its sitting still, though. Static, the star is the engine and, more specifically, how all that burnt air <EVENT eid="e54" class="OCCURRENCE">works</EVENT> its way out the back. Its loud from the inside, louder from the outside and its loud in a way that makes the very word "loud" seem inadequate. And thats in the default start-up mode (Sport, incidentally). Its deep, it rumbles, it <EVENT eid="e55" class="STATE">has</EVENT> a slightly odd, off-beat burble to it and the tacho needle responds to the throttle like someone <EVENT eid="e56" class="OCCURRENCE">jumped</EVENT> on the other end of it. For all that, the engine is perhaps the least fiddled bit of the car. The modular V8 is dry-sumped, like it is in the GT, but <EVENT eid="e57" class="STATE">runs</EVENT> different mapping, a slightly higher compression ratio and more turbo boost (up to 1.35 bar) to <EVENT eid="e58" class="OCCURRENCE">thump</EVENT> out an extra 55kW. To <EVENT eid="e59" class="OCCURRENCE">give</EVENT> it more agility, the dual-mass flywheel is 0.7kg lighter, The seven-speed dual-clutch gets a taller first gear, a shorter seventh and a shorter final-drive ratio, while the rear diff is <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> so tight that ours <EVENT eid="e60" class="OCCURRENCE">graunched</EVENT> on full-lock turns. The critical new addition, overlooked in favour of sexier aero talk, is the active rear-wheel steering, <EVENT eid="e61" class="OCCURRENCE">governed</EVENT> by a massive electric motor on each wheel and <EVENT eid="e62" class="OCCURRENCE">moving</EVENT> the toe angle up to 1.5, with no physical connection to the steering wheel whatsoever. There are also uniball bearings on the rear, which dont change their toe angle under hard cornering and are harder <EVENT eid="e63" class="OCCURRENCE">wearing</EVENT> than wishbone bushes. So thats just <EVENT eid="e64" class="OCCURRENCE">scratching</EVENT> the surface of what AMG has done to <EVENT eid="e65" class="OCCURRENCE">turn</EVENT> the twitchy GT S into the brilliant GT R. And it is brilliant. The Black Series was the most precise of the old SLS coupes and its the same here. You have to <EVENT eid="e66" class="OCCURRENCE">put</EVENT> a lot of effort into <EVENT eid="e67" class="OCCURRENCE">driving</EVENT> a GT S quickly, but you get more reward, for the same effort, in the GT R. Its also <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> just fast enough that you physically feel like youve had a workout after an afternoon of fast lappery. How fast is it? Realistically, its lets-sit-down-and-recalibrate fast. Its properly fast. Its scorchingly fast. Its not sneaky fast. Its not sneaky anything. Definitely not the kind of car that flies under the radar (the noise alone takes care of that), the GT R succeeds both on sheer speed on a circuit and it <EVENT eid="e68" class="I_STATE">delivers</EVENT> a huge leap on giving the driver an experience to <EVENT eid="e69" class="OCCURRENCE">soak</EVENT> up and <EVENT eid="e70" class="OCCURRENCE">enjoy</EVENT>. It starts, as every AMG does, with the engine note. The titanium exhaust <EVENT eid="e71" class="OCCURRENCE">turns</EVENT> its work into something that, in Sport+ or Race mode (or when you just <EVENT eid="e72" class="OCCURRENCE">push</EVENT> the Loudenator button) is so loud that just five of the things together would <EVENT eid="e73" class="OCCURRENCE">frighten</EVENT> off an alien <EVENT eid="e74" class="OCCURRENCE">invasion</EVENT>. Its an astonishingly brutal noise that is deeper than anything of just four litres has a right to be, yet rich, thick and carries an underlying sophistication to it. Then you <EVENT eid="e75" class="OCCURRENCE">lift</EVENT> off or brake and <EVENT eid="e76" class="OCCURRENCE">downshift</EVENT> and the pops and <EVENT eid="e77" class="I_STATE">crackles</EVENT> are so exaggerated they <EVENT eid="e78" class="OCCURRENCE">make</EVENT> the just-launched, very loud E63 seem like its <EVENT eid="e79" class="OCCURRENCE">scrunching</EVENT> up a bit of paper by comparison. And it <EVENT eid="e80" class="OCCURRENCE">matches</EVENT> that theatre with epic performance. Sure, 3.6 seconds to 100km/h is only a tenth quicker than the stock one, but <EVENT eid="e81" class="I_STATE">thats</EVENT> missing the point. Its belligerently flexible, with the torque peak <EVENT eid="e82" class="OCCURRENCE">hitting</EVENT> at only 1,900r/min and its belligerently loud while doing it. If its not just Porsches its chasing, Ferrari, Lamborghini and Aston are all incapable of making noise like this. If youve driven 50m and still <EVENT eid="e83" class="OCCURRENCE">overlook</EVENT> just how much more precise the car is, then <EVENT eid="e84" class="OCCURRENCE">youve got</EVENT> no business driving it. Its <EVENT eid="e85" class="OCCURRENCE">wasted</EVENT> on you. The new carbon fibre braces, <EVENT eid="e86" class="OCCURRENCE">joining</EVENT> the underbody sides to the torque tube, <EVENT eid="e87" class="OCCURRENCE">give</EVENT> it an extra 7% of torsional rigidity. The torque tube itself adds more rigidity, so do a host of other braces. And the car is just astonishingly accurate <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3>. Too accurate, to be fair, on public roads. We <EVENT eid="e88" class="OCCURRENCE">found</EVENT> wet roads and mud all over the mountain passes of the Algarve in Portugal and the ride was at least firm in every mode, with the car <EVENT eid="e89" class="OCCURRENCE">snapping</EVENT> into wheelspin over muddy patches even in fifth or sixth gear with modest throttle inputs and little suspension compliance to <EVENT eid="e90" class="OCCURRENCE">help</EVENT> out. On really bad roads, well, it might be just too <EVENT eid="e91" class="STATE">hard</EVENT> for some people. Where the GT Ss steering feedback suffers from its cab-rearward stance, the GT R is pin sharp and more intuitive. It still slides and it still <EVENT eid="e92" class="OCCURRENCE">runs</EVENT> out of grip, but its phenomenally easy to <EVENT eid="e93" class="OCCURRENCE">control</EVENT>, even with the traction control <EVENT eid="e94" class="OCCURRENCE">turned</EVENT> off completely. To be safe, you can <EVENT eid="e95" class="OCCURRENCE">run</EVENT> it in Sport+ or in Race with the skid-control either on or in Sport mode. That way you keep some traction control plus some skid-control when the car starts to <EVENT eid="e96" class="OCCURRENCE">slide</EVENT>. The fun way is to <EVENT eid="e97" class="OCCURRENCE">attack</EVENT> it in Race with the skid-control off all the way (hold the button down for <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="X">five seconds</TIMEX3>), then you control the slides with your feet and hands and you <EVENT eid="e98" class="I_STATE">control</EVENT> the traction control with the unmistakable bright yellow knob beneath the air vents.It will <EVENT eid="e99" class="OCCURRENCE">light</EVENT> up as you <EVENT eid="e100" class="OCCURRENCE">turn</EVENT> it (with a mirror version in the dash display, in case you <EVENT eid="e101" class="OCCURRENCE">missed</EVENT> it) and it will <EVENT eid="e102" class="OCCURRENCE">light</EVENT> up the rear tyres more as you <EVENT eid="e103" class="OCCURRENCE">turn</EVENT> it down to off. There are nine stages, with the first for wet <EVENT eid="e104" class="OCCURRENCE">driving</EVENT>, the last for off and then theres everything in between.The whole package <EVENT eid="e105" class="OCCURRENCE">adds</EVENT> up to a machine thats a joy to drive, all the time. You <EVENT eid="e106" class="OCCURRENCE">attack</EVENT> corners deeper and deeper under brakes because it bites and bites and bites.You fiddle with the front end in fast and slow corners because it will dive hard for the apex even if youve still <EVENT eid="e107" class="OCCURRENCE">got</EVENT> a rude amount of friction <EVENT eid="e108" class="OCCURRENCE">squeezing</EVENT> the brake calipers together.And you jump on the throttle harder and earlier, every lap, because the rear end (which <EVENT eid="e109" class="STATE">has</EVENT> 52.7% of the weight) is simply <EVENT eid="e110" class="OCCURRENCE">accepting</EVENT> all the power youre <EVENT eid="e111" class="OCCURRENCE">giving</EVENT> it and <EVENT eid="e112" class="OCCURRENCE">punching</EVENT> the car forward, harder and harder.It works the other way, too, with an innate ability to pivot around the centre of its axis thats highly <EVENT eid="e113" class="OCCURRENCE">sought</EVENT> after and rarely <EVENT eid="e114" class="OCCURRENCE">found</EVENT>, along with <EVENT eid="e115" class="I_ACTION">responding</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e116" class="OCCURRENCE">throttle</EVENT> lift-offs sharply and precisely to <EVENT eid="e117" class="OCCURRENCE">bring</EVENT> the nose closer to the apex on both fast and slow bends.Its also almost infinitely adjustable in a corner and you can <EVENT eid="e118" class="OCCURRENCE">drive</EVENT> it on understeer or oversteer, you can <EVENT eid="e119" class="OCCURRENCE">drive</EVENT> it <EVENT eid="e120" class="OCCURRENCE">leaning</EVENT> on the back wheels or the front and you can <EVENT eid="e121" class="OCCURRENCE">fling</EVENT> it into high-speed four-wheel drifts at will, even over sharp camber changes and crests.It is equally happy and able to <EVENT eid="e122" class="I_ACTION">drive</EVENT> it cleanly to <EVENT eid="e123" class="OCCURRENCE">set</EVENT> lap times or loosely to <EVENT eid="e124" class="OCCURRENCE">hang</EVENT> out and <EVENT eid="e125" class="STATE">have</EVENT> a blast and it is more accurate to the touch than any Benz-badged road car in history.At one point, with the stickier boots on, we were <EVENT eid="e126" class="OCCURRENCE">emerging</EVENT> onto Portimaos front straight at 200km/h and <EVENT eid="e127" class="OCCURRENCE">braking</EVENT> at the end at well over 290. Sure, it can slide, buck and dance over bumps and hard cornering, but it <EVENT eid="e128" class="REPORTING">leaves</EVENT> you with the unshakable impression that its dancing to the drivers tune and the drivers <EVENT eid="e129" class="OCCURRENCE">tune</EVENT> alone.There will be a day when it lines up <EVENT eid="e130" class="I_STATE">head</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e131" class="OCCURRENCE">head</EVENT> against the 911 GT3 and even the GT3 RS and the McLaren 570S, but there are plenty of reasons to <EVENT eid="e132" class="OCCURRENCE">like</EVENT> it, even in that company.That, and its also front-engined and rear-drive and happy to slide. And that never hurts.Mercedes-AMG GT RPrice: R2,689,900On sale date: Q2 2017Max power: 430kWMax torque: 700NmTop speed: 318km/h0-100km/h: 3.6 secondsCombined consumption: 11.4l/100kmCO2 emissions: 259g/kmStar rating out of five: ****.5
