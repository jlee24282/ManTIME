In a recent <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">interview</EVENT> with Publishers Weekly magazine, acclaimed American author Paul Auster <EVENT eid="e2" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT> that he doesnt <EVENT eid="e3" class="I_ACTION">think</EVENT> theres a human being alive who hasnt <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">speculated</EVENT>, what if? What if my father hadnt been <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">killed</EVENT> in that accident? What if I had <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">hit</EVENT> a home run instead of <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE">striking</EVENT> out? Its very easy, he <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE">went</EVENT> on, to <EVENT eid="e9" class="ASPECTUAL">start playing</EVENT> at these alternate realities for yourself, and its a fascinating game to <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE">play</EVENT>. 
 
4321 , Austers seventeenth novel, and his first since <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="201X">2010s</TIMEX3> Sunset Park , is the ultimate What If? game. 
 
On <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="1947-03-03">March 3, 1947</TIMEX3>, at Beth Israel Hospital in Newark, NJ, Stanley Ferguson and his wife Rose Adler <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE">welcome</EVENT> into the world their first, and only, child, Archibald Isaac Ferguson. It is an unexceptional birth, surrounded by family, and for the briefest of moments, Archie is the youngest human being on the face of the earth. 
 
But things do not <EVENT eid="e12" class="STATE">remain</EVENT> unexceptional for long. 
 
Happenstance has always <EVENT eid="e13" class="I_ACTION">played</EVENT> a significant role in Austers fiction. Chance is part of reality, he wrote in The Art of Hunger , his <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="1992">1992</TIMEX3> collection of essays and interviews, we are continually shaped by the forces of coincidence, the unexpected occurs with almost numbing regularity in our lives. 
   
Article Continued Below 
   
With <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="X">4321</TIMEX3> , Auster <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE">plays</EVENT> out the string of chance, <EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE">wondering</EVENT>, as young Archie himself <EVENT eid="e16" class="I_STATE">wonders</EVENT>: how things could be different even though he <EVENT eid="e17" class="STATE">was</EVENT> the same . . . The same boy with different parents. The same boy with the same parents who didnt <EVENT eid="e18" class="OCCURRENCE">do</EVENT> the same things they did <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> . . . anything was possible, and just because things <EVENT eid="e19" class="OCCURRENCE">happened</EVENT> in one way didnt mean they <EVENT eid="e20" class="I_STATE">couldnt</EVENT> happen in another. Everything could be different. 
 
And so Auster follows four possible paths of Archies life, each contingent upon unexpected occurrences. Chief among these unanticipated events is the <EVENT eid="e21" class="OCCURRENCE">demise</EVENT> in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="1953-11">November 1953</TIMEX3> of 3 Brothers Home World, Stanley Fergusons furniture business. 
 
The how and why of that demise  by theft, accidental fire, arson or acquisition  <EVENT eid="e22" class="OCCURRENCE">propels</EVENT> the four Archies on their singular journeys, <EVENT eid="e23" class="OCCURRENCE">leading</EVENT> one to Paris, one to Princeton, one to the tumultuous campus of Columbia University during the <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="1968">1968</TIMEX3> student <EVENT eid="e24" class="OCCURRENCE">occupation</EVENT>, and one to an early and tragic end. 
   
Auster is nothing if not a clever writer, and 4321 is a wonderfully clever book. The Austerian hallmarks of intertextuality and metafiction are on show throughout. For those who have <EVENT eid="e25" class="OCCURRENCE">read</EVENT> his work, familiar names will <EVENT eid="e26" class="OCCURRENCE">pop</EVENT> up: Daniel Quinn from The City of Glass , Adam Walker from Invisible , Peter Aaron from Leviathan , Marco Fogg and David Zimmer from Moon Palace and The Book of Illusions . 
 
And there are other postmodern tricks on display, as when the third Archie sets out to <EVENT eid="e27" class="OCCURRENCE">write</EVENT> his first book, the middle section of which he concludes with a description taken almost verbatim from earlier in the novel itself. 
 
But 4321 is much more than a piece of literary gamesmanship  though Austers detractors have often <EVENT eid="e28" class="OCCURRENCE">accused</EVENT> him of being capable of little more. It is a heartfelt and engaging piece of storytelling that unflinchingly <EVENT eid="e29" class="OCCURRENCE">explores</EVENT> <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="X">the 20th</TIMEX3> century American experience in all its honour and ignominy. 
 
This is, without doubt, Austers magnum opus. Weighing in at 964 pages, it dwarfs any of his other works, and <EVENT eid="e30" class="OCCURRENCE">gives</EVENT> him the room to fully <EVENT eid="e31" class="OCCURRENCE">indulge</EVENT> his fictional obsessions: the question of identity, the writing life, absent fathers, the moral obligations of both art and the artist, as well as  and perhaps most importantly, given the <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="X">present</TIMEX3> circumstances  the betrayal of America by its politicians, not only Democrats and Republicans, but also those radical groups that arose out of the turbulence of the <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="196X">1960s</TIMEX3>, only to <EVENT eid="e32" class="OCCURRENCE">fall</EVENT> prey to the same hypocrisies and egocentricities of their mainstream foes. 
 
And yet, for all its gravitas, <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="X">4321</TIMEX3> itself springs from a joke, a joke about the Jews from Poland and Russia who had <EVENT eid="e33" class="OCCURRENCE">boarded</EVENT> ships and <EVENT eid="e34" class="OCCURRENCE">come</EVENT> to America, the punchline of which Auster delivers with such aplomb as to <EVENT eid="e35" class="OCCURRENCE">reshape</EVENT> the readers entire perception of the novel. It is one of those rare instances in reading, when, for the briefest moment, everything seems to <EVENT eid="e36" class="OCCURRENCE">stop</EVENT> and <EVENT eid="e37" class="OCCURRENCE">reorder</EVENT> itself, a moment of true revelation, when the world  at least the world of the novel  makes sense, and one cant help but admit they are in the presence of genius.
