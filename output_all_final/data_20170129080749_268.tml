<TITLE>Foreign-language Oscar picks: World of turmoil turns to escapism</TITLE>


<TEXT>
By At a time of global anxiety, fervent populism and enduring conflict, international filmmakers have <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">turned</EVENT> to marriage, high jinks, history and even a remote island in the middle of the ocean to <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">make</EVENT> sense of things. 
 
Those themes were resonant in the Academy Award nominations for foreign-language film, which were <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">dominated</EVENT> by European movies that included an eccentric father-daughter comedy, a World War II drama about hidden land mines and the story of a curmudgeonly Swede <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">charmed</EVENT> by his immigrant neighbor. 
 
The two other movies among the five nominees were "Tanna," an Australian-directed tale of star-crossed lovers on a South Pacific island, and "The Salesman," an investigation of a marriage in turmoil by Iranian director Asghar Farhadi. Farhadi <EVENT eid="e5" class="STATE">won</EVENT> the foreign-language Oscar in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2012">2012</TIMEX3> for "A Separation." 
 
Europe's gaze at itself was <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">revealing</EVENT>. Germany's "Toni Erdmann" sets Eastern European capitalism as a backdrop for the strained relationship between a conformist daughter and her prankster father. Denmark's "Land of Mine" <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE">raises</EVENT> questions about morality and blame as German soldiers clear land mines on a beach. "A Man Called Ove" from Sweden looks at immigration through the eyes of a suicidal railroad worker. 
 
The nominated films <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE">explore</EVENT> the fissures, bonds, expectations and unpredictability of relationships, especially when characters are <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE">forced</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE">confront</EVENT> change. "The Salesman" <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE">hits</EVENT> all these notes as a couple <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE">navigate</EVENT> vengeance, fear and the insecurities of home after a wife is <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE">attacked</EVENT> by a stranger in the shower. That film, like "Toni Erdmann," <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE">directed</EVENT> by Maren Ade, draws the viewer deep into the intricacies of psychology and emotion. 
 
"It's in crisis that we <EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE">reveal</EVENT> our true selves," Farhadi recently <EVENT eid="e16" class="REPORTING">told</EVENT> The Times. "Film to me is like a court <EVENT eid="e17" class="OCCURRENCE">trial</EVENT>. The spectator is the judge." 
 
"Toni Erdmann" has been a favorite of critics, but the way it tests the bounds of family troubles - the father (Winfried) is a rambling jokester who wears oversized fake teeth and an outfit that makes him look like Bigfoot - is bracingly unconventional. Perhaps too much for some in the academy. The unsentimental film <EVENT eid="e18" class="REPORTING">crystallizes</EVENT> German sardonic wit, yet it movingly plays on Winfried's act-of-love strategy to <EVENT eid="e19" class="OCCURRENCE">embarrass</EVENT> his daughter (Ines) until he <EVENT eid="e20" class="OCCURRENCE">frees</EVENT> her from her rigid mask. 
 
"Tanna" summons a different kind of existential crisis amid <EVENT eid="e21" class="OCCURRENCE">battling</EVENT> tribes in the South Pacific. Unfolding amid thatched huts, grass <EVENT eid="e22" class="OCCURRENCE">skirts</EVENT> and a flickering volcano, the film, based on a true story, centers on the fate of two lovers after one of them is <EVENT eid="e23" class="I_ACTION">chosen</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e24" class="I_ACTION">marry</EVENT> someone in an <EVENT eid="e25" class="OCCURRENCE">opposing</EVENT> clan to <EVENT eid="e26" class="OCCURRENCE">keep</EVENT> peace and <EVENT eid="e27" class="OCCURRENCE">preserve</EVENT> island culture. Directed by Bentley Dean and Martin Butler, the film is a picturesque paean to a way of life far from the tug of modern forces. 
 
"Land of Mine" <EVENT eid="e28" class="OCCURRENCE">glimpses</EVENT> the dangerous irony of changing fortunes. It explores compassion, hate and justice along a Danish beach where Nazis had <EVENT eid="e29" class="OCCURRENCE">laid</EVENT> 45,000 land mines to <EVENT eid="e30" class="I_ACTION">prevent</EVENT> an Allied invasion. But the Danish army is back in control and has <EVENT eid="e31" class="OCCURRENCE">pressed</EVENT> German POWs into the meticulous task of <EVENT eid="e32" class="OCCURRENCE">clearing</EVENT> the mines. Directed by Martin Zandvliet, the movie follows "A War," about the Afghanistan conflict, as the second Danish film in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P2Y">two years</TIMEX3> to be <EVENT eid="e33" class="OCCURRENCE">nominated</EVENT> for an Academy Award. 
 
Whimsy mixes with Scandinavian stoicism in a "A Man Called Ove," <EVENT eid="e34" class="OCCURRENCE">directed</EVENT> by Hannes Holm, after a laid-off railroad worker and recent widower attempts to <EVENT eid="e35" class="OCCURRENCE">hang</EVENT> himself. The title character is a gruff bore who <EVENT eid="e36" class="OCCURRENCE">becomes</EVENT> enamored with his Iranian immigrant neighbor in a tender story that speaks to larger questions of culture and diversity that have been <EVENT eid="e37" class="OCCURRENCE">agitating</EVENT> Europe in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent years</TIMEX3>. 
 
"No one should be all on their own," Ove's neighbor <EVENT eid="e38" class="REPORTING">tells</EVENT> him. "Not even you."
