<TITLE>Dublin Bus still has three single-decker buses</TITLE>


<TEXT>
DUBLIN BUS HAS a fleet of nearly 1,000 buses, three of which are single deck vehicles.

The need for the smaller vehicles has largely <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">died</EVENT> out due to growing passenger numbers and <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">extended</EVENT> routes, but the capitals bus service still <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">retains</EVENT> the vehicles for certain routes.

The buses are <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">used</EVENT> on routes where roads may be narrower and less easily accessible to double deckers.

<EVENT eid="e5" class="REPORTING">According</EVENT> to DublinBusStuff.com, single decker buses were <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">used</EVENT> extensively on the Nipper route in the late 80s/early 90s.

A spokesperson for Dublin Bus that the bus is <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE">used</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE">service</EVENT> the 44B route which takes it to Johnny Foxes Pub in the Dublin Mountains.

Dublin Bus operates a fleet of 987 buses, three of which are single deck vehicles. These are based in Donnybrook Depot and are predominately <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE">used</EVENT> on Route 44b due to narrow roads and low hanging trees along the route to Glencullen.

The route <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE">goes</EVENT> to Glencullen from Dundrum six times <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-23">a day Monday</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3>.
