<TITLE>Legal Scoop | Hands off, court tells CVM - Ruling provides treasure trove for persons dealing with copyrighted material</TITLE>


<TEXT>
Copyright infringement cases are a rarity locally, and it does not help that the Copyright Act in Jamaica is as large as it is unwieldy. 
 
Understandably, therefore, media practitioners, generally, and practitioners in this area of the law, were <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">gushing</EVENT> recently when Justice Bryan Sykes <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">handed</EVENT> down a couple of judgments (and <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">written</EVENT> to boot!) in the copyright infringement case <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">brought</EVENT> by Television Jamaica Ltd (TVJ) against CVM television (CVM) in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3>. 
 
To <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">address</EVENT> the big white elephant in the room before <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">proceeding</EVENT> further, yes, I am substantively <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE">employed</EVENT> to the 
 
RJR Gleaner Group, of which TVJ is a member, and, yes, that connection may have <EVENT eid="e8" class="ASPECTUAL">heightened</EVENT> my interest in the <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE">rulings</EVENT>, but regardless of affiliation, the judgments are worthy of attention as they <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE">add</EVENT> local jurisprudence to an area of the law that is woefully <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE">lacking</EVENT> in Jamaica. 
 BACKGROUND  
The genesis of the <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE">dispute</EVENT> in the case traces back to <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3> when TVJ <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE">commenced</EVENT> legal proceedings against CVM for infringement of its exclusive right to <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE">broadcast</EVENT> the IAAF World Athletics Championships then under way in Beijing, China. 
 
At the <EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE">trial</EVENT> of the substantive issue in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2016-06">June 2016</TIMEX3>, CVM did not dispute TVJ s ownership of the rights in question or that it had <EVENT eid="e16" class="OCCURRENCE">broadcast</EVENT> various aspects of the World Championships, however, it <EVENT eid="e17" class="I_ACTION">contended</EVENT> that its use of the content <EVENT eid="e18" class="OCCURRENCE">constituted</EVENT>  fair dealing  and was, therefore, legal. 
 LIABILITY  
At the first phase of the <EVENT eid="e19" class="OCCURRENCE">trial</EVENT>, which, like the second phase, was <EVENT eid="e20" class="OCCURRENCE">presided</EVENT> over by Justice Bryan Sykes, various examples of CVM s breach of TVJ s licence were <EVENT eid="e21" class="OCCURRENCE">tendered</EVENT> into evidence, and Justice Sykes, in his usual methodical manner, <EVENT eid="e22" class="OCCURRENCE">reviewed</EVENT> each to <EVENT eid="e23" class="I_ACTION">determine</EVENT> whether the defence of fair dealing was indeed available to CVM. 
 
While CVM s defence of  fair dealing  did <EVENT eid="e24" class="OCCURRENCE">succeed</EVENT> in some instances (and those, too, constitute an important addition to the jurisprudence), TVJ, as stated by Justice Sykes in his judgement in the second phase of the trial, <EVENT eid="e25" class="OCCURRENCE">succeeded</EVENT> in <EVENT eid="e26" class="OCCURRENCE">establishing</EVENT> CVM s liability in large measure and was, therefore, <EVENT eid="e27" class="OCCURRENCE">entitled</EVENT> to full costs. 
 SPLIT TRIAL  
An interesting aspect of the approach <EVENT eid="e28" class="OCCURRENCE">adopted</EVENT> in this case was the <EVENT eid="e29" class="OCCURRENCE">holding</EVENT> of, in effect, two trials. In the words of Justice Sykes, in the earlier of the two judgments he <EVENT eid="e30" class="OCCURRENCE">delivered</EVENT>:  In intellectual property cases it is common for the trial to <EVENT eid="e31" class="OCCURRENCE">take</EVENT> place in two stages. The first stage <EVENT eid="e32" class="OCCURRENCE">deals</EVENT> with liability, and if there is liability, then the second stage deals with the remedy.  
 
Justice Sykes then <EVENT eid="e33" class="OCCURRENCE">went</EVENT> on to <EVENT eid="e34" class="OCCURRENCE">set</EVENT> a <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-09">September</TIMEX3> date for the second phase of the trial. 
 DAMAGES  amp; ADDITIONAL DAMAGES  
Interestingly, both  Damages and Additional Damages  were <EVENT eid="e35" class="OCCURRENCE">awarded</EVENT> to TVJ in this case, notwithstanding the submissions of Queen s Counsel Charles Piper, for CVM, for only nominal damages to be <EVENT eid="e36" class="OCCURRENCE">awarded</EVENT>. 
 
In the view of Justice Sykes, the only legitimate way for CVM to have <EVENT eid="e37" class="OCCURRENCE">gained</EVENT> access to the material <EVENT eid="e38" class="OCCURRENCE">used</EVENT> in its  Return to the Nest  programme, and in other infringing uses, was by <EVENT eid="e39" class="OCCURRENCE">paying</EVENT> for a <EVENT eid="e40" class="OCCURRENCE">licence</EVENT> from TVJ. 
 
Having, therefore, <EVENT eid="e41" class="I_STATE">considered</EVENT> the expert evidence of Oliver McIntosh, CEO of SportsMax, as to how such licences were <EVENT eid="e42" class="OCCURRENCE">priced</EVENT> and <EVENT eid="e43" class="OCCURRENCE">marketed</EVENT> in the industry, Justice Sykes then <EVENT eid="e44" class="OCCURRENCE">went</EVENT> on to <EVENT eid="e45" class="I_ACTION">hold</EVENT> that CVM was to <EVENT eid="e46" class="OCCURRENCE">pay</EVENT> TVJ US$85,975.00 by way of damages. 
 
The sum in question <EVENT eid="e47" class="OCCURRENCE">represented</EVENT> a 50/50 share of the US$172,750.00 cost <EVENT eid="e48" class="OCCURRENCE">paid</EVENT> by TVJ for the rights in question and to <EVENT eid="e49" class="OCCURRENCE">bring</EVENT> them to Jamaica. 
 
Justice Sykes then <EVENT eid="e50" class="OCCURRENCE">went</EVENT> on to award  additional damages  in favour of TVJ. 
 
In Paragraph 51 of the judgment, Justice Sykes states:  Section 32 (2) of the Copyright Act, <EVENT eid="e51" class="REPORTING">permits</EVENT> an award of additional damages <EVENT eid="e52" class="OCCURRENCE">having</EVENT> regard to (a) the benefit accruing to the defendant; (b) the flagrancy of the infringement and (c) all other material considerations. It is this court s <EVENT eid="e53" class="OCCURRENCE">considered</EVENT> opinion that additional damages are in order. The conduct of CVM can properly be <EVENT eid="e54" class="OCCURRENCE">described</EVENT> as deliberate and calculated risk <EVENT eid="e55" class="OCCURRENCE">taking</EVENT>.  [emphasis added] 
 
In the view of Justice Sykes, CVM s breach of TVJ s rights in the World Championships programme <EVENT eid="e56" class="OCCURRENCE">went</EVENT> beyond a mere breach. It was flagrant. 
 
The words of Sykes at Paragraph 65 of the <EVENT eid="e57" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT> judgment are particularly strident: 
 
 The Return to the Nest programme <EVENT eid="e58" class="OCCURRENCE">made</EVENT> no <EVENT eid="e59" class="I_STATE">pretence</EVENT> at <EVENT eid="e60" class="REPORTING">reporting</EVENT> current events. It was not a news programme. It was an audacious taking and <EVENT eid="e61" class="OCCURRENCE">using</EVENT> of exclusive licence protected material, which <EVENT eid="e62" class="OCCURRENCE">continued</EVENT> despite verbal and written complaints from TVJ ... . It was deliberate, calculated risk <EVENT eid="e63" class="OCCURRENCE">taking</EVENT>. There was no <EVENT eid="e64" class="OCCURRENCE">deceit</EVENT>. There was no <EVENT eid="e65" class="OCCURRENCE">dishonesty</EVENT>. Nonetheless, the breach was flagrant. [emphasis added] 
 
Having <EVENT eid="e66" class="OCCURRENCE">determined</EVENT> that CVM s breach was flagrant, Justice Sykes, therefore, <EVENT eid="e67" class="OCCURRENCE">went</EVENT> on to award US$40,000.00 in additional damages to TVJ. 
 COSTS  
Georgia Gibson Henlin, Queens Counsel, who <EVENT eid="e68" class="OCCURRENCE">represented</EVENT> TVJ, also <EVENT eid="e69" class="OCCURRENCE">persuaded</EVENT> the court with her submissions on costs. 
 
Although TVJ had not <EVENT eid="e70" class="OCCURRENCE">succeeded</EVENT> in every single instance of breach <EVENT eid="e71" class="OCCURRENCE">claimed</EVENT>, Gibson Henlin <EVENT eid="e72" class="OCCURRENCE">argued</EVENT> that there should be no <EVENT eid="e73" class="OCCURRENCE">deduction</EVENT> of costs for failure on some issues, but rather, that full costs should be <EVENT eid="e74" class="OCCURRENCE">awarded</EVENT> to TVJ since it had won  the lion s share  of the issues and <EVENT eid="e75" class="STATE">was</EVENT> the party that had been <EVENT eid="e76" class="OCCURRENCE">ruled</EVENT> entitled to damages. 
 
While Justice Sykes <EVENT eid="e77" class="I_ACTION">agreed</EVENT> with Henlin Gibson that TVJ was <EVENT eid="e78" class="OCCURRENCE">entitled</EVENT> to full costs, he <EVENT eid="e79" class="OCCURRENCE">fell</EVENT> just short of <EVENT eid="e80" class="OCCURRENCE">ordering</EVENT> same as the judge <EVENT eid="e81" class="OCCURRENCE">ruled</EVENT> that an additional day had been <EVENT eid="e82" class="OCCURRENCE">added</EVENT> to the second phase of the trial because TVJ had <EVENT eid="e83" class="I_ACTION">failed</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e84" class="OCCURRENCE">organise</EVENT> itself in a particular instance. 
 
While CVM has <EVENT eid="e85" class="OCCURRENCE">appealed</EVENT> the judgments, the case represents a treasure trove for media practitioners, intellectual property lawyers, and generally, for anyone who republishes copyrighted material. 
 
Kudos to Justice Sykes for his industry in concluding the two phases of the trial quickly and delivering written judgments.
