Transaction must be <EVENT eid="e140" class="OCCURRENCE">enter</EVENT> with profit motive, though profit need not be in fact earned. In this case it was <EVENT eid="e141" class="I_STATE">held</EVENT> that when a person <EVENT eid="e142" class="OCCURRENCE">carry</EVENT> on business is <EVENT eid="e143" class="OCCURRENCE">required</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e144" class="OCCURRENCE">sale</EVENT> of fixed assets and discarded goods then he is not constitute business because he does not <EVENT eid="e145" class="OCCURRENCE">carry</EVENT> on business of selling of fixed assets. To <EVENT eid="e146" class="OCCURRENCE">override</EVENT> this <EVENT eid="e147" class="OCCURRENCE">decision</EVENT> and <EVENT eid="e148" class="OCCURRENCE">cover</EVENT> more transaction in tax net definition of business is <EVENT eid="e149" class="OCCURRENCE">expended</EVENT> . a.

An individual buys a car for personal use and after <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="X">a</TIMEX3> year <EVENT eid="e176" class="OCCURRENCE">sells</EVENT> it to a car dealer. Will the transaction be a supply in terms of MGL? Give reasons for the answer. Ans. No, because supply is not made by the <EVENT eid="e177" class="OCCURRENCE">individual</EVENT> in the course or furtherance of business. Further, no input tax credit was admissible on such car at the time of its <EVENT eid="e178" class="OCCURRENCE">acquisition</EVENT> as it was <EVENT eid="e179" class="OCCURRENCE">meant</EVENT> for non business use. The Term Business has been <EVENT eid="e180" class="OCCURRENCE">defined</EVENT> by sec <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="X">2</TIMEX3> (77) of GST Act, to <EVENT eid="e181" class="OCCURRENCE">constitute</EVENT> a <EVENT eid="e182" class="OCCURRENCE">transaction</EVENT> as a supply the business should be must.
