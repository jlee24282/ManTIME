<TITLE>2017 Audi Q7: The pleasures of the pricier people mover</TITLE>


<TEXT>
The German occupation of my Los Angeles neighborhood <EVENT eid="e1" class="ASPECTUAL">began</EVENT> with the SUVs. 

Driveways once <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">filled</EVENT> with Honda Accords, Toyota Camrys, and vintage Volvo station wagons <EVENT eid="e3" class="I_ACTION">began</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">sprout</EVENT> BMW X3s and X5s and Audi Q3s and Q5s. 

Though I myself had been part of an earlier wave of gentrification, when I <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">moved</EVENT> into the area in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="198X">the 1980s</TIMEX3>, I was hypocritically <EVENT eid="e6" class="I_STATE">suspicious</EVENT> of these new interlopers. 

Who were they? What did they want? And why did they all <EVENT eid="e7" class="I_ACTION">drive</EVENT> these overdressed, overpriced pumped-up German cars? 

It wasn't until I <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE">drove</EVENT> and <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE">reviewed</EVENT> a few that I <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE">understood</EVENT>. Whatever their motivations for <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE">buying</EVENT> these vehicles - Teutonic pride, conspicuous consumption, or antipathy for automobiles of American or Japanese provenance - the vehicles were terrific. 

Audi's Q7 is the company's flagship SUV. A three-row seven-seater, the Q7 comes standard with a raft of technological appurtenances that make it a pleasure to <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE">drive</EVENT>. 

The drive train <EVENT eid="e13" class="REPORTING">comprises</EVENT> Audi's 3.0-liter V-6 gasoline engine (a 2.0-liter version is also available) <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE">mated</EVENT> to Audi's 8-speed "Tiptronic" transmission. The engine makes an impressive 333 horsepower and 325 pound feet of torque - more than enough to <EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE">make</EVENT> this 5,000-pound machine nimble in traffic as well as stable on the highway. 

The weight isn't hard to <EVENT eid="e16" class="OCCURRENCE">explain</EVENT>. Standard on the Q7 are wide, comfortable, heated seats, leather-bound and 8-way adjustable; a two-panel panoramic sunroof; power tail gate; roof rails; rollover bars; folding third-row seats; three-zone climate control; and a healthy array of front, side, and head curtain air bags. 

The model I <EVENT eid="e17" class="OCCURRENCE">drove</EVENT>, which <EVENT eid="e18" class="OCCURRENCE">kicked</EVENT> the $55,750 MSRP up to $85,425, also <EVENT eid="e19" class="OCCURRENCE">included</EVENT> the Prestige, Luxury, Adaptive Chassis, Driver Assistance, and Towing packages. 

Those <EVENT eid="e20" class="OCCURRENCE">enabled</EVENT>, among other things, four-wheel steering; adaptive air suspension; adaptive cruise control; lane-departure warning; Audi's "traffic sign recognition" system; a heads-up dashboard display; and many other comfort, convenience, and safety features - though the full-size spare that many drivers expect was not <EVENT eid="e21" class="OCCURRENCE">included</EVENT>. 

The result was a sublime driving experience. The four-wheel steering, paddle shifters and drive modes, which included a sporty "sport" setting, <EVENT eid="e22" class="OCCURRENCE">gave</EVENT> the big SUV a light, lithe feeling around town and on curvy canyon roads. 

The interior was so elegant, refined, and quiet that the sharp acceleration <EVENT eid="e23" class="OCCURRENCE">allowed</EVENT> by the big torquey engine <EVENT eid="e24" class="OCCURRENCE">seemed</EVENT> almost ill-mannered. 

In sport setting, the vehicle <EVENT eid="e25" class="I_ACTION">tended</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e26" class="OCCURRENCE">lurch</EVENT> a bit when <EVENT eid="e27" class="OCCURRENCE">pushed</EVENT> hard, <EVENT eid="e28" class="OCCURRENCE">giving</EVENT> it a slightly unstable feeling when <EVENT eid="e29" class="OCCURRENCE">accelerating</EVENT> from a stop or out of a slow corner. 

All that power and fast forward motion mean, alas, pretty poor fuel economy. Like many SUVs, this one gets only a combined 21 miles per gallon <EVENT eid="e30" class="OCCURRENCE">driving</EVENT> on city streets and highways. The dashboard readout <EVENT eid="e31" class="I_ACTION">suggested</EVENT> that my lead-footed <EVENT eid="e32" class="OCCURRENCE">driving pushed</EVENT> that number quite a bit lower. 

But my goodness is it comfortable. The driver and passenger seats are a marvel of ergonomic pleasure. The leg- and headroom in the second and third rows was Business Class impressive. The push-button system that makes the third-row seats disappear <EVENT eid="e33" class="OCCURRENCE">creates</EVENT> a lot of storage room, too. Audi <EVENT eid="e34" class="OCCURRENCE">puts</EVENT> the total storage room, with seats folded, at 71.6 cubic feet. That should be room enough for five golf bags - and five golfers. 

On the outside, the Q7 isn't very distinguished. But, what SUVs are? 

To my eye, they almost all have what a friend of mine <EVENT eid="e35" class="I_STATE">used</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e36" class="OCCURRENCE">call</EVENT> the "pregnant hamster" look - sporty at the front, but rather thick in the middle and the behind.
