<TITLE>ICYMI AFCON Match Day 13: Ondoas heroics seals Cameroon semi-final berth</TITLE>


<TEXT>
The business end of the African Nations Cup <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">kicked</EVENT> off on <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TEV">Saturday evening</TIMEX3> with <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-Q1">the first quarter</TIMEX3> final set in the Gabonese capital Libreville A fierce Burkina Faso side took on a technically sound Tunisia The North Africans had surprised everyone as they played an exciting brand of football throughout the tournament

It was a bright start with both teams looking to get onto the front foot The Burkinabe had a glorious chance to open the scoring but Prejuce Nakoulma scuffed his effort high and wide They continued to grow in confidence and Bertrand Traore almost grabbed the opener But the Chelsea Academy graduates shot could only skim the top of the crossbar As the half time whistle approached it was the Lions of Carthage who took aim for the elusive goal but the ball went agonisingly wide off the far post Neither team could break the deadlock in what was a tightly contested opening half The second half was a more open encounter The Stallions looked the livelier of the two sides and threatened the Tunisian defence but they <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">lacked</EVENT> the decisive final ball It was substitute Aristide Bances free kick <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="PXM">10 minutes</TIMEX3> before the end of the match which saw the deadlock broken The former Chippa United player had only been on the pitch for <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="X">four minutes</TIMEX3> before <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">sending</EVENT> the ball whistling into the bottom corner of the Tunisian net Bance was an inspired substitution by Burkinabe coach Paulo Duarte as <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="PXM">minutes later</TIMEX3> he was denied a <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="X">second</TIMEX3> goal by the post

The Tunisians knew they had to throw caution to the wind as they went in search of the equaliser However it was a blistering Burkina Faso counter attack in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="X">the 83rd minute</TIMEX3> that saw the North Africans crash out Nakoulma calmly slotted the ball into an open net after beating Tunisian goalkeeper Aymen Mathlouthi who had found himself in no mans land With the final whistle blown the West Africans booked their place in the semi-final

The second game of the night was a mammoth encounter when Cameroon took on tournament favourites Senegal The crowd at the Stade de Franceville were in for a tantalising affair as the two Lions of African football fought valiantly The opening stanza was a tightly fought physical contest The Senegalese looked the more confident of the two teams as Cameroon were content to play on the counter attack Chances were few and far between and with the half finely balanced and neither team able to grab the game by the scruff of the neck

The second half was a more open affair but Senegal continued to dominate The Indomitable Lions defence stood resolute throughout the half Cameroonian keeper Fabrice Ondoa denied Stoke City forward Mame Biram Diouf from point blank range The four time Afcon champions showed they werent out of the contest when Benjamin Moukandjo found himself in space but Diallo in the Senegalese goal was equal to the task

REVEALED The Nations Cup Passmasters

As the final whistle approached the Teranga Lions displayed a look of disbelief as the plucky Cameroonians survived the onslaught of Senegalese pressure Extra time would be needed as the two African giants could not be separated after <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="X">90</TIMEX3> minutes

Both teams began to show signs of fatigue in the first half of extra time as another <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="X">fifteen minutes</TIMEX3> of immense defending saw the Indomitable Lions remain in the game On the stroke of half time Cameroonian Jacques Zoua found himself in space but his shot was superbly saved by impervious Diallo

The second half was nail-biting but neither team could grab the elusive goal as the game was destined to be decided by a penalty shootout The dreaded Penalty shootout saw Sadio Manes penalty saved by the superb 21 year-old Fabrice Ondoa Cameroons Vincent Abubakar scored the winning penalty as Cameroon progressed into the semi-finals
