<TITLE>Commentary: Can Trump reconcile populist aims with establishment means?</TITLE>

is a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester and an adjunct professor of economics at Villanova University 

The <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3> election season officially <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">came</EVENT> to a close with the <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">inauguration</EVENT> of Donald Trump as our 45th president. What a season it was. Even before the primaries were over, we were already <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">grasping</EVENT> at historical precedents from previous elections just to <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">come</EVENT> to grips with what was <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">happening</EVENT> before our eyes, and what our collective future could <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">look</EVENT> like. 

This is especially true among economists, as we have the unenviable task of <EVENT eid="e7" class="I_ACTION">trying</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE">predict</EVENT> the economic future based upon this election. 

Some pundits <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE">pointed</EVENT> to examples as recent as Ronald Reagan's victory in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="1980">1980</TIMEX3>, while others go back as far as <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="1828">1828</TIMEX3>, when Andrew Jackson <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE">won</EVENT> what probably stands as the ugliest mudslinging match of the pre-Twitter era. What most of these previous examples have in common with each other and with <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3> is a healthy dose of populism. 

In fact, you could even <EVENT eid="e11" class="REPORTING">say</EVENT> that <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3> had a double dose of populism, with both Trump and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE">running</EVENT> decidedly antiestablishment campaigns fueled by underlying populist sentiments. 

Granted, these are two very distinct movements, but they both <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE">speak</EVENT> to the same truth, just in different ways. After all, what makes populist movements so popular in the first place is that in most cases they are based in at least some truth. Often it's an incomplete truth, but truth all the same. 

The truth underlying these movements in the <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3> campaign was that the gap between the haves and have-nots has <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE">grown</EVENT> larger, and too many Americans feel left behind. What the <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3> election <EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE">reminded</EVENT> us, though, was that you can have two very different reactions to the same truth. 

For the Trump movement, the reaction was protectionism. 

For the Sanders movement, the reaction was socialism. 

The question remains, however: Is populism ultimately good or bad for the economy, and what will it <EVENT eid="e16" class="OCCURRENCE">mean</EVENT> to America over <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="P4Y">the next four years</TIMEX3>? 

My go-to answer as a two-handed economist is: It depends. 

The results of unadulterated populism can be very bad, including a <EVENT eid="e17" class="OCCURRENCE">devolution</EVENT> into any number of other "isms" incompatible with liberal democracy. At its extreme, populism is essentially mob rule. 

It's what the Founding Fathers <EVENT eid="e18" class="I_STATE">hoped</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e19" class="OCCURRENCE">avoid</EVENT> when they <EVENT eid="e20" class="OCCURRENCE">established</EVENT> a republican government in which the people were <EVENT eid="e21" class="OCCURRENCE">represented</EVENT> by wise, <EVENT eid="e22" class="I_ACTION">learned</EVENT> representatives <EVENT eid="e23" class="OCCURRENCE">advocating</EVENT> and <EVENT eid="e24" class="OCCURRENCE">governing</EVENT> on behalf of the people. To <EVENT eid="e25" class="OCCURRENCE">head</EVENT> off autocracy, the opposite of unadulterated populism, the Founding Fathers <EVENT eid="e26" class="OCCURRENCE">made</EVENT> those same representatives directly answerable to the people. 

American government is designed so that those two groups cannot <EVENT eid="e27" class="OCCURRENCE">operate</EVENT> independently of one another, at least not for very long. The representatives <EVENT eid="e28" class="OCCURRENCE">need</EVENT> the people, and the people need their representatives. When that relationship breaks down, bad things can <EVENT eid="e29" class="OCCURRENCE">happen</EVENT>. Particularly, when the establishment <EVENT eid="e30" class="OCCURRENCE">loses</EVENT> its ear for the concerns of everyday Americans, populist movements can <EVENT eid="e31" class="OCCURRENCE">arise</EVENT>. 

But does that make populism good or bad? Certainly unadulterated populism is bad, but so is unadulterated elitism. Both a $15-per-hour federal minimum wage and a trade war with China would be <EVENT eid="e32" class="OCCURRENCE">damaging</EVENT> to our economy. But the fact that both of those populist proposals from opposite ends of the political spectrum are even <EVENT eid="e33" class="OCCURRENCE">making</EVENT> their way into everyday conversation is a sign to the more moderate political mainstream to <EVENT eid="e34" class="OCCURRENCE">refocus</EVENT> their efforts onto the concerns of the average American. 

Populism is a check on elitism in the same way that the people are a check on their elected officials. The <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3> election <EVENT eid="e35" class="OCCURRENCE">reminded</EVENT> us of too many ugly truths still prevalent in the United States. Those truths have <EVENT eid="e36" class="REPORTING">manifested</EVENT> themselves in populist movements that have <EVENT eid="e37" class="OCCURRENCE">garnered</EVENT> the <EVENT eid="e38" class="OCCURRENCE">attention</EVENT> of every elected official in the United States. The encouraging thing <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2016">about 2016</TIMEX3> is that it <EVENT eid="e39" class="OCCURRENCE">reaffirmed</EVENT> the ability of everyday people to <EVENT eid="e40" class="OCCURRENCE">get</EVENT> the establishment's attention, even with all the money in the world <EVENT eid="e41" class="OCCURRENCE">working</EVENT> against them. 

So even if none of the specific policy measures <EVENT eid="e42" class="OCCURRENCE">put</EVENT> forth by the more extreme populist movements on both sides of the political spectrum are actually <EVENT eid="e43" class="OCCURRENCE">enacted</EVENT>, the fact that they are being <EVENT eid="e44" class="OCCURRENCE">discussed</EVENT> is a victory for the populists, and America, in and of itself. 

President Trump, as a newcomer the likes of which the Oval Office has never before <EVENT eid="e45" class="PERCEPTION">seen</EVENT>, has the potential to <EVENT eid="e46" class="OCCURRENCE">play</EVENT> a unique role in reconciling populist aims with establishment means. Establishment forces in Congress, of both parties, have the potential to <EVENT eid="e47" class="OCCURRENCE">refocus</EVENT> mainstream political arguments toward the most pressing concerns of everyday Americans. If the so-called political establishment can <EVENT eid="e48" class="OCCURRENCE">use</EVENT> 2016 as a wake-up call instead of a call to arms, it might be just what we <EVENT eid="e49" class="I_ACTION">needed</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e50" class="OCCURRENCE">awaken</EVENT> us from the floundering status quo.
