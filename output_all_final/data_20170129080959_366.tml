<TITLE>Pink Camels and Floating Grannies hits the shelves</TITLE>


<TEXT>
The story is about an over-active imagination little girl, called Monkey, who <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">celebrates</EVENT> her birthday <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DURATION" value="PXW">weekend</TIMEX3> with her grandparents. There is no magical world, unified rings, or announcements of royal blood lines and treasure hunts, <EVENT eid="e2" class="REPORTING">says</EVENT> author, Celeste Beckerling. 
 
This is just a good, old-fashion, laugh out-loud story, <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">aimed</EVENT> at children who have a good sense of humour. The story <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">follows</EVENT> Monkey as she goes on outings with her rather loud, robust, and ridiculous family. Her Grandmother <EVENT eid="e5" class="I_STATE">manages</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">get</EVENT> strangers doing warm-ups with her Cecilia Forest, her Granddad <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE">tells</EVENT> her how he <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE">lost</EVENT> his finger by digging in his noise and her brother <EVENT eid="e9" class="I_STATE">insists</EVENT> on doing terrible magic. 
 
These are things that really <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE">happened</EVENT> in my childhood! Celeste laughs. I have <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE">added</EVENT> a lot of poetic license and mixed it up a little, but the truth is my Granddad really did <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE">tell</EVENT> me his finger got <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE">stuck</EVENT> in his noise and they had to <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE">chop</EVENT> it off! 
 
The book is available through Celestes online shop at Inspired Things  www.inspiredthings.co.za for R 95.
