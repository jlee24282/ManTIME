<TEXT>
 State Government Co-operative Loans Scheme <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">assists</EVENT> new infrastructure projects for Geraldton-based western rock lobster processor and exporter  
The Geraldton Fishermen's Co-operative Ltd has <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">secured</EVENT> a $3.5 million loan through the State Government's Co-operative Loan Scheme to <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">build</EVENT> an 80-tonne live lobster holding facility at Welshpool to facilitate increased exports to China. 
 
Agriculture and Food Minister Mark Lewis <EVENT eid="e4" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT> that as Western Australia's biggest rock lobster processor, the Liberal National Government <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">recognised</EVENT> the importance of the Geraldton Co-operative to the economy of both the Mid-West and the State. 
 
"This scheme has <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">enabled</EVENT> this Geraldton-based processor and exporter to <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE">build</EVENT> vital infrastructure to further <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE">grow</EVENT> premium western rock lobster exports," Mr Lewis <EVENT eid="e9" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT>. 
 
"The facility being <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE">built</EVENT> by the co-operative in Welshpool will be Australia's biggest rock lobster tank holding facility, and will <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE">facilitate</EVENT> air freight of fresh rock lobster into China to <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE">reduce</EVENT> the time from 'catch to plate'. 
 
"A new warehouse with lobster holding tanks has also been <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE">established</EVENT> in the Guangdong Province in China to <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE">assist</EVENT> with this growing market." 
 
The Minister <EVENT eid="e15" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT> producer-based co-operatives <EVENT eid="e16" class="OCCURRENCE">made</EVENT> an important <EVENT eid="e17" class="OCCURRENCE">contribution</EVENT> to the economic <EVENT eid="e18" class="OCCURRENCE">development</EVENT> of regional communities and the State. 
 
"The scheme <EVENT eid="e19" class="OCCURRENCE">facilitates</EVENT> the growth and <EVENT eid="e20" class="OCCURRENCE">development</EVENT> of established co-operatives through the <EVENT eid="e21" class="OCCURRENCE">purchase</EVENT> of assets or capital items," he <EVENT eid="e22" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT>. 
 
"A co-operative loan gives businesses, such as the Geraldton Fishermen's Co-operative, the ability to <EVENT eid="e23" class="OCCURRENCE">adapt</EVENT> to current global market requirements." 
 
Loans through the scheme allow co-operatives to <EVENT eid="e24" class="OCCURRENCE">claim</EVENT> a tax deduction on the principal repayments of the loan together with the usual taxation deductions of interest and fees under the Income Tax Assessment Act. 
 
"The Co-operative Loan Scheme has <EVENT eid="e25" class="OCCURRENCE">approved</EVENT> a range of loans to eligible Western Australian co-operatives totalling $75.8 million since its <EVENT eid="e26" class="OCCURRENCE">establishment</EVENT> in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2004">2004</TIMEX3>," Mr Lewis <EVENT eid="e27" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT>. 
 
"Sweeter Banana Co-operative and the WA Meat Marketing Co-operative are also currently <EVENT eid="e28" class="OCCURRENCE">accessing</EVENT> loans through this scheme." 
 
Western rock lobster is a sought-after ecologically sustainable product, with exports from WA worth $443 million in 2014-15.
