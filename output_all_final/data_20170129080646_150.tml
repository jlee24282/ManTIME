On <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-20">Jan. 20</TIMEX3>, an event was <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">held</EVENT> at the Vienna Community Building to honor one of Wood Countys finest citizens, Mr. Clyde Brewer, who has been <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">suffering</EVENT> from a long and egregious illness. Over 175 people <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">gathered</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">honor</EVENT> a man who has <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">given</EVENT> most of his life to the Wood County Schools as a teacher and coach. Many of you may <EVENT eid="e6" class="I_STATE">remember</EVENT> Coach Brewer as a head boys basketball coach from <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="1982">1982 to 2008</TIMEX3>. He <EVENT eid="e7" class="STATE">has</EVENT> an outstanding record, and <EVENT eid="e8" class="I_ACTION">helped</EVENT> many athletes get scholarships, mature and become fine young men in the community. The event was <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE">emceed</EVENT> by John Coe. The roasters were Dike Goff and Doug Kiger, who <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE">shared</EVENT> many amusing memories about Mr. Brewer. The stories <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE">covered</EVENT> the period from his days at Glenville State College to his time with Wood County Schools. 
  
Many people and businesses were <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE">involved</EVENT> in <EVENT eid="e13" class="I_ACTION">making</EVENT> this event a reality. Former delegate Tom Azinger and Mr. Jim Hameric, former AD at Parkersburg High School, <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE">worked</EVENT> very hard <EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE">promoting</EVENT> the event. Colombos Restaurant <EVENT eid="e16" class="I_ACTION">provided</EVENT> the meat; Jim Oppe from Foodland <EVENT eid="e17" class="OCCURRENCE">provided</EVENT> the utensils, and the local Pepsi Cola Company <EVENT eid="e18" class="OCCURRENCE">provided</EVENT> the drinks. The Great Steak Grill in the Grand Central Mall <EVENT eid="e19" class="OCCURRENCE">donated</EVENT> the bread and the manpower to <EVENT eid="e20" class="I_ACTION">help serve</EVENT> the dinner. The food was <EVENT eid="e21" class="OCCURRENCE">prepared</EVENT> by Officer Chris Jackson, a state trooper for the West Virginia State Police. 
 
People <EVENT eid="e22" class="OCCURRENCE">came</EVENT> from as far away as Mingo and McDowell counties to <EVENT eid="e23" class="OCCURRENCE">attend</EVENT> Clydes roast. Mayor Joyce and Mayor Rapp were in attendance as well as a state senator and two circuit judges. The outpouring of respect and honor for this man shows what a compassionate and generous community we live in. We should all be happy that we <EVENT eid="e24" class="STATE">live</EVENT> in the Mid Ohio Valley that honors and respects those who have <EVENT eid="e25" class="I_ACTION">worked</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e26" class="OCCURRENCE">make</EVENT> our community a better place in which to live. We are proud of our teachers, policemen and public servants. 
 
At the conclusion of the event, several door prizes were <EVENT eid="e27" class="OCCURRENCE">given</EVENT> away, one of which was a basketball <EVENT eid="e28" class="OCCURRENCE">signed</EVENT> by Bob Huggins of WVU, provided by Shane Lyons of WVU, who <EVENT eid="e29" class="STATE">was</EVENT> one of Clydes former players. The ball was <EVENT eid="e30" class="OCCURRENCE">won</EVENT> by Mike Hayden, who graciously <EVENT eid="e31" class="OCCURRENCE">donated</EVENT> it back to Mrs. Brewer. What a wonderful outpouring of support and appreciation this event was! 
 
It was my great pleasure to have <EVENT eid="e32" class="OCCURRENCE">worked</EVENT> many years with Clyde and his wife at Wood County Schools. My very best to you and your family.
