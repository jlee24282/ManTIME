<TITLE>New Exhibition Proposes Timber as Tomorrow's Smart Building Material</TITLE>


<TEXT>
For centuries, wood was civilization's primary construction material, but it <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">gave</EVENT> way to concrete, glass and steel and was largely relegated to flooring and interior paneling. An exhibition at the National Building Museum in Washington challenges that. It <EVENT eid="e2" class="I_STATE">suggests</EVENT> that <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-30">tomorrow</TIMEX3>'s buildings will or should be <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">constructed</EVENT> of wood. VOA's June Soh has more, in this report, <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">narrated</EVENT> by Carol Pearson.
