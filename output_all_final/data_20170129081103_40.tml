<TITLE>Many surprises await in tension-filled 'Split'</TITLE>


<TEXT>
If I had to <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">sum</EVENT> up M. Night Shyamalans Split in one sentence, I would <EVENT eid="e2" class="REPORTING">say</EVENT> it has personality. Lots of personality. 
 
The psychological thriller is about Casey, Claire and Marcia (Anya Taylor-Joy, Haley Lu Richardson and Jessica Sula), three high school girls who are <EVENT eid="e3" class="STATE">kidnapped</EVENT>. Their assailant is Kevin Crumb, a man with dissociative identity disorder, <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">resulting</EVENT> in 23 separate identities in one body. 
 
James McAvoy, who plays Kevin and Dennis, Patricia and the rest of Kevins alters shows off his extensive acting abilities as he plays multiple characters mostly through voice and body language alone. The switches in demeanor are almost reminiscent of a theater-character exercise, they are so quickly and drastically <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">portrayed</EVENT>. 
 
The dissociative personality disorder <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">isnt</EVENT> the twist of Split, though; <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE">revealed</EVENT> from the start, it is not one of the many surprises that await. 
 
Kevins <EVENT eid="e8" class="REPORTING">therapist</EVENT> Dr. Fletcher (Betty Buckley) sprinkles exposition by the handful throughout the movie, but also provides another layer of character that the film sorely <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE">needed</EVENT>. Out of the three kidnapped girls. Casey is the most <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE">fleshed</EVENT> out, her backstory being <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE">revealed</EVENT> through tasteful flashbacks. 
 
 Story <EVENT eid="e12" class="ASPECTUAL">continues</EVENT> below video

For the first half of the movie, tension was evenly balanced, the creeping confusion of the unknown perfectly <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE">interspersed</EVENT> with laughable moments. The second half was where it <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE">fell</EVENT> flat. Split <EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE">felt</EVENT> choppy and hurriedly <EVENT eid="e16" class="OCCURRENCE">borrowed</EVENT> from common horror movies. 
 
The movie is rated PG-13, yet <EVENT eid="e17" class="OCCURRENCE">presented</EVENT> its main actresses unnecessarily half-dressed for a good <EVENT eid="e18" class="OCCURRENCE">portion</EVENT> of the feature. I had high hopes for great character development, but whether it was too tight of a script or just bad writing, there was simply no room for growth. 
 
Yet the near absence of gore was a refreshing breath of air in the otherwise blood-soaked horror industry. An appropriately balanced score <EVENT eid="e19" class="OCCURRENCE">added</EVENT> to the atmosphere of Split, and good cinematography <EVENT eid="e20" class="OCCURRENCE">brought</EVENT> the tone of the movie to a suspenseful simmer. 
 
Overall, I would <EVENT eid="e21" class="REPORTING">say</EVENT> that Split is a film best for <EVENT eid="e22" class="OCCURRENCE">watching</EVENT> at home with friends and cheap pizza. The movie wasnt bad by any means, but as I <EVENT eid="e23" class="OCCURRENCE">watched</EVENT> the end credits <EVENT eid="e24" class="OCCURRENCE">roll</EVENT>, I <EVENT eid="e25" class="I_STATE">felt</EVENT> unsatisfied. 
 
The only explanation I can think of is that the hype surrounding Split was just too great, and I had mistakenly <EVENT eid="e26" class="OCCURRENCE">expected</EVENT> more from the film.
