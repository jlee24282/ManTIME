<TEXT>
To the editor: 
  
I have recently had some serious issues with home health care and receiving, good home health care for myself, and someone I take care of in my home. 
 
Many people dont <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">realize</EVENT> it, but that is what your governor is for. And the same with the attorney general. I <EVENT eid="e2" class="REPORTING">called</EVENT> a young man by the name of Dave Ward, and he <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">reached</EVENT> out for me to state agencies and <EVENT eid="e4" class="I_ACTION">helped</EVENT> me <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">get</EVENT> independent home health care taken care of. Thanks to him, Gov. John Kasich and Attorney General Mike DeWine, You truly <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">made</EVENT> a difference. If you have any issues, please reach out to state officials. Thats why they are here.
