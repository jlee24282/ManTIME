<TITLE>Dalgarn: Group that advocates for disabled, elderly seeks input and support from community</TITLE>


<TEXT>
Can you guess what the largest minority group is composed of in America? 
 
Is the countrys largest minority a race? 
 
No. It is the disabled. 
 
The reason its so big is the disability club is all-inclusive, <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">allowing</EVENT> anyone to <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">join</EVENT> and at any given time. 
 
As the countrys largest minority, comprising about 56.7 million people, the disabled population is highly underrepresented and underserved. 
 
Greeley is the hub in all of Weld County for aging populations and peoples with disability. 
 
In fact, the United States Census taken in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2010">2010</TIMEX3> <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">found</EVENT> 8.2 percent of people in Greeleys catchment area younger than age 65 identified as being <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">disabled</EVENT> while 10.7 percent of people older than age 65 <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">identified</EVENT> that way. 
 
This totals up to 18.9 percent of the entire population of Greeley in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010">2010</TIMEX3>. Roughly one in five people <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">represent</EVENT> this minority. 
 
Being <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE">aging</EVENT> and disabled  even after some great laws have been <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE">passed</EVENT>  still <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE">segregates</EVENT> us. Many members of this club, including me, saw the disparity and <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE">deprivation</EVENT> of our population, and we <EVENT eid="e11" class="I_ACTION">sought</EVENT> for better understanding. Thus, we <EVENT eid="e12" class="I_ACTION">created</EVENT> the Weld Advocacy Network on Disability. 
 
WAND seeks answers for affordable and accessible housing and <EVENT eid="e13" class="STATE">needs</EVENT> our help. 
 
WAND has been <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE">serving</EVENT> the disabled population for <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P14Y">14 years</TIMEX3> and has always been a place for anyone whos interested in helping the disabled or <EVENT eid="e15" class="STATE">has</EVENT> a disability themselves. 
 
WAND was <EVENT eid="e16" class="OCCURRENCE">created</EVENT> for many purposes.  First off, it was <EVENT eid="e17" class="OCCURRENCE">made</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e18" class="OCCURRENCE">create</EVENT> interaction among all community members and to have a place for all community members to <EVENT eid="e19" class="OCCURRENCE">voice</EVENT> public concern. 
 
In <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">the past</TIMEX3>, WAND has <EVENT eid="e20" class="OCCURRENCE">taken</EVENT> on some tough issues. One such instance is when it <EVENT eid="e21" class="OCCURRENCE">dealt</EVENT> with the public transit system. Working with a few key members who <EVENT eid="e22" class="OCCURRENCE">foresee</EVENT> safety, accessibility and efficiency, a panel was <EVENT eid="e23" class="OCCURRENCE">created</EVENT> and it continues these <EVENT eid="e24" class="OCCURRENCE">efforts</EVENT>. 
 
<TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> a new direction arises. 
 
WAND is well aware our housing situation is in despair. Many consumers <EVENT eid="e25" class="OCCURRENCE">show</EVENT> up in hopes of <EVENT eid="e26" class="OCCURRENCE">finding</EVENT> housing, yet they are <EVENT eid="e27" class="I_STATE">dismayed</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e28" class="OCCURRENCE">find</EVENT> a lack of resources or outrageous prices. 
 
We seek answers, understanding, data and input from others. 
 
If you know someone or are someone who <EVENT eid="e29" class="STATE">has</EVENT> a disability, or even if youre simply just interested in <EVENT eid="e30" class="OCCURRENCE">helping</EVENT> the cause, please <EVENT eid="e31" class="OCCURRENCE">come</EVENT> to our monthly WAND meeting. Your input is highly valuable in making changes. 
 
The <EVENT eid="e32" class="OCCURRENCE">meeting</EVENT> Takes Place <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-01-26">the fourth Thursday</TIMEX3> of each <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="PXM">month from noon</TIMEX3> to 1:30 p.m. at Connections for Independent Living, 1331 8th Ave. in Greeley. Snacks are <EVENT eid="e33" class="OCCURRENCE">provided</EVENT>. 
 
<EVENT eid="e34" class="OCCURRENCE">Receiving</EVENT> help from the people at connections for independent living 
 
The reason Connections for Independent Living exists is to <EVENT eid="e35" class="OCCURRENCE">help</EVENT> those with disabilities in Northern Colorado. 
 
It is located at <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="1331">1331</TIMEX3> 8th Ave. in Greeley. 
 
It not only <EVENT eid="e36" class="OCCURRENCE">helps</EVENT> Weld County residents, but residents of Morgan, Logan, Washington, Sedgwick, Yuma and Phillips counties, as well. 
 
One of the magical and inspiring promises it brings is a consumer-driven philosophy led by executive director Patricia Ziegler and all of the employees at Connections. 
 
This nonprofit strives to <EVENT eid="e37" class="OCCURRENCE">bring</EVENT> equal access and opportunities for <EVENT eid="e38" class="OCCURRENCE">disabled</EVENT> in housing, healthcare, transportation and education along with its core services of independent living skills training, information and referral, peer support, and self/system advocacy. Stop by or <EVENT eid="e39" class="OCCURRENCE">call</EVENT> at (970) 352-8682. 
 
 
 David Dalgarn is a Colorado native. He <EVENT eid="e40" class="I_ACTION">works</EVENT> at Connections for Independent Living where, as a team, they <EVENT eid="e41" class="I_ACTION">advocate</EVENT> for Northern Colorados disabled and aging populations. It is his <EVENT eid="e42" class="I_ACTION">pleasure</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e43" class="OCCURRENCE">serve</EVENT> Greeley and share what was so freely <EVENT eid="e44" class="OCCURRENCE">given</EVENT> to him.
