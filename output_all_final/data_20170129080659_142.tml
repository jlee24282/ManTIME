<TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>, <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">January 28, 2017</TIMEX3> 
 
DENVER — The new leader of the House Republicans isn’t <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">earning</EVENT> a lot of friends on the Western Slope. 
 
That’s because many people are upset that House Minority Leader Patrick Neville, R Castle Rock, didn’t <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">appoint</EVENT> his caucus’ newest member, Rep. Marc Catlin, R Montrose, to the House Agriculture, Livestock  amp; Natural Resources Committee. 
 
They <EVENT eid="e3" class="I_ACTION">considered</EVENT> it a no brainer that Catlin would <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">gain</EVENT> such an appointment. He is an undisputed expert in water issues, particularly on the Western Slope, 
 
“It’s just ridiculous,” <EVENT eid="e5" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT> Christian Reece, executive director of Club 20, a Western Slope advocacy group. “The committee and the House as a whole would <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">benefit</EVENT> greatly if they <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE">used</EVENT> his skills. One would <EVENT eid="e8" class="I_ACTION">think</EVENT> that appointments would be based on a legislator’s skill set. With attempts to <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE">implement</EVENT> the statewide water plan <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017">this year</TIMEX3>, it’s important to have a strong voice from the Western Slope on such a committee.” 
 
Instead of being <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE">appointed</EVENT> to the ag panel and the House Transportation Committee — as his predecessor, now Sen. Don Coram, R Montrose, was — Catlin was <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE">assigned</EVENT> to the House Public Health Care  amp; Human Services Committee and House Finance Committee. 
 
Catlin has no health care, social service or financial background. Instead, he is an acclaimed expert on water issues. 
 
His job outside of public service is as water rights development coordinator for Montrose County. He also is a former manager of the Uncompahgre Valley Water Users’ Association and a longtime member of the Colorado River Water Conservation District board of directors. 
 
Neville, who <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE">refused</EVENT> to be <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE">interviewed</EVENT> for this story, has sole discretion over what committees members of his caucus get. But because Republicans <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE">lost</EVENT> seats in the House in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3>’s elections, that also <EVENT eid="e15" class="I_ACTION">meant</EVENT> there are fewer seats in House committees for GOP members. 
 
As a result, coveted committees such as agriculture and transportation <EVENT eid="e16" class="ASPECTUAL">end</EVENT> up going to more senior members. 
 
Still, not including someone such as Catlin is a hard pill for Western Slope legislators to <EVENT eid="e17" class="OCCURRENCE">swallow</EVENT> because of his vast knowledge on water law, especially when considering who else is on the panel, those lawmakers <EVENT eid="e18" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT>. 
 
The 13 member committee is <EVENT eid="e19" class="OCCURRENCE">dominated</EVENT> by lawmakers who hail not just from the Front Range, but from the South Platte River Basin. That’s the region that has the highest population and the greatest need for more municipal water supplies. 
 
The rest <EVENT eid="e20" class="OCCURRENCE">break</EVENT> down to two for the Colorado River basin on the Western Slope, two in the Arkansas River basin in southeast Colorado, and one in the Rio Grande River basin in the San Luis Valley. 
 
That means when water issues — which historically divide along basin lines rather than political ones — <EVENT eid="e21" class="OCCURRENCE">come</EVENT> up for votes, the northern Front Range region out votes the other basins combined, 8 6. 
 
The Western Slope lawmakers on the panel are Reps. Yeulin Willett, R Grand Junction, and Diane Mitch Busch, D Steamboat Springs, both of whom <EVENT eid="e22" class="I_ACTION">agreed</EVENT> that Catlin’s voice on the panel would be <EVENT eid="e23" class="OCCURRENCE">welcomed</EVENT>. 
 
Chris Treese, executive director of the Colorado River Water Conservation District, <EVENT eid="e24" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT> the Western Slope <EVENT eid="e25" class="OCCURRENCE">deserves</EVENT> a greater voice on that committee because the bulk of the state’s water is located here. And someone like Catlin, who has more direct experience with water issues than Willett, an attorney, or Mitch Busch, whose background is in sociology, can <EVENT eid="e26" class="OCCURRENCE">speak</EVENT> more knowledgeably about the subject, Treese <EVENT eid="e27" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT>. 
 
“Marc’s whole life has been water, Marc’s family has been water, is water, and for the sake of the House ag committee and for the sake of the whole General Assembly, his expertise is being <EVENT eid="e28" class="OCCURRENCE">wasted</EVENT>,” he <EVENT eid="e29" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT>. “From the perspective of his district, the vacancy committee <EVENT eid="e30" class="OCCURRENCE">elected</EVENT> him in large measure because of that significant background, that natural resource, water specific background. I <EVENT eid="e31" class="I_STATE">know</EVENT> they are <EVENT eid="e32" class="I_STATE">disappointed</EVENT> that he is not being <EVENT eid="e33" class="OCCURRENCE">assigned</EVENT> in a way that’s consistent with the talents that he <EVENT eid="e34" class="OCCURRENCE">brings</EVENT> to the Legislature.” 
 
Montrose rancher Jay Jutten, a Republican, <EVENT eid="e35" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT> people like him <EVENT eid="e36" class="OCCURRENCE">look</EVENT> to their elected officials to <EVENT eid="e37" class="OCCURRENCE">represent</EVENT> them in far away Denver, and <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> is not so sure he’s <EVENT eid="e38" class="OCCURRENCE">getting</EVENT> that. 
 
“We’re over here in the back 40 and we <EVENT eid="e39" class="PERCEPTION">see</EVENT> the Front Range <EVENT eid="e40" class="OCCURRENCE">getting</EVENT> a lot of attention,” he <EVENT eid="e41" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT>. “The representation we get, we need them on those committees that are important to us. I’m not <EVENT eid="e42" class="REPORTING">saying</EVENT> that the committees Representative Catlin is on aren’t <EVENT eid="e43" class="STATE">important</EVENT>, but agriculture is huge, transportation is huge for the Western Slope.” 
 
Both Treese and Reece have <EVENT eid="e44" class="OCCURRENCE">sent</EVENT> letters to Neville in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent weeks</TIMEX3> <EVENT eid="e45" class="I_ACTION">asking</EVENT> him to <EVENT eid="e46" class="OCCURRENCE">reconsider</EVENT> Catlin’s appointments. Neville hasn’t yet <EVENT eid="e47" class="OCCURRENCE">responded</EVENT> to either. 
 
As a result, Reece <EVENT eid="e48" class="OCCURRENCE">sent</EVENT> a similar letter to other House Republican leaders, two of whom, Reps. Lori Saine of Dacono and Perry Buck of Windsor, sit on the ag committee. 
 
Coram, who <EVENT eid="e49" class="OCCURRENCE">replaced</EVENT> Sen. Ellen Roberts, R Durango, when she <EVENT eid="e50" class="OCCURRENCE">resigned</EVENT> her seat in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-12">December</TIMEX3>, <EVENT eid="e51" class="OCCURRENCE">creating</EVENT> the vacancy for Catlin, <EVENT eid="e52" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT> he’s been <EVENT eid="e53" class="OCCURRENCE">getting</EVENT> dozens of emails and telephone calls about the matter. 
 
Coram, who sat on the agriculture and transportation committees when he <EVENT eid="e54" class="OCCURRENCE">served</EVENT> in the House, was <EVENT eid="e55" class="OCCURRENCE">assigned</EVENT> to the Senate ag committee when he <EVENT eid="e56" class="OCCURRENCE">switched</EVENT> to the Senate. 
 
He <EVENT eid="e57" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT> he’s aghast at Neville’s assignments not only for the ag committee, but transportation, too. 
 
“<EVENT eid="e58" class="OCCURRENCE">Looking</EVENT> back at the ag committee for as long as I can <EVENT eid="e59" class="ASPECTUAL">remember going</EVENT> back to the ‘60s, there has never been a time a Western Slope Republican agricultural person has not <EVENT eid="e60" class="STATE">been</EVENT> on the committee,” Coram <EVENT eid="e61" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT>. “And there was never a time when there wasn’t a Western Slope Republican on the transportation committee.”
