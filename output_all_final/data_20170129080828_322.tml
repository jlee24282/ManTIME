<TITLE>The Colorado Rockies all-time team from Rocky Colavito to Brooks Robinson</TITLE>


<TEXT>
While reading Baseball Prospectuss top prospects list for the St. Louis Cardinals , they <EVENT eid="e1" class="I_ACTION">noted</EVENT> that there has never been a major-leaguer named Harrison before. But Cardinals prospect Harrison Bader could be the first. That is, if Rockies prospect Harrison Musgrave doesnt <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">beat</EVENT> him to it. (Theres another fun thing about Harrison Musgraves name that you can <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">read</EVENT> about in the Baseball Prospectus Annual <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> .) 
 
Baseball names are fun! Not only might we <EVENT eid="e4" class="PERCEPTION">see</EVENT> two Harrisons for the first time in major-league history this season, but Harrisons Bader and Musgrave could also soon be <EVENT eid="e5" class="STATE">eligible</EVENT> for an all-time presidential team lineup.
