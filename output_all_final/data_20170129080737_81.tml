<TITLE>When was the last time you patronized a business owned by an immigrant?</TITLE>


<TEXT>
Among the New England states, Rhode Island has the smallest percentage of immigrants who <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">make</EVENT> their living owning a business. Yet in Providence, the number of immigrant business owners <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">increased</EVENT> nearly 50 percent from <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2000">2000 to 2013</TIMEX3>, a city whose population is more than one-quarter immigrant. 
 
It is clear that more activity by immigrants would <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">translate</EVENT> into a more vital state economy, but it is not clear that the businesses owned by immigrants are <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">connecting</EVENT> with the main stream community. Have you <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">patronized</EVENT> a business <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">owned</EVENT> by immigrants recently?
