While B.C. battles the overdose crisis, the number of Canadian babies born with symptoms of addiction and withdrawal is on the rise. 
 
<EVENT eid="e1" class="REPORTING">According</EVENT> to the Canadian Institute for Health Information, there were almost 300 more babies born with Neo-natal Abstinence Syndrome across the country in the <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017">2015-2016 fiscal year</TIMEX3> than there were in the <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017">2012-2013 fiscal year</TIMEX3> (excluding Quebec, which did not have numbers available). 
 
Pediatrician and Senior scientist with the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences, Astrid Guttmann, <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">spoke</EVENT> to CKNW Weekend host Tim Dickert, <EVENT eid="e3" class="REPORTING">saying</EVENT> one reason why those numbers are up is because some mothers are <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">taking</EVENT> those drugs during their pregnancy. 
 
Weve been in Ontario, <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">tracking</EVENT> the numbers of babies that are born in withdrawal from opioids for <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">a few years now</TIMEX3>, and the numbers have been <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">increasing</EVENT> quite dramatically so about a five-fold <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE">increase</EVENT> in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P10Y">the last 10 years</TIMEX3>. 
 
Guttman <EVENT eid="e8" class="REPORTING">says</EVENT> now that theyre more aware of the symptoms of babies addicted to opioids, they know how to <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE">treat</EVENT> them while they <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE">experience</EVENT> withdrawal. 
 
By <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE">giving</EVENT> them a low dose of an, opioid and then just slowly <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE">weaning</EVENT> them off of it, theres a score that we <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE">give</EVENT> to babies based on how jittery they are. 
 
She <EVENT eid="e14" class="REPORTING">says</EVENT> theres not enough data to <EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE">show</EVENT> the long term physical effects for babies born with opioid withdrawls.
