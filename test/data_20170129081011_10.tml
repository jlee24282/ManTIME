Point Guards

Austin Rivers Clippers 57 percent owned in Yahoo! leagues  Rivers has been much better than Raymond Felton since Chris Paul went down and should keep rolling for about another month. While his dad, Doc Rivers, says hes open to trading his son, I still find it hard to believe that he would actually do it. But if it happens, his value would most likely take a hit, depending on where he lands. But as long as hes with the Clippers, he should continue to rack up points and 3-pointers. He was quiet in Saturdays ugly blowout loss to the Clippers with 10 points and six assists on 3-of-11 shooting, but played 38 minutes and was averaging 19.8 points, 4.4 assists and 3.0 3-pointers over his previous five games.

T.J. McConnell Sixers 41% - McConnells not a big scorer, but has been racking up assists at an alarming rate lately. He hit double digits in assists in three straight games before scoring 13 points with eight dimes on Friday. Hes starting for the Sixers and averaging 9.0 points, 2.8 rebounds, 9.4 assists and 1.6 steals on 53 percent shooting over his last five games. I wish he was a 3-point shooter, but hes not.

Matthew Dellavedova Bucks 30% - Delly took over the starting job from Malcolm Brogdon five games ago and is averaging 13.0 points, 5.4 assists, 0.8 steals and 1.8 3-pointers in 29 minutes a game over that stretch. Brogdon has more upside and talent, but Dellys putting up better numbers right now. Hes also had at least 14 points and six dimes in three of his last five games.

Raymond Felton Clippers 24% - Felton has bounced in and out of the starting lineup since Chris Paul went down and played just 17 minutes for two points and three assists on 1-of-3 shooting in Tuesdays loss to the Sixers. He bounced back on Saturday with 10 points, seven rebounds, five assists, a block and two 3-pointers on Saturday, and even played garbage time in a blowout loss because the Clippers simply dont have healthy points guards right now. Over his last five hes averaging 10 points, 4.0 rebounds, 4.4 assists, 0.6 steals and 1.2 3-pointers on 38 percent shooting. His shooting took a hit on Saturday when he hit just 3-of-12 shots, but hes getting enough minutes (27.8 in his last five) to make a fantasy dent, and his shooting should be better than this going forward. 

Malcolm Brogdon Bucks 55% - Brogdon lost his job to Dellavedova and had scored six or fewer points in three of his last four games before bouncing back with 11 points and five assists on Saturday, although he hit just 4-of-12 shots. Hes averaging just 7.0 points, 2.0 rebounds, 5.2 assists, 1.4 steals and just 0.2 3-pointers in his five games since being moved to the bench. Brogdon has plenty of time to reclaim the job or make a comeback, but as long as Dellys starting, things arent looking great for Brogdon. Editors Note: Golf is coming soon to FanDuel!

Dion Waiters Heat 58% - Waiters was at it again on Saturday with 17 points and seven assists, but hit just 1-of-9 3-pointers, or his line would have been a lot bigger. Waiters is averaging 25.2 points, 4.2 rebounds, 4.6 assists and 3.4 3-pointers over his last five games, knocking down 52 percent of his shots. Hell take a bit of a hit once Tyler Johnson is back from his shoulder injury, which should happen any day. Hell also get stung again by the return of Josh Richardson, but even with those guys lurking, Waiters is hot enough right now to be owned in all leagues. Just know that if you pick him up for the upcoming week, you probably missed the best five-game streak of his season.

Seth Curry Mavericks 49% - Curry looks like a full-time starter the rest of the way for the struggling Mavericks, has scored in double figures in six straight games, and is averaging 15 points, three rebounds, 1.4 assists, 1.2 steals and 2.4 3-pointers in 31.4 minutes per game over his last five. If he continues to start the rest of the season, Curry should be owned in a lot more leagues.

Iman Shumpert Cavaliers 28% - Shumpert had scored in double figures in six straight games before hitting just 2-of-8 shots for six points and three steals in Fridays win over the Nets. He was 0-for-5 from downtown in that one, but had hit at least two 3-pointers in each of his previous six games. Forget about Fridays dud and consider Shumpert a favorite to average around 15 points, 2.0 steals and close to 3.0 3-pointers going forward.

Gary Harris Nuggets 63% - Harris came through on Saturday with 15 points, eight rebounds, four assists, two steals and a 3-pointers, but the Suns typically give it up to opposing guards. Hes averaging 11 points, 3.2 rebounds, 2.0 assists, 0.8 steals and 1.2 3-pointers on 45 percent shooting over his last five games, but hed have a lot more fantasy appeal if Will Barton wasnt getting at least 20 minutes night.

Garrett Temple Kings 25% (and Arron Afflalo) - Im not a big Temple guy and theres really no one from the Kings that I love filling in for Rudy Gay, whos out for the season with a blown Achilles. But Temple appears to be the best of the bunch, getting 32 minutes with 8.0 points, 2.2 rebounds, 2.6 assists, 2.0 steals and 0.8 3-points on 34 percent shooting over his last five games. Teammate Arron Afflalo might be a better flier, as hes coming on and averaging 14 points, 1.3 rebounds, 2.3 assists and 3.0 3-pointers over his last three games, knocking down 9-of-15 shots in 34 minutes a night in the process.</TEXT>
