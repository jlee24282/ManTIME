Max Angelelli’s No. 10 Wayne Taylor Racing Cadillac DPi-V.R continues to lead the Rolex 24 at Daytona at half distance. 
 
The Italian has 85 seconds in hand over the No. 90 Visit Florida Racing Riley Mk. 30 Gibson of Rene Rast, with Christian Fittipaldi’s No. 5 Action Express Cadillac a further lap behind in third. 
 
After its accident in the tenth hour, the No. 22 Tequila Petron ESM Nissan Onroak DPi returned to the track in 36 th position overall and tenth in class, with Johannes van Overbeek at the wheel. 
 
In Prototype Challenge, the No. 38 Performance Tech Motorsports entry of Nicholas Boulle retains its four-lap lead over Gustavo Yacaman in the No. 20 BAR1 Motorsports car. 
 
In the worsening conditions, the Porsche 911 RSRs began to take control of the GTLM class, with the No. 912 car of Kevin Estre taking the lead from Patrick Pilet’s identical No. 911 car on lap 341. 
 
The best of the Ford GTs is still the No. 66 Ford car driven by Joey Hand, while Toni Vilander holds fourth in the No. 62 Risi Competizione Ferrari 488 GTE. 
 
Ford’s challenge was dented when Ryan Briscoe backed the No. 67 car into the wall on the exit of the Bus Stop, leaving six cars on the lead lap. 
 
Meanwhile in GT Daytona, Acura continues its early promise in first and sixth positions. 
 
The No. 86 NSX GT3 of Jeff Segal leads Connor De Phillippi’s No. 29 Land Motorsports Audi R8 LMS, while Katherine Legge remains in touch in the No. 93 Acura after taking over from Andy Lally.
