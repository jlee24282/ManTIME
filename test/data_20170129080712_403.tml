<TITLE>Media organisations: Media control bill must be aborted</TITLE>
<TEXT>At the Thai Journalists Associations headquarters, scores of media practitioners gathered to discuss over the controversial media regulation bill pushed by the media reform committee and would enter the NRSAs meeting Monday before being forwarded to the Cabinet for consideration. 
 
After a two-hour consulting, Thepchai Yong, president of The Thai Broadcast Journalists Association, represented the organisations to read the joint statement. 
 
The statement denounced the embattled bill as restricting press freedom rather than protecting it by opening way for state authority to interfere with the media affairs through the so-called professional media council. 
 
Besides having the direct impact on the press, such practice would also limit the publics freedom of expression and access of information, the statement read. 
 
The organisations called on the NRSA to drop the bill and review the necessity of such legislation. If not, they threatened to step up their measure against the bill and they insisted the media had been developing the system to self-regulation to ensure media responsibility and to meet with the publics changing demand.</TEXT>
