<TEXT type="str">It is reported that Fiorentina are ready to sign Martin Caceres, but still want proof of the Uruguayan&apos;s fitness before confirming the deal. 
 
The former Juventus man is currently a free agent, having left the Old Lady last summer. He has not played for a year, suffering an achilles injury during his final months in Turin before failing to find a new club following his release. 
 
According to various reports in Italian media, the 29-year-old is set to undergo a medical in Florence. While this is usually a routine procedure for any player completing a transfer, it is said the Viola will be keeping a watchful eye on Caceres&apos; physical condition. 
 
Terms for a contract have already been agreed between the two parties, but Fiorentina still have the option to cancel the deal should they not be satisfied with the results of the medical. 
 
Caceres, who has played for Spanish clubs Barcelona, Sevilla and Villarreal, has also been linked with Turkish side Trabzonspor.
