Paul Krato and Tony Dinh with Pour joined Tiffiany as this week’s guest co-hosts on the “Lafayette Food Junkie Show.” 
 
They discussed how Shake Shack lives up to the hype, preferences on chili/cheese fry toppings AND the recent phenomena of locally-owned restaurants taking jabs at chain restaurants on social media. 
 
Tony also touched on why he is not a fan of recent fusion combinations like the sushi burrito and pho-ritto.</content>
