<TITLE>Always a crowd pleaser</TITLE>
<TEXT>Buoyed by demand, one of South Africas most commercially successful comedians, Karou Charou, returns to Carnival City for another outrageously funny show.

This time he brings with him an entourage of Durban-based comedians for the Karou Charou Comedy Showcase.

On the bill for the show, on February 19, are Charou himself, Neville Pillay, Muthu Murugan and Shika Budhoo.

In November, last year, he achieved sold-out status when he featured a host of local Johannesburg-based comics.

This time he features some of the best comedic talent that Durban has to offer.

Headlining the show will be the living legend of Indian comedy, Muthu Murugan.

A household name, this comedian has a commanding stage presence and a career spanning three decades.

He combines laid-back humour with sharp wit to appeal to South Africas rainbow nation.

Always in demand, Murugan has toured both nationally and internationally during his career.

Budhoo, most famous as the voice of Mrs Singh Song on the Lotus FM drama series, has performed in a host of comedy shows, including the KWV Indian Comedy Tour, All Girls Jam, Stekkies Comedy Jam and Prof Gopauls Comedy show.

With her roots as an actress, she has perfected the art of comedy drama and will leave you in stitches with her role playing.

Lotus FMs breakfast jock, Pillay has, via his radio show, acquired a following both nationally and internationally.

An established comic on the local circuit, his comedic flair comes through strongly on his radio show, especially with his parodies, twisted tunes and prank calls.

On stage, with the mic in hand, Pillay relates Indian stories in hilarious fashion.

And the glue that binds the entire show together will be the enigmatic and charismatic Karou Charou.

With his zany costumes, dark glasses, bling and uniquely refreshing and interactive style, Charou is always a crowd pleaser.

The show takes place in the Mardi Gras Theatre at 3pm. Instagram
