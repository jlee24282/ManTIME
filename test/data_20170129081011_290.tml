<content type="str">KABUL, Jan. 29 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan security forces have destroyed six heroin labs, as the war-hit country struggled to fight the narcotics, said Defense Ministry on Sunday. 
 
The Afghan National Army&apos;s Special Forces carried out operations in Sangin and Naw Zad districts of southern Helmand province on Friday, destroying six heroin factories, it said in a statement posted on the ministry&apos;s website. 
 
Among the drugs and materials, 1,000 kg of morphine, over 16,000 kg of ammonium chloride, 277 barrels of a chemical substance which has been used in making heroin, were also destroyed, the statement added. 
 
&quot;One militant was killed and two others wounded as a result of the raids, which were conducted on confirmed tip-offs, and the security force also destroyed four vehicles, three motorcycles and six weighing scales,&quot; the statement noted. 
 
Helmand, notorious for poppy growing, is also a known Taliban stronghold. 
 
Some 4,800 tons of opium has been produced in Afghan provinces where government security forces had little presence in 2016, according to Afghan officials.
