<TEXT type="str">It&apos;s a tale of romance straight from the script of a Jeremy Kyle Show and it stars... Jeremy Kyle. 
 
The TV host famed for grilling people over romantic entanglements has fallen for his children’s former nanny. 
 
Jeremy, 51, and 35-year-old Vicky Burton have been an item for two months, a source has revealed. 
 
They first met when she became the family nanny many years ago. 
 
She was pictured alongside Jeremy, his wife Carla Germaine and two of their three kids on holiday in Barbados in July 2013. 
 
Jeremy and Carla later split and divorced last February – and the romance with Vicky is his first since the 13-year marriage ended.

A pal close to the star said last night: “It’s very early days but he’s very happy. 
 
“The relationship is just starting out so who knows what the future will hold? 
 
“Vicky is much loved by all the family. Jeremy’s children have been at the forefront of his mind. He has dealt with his new romance very sensitively. 
 
“His children have been made aware. He has also told Carla. There’s no animosity. He’s been single for a long time and deserves a bit of happiness.”

Vicky had worked for the family since the children – now aged 13, 10 and seven – were very young. 
 
She left the job nine months ago to pursue other work. 
 
News of the romance will fascinate viewers of The Kyle Show in which Jeremy addresses relationship dilemmas in front of the camera. 
 
He has helped hundreds of warring partners face up to their problems since the ITV show launched a decade ago.

But then his own life could form the basis for a show: Two marriages, a wife who had an affair, one cancer scare, a long battle with a crippling gambling addiction and now... a love story. 
 
Jeremy announced he and second wife Carla had broken up 18 months ago, saying said they had “separated amicably” after growing apart. 
 
Confirming the news in a statement he added that they had a “generally happy marriage”. 
 
Days later it was reported that Carla had enjoyed a “passionate affair” with an England Polo player while Jeremy was away in America filming the US version of The Jeremy Kyle Show. 
 
Toyboy James Carr, 25, claimed he and Carla met up for sex “six or seven times”. 
 
Carr told how he had grown close to Carla, then 40, after she went to him for polo lessons in 2012. 
 
He claimed the pair flirted and would often see each other out locally near the home she and Jeremy shared in Ascot, Berks.

Carr and Carla finally became lovers in June 2015 after the 25-year-old sportsman started renting a house across the road from the couple’s mansion. 
 
And that same month Jeremy hinted on his own ITV show that he and Carla were no longer intimate. 
 
Mid-conversation with two warring guests, he blurted: “I haven’t had sex for ages myself.” 
 
Former public schoolboy James described his affair with Carla as “just sex.” 
 
Of their first night together, he said: “Carla called after midnight asking if I wanted to meet her outside for a cigarette. 
 
“We had a smoke and a chat and she told me Jeremy was in America. Then suddenly we began kissing. Without talking, I took her hand and led her inside my house. 
 
“Carla took her high heels off so her shoes wouldn’t make a noise on our stone stairs. We didn’t want to wake my housemates. We started having sex — it was amazing.” 
 
He said she was concerned to keep the affair a secret but rumours about it quickly spread like wildfire.

In December 2015 it emerged that former model Carla blamed Jeremy for their split. 
 
A source close to her insisted that she was particularly embarrassed about a row they had at a racing event in Windsor, where the TV star reportedly embarrassed her while drunk. She cited Jeremy’s “unreasonable behaviour” in her divorce petition. 
 
A month later, in January 2016, Jeremy attended the National Television Awards and spoke about life as a singleton. 
 
He said finding new love wasn’t on the agenda so soon after his marriage breakdown. 
 
He said: “Kids and work – that’s it. I promise you. Literally that. I’ve thrown myself into work, that has kept me going. I appreciate all the support.” 
 
He also laughed off suggestions he could find love on online dating sites like Tinder. 
 
He said: “I don’t understand any of that. I’m not on Twitter or any of that rubbish. I’m an old man.” 
 
Last February the couple were granted a quickie divorce during a hearing at the Central Family Court in High Holborn, Central London. Neither were present. 
 
Jeremy and Carla were married in 2002.They met when she entered a competition called Two Strangers And A Wedding run by BRMB radio station in Birmingham, where Kyle was working. 
 
As the winner, her prize was to marry a selected groom, called Greg Cordell. 
 
But their marriage lasted just three months amid rumours Greg had had an affair – though he protested his innocence. 
 
Carla started dating Jeremy afterwards. 
 
The TV presenter was previously married to Kirsty Rowley, who he met in 1988 when he was working as a recruitment consultant in Bristol.

They wed in 1989, only to split a year later. They have a daughter called Harriet, 26. 
 
In 2007 Kirsty told how their relationship had broken down because of a gambling habit he was battling with. 
 
She said Jeremy had ­frittered away £70,000 and had previously run up £4,500 debts at the bookies and on betting phone lines. 
 
Jeremy also spoke about the addiction – which he eventually overcame – in his 2009 book I’m Only Being Honest. 
 
He wrote: “Gambling is the mistress that truly seduced me. I will never understand what a hit of heroin feels like, but gambling I get. Big time. 
 
&quot;Plenty of days I can remember taking money out of the cashpoint and going to the bookies and then losing and going again to the cashpoint – and back again and again. 
 
“I would think ‘I’ve got to go now’ but there was this pull and suddenly I was chasing money, trying to achieve something that has never been achieved: making a bookie poor.” 
 
In 2012 he was diagnosed with testicular cancer but was given the all-clear after chemotherapy and surgery. 
 
Aside from his daytime show, famed for its lie detector test and confrontational style, he has fronted dozens of programmes for ITV. In 2015 he presented two series of primetime show The Kyle Files. 
 
He also presented a 10-part series called Jeremy Kyle’s Emergency Room. The show returned in March 2016. 
 
And last year he also stood in for Piers Morgan on Good Morning Britain. 
 
He started his career on local radio before getting his break broadcasting on national station Virgin – presenting Jezza’s Virgin Confessions every weeknight. 
 
In 2004 he ran a similar Confessions Show on London’s Capital FM. 
 
It proved so popular he was poached by TV bosses and in 2007 The Jeremy Kyle Show began.</TEXT>
