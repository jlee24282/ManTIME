<TITLE>Kings hand Breakers a record-breaking...</TITLE>
<TEXT>BASKETBALL: The Sydney Kings have moved into fourth spot on the NBL ladder with a record-breaking 84-57 win over the New Zealand Breakers at Qudos Bank Arena. 
 
The Kings now have a 13-13 record with two regular-season games remaining and have laid down a marker for the playoffs. 
 
The home team overcame a strong start by the visitors and ensured this was the most lopsided win over the Kiwi outfit in club history, eclipsing the 21-point beating of the Breakers in 2006. 
 
Greg Whittington was the star of the show with 16 points, eight rebounds and seven assists, while Kevin Lisch had 15 points and Jason Cadee 13. 
 
It was Andrew Gaze's team's second win of the weekend following the victory in Brisbane over the Bullets on Friday night. 
 
It was the Breakers' first game since losing American import Akil Mitchell to a highly publicised eye injury in Thursday's loss to Cairns. 
 
The Kiwi side started well but the Kings came on strong in the second quarter and got even better in the third term, scoring 26-7 to take what proved to be an insurmountable 32-point lead into the final quarter. 
 
Gaze was able to rest some of his stars in the fourth term, with Chinese development player Bo Liu becoming the first Chinese player to score in the NBL with his baseline jumpshot. 
 
Scores: Bullets 77 Kings 80, Breakers 81 Taipans 94, Hawks 95 36ers 92, Wildcats 73 Melbourne United 71, Kings 84 Breakers 57</TEXT>
