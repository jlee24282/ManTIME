<content type="str">Despite IRS and law enforcement efforts to thwart tax-related scams, including a significant arrest last October, the IRS continues to alert taxpayers and tax professionals to new versions of various schemes designed to gather both money and personal information from unsuspecting victims. 
 
While these scammers work year-round, their efforts tend to peak during tax season when complying with IRS tax rules and filing deadlines are top of mind for both taxpayers and tax preparers. During the 2016 filing season, the IRS reported a 400 percent increase in tax-related scams. 
 
The IRS continues to update its warnings to taxpayers about an ongoing telephone scam in which the caller claims to be an IRS agent tasked with collecting an unpaid tax liability. The caller demands immediate payment by gift card or iTunes card, both of which are more difficult to trace, and often threatens arrest if the taxpayer fails to comply. I have spoken to several taxpayers who received these calls, and have received them myself. I have also seen fake IRS messages come through via text making similar claims and enticing taxpayers to call a phone number provided to settle the matter. To avoid falling victim to these telephone and text message scams, keep in mind that the IRS will never contact you by phone or text regarding your tax account or filings. They will always send a notice through the old-fashioned U.S. mail. 
 
Scammers have also used email to find victims and this approach may be growing. The IRS recently warned tax preparers regarding a two-part email scam comprised of an initial message supposedly from a taxpayer looking for assistance in preparing his tax return. If the preparer responds, a second email with either a web link or a PDF attachment with an embedded web link is sent under the guise of containing the taxpayer&apos;s tax documents. These links are designed to allow the scammer to collect information from the tax preparer that can be used to unlock other information the scammers can use for financial gain. 
 
Another email scam targeting tax preparers is also circulating. In an effort to improve its e-services system, which is used by tax professionals to request tax transcripts and conduct other business with the IRS on a taxpayer&apos;s behalf, the IRS recently required all e-services users verify their identities. Notices were mailed to all e-services users that their accounts would be disabled if they did not take action within 30 days. Scammers have used this opportunity to send fraudulent emails which appear to be an important security-related communication from the IRS but actually contain a link to a bogus website that mimics the IRS&apos; e-services registration page. 
 
Based on a message I received from a client last week, this scam may be targeting taxpayers as well. She had received an email that appeared to be from the IRS requesting that she verify her account information via a web link. This email was not legitimate. The IRS has a clear warning on its &quot;Get Transcript&quot; web page noting the IRS will never call, email or text a taxpayer asking for information or requesting that a taxpayer login to a website to update his or her account profile.  
 
The IRS also issued a warning about emails containing fake CP2000 notices. These notices are generated when information reported on a taxpayer&apos;s return does not match information the IRS received on W-2, 1099 and other tax-related reports. If additional tax is owed due to the discrepancy on the return, these notices also provide instructions for making a payment to the IRS. In addition to appearing legitimate, the fake notices are being sent both via email and postal mail. Emailed versions should be easy to identify as fake since the IRS will never use email to deliver them. 
 
The IRS has also provided guidance regarding how to tell if a CP2000 notice is legitimate or a scam. The fake notices are issued from an Austin, Texas, address and the tax issue involved is related to the Affordable Care Act. The included payment voucher in the fake versions also lists a letter number 105C. To help taxpayers determine whether a notice received via mail is legitimate, the IRS recommends visiting their website at www.irs.gov/individuals/understanding-your-cp2000-notice where they provide an example of a real notice.
