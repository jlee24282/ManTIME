In other news, ALLEN SMART, vice president of programs at the Kate B. Reynolds Charitable Trust in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, will be leaving the foundation at the end of February to pursue consulting opportunities in philanthropy. Smart joined the trust in 2006 as the Health Care Division’s senior program officer for the eastern region of North Carolina, became Health Care Division director in 2012, and then vice president of programs in 2014. Under former President Karen McNeil-Miller, Smart worked closely with colleagues to develop and launch  Healthy Places NC — a decade-long, $100 million initiative to improve the health of ten to twelve rural communities in the state. He subsequently served as interim president of the trust from September 2015 to June 2016 and resumed his role as vice president of programs after Dr. Laura Gerald joined the trust as president in July 2016. “Allen’s contributions to the Kate B. Reynolds Charitable Trust and to achieving Mrs. Reynolds’ vision of improved health and quality of life for all residents have been invaluable,” said Gerald. “He leaves a lasting mark on the foundation — encouraging program officers to get out in the field and listen, recognizing the strengths of rural communities, and knowing there is no one size-fits-all approach — that will continue to help us improve outcomes for the communities we serve. We wish Allen well in all of his future endeavors.”</content>
