<content type="str">– Showtime Boxing and the Premier Boxing Champions were at the MGM Grand on Saturday, January 28th with a huge night of boxing headlined by the WBA featherweight world title rematch between Carl Frampton and Leo Santa Cruz. 
 
The atmosphere in the MGM Grand for this “Ireland vs Mexico” match-up was electric, and the two men picked up where their last fight left off in this one. The two men are a contrast in many ways but they are very evenly matched and both men took the experience of the first fight into the ring with them. The first match ended in a majority decision in Frampton’s favor back in July and after another twelve rounds last night, Santa Cruz was judged to have won a majority decision, setting up the inevitable trilogy. 
 
The first of the evening’s world title fights saw WBC 135 pound champion Dejan Zlaticanin was making his first title defense against highly regarded Mikey Garcia. Garcia entered the fight 35-0 and he was favored to defeat Zlaticaniin, who was 22-0 in his own right. Garcia was making just his second appearance in roughly three years but it did not take long for the twenty eight year old to establish himself over Zlaticanin. Garcia got the stoppage inround three to take a world title in a third weight class home. 
 
A third world title fight on the card was cancelled when Johnny Barros of Argentina failed to meet Nevada’s licensing requirements. IBF featherweight titleholder Lee Selby will return home to England with the belt still around his waist.
