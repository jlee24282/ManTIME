<TITLE>Old-school Zach Randolph is rolling for the Grizzlies</TITLE>
<TEXT>6:45 AM GMT   
SALT LAKE CITY -- Much has changed for Memphis Grizzlies franchise cornerstone Zach Randolph this season. He has a new role for a new coach in a new system. 
 
But hes still the same, ol' Z-Bo, even at the ripe old age of 35. 
 
I dont see anything different, man, point guard Mike Conley said after Randolphs season-high 28 points led the Grizzlies to a 102-95 victory Saturday over the Utah Jazz . Its the same guy making the same moves. We joke all the time. Im like, Man, youre never going to stop playing. You dont look like you age. You dont look like youre slowing down. Its fun to see him just continually doing his thing. 
 
Thats a polite way of saying that Randolph has been getting buckets his entire career despite a vertical leap that can be measured with your thumb and index finger. 
 
They say its an old-man game, old-school game, Randolph said with a smile. Ill take it how it comes. 
 
Randolphs role has changed this season, as he sacrificed by accepting a sixth man role, but his per-minute production hasnt dipped. His player efficiency rating (19.2) is right about his career norm. Hes putting up 20.7 points per 36 minutes, which is actually 1.5 points better than his career average.

The major dip for Randolph has been in his minutes. Hes playing only 24.2 minutes per game, his fewest since he was a 21-year-old pup in Portland. 
 
However, Randolphs playing time is trending upward as hes in the midst of his best month of the season. Hes averaging 27.9 minutes in January while putting up 15.9 points and 9.8 rebounds per game. Three of his five 20-plus-point performances so far this season have come this month. 
 
Im just in a rhythm, man, Randolph said. I had to get my legs under me and get a feel. Coach is playing me more minutes and longer stretches. Im getting a chance to get my rhythm. 
 
First-year coach David Fizdale: Hes worked his way to that. I needed to get him on the court more, but it also came with his conditioning level going up. 
 
That has meant more minutes alongside All-Star center Marc Gasol . For years, that duo formed a punishing one-two punch as the Grizzlies built their six-year postseason streak on a bullying style of basketball. With the league trending toward a space-and-pace style, Fizdale was hesitant about using the two bruisers together a lot, primarily due to concerns about Randolph defending small-ball power forwards. 
 
Fizdale made a deal with Randolph: Prove he can defend pick-and-rolls and prevent opposing power forwards from getting open 3-pointers and hed get to be on the floor with Gasol more. 
 
The 6-foot-9, 260-pound Randolph has responded to the challenge. As a result, hes a crunch-time regular again, which is much more important to Randolph than starting games. His presence down the stretch is paying dividends: Randolph has 21 points on 10-of-15 shooting in 31 clutch minutes this month, according to NBA.com stats. 
 
The Gasol-Randolph pairing is perhaps more potent than ever on the offensive end, in large part due to Gasol emerging as a lethal long-range shooter after operating primarily around the elbows for most of his career. Gasol serves as a stretch-4 these days when he plays with Randolph, who remains a crafty bull on the block. 
 
The Grizzlies have a sky-high offensive rating of 114.6 points per 100 possessions in the 220 minutes Gasol and Randolph have played together this month. They played only 219 minutes together this season before January. 
 
I know where he wants the ball and I know how to get it there, said Gasol, who had 18 points and five assists Saturday. Ill do that. Its something that weve been very productive at. I know how to pass it, where to pass it, and Im pretty good at it. If they try to front him, its a wrap because Im going to get it to him with an advantage. 
 
And once he gets going and in a rhythm, then youre guessing what to take away. When hes in a rhythm, its hard to stop him.

Thats true regardless of whos guarding Randolph. There certainly arent many second-team bigs who can disrupt his rhythm. But he proved Saturday that he could still score against even a dominant defender. Randolphs 12-of-20 shooting night included four buckets on seven attempts when he was guarded by Defensive Player of the Year candidate Rudy Gobert , highlighted by a beautiful, old-school, up-and-under move when he got the NBAs best shot-blocker to leave his feet. 
 
He just gave him the business! Grizzlies shooting guard Tony Allen said gleefully. You saw it! I mean, you saw it! I aint making this s--- up. 
 
Randolph raved about Goberts impact as a defender after the game, but he certainly wasnt surprised to have some success against the Jazz big man. 
 
Ive been doing it my whole career, Randolph said as he strolled to the Grizzlies bus. Anybody. It dont matter.</TEXT>
