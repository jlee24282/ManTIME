<TITLE>First-half deficit too much for Troy men</TITLE>
<TEXT>TROY  The Troy Trojans chipped, clawed and skimmed away at Georgia States 14-point halftime lead but fell short of victory in a 78-72 loss to the Panthers Saturday at Trojan Arena. 
   
A tough loss to a really talented team, one of the hottest teams in the league right now, Trojans head coach Phil Cunningham said. As poorly as we played for the first 10, 12 minutes and couldnt get anything going offensively, we were in the game. We had a five- or six-minute stretch where they took control of the game at the end of the half. 
   
Georgia State (13-7 overall, 6-2 Sun Belt Conference) entered the contest with a four-game winning streak  its last loss coming to Troy in Atlanta on Jan. 9. Despite seven turnovers in the early going, the Trojans (11-11, 3-5) pulled within 21-19 on a trey from Jeremy Hollimon with 5:57 left in the first half. 
   
That served as Troys last basket from the field in the first half, though, as the Trojans turnover woes continued. 
   
Troy managed just three shots in the final 5:57 and committed four turnovers in the stretch. That allowed the Panthers to build a 34-19 lead with 55 seconds left in the half. 
   
We have had some struggles with turnovers, but give them credit. Its that zone, Cunningham said. Whenever we play Georgia State, we talk about keeping your head up because theyll create some turnovers  but they turned them into points tonight. 
   
Kevin Baker broke the scoreless streak with three free throws, but Dmarcus Simonds scored on a layup with two seconds left to give the Panthers a 36-22 advantage. Simonds, a freshman, had eight of his 26 points in the stretch. 
   
That was a stretch when we had no answer for Simonds, Cunningham said. Simonds really controlled the end of that first half. 
   
Troy, though, chipped away at the Georgia State lead in spurts. Jordon Varnado opened the half with a layup then blocked a Panther shot on the other end. 
   
DeVon Walker rebounded and fed Wesley Person for a trey. After Georgia State hit a free throw, Person buried another long-distance shot, and Troy trailed 37-30 just 1:24 into the second half. 
   
We said we had to play with more energy coming out in the second half, he said. A couple of threes and the big block  some good looks  kinda sparked us to go on that run. 
   
The Trojans pulled within four on a layup from Alex Hicks with 10:49 left, but the Panthers pushed it out to nine on a layup from Jordan Session with 9:28 left. 
   
Still, Troy kept making charges. Baker buried a pair of treys  including a 30-footer  and Hollimon added a pair of free throws. His last make from the charity stripe cut the Panthers deficit to 60-57 with 6:06 left in the game. 
   
Georgia State responded, though, with a 7-0 run. Malik Benlevi dunked over the Trojans and followed with a layup. Jeff Thomas, who was 3-of-4 from the outside, followed with a trey to up the Panthers lead to 67-57. 
   
Stops, you got to get stops, Hollimon said. You cant trade buckets when youre trying to come back and take the lead. We didnt get the stops we needed. 
   
Yet, Troy made one final push. 
   
Down 74-64, Person notched a trey. Daniel Peace came up with a steal, and Baker found Person for another trey with 49 seconds to go. 
   
Georgia State iced the game at the free throw line. 
   
Behind Simonds, Jeremy Hollowell had 14 points, while Thomas added 11 to pace the Panthers. Person had 25, while Hollimon netted 16. Varnado and Baker chipped in nine each.</TEXT>
