<TEXT type="str">Q: My two children seem to hate each other. My son is 25 and my daughter 23, and I always thought their relationship would improve as they grew into adulthood. But the competition, sniping and downright cruelty and indifference they show to each other has not improved. They have a good relationship with us individually, but they act like being in the same room together is terrible. 
   
They are mean to each other in ways I have never seen them be mean to other people. 
   
A: It is good that they are capable of having respectful relationships with others, which makes me think this problem is extremely deep-rooted or indicative of a serious incident. 
   
Sit them down individually in a relaxed context and ask what you can do to help them get along. If they don’t improve with your help, and they show no motivation to work on it, set boundaries for civility in your home. Warn them that you’ve got to protect the vibe of your family gatherings — and give them grown-up timeouts accordingly. 
   
Q: My fiancée comes from a conservative religious family, and many of them will be meeting my family for the first time at our wedding this spring. My sister has been with her female partner (whom we all love) for six years. My fiancée thinks it would be easiest if my sister keeps things “low-key” at the wedding and does not make it obvious that they are a couple. My fiancée is not against my sister’s relationship, but her family is very anti-gay. I say I would never ask my sister or her partner to do that. 
   
A: If she’s not against your sister’s relationship, she sure is acting like it. I get that she doesn’t want to watch her Great-Uncle Harold squirm during the champagne toast. But your sister’s about to be her family too. Her choosing to stifle love that she supposedly supports, all because of some potential grumbling from people she supposedly doesn’t agree with in the first place? Make it clear that this is non-negotiable. There can be general caps on PDA, but say your sister will not be shoved in a closet. It’s your fiancée’s responsibility to handle her family in whatever way she wants. Give your sister a friendly heads-up, so she and her partner can choose how and whether to calibrate their behavior.
