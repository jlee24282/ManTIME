<content type="str">Three young women from two of the 20 secondary schools adopted by the Industrial Development Corporation (IDC) in 2013 were among the top performers in the matric class of 2016. 
 
Malamba Nemavhadwe, from Tshivhase Secondary School in Limpopo, topped the log for quintile 2 schools (the category of the country’s second poorest schools), while classmate Nyandano Madiba came third. 
 
Anelisa Marwanqana of Mariazell Secondary School in Eastern Cape was second, in quintile 1 (the country’s poorest schools). 
 
The two secondary schools, situated in two of South Africa’s most rural and marginalised areas, are among the 20 adopted by the IDC in 2013. 
 
Four years later, all but three of the adopted schools registered an improved matric pass rate – which is also the highest since the IDC came on board. 
 
This is the final year of the five-year agreement reached by the IDC in partnership with the department of basic education and the Adopt-a-School Foundation. 
 
A total of R52 million was invested to improve the infrastructure, as well as the academic and social environment, in the adopted schools incrementally over a period of time. 
 
This was done through the Whole School Development Programme, which is a holistic and sustainable model aimed at improving schools. 
 
Academic performance, particularly at matric level, is one of the programme’s key measurements, as is the increase in the number of pupils from poor backgrounds who access tertiary education. 
 
The Class of 2016 produced the best results since the partnership with the IDC initiative was launched, marking an overall improvement from 82.1% in 2015 to 84.5% in 2016 – which scores significantly more than the national average of 72.5%. 
 
The number of learners who attained a university entrance improved from 32% in 2015 to 34% in 2016. 
 
Critically, the learners’ performance increased from 49% to 53% in maths; from 65% to 70% in physics; and from 77% to 80% in accounting. 
 
The IDC programme focuses on the teaching and learning of maths, physics, life sciences and accounting. 
 
Specialists are brought in to provide training and classroom support for teachers in the respective subjects, and supplementary classes in these subjects take place during weekends and holidays. 
 
This explains the improvement at matric level. 
 
Our schools managed a total of 891 distinctions, with 36 learners achieving 80% and above in maths and 52 learners achieving the same in physical science. 
 
Although progress is being made, future interventions will have to focus on addressing the apparent difficulties learners have with maths and science. 
 
The majority of learners still fall short of the minimum university entry marks required to study science, technology, engineering and maths, otherwise known as Stem. These marks are set at 60% and above. 
 
Very few obtain a minimum score of 50% and above. 
 
In 2017, we will continue to offer matriculants supplementary classes in these subjects to increase their chances of passing them with the required marks. 
 
We also anticipate that Minister of Basic Education Angie Motshekga’s new national Stem unit will address the problem and contribute solutions. 
 
It is evident that the IDC’s contribution to these schools is yielding positive results. 
 
All pupils benefit from the supplementary classes and support from the IDC is intended to give these poor pupils a chance to succeed. 
 
It will take teamwork among all stakeholders to beef up our education system and the IDC appreciates the support it has received from the national and provincial departments of basic education, as well as parents, school managers and pupils. 
 
Luthuli is the IDC’s divisional executive of corporate affairs
