The Academy criticises the ban 
 
The Academy has blasted President Donald Trump’s travel ban branding it “extremely troubling“, reports PTI 
 
Iranian filmmaker Asghar Farhadi, who wrote and directed the 2017 Oscar—nominated foreign language film “The Salesman,” would not be able to enter the US for the awards under Trump’s recently enacted travel ban, reported Variety. 
 
“The Academy celebrates achievement in the art of filmmaking, which seeks to transcend borders and speak to audiences around the world, regardless of national, ethnic, or religious differences. 
 
“As supporters of filmmakers — and the human rights of all people — around the globe, we find it extremely troubling that Asghar Farhadi, the director of the Oscar—winning film from Iran ‘A Separation,’ along with the cast and crew of this year’s Oscar—nominated film ‘The Salesman,’ could be barred from entering the country because of their religion or country of origin,” statement released by the Academy’s official spokesperson read.
