<TITLE>Historic Day at March for Life</TITLE>
<TEXT>No sitting President or Vice President has ever addressed the annual March for Life , which has convened in Washington D.C. every year in the 44 years since Roe v. Wade was passed. It was not the first time that Mr Pence had been present at the rally , however. Kellyanne Conway, Donald Trump's senior counselor, also made an appearance. He added: "To all of you marching - you have my full support". "That's why on Monday, the president reinstated the Mexico City Policy", Pence said . 
 
In his address to the crowd, Pence said the Trump Administration will continue working with pro-life advocates to defund Planned Parenthood, stop taxpayer funding of abortions, and ban late-term abortions. It's the 44th year of the march, but this time, many attendees said, is the first in almost a decade they feel their voices will be heard - and that's because of President Trump and Vice President Pence. 
 
"There's been a lot of talk about numbers this past week", Jeanne Mancini  told the hundreds of thousands of marchers. 
 
"Every year scores of men and women visit our National Mall to peacefully march for the rights of people who can not yet march or speak for themselves, countless babies who have yet to be born". 
 
Marko Prizmic, part of Carroll College's Pro-Life Club said he had a message for people who are pro-choice: "We love you, and we love all humans' beings". 
 
"For me, being a feminist is about supporting the rights of women in the United States but also supporting women in what truly makes them feminine... the ability to create life". 
 
"I am speaking out for those who can't speak for themselves", said Kathryn Burns of Macedonia, a student at Our Lady of the Elms High School who was attending her first march. But I was told you will have a very large crowd of people. "So I just think that it's so fitting and what an honor to be there at my first event attending where our vice president will be there as well". "We are going to do it in a positive way", marcher Sarah Wilkinson said. 
 
Almost seven-in-ten Americans say Roe v. Wade should not be completely overturned, according to a Pew Research Center poll. 
 
"He was really trying to let us know that we can trust him, and we can trust this administration, and I do trust Vice President Pence". He later clarified that professionals should instead be the ones held responsible if abortions were no longer allowed.</TEXT>
