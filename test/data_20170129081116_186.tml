<TITLE>Custom Service Test Platforms</TITLE>
<TEXT>'Tentacle' Offers Programmable Service Monitoring with Custom Perks  
 'Tentacle' is a new programmable service monitoring platform that enables users to create their own tests that can be programmed to run at specified intervals. This makes it possible for programmers to monitor virtually anything they want from websites, to APIs without having to rely on existing static tests. 
'Tentacle' provides users with advanced control over the kinds of tests they want to perform with their digital assets, which in turn can help them to pinpoint relevant results with better precision. With more complex digital configurations being launched every day, 'Tentacle' offers a great solution for service monitoring that can provide better results that are fine-tuned to your individual needs. Users can choose what to test, how it should be tested and even which data points they'd like to extract during said test.</TEXT>
