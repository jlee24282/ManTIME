<TITLE>The Dish: Braised Brisket at Blind Pig</TITLE>
<TEXT>By Restaurant: Blind Pig 
 
Chef: Michael Prete 
 
Address: 2 Badgers Island West, Kittery, Maine 
 
Monthly Theme: New! New! New! - New Restaurants, New dishes, New meals, New Flavors. This Months theme puts the word NEW on a whole new level. 
 
Blind Pig, in Kittery, is plowing its way through the winter season. They first opened their doors with a gastro pub menu and now almost two years later they are beginning to evolve. 
 
We are slowly morphing the theme of the restaurant into BBQ, specifically upscale BBQ. The trend is back to basics with clean, simple, fresh and well thought-out dishes. We are steering away from overcomplicated foods, shares chef Michael Prete, going on to add, We already do our own butchering and now well be smoking meats more. This brisket dish itself will morph into a rubbed and smoked product come spring, but currently we are braising it for more of a hearty winter-style dish. 
 
The addition of more BBQ isnt the only new addition at Blind Pig. Looking to the future, days filled with sun and warm breezes, Blind Pig will be breaking out the teeny, tiny hammers. 
 
This summer well have crab and crawfish tables for our patrons. With a hole in the middle you can crack some crabs and drink some beer. Well also have music outside, Prete says. 
 
In addition, everything on the new menu will be available in their new provision section. 
 
Youll be able to buy everything we make by the pound. We will be making our own bacon, pulled pork by the pound, ketchup, BBQ sauces, hot sauces and more, Prete adds. 
 
Braised Brisket, Sweet Pepper Glaze with Butter Smashed Fingerlings and Crispy Haricot Vert 
 
Brisket instructions, according to Prete 
 
First the brisket gets lightly trimmed of the deeper fat spots, seasoned and grill seared on all sides, then goes into a braising pan with a briny bath of BBQ-esque liquids. (Ketchup, Worcestershire, molasses, vinegar, seasonings, etc.) Covered tight and into a 300 degree oven for at least 5 hours. Then into the fridge to chill. 
 
Sweet Pepper Glaze 
 
A combination of local sweet and hot peppers, sugar, corn starch, seasoning and cooked down to a nice glaze and then finished off with some finishing sherry vinegar and honey. 
 
Green Bean Frits 
 
We use Haricot Verts, a French-style green bean, lightly blanched, we toss them in buttermilk, then into a dry coating of corn meal, corn starch, flour with seasoning and herbs, then fried crispy. 
 
Smashed Fingerlings 
 
Blanch the fingerling potatoes and to order, hand crush them into a pan with butter, roasted garlic paste, shallots and mixed herbs. 
 
To assemble: 
 
We sear the sides of the portioned brisket and then into a 450 degree oven until hot. We place our potatoes on the bottom of the plate as a nest, the brisket goes on top, the glaze gets drizzled over part of the brisket and it's finished off with the crispy green beans. Easy, delicious.
