<TITLE>Coach Jones Wants Bold Approach As England Defend Crown</TITLE>
<TEXT>Rugby  6 Nations 2017   
The 2017 RBS 6 Nations will kick off on Saturday February 4 with the games between Scotland and Ireland at Murrayfield and England taking on France at Twickenham. 
 
The tournament is set to conclude on March 18 and England will bid to not only defend their title but also maintain their winning run which now stands at 14 matches. 
 
Eddie Jones side are now just four wins short of New Zealands world record for consecutive victories and a second successive Grand Slam in the coming months would see them break that mark with 19. 
 
However, Ireland are hot on the heels of England in the betting to reclaim the trophy they last won in 2015 while Wales, France and Scotland will also harbour aspirations to halt the Red Rose charge. Italy, as ever, are the tournament outsiders. 
 
In the 2016 tournament, England completed a first Six Nations Grand Slam since 2003 by beating France 31-21 in Paris. 
 
In Eddie Jones first campaign as head coach, the Red Rose bounced back from their World Cup failure under Stuart Lancaster in the best way possible by ending a run of four successive runners-up placings in the tournament by claiming victories over Scotland, Italy, Ireland, Wales and finally France to achieve a clean sweep. 
 
Wales ended up runners-up this time, with defending champions Ireland having to settle for third place ahead of Scotland. Italy took the wooden spoon. 
 
The RBS 6 Nations title launched Jones regime with Twickenhams first silverware for five years and by the end of 2016 the Australian had presided over a sequence of 13 successive Test victories. 
 
England are now second in the global rankings and the next stage on their mission to supplant New Zealand at the pinnacle of the sport is to rid themselves of any conservatism against their European rivals. 
 
You dont defend a Grand Slam, youve got to win it again and thats why weve got to be absolutely daring going into the Six Nations, Jones said. 
 
Its a big part of how we want to develop our game because we want to be a side that has the courage to play our sort of rugby from the very first game of the tournament. 
 
For the first couple of games last year we were quite reticent to play any rugby. We got better against Ireland and Wales and then went back into our shell against France. 
 
Thats the challenge ahead. Weve got a short period of time to change mindsets but I think we can do that. 
 
This years Six Nations will also see the introduction of a bonus-point system  details of which as follows: 
 
Points System (including bonus details) 
 
FOUR points awarded for a win 
 
TWO points awarded for a draw 
 
NO points awarded for a loss 
 
ONE bonus point awarded for scoring four tries or more 
 
ONE bonus point awarded if a team loses a match by seven points or less 
 
THREE bonus points if a team wins all five of their matches 
 
 
 
Therefore a winning team can gain a maximum of five points while a losing team can still earn up to two points. The maximum total number of points a team can win over the tournament is 28 (55 plus three Grand Slam bonus points).</TEXT>
