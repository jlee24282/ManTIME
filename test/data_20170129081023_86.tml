<content type="str">DUBAI (Reuters) - A decision by President Donald Trump to temporarily ban Yemeni citizens from traveling to the United States is &quot;illegal and illegitimate,&quot; authorities controlled by the Iran-allied Houthi group in Yemen&apos;s capital said. 
 
The war-damaged and impoverished country in the south of the Arabian Peninsula is one of seven majority Muslim countries whose citizens now face a 90-day ban on entering the United States while the U.S. administration says it studies ways to keep militants out. 
 
The Houthi-controled news agency SABA quoted a foreign ministry source as saying the ministry was aware that such action is the sovereign right of the U.S. government. 
 
But &quot;the source said emphatically that any attempt to classify Yemen or its citizens as a possible source of terrorism and extremism was illegal and illegitimate.&quot; 
 
Yemen has been divided by nearly two years of civil war. 
 
The Iran-allied Houthi group has de facto control of northern areas, including the capital Sanaa and the country&apos;s largest international airport, while the internationally recognized government is based in the south and east. 
 
An official in that administration said on Saturday that it was &quot;dismayed&quot; by the visa ban.

    Stream This: Films that are (or should have been) nominated for Oscars  
‘The Lobster’ Amazon Prime The majority of this year’s Oscar nominees are from movies that — no surprise! — were released during Oscar season. So to catch up, you have to leave your house and buy a ticket. One title you can watch instantly, from the comfort of your recliner, is one of this year’s unexpected moneymakers: That darkly comic dystopia in which single people have 45 days to find a romantic partner or else they’re turned into an animal of their choice. “The Lobster” nabbed a nom for... 
    Cate Le Bon makes poetic songs for absurd times  
Cate Le Bon is well aware that we live in strange times. That’s the premise for the Welsh singer/songwriter’s new EP “Rock Pool” (out today), which came out of the same recording sessions as her 2016 record “Crab Day.” “It’s almost a reactionary language to the absurdity and horror of the times we’re living in,” says Le Bon, who now lives in Los Angeles. She wrote these songs before Donald Trump came into power and Brexit happened, but she certainly recognizes their significance now. The EP’s... 
    Bombino puts a Western spin on Tuareg rock  
Bombino, the Niger-based musician née Omara Moctar, fell in love with the guitar as a child refugee living in Algeria. “The guitar to me represented freedom and it became my only dream,” he says. Now 37, Bombino has made recording and performing Tuareg rock across the globe his calling. Like fellow Tuareg musicians Tinariwen, his masterful guitar skills reflect influences from Jimi Hendrix and Mark Knopfler (of the Dire Straits) as well as techniques translated from a traditional lute and a...

    Asghar Farhadi on why he returned to Iran for &apos;The Salesman&apos;  
With 2011’s “A Separation,” Asghar Farhadi went from an Iranian filmmaker largely known among the film festival circuit to an international master. The drama won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film and was nominated for its screenplay. Farhadi went to France next, making “The Past.” Then he decided to return home. Now we have “The Salesman,” in which a teacher/actor named Emad (played by Shahab Hosseini) becomes singlemindedly obsessed with finding the man who assaulted his wife (Taraneh... 
    &apos;Paris 05:59: Theo &amp; Hugo&apos; is more than a &apos;Before Sunrise&apos; knock-off  
‘Paris 05:59: Theo &amp; Hugo’ Directors: Olivier Ducastel, Jacques Martineau Stars: Geoffrey Couet, Francois Nambot Rating: NR 3 (out of 5) Globes “Paris 05:59: Theo &amp; Hugo” is the rare “Before Sunrise” knockoff that frontloads the stumping. And how: Kicking off with bold, loud Gaspar Noe titles, it proceeds to an orgy that out-Noes Noe (while staying 100 percent sex-positive). For 20 minutes, we descend into the basement of a gay sex club, where bodies bathed in red and blue lights — and...
