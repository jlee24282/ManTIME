<TEXT type="str">GREAT NEWS: Somerset Chamber Chairman Greg Saunders and Chief Executive Dale Edwards with the British Chambers of Commerce accreditation certificate THE Somerset Chamber of Commerce has had its accreditation to the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) confirmed for a further two years. 

The BCC assessment, which is the Chamber equivalent of an Ofsted inspection, examines the quality and performance of all areas of the business, from member services to governance, operational performance, finance and risk management. 

Somerset Chamber has grown significantly since its first accreditation in 2011, with plans in place to support continued growth over the coming years. 

Dale Edwards, chief executive of Somerset Chamber, said, “I am delighted that we have received re-accreditation from the BCC, which recognises the consistently high standards of service quality and performance we have achieved. 

“With Somerset Chamber being one of only 52 accredited Chambers in the UK, it provides our members with the knowledge and assurance that we are a thriving Chamber with a clear objective to support the growth of our members and the Somerset economy as a whole.” 

Dr Adam Marshall, director general of BCC, said: “The strength of the accredited Chamber of Commerce network rests on our shared commitment to members, to the places where we do business, to helping firms trade, and to giving business a voice locally, nationally and internationally. 

“It gives me great pleasure to congratulate Dale and the Somerset Chamber team on their re-accreditation, and on delivering consistently high standards of quality and performance for Chamber members.” 

Being part of the BCC Accredited Network amplifies the voice of Somerset Chamber, enabling the views of Somerset businesses to be heard at a national level. 

It also opens up new business opportunities in local, national and international markets and enables Somerset Chamber to provide a high level of business advice, services and financial benefits to its members.</TEXT>
