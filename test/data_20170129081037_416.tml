<content type="str">Duggu Roshan recently gave us a sneak peek of the grand finale episode of Bigg Boss as he shared an adorable selfie with &apos;brother&apos; Salman Khan and his &apos;Kabil&apos; co-star Yami Gautam from the show&apos;s sets.

Hrithik, who had an &apos;absolute blast&apos;, even posted a message on Instagram that summarises brotherhood in the sweetest possible way. The 43-year-old wrote, &quot;Kaun Shahenshah, kaun Sultan. At the end of it, we are all brothers. Me and Yami had an absolute blast on the sets with the one and only Salman Khan! #BiggBoss #dontjudgetheselfiestick.&quot;

While the &apos;Dabangg&apos; star flaunts some swag, Roshan Jr. looks as handsome as ever as he and Yami point at Salman.
