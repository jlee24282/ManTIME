<TITLE>Stretching a Dollar: Gluten-free diets don't have to wreck grocery budget</TITLE>
<TEXT>Recently, a family member was put on a gluten-free diet. The person was astonished at the cost of gluten-free bread versus a loaf of wheat or white bread. 
   
Special dietary restrictions can be more costly, but there are ways to save. 
   
A loaf of premium gluten bread costs about $3 on sale, but gluten-free Udi bread runs about $9 on sale. 
   
Registering for a gluten-free brands e-newsletter or e-club is a great first step. Then contact the various companies and ask, Do you have any coupons for your products? 
   
There is no need to gush over or complain about their products, which you may have never tried, just to get coupons. Of course, if you do have an honest opinion after trying the products, share that. If you havent tried them yet, be honest and just ask if any are available. Look on their websites, in the Sunday News & Record and on in-store displays. 
   
Stockpile the special items more than you would with non-specialty foods. For example, gluten-free pasta and flour will go on sale less often than gluten varieties. That means instead of buying only a months worth of pasta, a gluten-free family may need to buy enough for three months when the sale price hits rock bottom. 
   
You may find some of the better deals online. Amazon, VitaCost.com and DirectEats.com are three sites that routinely have good prices for gluten-free selections. Often they offer free shipping with a spending threshold of $25 to $50. This can be a good way to quickly stock up on gluten-free products. 
   
The most expensive products are those that have to be processed, like bread and pasta. But fruit, vegetables, eggs, rice and beans are usually naturally gluten-free. 
   
Avoiding the processed food and going with the naturally gluten free will save money, and the products are often healthier. Look for options that offer the same flavor or texture but are naturally gluten-free. 
   
Try using gluten-free tortillas instead of sandwich bread. Skip the pricey gluten-free pasta and make spaghetti squash or zucchini noodles. Make fried chicken with almond meal instead of flour. 
   
Dietary changes can often be a shocker to the taste buds, stomach and the budget. It may take a little extra time, effort and adjustment to bring the grocery budget under control. But there is no need to pay full price for specialty food.</TEXT>
