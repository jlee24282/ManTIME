<content type="str">Seems all is not well between veteran rapper Lord of Ajasa and YBNL’s Olamide. Sometime yesterday, Lord of Ajasa’s wife, Funke who goes by the name @queenfunkaso on Instagram shared a throwback photo of Olamide and her son with the caption. 
  
‘@baddosneh and ajasa little son back in d days .memory keep coming yet they do as if dem no no us again. anyway God dey’. 

      
Back then at ID Cabasa’s studio, Olamide used to be Lord of Ajasa’s protege before he became a star.</content>
