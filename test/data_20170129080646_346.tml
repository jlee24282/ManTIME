The Stormers however set out from the start with De Allende scoring in the opening minutes of the math with Jaco Coetzee and Godlen Masimla who dotted down as the Stormers led 21-7 at the break. 
 
Stormers coach Robbie Fleck made a number of changes in the second half but that did not stop the men from Cape Town to dominate the match and run in another four tries. 
 
The Cheetahs was unable to to score any points in the second half with the Stormers taking the game. 
 
Although Fleck made a number of changes after the break, the Stormers continued to dominate as they ran in four more tries, with the Cheetahs remaining scoreless in the second stanza.
