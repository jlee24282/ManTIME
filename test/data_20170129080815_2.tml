<TITLE>Fort Smith Museum of History fundraiser gets new name, location</TITLE>
<TEXT>By It has a new name and will be held at a new location, but its mission remains the same. 
 
The Fort Smith Museum of History's Pardi Gras fundraiser will be held from 6-11 p.m. Saturday at Shipley Baking Co., 52 S. Seventh St., with the goal of providing an entertaining, Mardi Gras-themed event for attendees while raising money for the museum. The evening will be a memorable occasion for "party-seekers" for a number of reasons, said Leisa Gramlich, executive director for the Fort Smith Museum of History. 
 
"This is Pard Gras, our annual fundraiser that is re-imagined," she said. "We've crossed out the M in Mardi Gras and made it a P, for pardi, like party. 
 
"We're so excited about all of this," Gramlich added of the 21-and-older fundraiser. "We're excited that the new venue is Shipley Baking Co., and we have a new band, Full House, which is from Fayetteville. This is going to be a really fun, exciting fundraiser for people to attend." 
 
Full House will perform various styles of music for the dancing portion of the fundraiser, while Don Bailey will offer jazz and other sounds for the event's cocktail time, she said.  
 
"The Cajun dinner we will have for Pardi Gras will be fun, as well," Gramlich said. "Art's Catering is doing the dinner, and they have a nice menu that really sounds good." 
 
Attendees also will be entertained by the live auction, which will include Dallas Cowboys football tickets and box seats; a vacation in Florida; a "Barefoot Beach" resort trip for seven days; a bourbon-tasting party for 30 at the Fort Smith Museum of History; and a framed Gen. William O. Darby photograph, she said. 
 
A framed print of deputy U.S. deputy marshal Bass Reeves autographed by Harold T. Holden and a party for 10 at Hooters also will be on the auction table, Gramlich said. 
 
"People will also enjoy the inside of the new venue Shipley Baking Co.," she said. "We have our decorating committee active, so everything will be very festive inside. You will see Mardi Gras colors purple, gold and green and there will be colorful drapes hanging from the ceiling. It will be very interesting." 
 
Historic photos and newspaper clippings of Shipley Baking Co. have been enlarged and will be on display throughout Pardi Gras, Gramlich said. 
 
"These are magnificent reproductions of Shipley Baking Co. photos," she said. "People will love seeing those. 
 
"And Shipley Baking Co. is a really cool building, and it's a fun place to have a party," Gramlich added. 
 
Shipley Baking Co. was established in 1921 by brothers B.H. "Harry" Shipley Sr. and W.G. "Garvin" Shipley, both of whom had worked in Tom Edmondson's Van Buren-based bakery. While at Edmondson's establishment, the Shipleys learned the production and retail aspects of the business. 
 
The Shipleys established smaller bakeries in McAlester, Okla., and Muskogee, Okla., in 1923 and 1924, respectively. In 1926, the Shipleys purchased a bakery in Fayetteville, leading the way for Harry Shipley to run the Fort Smith bakery and Garvin Shipley to oversee the bakeries in Fayetteville and Oklahoma. 
 
"So many people in Fort Smith remember the baking company and smelled that bread," Gramlich said. "It was so nice." 
 
Pardi Gras is expected to draw 400 people, she said. 
 
"This is our largest fundraiser of the year, and all of the proceeds will go to help us with the museum's daily operating expenses," Gramlich said. "We've had a ticket-price increase this year for the fundraiser, so hopefully we'll be able to raise more than $30,000 for the museum." 
 
Tickets are $100 per person and $1,000 for a table for 10 and can be purchased by calling 783-7841 and at www.fortsmithmuseum.org. 
 
"The Fort Smith Museum of History is important, and so is the Pardi Gras fundraiser," Gramlich said. "People who attend this fundraiser, that is how we keep our doors open. The Pardi Gras event and our supporters are so important for the stability of the Fort Smith Museum of History."</TEXT>
