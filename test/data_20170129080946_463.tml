<content type="str">six months back after giving up the vice president post of state Trinamool Congress unit, said he was lured by Prime Minister Narendra Modi&apos;s ideology and principles. 
 
&quot;But when you see the pattern of ticket allotments, when deserving Muslim candidates are denied tickets you do realise that the BJP isn&apos;t for the minority community,&quot; Khan alleged. 
 
Now having decided to contest from Keirao constituency on NCP ticket, he said, &quot;We will expose the fact that BJP doesn&apos;t stand for the minority. There are 18 constituencies in Manipur where Muslim votes do play a key factor and we will ensure that the community doesn&apos;t endorse the communal party.&quot; Likewise, Md Habibur Rahman, who was the Vice President of Minority Morcha BJP Manipur, has joined JD(U) to contest from Wagbai after failing to get BJP ticket. 
 
&quot;Initially we believed in Narendra Modi&apos;s &apos;sabka saath sabka vikas&apos; slogan but when tickets are distributed there&apos;s a question mark raised on the intent of BJP. Its actions are showing to be Hindu-oriented,&quot; he said of the party for which he was a member for two years. 
 
Calls and messages to BJP Manipur spokesperson O Joy remained unanswered.
