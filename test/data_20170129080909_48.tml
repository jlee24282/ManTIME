<TEXT type="str">Audience members at contemporary Christian rock band MercyMe’s upcoming Texas Takeover Tour can anticipate a preview of the award-winning group’s newest studio album. 
 
Bassist Nathan Cochran said each song on the album, titled “Lifer” and slated for release March 31, showcases how the five-person band’s faith has changed their lives on a personal level. 
 
“There’s no illusion that we’re pastors or theologians or anything like that,” he said. “We’re musicians trying to be honest about what we’re going through in life.” 
 
The band — nominated for a Grammy and winners of the American Music Award and Gospel Music Association Dove Award — are known for their Billboard Adult Contemporary top 40 hits like “I Can Only Imagine,” “Here With Me,” “Homesick,” “So Long Self,” “Flawless” and “Greater.” 
 
Cochran said the group — consisting of himself, lead vocalist Bart Millard, guitarist Barry Graul, guitarist Mike Scheuchzer, and drummer Robby Shaffer — collaborates on songwriting to create pieces that ring true for all of them. 
 
“I’ve had people ask us before, ‘Why did you choose Christian music?’ And the truth is we can write about whatever we want, but it just so happens that our faith and our relationship with Christ informs everything about us,” Cochran said. 
 
“So when it comes time for us to be a band and write songs, it’s what we write about. It’s what we’re consumed with. For us it would be disingenuous to write about anything else.” 
 
For past albums, Cochran said the group focused on working together, just the five of them, throughout the writing process. To switch things up, he said the group invited other people to be a part of their writing process for the upcoming album. 
 
The band wanted their fans to feel a special connection with this newest album, Cochran said, so they created several ways for fans to be involved via pledgemusic.com. 
 
The website lets fans get access to exclusive updates and previews to new songs, band merchandise and memorabilia from creating the album. 
 
Unique offerings on the site include a “VIP Studio Visit” with the band in Nashville, including a private listening party, Q&amp;A session, photo op, autographed CD, signed colored vinyl and T-shirt. 
 
Other packages include signed memorabilia or an undeveloped disposable camera filled with photos taken by the band while in the studio or on the road. 
 
Besides the Texas tour and a few shows this spring, the band’s next project is performing at a couple’s retreat, the Love Song Couples Getaway, at Grand Hyatt Kaua’i Resort and Spa in Kauai, Hawaii, from May 28 to June 3. 
 
Cochran said the band has participated in the event a few times, in various locations, and the performers think it’s a great escape for couples. 
 
Mixing work and their personal lives, the bandmates even bring their wives along to enjoy the retreat. 
 
They have slowed down on touring over the years, going from an average of 120 shows a year to about 60 or 70. 
 
Cochran said the group decided early on that finding the balance between work and life in a band would be nearly impossible. Collectively, they decided the band would come second, behind their families. 
 
While they might be performing less and less in an effort to be present with their growing families, Cochran said they don’t take for granted the opportunity they’ve been given to share a message that is near and dear to their hearts. 
 
“We’re serious about our relationship with Christ. If we really take that relationship seriously and really truly believe that he’s changed our lives, then we certainly want to talk about that with people,” he said. 
 
“We’ve never been ones to slap people upside the head with a Bible, but at the same time we want to be honest that this is the only thing that has actually changed our lives — is our relationship with Christ. If you really want to know who we are, this is it. And we’ll certainly tell you.”</TEXT>
