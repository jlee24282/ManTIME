<TEXT type="str">Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Colin Leis issued the temporary restraining order after Patton also accused the singer of physically abusing her during their marriage, which ended in March 2015. She also said the singer has traumatized her and her son by demanding visitation and refusing to leave her mother’s home last week.

Thicke’s attorney Larry Ginsberg wrote in a court filing opposing the restraining order that there was no basis to issue it and called it a retaliatory after Patton was denied sole custody this month.</TEXT>
