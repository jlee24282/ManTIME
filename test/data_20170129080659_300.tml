<TEXT type="str">Consider all facets of road safety

It’s rare, but I totally agree with the editorial of Jan. 25, “Stop the carnage on local roads.” All of the points made in this well-written piece are valid, and I especially like the viewpoint on distracted driving. Texting and other screen-related activities should be primary offenses, and the fines should be significant. There’s nothing so important on the screen that anyone needs to take their eyes off the road.

(READ: Stop the carnage on local roads)

You did, however, leave out one significant contributing factor to the carnage, and that’s the pedestrians and bicyclists themselves. Many times, at least from my observation, they are their own worst enemies. Just last week, I barely missed hitting a jogger in the dark, wearing black clothes, running in the road when there was a perfectly good sidewalk four feet away. It’s not only stupid, it’s illegal. Florida statute 316.130, section 3 says: “Where sidewalks are provided, no pedestrian shall, unless required by other circumstances, walk along and upon the portion of a roadway paved for vehicular traffic.”

And the people who cross our busiest roads in the middle of a block when a crosswalk with a traffic light is only a few steps away defy any logic or common sense. The same statute makes this illegal as well.

But the bicyclists who ignore the rules of the road are the worst. They zoom in and out of traffic, oblivious to the danger, and ride two and three abreast knowing they are impeding the flow of traffic, almost challenging drivers to pass them. Here’s a blinding glimpse of the obvious: They may win the moment, but when it’s car versus bicycle, the bicycle loses every time.

There’s lots of blame to go around, but let’s hope transportation officials look at all the factors, including the actions of people who choose to play chicken with a 3,000-pound car.

See those signs

With all the recent articles and opinions about traffic safety, texting, etc., I think it is time to address another concern for traffic safety.

(READ: Volusia, Flagler see major increases in traffic fatalities)

Have motorists forgotten the meaning of “yield”? All too often I encounter motorists merging onto a high-speed highway such as an interstate, expecting the fast-moving vehicles to just move over and let them in. And, with the recent report in The News-Journal about the increase in accidents, it is even more imperative to abide by all the highway signs.

To yield is to “give way,” which is what drivers are supposed to do when a “yield” sign is in their lane of traffic. As a courtesy, we all try to accommodate the incoming traffic when it is safe to do so. But when all lanes are jammed, or drivers are pulling large trailers, at times it is impossible to move over. The first and only expectation that should be considered is that the fast-moving vehicles cannot “give way,” thereby requiring the incoming driver to either slow down or speed up to merge safely. Forcing or bullying a fast-moving vehicle to move over creates the possibility of a horrific accident.

Come on, folks, let’s use common sense and abide by the traffic signs that say “yield,” and we’ll all make it to our destination alive!

Put phone down

Again, Mark Lane puts his fingers on the pulse of human action that tragically forces human interaction in his Jan. 26 column, “Crash data shows need for tougher driver texting law.”

About 15 years ago, many drivers were suddenly driving around with what appeared to be toothaches or full-blown root canals — driving with one hand, cradling their jaws with the other. After inspection, it turns out they were talking, and talking — for many miles — on those newfangled cellphone devices.

Fast forward, and now they’re staring at their crotches most of the time, often using one hand or both hands, fumbling with their iPhones while steering with their knees. Drivers are no longer in a rush. If in front when the light turns green, it could take an eternal five seconds for the brakes to come off. They slog along blissfully, leading Jim Morrison’s “Soft(ware) Parade,” while proudly multi-tasking and feeling so much smarter than challenged, one-dimensional drivers. Some are so bold as to hold the iPhone up to the bottom or even the top of the steering wheel, tiring of raising their eyes every four seconds to view the road. If only the lives of pedestrians, bicyclists, motorcyclists and other drivers and passengers were not at stake!

Tracking local votes

With the recent attacks on the press, I want to say how much I appreciate The News-Journal’s column entitled “Florida Tally: How Your U.S. Lawmakers voted.” It’s helpful for your readers to stay informed about how our lawmakers are voting, and to track their support or opposition to issues they find crucial in their community.

I was alarmed, for example, to learn last week that U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis voted to reduce the power of the Federal Trade Commission to regulate the derivatives (swaps) market. Remember, these financial instruments were designed to expressly benefit large banks and institutions, leaving average citizens at great risk. The 2008 global financial crisis was caused, in large part, by that gamble finally collapsing — costing many middle-class families their homes and life savings.

I’m glad to know where DeSantis stands — valuing the profits of large financial institutions over average Floridians’ economic security.

The fact that DeSantis voted to allow insurance companies to deny health care to those with pre-existing conditions was even more troubling to me. Knowing that he voted against an element of the Affordable Care Act that had bipartisan support was, frankly, terrifying. Considering how many people could lose their coverage without such protections should be a concern to all of us, whether or not we supported him in this last election.

I do have one suggestion. If you could publish the bills that are going to be voted on in advance, it would be even more helpful. This way, the public could call their congressmen (202-225-3121) or senators (202-224-3121) to let their voices be heard before votes happen.

The next play

The phrase “impeachment” is already being tossed about.

I’m waiting for someone to catch it and run for a touchdown. It is then that the bands will play and the flags will wave and wave and wave.

Kate Ruhlman Claim victory

Being brought up in the middle of the middle class, I saw Donald Trump’s victory as inevitable. It was plain (except to establishment elites) that Middle America was completely done with the economic deprivation of globalist hegemony. It was obvious that too many were riding in the wagon, with too few pulling. It was time for taxpaying citizens to take back their country.

Admittedly, prior to Inauguration Day, there remained a nagging doubt that somehow the powers that be might stop him. But they couldn’t. He outworked, outflanked and outsmarted the entire Washington-media-Hollywood army of arrogance.

President Trump for U.S. Let’s roll.

Cost of immigration

As a taxpayer I have often wondered why the costs of illegal immigrants living in our country are not deducted from any foreign aid provided to their country of origin. As of 2015, there were an estimated 73,665 non-U.S. citizens in state and federal prisons, accounting for approximately 5 percent of the prison population and costing taxpayers (based on 2012 figures) an average of $31,286 annually for a total cost of approximately $2.3 billion. Additionally, any costs associated with returning the released prisoners to their original home should also be recouped.

Also, according to the Center for Immigration Studies, illegal immigrant households receive an average of $5,692 in federal welfare benefits every year. Why can’t their countries of origin pay for their illegal presence and costs to U.S. taxpayers? One can only imagine how many taxpayer dollars would be saved by this action.

Trump’s moves

In light of the recent actions of our new president, it is clear that he is comfortable with letting the taxpayers fund his follies. Billions for a wall that Mexico isn’t buying, another extensive study searching for nonexistent voter fraud, a pipeline from Canada that we don’t need, relocating the U.S. Embassy in Israel, etc. The fun just never ends. Perhaps he should set up a GoFundMe account and give his wealthy friends a chance to pay for his foible-induced conjurings. How about an intervention or some therapy? Has a president ever been &quot;Baker acted&quot;?
