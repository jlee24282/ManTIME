<TEXT type="str">The latest eruption of Bogoslof volcano Tuesday morning sent a relatively low-altitude ash cloud east over Unalaska, but the cloud dissipated with no reports of ashfall in the Aleutian Islands port. 
 
Unalaska police dispatchers said at 11:30 a.m. Tuesday that they had received no local reports of ashfall. 
 
An update from the Alaska Volcano Observatory&apos;s Facebook page on the eruption said the cloud, at an estimated altitude of 25,000 feet, was produced by an eruption beginning at 4:53 a.m. Tuesday. Bogoslof is on an island about 60 miles west of Unalaska. 
 
&quot;A volcanic cloud was observed in satellite data beginning at (5 a.m. Alaska time),&quot; AVO staff wrote. &quot;Subsequent images show the volcanic cloud moving towards the east. The cloud is ice-rich, but likely contains volcanic ash.&quot; 
 
Michelle Coombs, the observatory&apos;s scientist in charge, said volcanologists notified state officials early Tuesday but had expected only possible trace amounts of ashfall in Unalaska. 
 
Brian Hagenbuch, a general aviation meteorologist with the National Weather Service&apos;s Alaska Aviation Weather Unit in Anchorage, said that an advisory to pilots for the ash cloud was canceled at about 11:20 a.m. 
 
The cloud passed over Unalaska between 7 a.m. and 7:30 a.m., Hagenbuch said. Its subsequent track on radar took it east over the Gulf of Alaska, where it dissipated later Tuesday morning. 
 
Bogoslof has been erupting since mid-December, sending ash clouds to altitudes of up to 31,000 feet. Last week, an ash cloud from the volcano forced several aircraft to divert around it. 
 
Coombs said there wasn&apos;t any immediate prognosis for future eruptions at Bogoslof, given its unstable behavior. 
 
&quot;We feel like it&apos;s Groundhog Day because it keeps erupting, but previous eruptions have lasted three weeks â€” we&apos;re already beyond that,&quot; Coombs said. &quot;Certainly these eruptions, these explosions, could continue on, but we&apos;ll just have to see.&quot; 
 
At about 9:45 a.m. Tuesday, AVO said it had been tracking an &quot;energetic earthquake swarm&quot; since Monday near another Aleutians volcano, Takawangha. A description of the volcano, about 60 miles southwest of Adak, notes that &quot;no historical eruptions are known from Takawangha.&quot; 
 
&quot;The earthquakes locate 6 to 7 kilometers (east-southeast) of Takawangha volcano,&quot; AVO staff wrote on Facebook. &quot;This activity may be due to brittle failure in the surrounding rock caused by magma movement.&quot; 
 
Although no eruptive activity was detected at Takawangha, the observatory raised its aviation color code to yellow and its alert level to advisory. Bogoslof&apos;s aviation color code remained at red and its alert level at warning, the advisory&apos;s highest levels.
