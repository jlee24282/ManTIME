<TITLE>LC men drop third-straight game at LeTourneau</TITLE>
<TEXT>LONGVIEW, Texas (LC) - Due to their worst shooting performance of the season, the Louisiana College men were out paced by LeTourneau Saturday afternoon in Longview, 88-68. The loss is the third straight for the Wildcats and their 10th overall in conference play. LC is still mathematically alive for the final tournament spot out of the East, but will need some help over the next two and a half weeks to get into the bracket. 
 
A sluggish first few minutes of the game for the Wildcats carried over through the rest of the afternoon, leading LC to their lowest shooting percentage of the season, going 24-of-71 from the floor in the game for 33.8%. The Wildcats started the game 3-for-9 from the floor in the first five minutes of play but were only down 7-6 at that point. 
 
The Wildcats hung around over the next 10 minutes of play and eventually tied the game thanks to a 3-pointer from Jacquez Coleman, knotting the game at 23 with just under seven minutes remaining in the half. That was the point, however, when LeTourneau would seize control of the game, outscoring LC 16-1 over the final seven minutes of the half. LC went a miserable 0-for-12 from the floor during that stretch, that included several point-blank attempts at the basket, finishing with an 11-for-38 (28.9%) performance for the first 20 minutes. 
 
LC continued to play hard in the second half but the 39-24, halftime deficit was too much for them to overcome in the game. Both teams were even on the offensive side in the second half in terms of rebounds, turnovers, assists, and points, a 49-44 advantage for LeTourneau in the half. LC missed six more shots than the Yellowjackets did in the second half and were outshot 55.9% to 39.4% in the half. 
 
Even with the shooting troubles of the game, Raheem Reigs led the way for the Wildcats once again with his sixth double-double of the season, and his third in the last four games, scoring 20 points and pulling in 10 rebounds. After missing Thursday's game due to concussion symptoms, Taylan Grogan bounced back with an 18-point outing with five rebounds, the only other Wildcat to reach double figures in the game. He converted on 4-of-6 shots from behind the arc in the second half and made 5-of-7 overall. 
 
The Wildcats return to H.O. West Fieldhouse on Thursday for a rematch with the LeTourneau Yellowjackets in the first of a five-game home stand. LC will tip-off Thursday night at 7:30pm and then host UT Tyler on Saturday afternoon at 3pm.
