Fitted T-shirts with Star Wars logo, shopper bags with Darth Vader prints, smartphones cases, and even leggins featuring motifs known from the movie, are idea for those liking pop cultural inspirations. According to current trends, the design of space gadgets and clothes reflects street wear fashion. Pieces in the line are minimalistic, in a simple, monochrome black &amp; white style. Star Wars symbols have been taken with a pinch of salt. Designers incorporated them as comic book stamps, printed on sweatpants and shirts. Multiplication of tiny decorative objects provides unique effect, unobtrusively referring to the movie themes. The Star Wars line also consists of unisex accessories, like black baseball caps and trendy pins. Collection is available online as well as in the boutiques.</TEXT>
