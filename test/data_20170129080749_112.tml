<TEXT type="str">Zach Fischer tried to deliver a knockout blow to the Brandon Wheat Kings in the first period of their Western Hockey League game on Saturday, but it was Ryan Jevne who eventually landed it in the third period. 

Fischer dropped the gloves with Shael Higson less than a minute into the game, it was Jevne who scored twice, including a empty-netter with two minutes remaining in the game, to lift the Central Division-leading Tigers to a 6-4 victory. 

Medicine Hat (34-15-1-0) caught defenders from Brandon (23-19-4-1) watching the puck a few times, which concerned Wheat Kings head coach David Anning. 

&quot;I just felt our play away from the puck in terms of awareness and positioning wasn’t good enough,&quot; he said. &quot;I felt we had a lot of guys who were focused on the puck and not their responsibilities and as a result we gave up some dangerous looks.&quot; 

The Tigers capitalized 2:13 into the first period when Matt Bradley found Mason Shaw trailing the play. Shaw snapped a shot into the top corner of the net to open the scoring. A few minutes later, Wheat Kings goalie Jordan Thompson made a great save on a short-handed two-man breakaway to keep Brandon within one. 

The Wheat Kings evened the score 1:58 into the second period when Connor Gutenberg ripped a Kale Clague pass past Tigers netminder Michael Bullion. Ty Lewis put Brandon up 2-1 later in the frame, but James Hamblin tied it 44 seconds later when he split the defenceman and scored on a breakaway. 

With 27 seconds left in the frame, Jevne trailed the play and netted his first goal of the game to give Medicine Hat a lead it wouldn’t relinquish. 

Matt Bradley of the Tigers and Tanner Kaspick of the Wheat Kings scored 14 seconds apart early in the third period before Chad Butcher skated into the zone and sniped a shot past Thompson with 3:10 remaining. Jevne added an empty-netter before Zach Russell closed out the scoring for Brandon with 52 seconds remaining. 

Anning felt his side had a lot of chances, but failed the pull the trigger. The Wheat Kings recorded only 22 shots on goal. 

&quot;I felt that we generated enough scoring chances, especially in the third period I thought we had some really good looks and scramble plays at the net,&quot; he said. &quot;I don’t think we did a good enough job on execution to force their goaltender to make enough saves. When you don’t get the puck to the net, you don’t give yourself opportunities to score and you don’t have those opportunities to get second chances and really get their defencemen into a scramble mode. We need to do a better job executing.&quot; 

Anning will look for a lot of improvements when his side visits the Calgary Hitmen today at 5 p.m. 

It’s an important game for both teams as Brandon holds the first wildcard spot in the Eastern Conference with 51 points, while Calgary is one point behind Saskatoon for the second spot with 45. 

&quot;Tomorrow’s a big game for us,&quot; Anning said. &quot;It’s a big game for our hockey club. It’s a game with playoff implications. It’s a team that’s starting to score more here and is right in the mix. We have to clean up those areas of the game, have good focus and make sure the work ethic and energy is where it has to be and we’re willing to grind to get two points on the road.&quot; 

ICINGS: Brandon F Meyer Nell returned to the lineup for the first time since Dec. 30 when he suffered a lower-body injury … The Wheat Kings scratched F Nolan Patrick and Stelio Mattheos (Top Prospects Game) and injured F Linden McCorrister … Brandon was 1-for-3 on the power play, while Medicine Hat was 1-for-4.
