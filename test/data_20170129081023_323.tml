Aaron Samuel has joined Russian club PCF CSKA Moscow in a four-and-a-half-year deal. 
 
The attacker joins from Chinese Super League club Guangzhou R&F. 
 
Samuel spent part of the 2015/16 season on loan at CSKA and scored twice in five league appearances for the club. 
 
He has now sealed a permanent deal at the club which will see him remain in Moscow until 2021. 
 
Aaron Olanare has joined #CSKA today on 4.5 year deal. Welcome back, Aaron!, the clubs official Twitter account announced late on Saturday to herald the return of the 22-year-old who has been capped twice by Nigeria at senior level. 
 
The striker has since joined the rest of his teammates in Campoamor, Spain. 
 
Samuel has previously played for Norwegian clubs Valeranga and Sarpsborg.</TEXT>
