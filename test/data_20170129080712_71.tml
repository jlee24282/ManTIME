Justin Bieber might have just scored himself a second career in hockey. 
 
The 22-year-old singer made quite the impression at the NHL All-Star Celebrity Shootout on Saturday, where he joined Wayne Gretzky&apos;s winning team. 
 
Bieber was all over the ice during the game, completing successful zone entries and drawing penalties before chipping in offensively as well, as he picked up an assist on Eric Lindros&apos; goal. 
 
It was a big comeback for the Biebs, who was pinned against the glass by Chris Pronger earlier in the game. 
  
Is it too late now to say sorry? #NHLAllStar

It seems Bieber was able to get out some frustration during the game. 
 
Just last week, the &quot;Sorry&quot; singer reacted to news of ex-girlfriend Selena Gomez&apos;s new romance with the Weeknd, making it clear h e&apos;s not a fan of her new beau -- or his music, at least!</TEXT>
