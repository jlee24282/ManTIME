Author: Dennis Koller 
   
Publisher: Pen Books, 340 pages 
   
&quot;The Custer Conspiracy&quot; is the third offering by San Francisco author Dennis Koller in the Tom McGuire suspense series. It follows &quot;Kissed by The Snow&quot; and &quot;The Oath.” Most of the characters created in the book are action personalities with a big liking for law enforcement and weapons. 
   
Along these lines, if you like suspenseful, fast-moving detective stories, this would be an entertaining choice. 
   
Starting with international intrigue, the book quickly moves to the connection with Lt. Col. George Custer through a modern-day ill-fated meeting between the main character, Tom McGuire, and an close friend at the Little Bighorn Battlefield Monument near Hardin, Mont. With the death of McGuire’s friend Matt Conroy, the stage is set for the remainder of the book and amounts to a whodunit. 
   
With an almost cavalier style, the author blends mystery, murder, guns and beautiful women that would heavily appeal to the military/law enforcement background reader. Together with the continual almost prayerful stories about outlandish sniper shooting plus an almost godlike praise for those capable of 1,000-plus-yard headshots, the book also appeals to the military sniper-worshiping crowd. 
   
The main character comes across as a undiscovered super-asset who moves seamlessly from San Francisco detective through FBI and CIA contacts and crisscrosses the country on his journey to solve the mysterious killing of an old friend, and the motive of the international arms cartel behind that cowardly act. 
   
While the book is a fun ride, there is one irritating factor in the organizational details: The book&apos;s 340 pages are split into 89 chapters, some just two or three pages long. What nonsense. 
   
Also, without revealing the details of the plot, there are many who will be insulted by the disparaging reference and fictional treatment of Custer in this book. The author takes great liberty in plucking an American hero from history and assigning him a less-than-honorable characterization. 
   
As the book moves quickly to what seems a foregone conclusion, it is nevertheless quite entertaining and very easy reading. Notwithstanding the strange chapter divisions, I would recommend this intriguing tale. Good reading.</content>
