<content type="str">KANO Pillars forward Amos Gyang has said experience will make a huge difference in the top-flight clash at Mountain of Fire Miracles Ministries (MFM) FC. The Pyramid City are guests of the Olukoya Boys today’s Nigerian top-flight matchday 5 clash at the Agege Township Stadium in Lagos.

The former Nigerian champions are coming into the clash from a loss at Sunshine Stars while the Lagos outfit were classic in the midweek clash 1-1 draw at Shooting Stars Sports Club (3SC).

Gyang said his side cannot afford to disappoint after they received huge motivation and support from the management and teeming supporters.

&quot;Of course, the league race has always been the survival of the fittest, we are fit, strong and will bank on our versed experience to undo MFM FC. &quot;Everybody knows that MFM FC are good and young. We will dig deep into our experience to shape the outcome of the match.

&quot;I know the match will be tough but once we are able to put to full use our style of play, we are certain to come out with a good result.

&quot;Already we have told ourselves that we cannot afford to lose six points at a stretch, it’s sure to hurt our dream for the season.

&quot;We are okay and mentally fit to challenge MFM FC for the maximum points and I know we will come out unscathed,&quot; said the former Giwa FC marksman to supersport.com.

The Kano outfit have claimed six points from a possible 12 in the four-week-old top flight.</content>
