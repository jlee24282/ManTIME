<TITLE>Voice of the Reader: Soda and cents</TITLE>
<TEXT>To the Editor:

There was an article in the Jan. 18 issue of newspaper titled Soda and Cents. It described a new bill that proposes a tax on sugar sweetened beverages, syrups or powders sold or offered for sale to a consumer. It would be a penny per ounce. The bill was introduced by State Sen. Toi Hutchinson, who is a Democrat from Chicago Heights. It requires that the distributors of sugary drinks to obtain permits, which of course would not be free.

We are already taxed quite vigorously and vehemently here in Illinois, thank you very much. This idea is crazy. The tax would be imposed on everybody, not just those who enjoy some sugar now and then. Restaurants would hike the prices on everything they sell. Distributors would be troubled with more paperwork, the state would add more bureaucrats to keep track of it all, and worse yet, the aforementioned lunacy would probably be just the first step on a steep, slick and slippery slope, as slick as a disgusting substance spread on a door knob. You may think this is funny but it's not. Like when youre dancing with your honey and her nose is kind of runny. Why is it not funny?

It is not funny because if they can get away with taxing sugary drinks, they could get away with taxing, say, candy, cakes, sugar for your coffee and sugar for you tea. They would gladly tax delicious donuts dipped in rich yummy chocolate and topped with colorful sugar sprinkles. Some barbeque sauces have a lot of sugar in them too. Ice cream, shakes and sundaes, and lets not forget cookies for crying out loud. Go for it! Be sure to include brownies, Ho-Hos, Twinkies, Ding Dongs, and even Forest Gumps moms box of chocolates.

Go right to the source and tax the sinister substance itself, sugar. White and brown, raw and refined, granulated and powdered should all be included. Grab on to glucose, fructose, maltose, lactose and galactose. If Senator Hutchinson figures that the state can rake in 560 million dollars just on taxing sugary beverages then she should consider the billions it could rob by taking on and taxing all sugar sold in Illinois. Wouldnt that be sweet! Editor's note: According to reporting from The Southern's Springfield bureau, the proposed bill to tax sugar-sweetened drinks has been put on hold.</TEXT>
