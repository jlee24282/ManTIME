<TITLE>Pinning up confidence</TITLE>
<TEXT>The girls in this competition may spend hours perfecting the perfect hair-do, finding a snazzy lip colour and creating their outfits  but for Ballarat pin-up girls the focus is not on the fashion. The girls in this competition may spend hours perfecting the perfect hair-do, finding a snazzy lip colour and creating their outfits  but for Ballarat pin-up girls the focus is not on the fashion. Women of all shapes and sizes, body types and backgrounds are encouraged to enter the annual Ballarat Beat Pin-up competition. 

For a number of weeks the 34 contestants mainly women, but a few men  have rehearsed their routine, learned about pin-up and blossomed with confidence

Organiser Tracey Spencer calls pin-up the embodiment of old-world values.

The focuses are on the glamour, challenging yourself, increasing your confidence, Ms Spencer said.

This year the competition has categories including classic, which is the vintage style, modern which means reproduction, psycho-billy, ink swimwear  which gives tattooed women the opportunity to show off their tattoos, geekabilly and couples. 

We have girls up to size 22  its all about developing the confidence and finding clothes that suit the body type, Ms Spencer said.

Co-organiser and pin-up girl Miss Lippy-Lush also known as Amanda Rush never imagined she could make it as a pin-up girl.

I always loved the style but never thought I could wear it, Ms Rush said.

One day I got an outfit, spoke to Tracey and that was it  I was hooked. 

The pin-up girl movement experienced a resurgence about five years ago and that is continuing to grow and expand, Ms Spencer said.

Its about loving yourselves and your differences, Ms Spencer said.

We are all different  we would be pretty boring if we werent.

This is not just about fashion it is really about so much more. 

Competitors must perform a routine on the day where they take on a persona of a pre-1970s character, supply three poses and do a performance.

The competition will be held on February 11 at 2pm in at the Ballarat Mining Exchange. 

The Ballarat Beat Rockabilly Festival runs from Thursday, February 9 to Sunday, February 12 and includes performances by Jive Cats, Hillbilly Hellcats and Cherry Divine and a battle of the bands.
