<content type="str">UK Prime Minister Theresa May announced a defence deal between BAE Systems Plc and Turkish Aerospace Industries to develop Turkey’s first home-built fighter jet, calling it a step to expand trade with the nation.

“It marks the start of a new and deeper trading relationship with Turkey, and will potentially secure British and Turkish jobs and prosperity for decades to come,” May said as she arrived Saturday in Ankara, a day after meeting US President Donald Trump. This first agreement, worth $125.6 million, could facilitate “multi-billion pound” deals between the two countries in the future, the government said in its statement.
