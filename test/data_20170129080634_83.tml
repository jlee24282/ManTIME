<TEXT type="str">To the Editor: To all those people out there screaming bloody murder over the possible defunding of Planned Parenthood, if you are really so concerned about the dire consequences that you predict will result from such an act, then why do you not dig into your own pockets to fund it instead? 

After all, if the pro-life groups can maintain a whole host of far more extensive services entirely through voluntary donations of time and money, why can&apos;t you do the same? Especially given the wealth of your supporters: the Obamas, the Kerrys, now George Soros, and Ross Perot, etc. 

Or is the depth of your convictions limited to the use of other people&apos;s money?
