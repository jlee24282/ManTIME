<TITLE>This 30-Year-Old Picture Landed A School In Hot Water; Should It Be Removed? (Photo)</TITLE>
<TEXT>RoysterMiddle School, a public school in the small town ofChanute, Kansas, has removed a picture of Jesus from a hallway after a complaint was made by a group committed to defend the separation of church and state. 
 
The Freedom From Religion Foundation (FFRF) demanded that the middle schools superintendent RichardProffittremove the image, which has reportedly been hanging in the school for decades, the Wichita Eagle reported.

A lawyer for the district advised that the school was breaking the law by displaying the picture. 
 
We were notified and we responded to stay in compliance,Proffittsaid, according to the Wichita Eagle.

The image was a print of a work painted by WarnerSallman, an evangelical Christian artist. But nobody seems to know precisely how long it has been in the school. 
 
I do know its been decades,Proffittsaid. Some people who went through the system before  30 to 40 years ago  knew it was hanging in the hallway back then. It was kind of a permanent fixture, if you will. 
 
TheFFRFargued that as a public institution, the middle school was not permitted to display religious symbols. 
 
Its nice to have people who appreciate the law and get things done (and) who follow the law even if its likely to be unpopular in the community, Ryan Jayne of theFFRFsaid. 
 
We dont consider any constitutional violation to be petty and not worth going after, Jayne added. 
 
Some local residents expressed their disagreement with the move. 
 
SamanthaBarnhart, a former student atRoysterMiddle School, saithat non-Christian students always had the option of sitting out the pledge of allegiance or Christmas celebrations. 
 
If you have the right to not participate, we have the right to keep our picture up, she told the Wichita Eagle. Just dont look at it. 
 
Jayne countered that especially in communities where religion is a major factor, such as inChanutewhere there are around 30 churches in a town of 9,000, religious symbols must be removed from public buildings to protect religious minorities and atheists. 
 
Otherwise, [t]hey are extremely likely to remain political outsiders, Jayne said. 
 
FFRFtook up a similar case in Jackson, Ohio, last year, the Eagle reported. 
 
A school district was displaying the sameSallmanprint, but was forced to remove it and pay $95,000 in legal fees afterFFRFand the American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit.
