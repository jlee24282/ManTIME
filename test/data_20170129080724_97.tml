<TITLE>Mark Binder: Americans must oppose Trump at all costs</TITLE>
<TEXT>This is what dictatorship looks like. A leader in office  whether elected or by junta  wields every aspect of power according to his agenda or whim. 
 
Compromise is not an option. Because we are a democratic republic, parliamentary defeat is not an option. The only option is staunch opposition and sweeping implementation of every check and balance available. 
 
We must call on our elected representatives to oppose and block any and every action that moves our country backward. They must attack with rhetoric and legislation, filibusters and many votes of Nay. 
 
We cannot negotiate with terror nor reason with megalomania. The dreams and possibilities for the United States of America have eroded; now we are on the brink of collapse. I charge our senators and representatives to do everything to stop our president. Block him at every turn. 
 
They must abandon past practices and give up the notion that their vote on any issue or appointment will produce reasonableness in exchange. It is already clear that the president believes his vision and mandate is absolute; he owes nothing to anyone. Accommodation today will be treated as license for tomorrows insane agenda, not a return to the center. 
 
We must support our representatives in standing firm against tyranny  no matter what the danger. To do less will be to abdicate our responsibility to the greatness of America.
