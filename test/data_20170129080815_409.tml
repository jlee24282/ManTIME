DES MOINES — As we end the third week in our legislative session, I do have good news. We have finely reached an agreement on the FY 2017 Deappropriations Budget Bill for the $117 million revenue short fall that we have experienced. 
 
Additionally, as part of this bill, the legislators will vote to reduce their compensation by 10 days at the end of session for approximately a $360,000 savings. Negotiating the FY 2017 Budget Bill was an extensive process, getting the governor plus the senate and the house to all agree on the figures that we thought was appropriate. 
 
We plan to vote on this bill next Monday, Jan. 30. 
 
We hope this will pass so we can move on to other priorities that we have this session. We have already introduced over 100 bills that have been proposed so far this session. There are several bills that I feel are very important to the people I represent in District 5. 
 
Number one is House File 1 (HF 1) which is a process to review all state programs on a minimum rotation every five years. HF 1 will make sure that we stay current with our appropriations funding and that the programs are viable to the functions of the state. Another bill presented will protect our students from sexual exploitation by school employees which is an extremely important issue. 
 
We will watch this issue as they proceed through the voting process. 
 
Moving forward for FY18 the house, senate, and governor have agreed to a maximum level of spending totaling $7.455 billion. This agreement is within ongoing revenue and is $25 million below the 99 percent expenditure limitation. If the March revenue estimate is lowered, then that maximum spending level will be lowered. House Republicans have not agreed to spend $7.455 billion only that this number is the ceiling. A total spending level below that amount could still be approved. 
 
With revenue projections being very unpredictable over the last several budget years, a conservative approach to the budget is necessary. Current law allows the Legislature to spend 99 percent of available revenue; however, House Republicans will look to spend less than the allowed ceiling in the event that revenue projections are inaccurate again. 
 
On Saturday, Jan. 28, I will be attending and participating with Senator Bill Anderson in several forums in the following towns and locations: 
 
• 9–9:45 a.m. — Moville Forum, Fire Station, 24 W. Main St., Moville. 
 
• 10-10:45 a.m. — Pierson Forum, City Hall, 201 Main St., Pierson. 
 
• 11:15 a.m. to noon — Kingsley Forum, Community Building, 207 East First St., Kingsley. 
 
• 12:45–1:30 p.m. — Remsen Forum, Three Sisters Bistro, 203 Washington St., Remsen. 
 
I hope to see you at one of the forums.</TEXT>
