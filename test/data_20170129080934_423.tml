<content type="str">A Tokyo branch of cafe-restaurant chain Pronto has begun holding morning comedy skits to lighten people&apos;s moods before they head to work. 
 
The skits at the eatery&apos;s Kanda store in Tokyo&apos;s Chiyoda Ward were planned to boost morning sales, which are already doing well. For about 25 minutes starting at 8 a.m. on Jan. 18, around 50 people watched three comedy skits performed by professional actors in a space on the shop&apos;s second floor. 
 
Sayaka Tomita, 31, from Nagareyama, Chiba Prefecture, said, &quot;The topics of the skits were everyday and funny, so I think it&apos;d be easy to come to this even for people who aren&apos;t used to live performances.&quot; 
 
The morning skits come with a start-the-day set that includes coffee, toast and salad, a drink certificate usable at night when the cafe becomes a bar, and the morning edition of the Mainichi Shimbun newspaper, for 1,000 yen, tax included. Chikako Hirose, the head of the Pronto Corp.&apos;s PR department, says, &quot;We want people to charge their batteries and go to work feeling good.&quot; 
 
The skits will be held on Tuesdays and Wednesdays through Feb. 14. For tickets and inquiries, the Kanda cafe can be reached at 03-3254-8202 (in Japanese language only).</content>
