<TITLE>Film Screening Followed by Personal Tale</TITLE>
<TEXT>The Westport Cinema Initiative (WCI) today presented a screening of the 1997 film In & Out as part of the Westport Librarys WestportREADS Bettyville book selection. The book by George Hodgman explores the authors identity as a gay man. The movie stars Kevin Kline who plays a popular teacher, who is gay, and is outed by a former student. After the Town Hall showing, Westport filmmaker Doug Tirola (l) discussed the film with Westport writer, author, and soccer coach Dan Woog, who described his own decision to disclose his homosexuality. While he was worried about the reaction, he said he was relieved to find that he received nothing but kind words. I am sure things were said behind my back but most comments were of support, Woog said. (CLICK TO ENLARGE) Phyllis Groner for WestportNow.com
