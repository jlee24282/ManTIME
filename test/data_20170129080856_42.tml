<content type="str">William “Billy” Bendle, 60, of Carson City, NV, formerly of Amsterdam, OH, passed away January 21 at his home. 
  
A son of the late John H. Bendle and Donna (Griffiths) Bendle, Billy also was preceded in death by his sisters, Holly Bendle and Cindy (Bendle) Croskey. 
 
Billy is survived by brothers, John R. Bendle of Richmond, Kevin (Christy) Bendle of East Springfield, Spencer Bendle of Amsterdam, Mitchell Bendle of New Concord, Nick Bendle of Thornville; sisters Debbie (Dave) Grimm of Granbury, Texas, Bunny (Rob) Rucki of Killbuck, Marsha Bendle (Rick Stevens) of Thornville; as well as many nieces and nephews and his close friend and ex-wife, Linda Bendle. 
 
He also leaves behind his furry friend, Emma, who may have been the love of his life. 
 
Billy was one of 11 children of John and Donna and was by far the most ornery. He contributed to more of his parent’s gray hair than the rest of his siblings combined … a fact that we are sure he was proud of. 
 
Bill was quite the athlete in his younger days. He was also quite the “scrapper” and was never one to back down from a fight, despite his small stature. It was good to have Bill in your corner. He was colorful and charismatic with a quick wit and a big heart. He worked as a meat cutter at Sabol’s Market in Amsterdam, OH, and was a favorite of store patrons. 
 
He then headed west where he worked as a popular bartender at the Timber’s Saloon in Carson City, where he was known as “Bronco” to many. 
 
Bill was an avid sports fan and backed the Ohio State Buckeyes, Notre Dame, and the Pittsburgh Steelers. He loved fishing and the outdoors and was an avid reader. 
 
Billy’s family is thankful for the many friends in Carson City who helped during these past several years when his health was failing. A Celebration of Life will be held in Amsterdam, OH, and Carson City, Nevada. Details will be posted when finalized.
