<content type="str">First, I’d like to say to those companies that don’t want to come to N.C. because of us wanting men to use men&apos;s bathrooms and women to use women&apos;s bathrooms to stay away if that’s their real reason, because God will bless those that honor him and do the right things. What people do is a choice — you are not born that way. We are all born a sinner. God gave us choices; he didn&apos;t want robots. 
 
Second, about the letter: God gave us Trump but not as a blessing. Need to read all of Romans 1-28 to get real reason why God gave them over to a retrobate mind (a mind void of judgement)? 
 
We are suppose to pray for those that have authority over us. So pray for our leaders that God will cause them to make right decisions. If we all do that who knows what would happen in America. I don&apos;t think I’&apos;ve ever heard Mr. Trump say God. God moved upon leaders in Old Testament times to make decisions. He’s the same God now. Thank God for Jesus. Let’s trust him. God bless all.
