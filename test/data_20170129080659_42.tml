<content type="str">New Delhi : Stock market sentiment in the days to come would be driven by the country&apos;s first biggest economic event of the year, Union Budget due on February 1, say experts.  

&quot;This time market is approaching the Union Budget with very high expectations as this is the first budget after demonetisation. The market perceives the budget as an opportunity to fix the derailment caused to the growth trajectory,&quot; India Nivesh said in a report.  

&quot;The upcoming budget will be a key event from an equity market perspective. We believe the expected measures to reduce tax liability for individuals may provide a much-needed boost to the consumer-related sector,&quot; Motilal Oswal Securities said in a report. </content>
