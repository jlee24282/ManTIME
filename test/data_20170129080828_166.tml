Maskell won a second stand-up paddleboard title and added the open shortboard crown to his achievements this year at the Redhead event, which is part of the Surfest carnival.

Maskell, who surfed two rounds and a final in each category, said he was ”over the moon&quot; with his title double.

Redhead’s Matt Rawson and Justin Lee won the longboard and over 30s shortboard sections respectively.

The host club also secured a wildcard into next weekend’s Surfest Team Challenge at Stockton with victory in the Boardriders Challenge at the Lake Macquarie event.

In the women’s SUP event, Peru’s Brissa Malaga beat Newcastle’s Roxanne Masters.
