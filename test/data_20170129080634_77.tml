FORMER Bedford High School quarterback James Caparell had everything planned. After graduating from the University of Rhode Island in May, he would pursue his master&apos;s degree and use his final year of athletic eligibility at Division III Plymouth State University. 

Then, the NCAA messed up those plans last week by voting against a proposal that would have allowed students in Caparell&apos;s situation to transfer and participate in athletics at any Division III institution. 

Caparell&apos;s next move is still to be determined. 

&quot;I was really banking on that Division III rule going through,&quot; he said. &quot;I was 100 percent going to go to Plymouth. That would have been ideal. I went up there a couple times to visit. It has a good MBA program. affordable and it was close to home. 

&quot;Now I&apos;m kind of starting over again. I&apos;ll have to do a little more research and send out film to other schools.&quot; 

Caparell had a rocky career at URI, which changed head coaches after his redshirt freshman season. His best year came in 2014, when he appeared in 10 games and made six starts at quarterback. 

Caparell holds the NHIAA record for career passing yards (5,389). He tossed 50 touchdown passes at Bedford, and finished his high school career with 1,222 yards rushing and 23 rushing TDs. 

He said he will likely start contacting Northeast-10 schools to see if there&apos;s a good fit. St. Anselm&apos;s is not an option because it does not offer a master&apos;s program. He said there&apos;s no chance he&apos;ll return to URI. 

&quot;No. I already got my release,&quot; he said. &quot;I have no interest in staying here. I&apos;d like to stay close to home, and I want to go someplace where I can play.&quot;

Salem resident Matt Vartanian , a freshman on the Wentworth Institute of Technology men&apos;s basketball team, was named the Commonwealth Coast Conference Rookie of the Week for games played from Jan. 16-22.

Windham&apos;s Connor Hopkins made the Northeast-10 Honor Roll after he won two events and picked up five top-three finishes for St. Michael&apos;s College last weekend. He won the 100 free (50.91), anchored the third-place 200 medley relay (1:48.21) and nabbed fifth in the 200 free (1:57.66) during a 154-65 loss to Bentley on Saturday.
