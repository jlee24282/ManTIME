<TEXT type="str">The extreme heat will continue on Monday night through to Tuesday before an afternoon cool change brings some relief. 
 
&quot;It&apos;s going to be a hot start to the school year,&quot; Bureau of Meteorology duty forecaster Rob Taggart said. &quot;Dropping off the kids, it&apos;s going to feel pretty warm and humid.&quot; 
 
While a sea breeze will keep Sydney&apos;s predicted maximum to a comparatively mild 32 degrees on Monday, Richmond is poised to break an all-time record with a sixth January day above 40 degrees. 
 
There will be no relief on Monday night with temperatures in the west still hovering around or even above 30 degrees at midnight, Mr Taggart said. 
 
Compounding the heat is a &quot;widespread severe fire danger&quot; in southern NSW and far western NSW on Monday, with a &quot;very high fire danger&quot; for Sydney and the Hunter region, Mr Taggart said. 
 
In central and south-western parts of state, last year&apos;s floods have left the region vulnerable to grass fires . 
 
&quot;Grass fuel loads are pretty high because of all that rainfall,&quot; Mr Taggart said. &quot;The grass is pretty brown and there&apos;s a lot of it. It&apos;s ready and waiting to go.&quot; 
 
The state&apos;s maximum temperature is expected in Wilcannia, with a blistering top of 46 degrees.

If this January has seemed hotter and drier than usual, that&apos;s because it has been - especially at night. 
 
Maximum daytime temperatures in Sydney last January averaged 27.4 degrees. This January has so far averaged 29.1 degrees, which should rise with two more hot days to end the month. 
 
Meanwhile, Sydney has smashed the previous record for hot nights in January, with four nights (so far) staying above 24 degrees. The previous record was two. 
 
Sydney is on track to break the record for the number of summer days above 35 degrees, with just two more needed to break the all-time record 
 
Mr Taggart said this January has been &quot;almost certainly one of the hottest on record&quot;. 
 
And the heat won&apos;t end this week. Next weekend is forecast to again hit 40 degrees, Mr Taggart said, as the Bureau forecasts a &quot;hotter than average&quot; February with hot conditions pushing into March. 
 
January is also likely to end with less than half the month&apos;s average rainfall. So far the city has had 48.8mm, much lower than the average of 102.5mm. 
 
It&apos;s also significantly less than last year when Sydney received 249.8mm during January. 
 
Elsewhere in the state, Moree is in the middle of a remarkable hot streak, with the town sweltering through 34 consecutive days above 35 degrees. Mr Taggart expects that to stretch to 41 days based on current forecasts, close to the state record. 
 
&quot;The forecast for the next seven days is pretty horrific,&quot; Mr Taggart said. &quot;That heat is completely unrelenting.&quot; 
 
&quot;The forecast seems bad for Richmond and Sydney, but it&apos;s nothing compared to Moree.&quot;
