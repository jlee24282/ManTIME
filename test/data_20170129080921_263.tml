In a statement the party said the NEC has set up a committee responsible of election campaigning  and all party members willing to stand as Members of Paliarment and or Councillors on MRP ticket are advised to contact the committee members particularly Ackim Mhlanga who is tasked with the responsibility of collecting forms from aspiring candidates. 

&quot;Mthwakazi Parliament; all our Members of Paliarment begin work (today) and your term will be five years starting from the day you are sworn in at our Conference, we will not be limited by the 2018 election. The education sector remain our single most important target as we will be working with communities to clean our education system in Mthwakazi. Our Manifesto will be published any time from now so that people will be familiar with it . The NEC plans to visit all our diaspora structures this year to explain the party&apos;s vision and policies of the party as we are gearing for the elections which to us are as good as a Referendum because the result of which will motivate our people even more to work towards restoration of our state,&quot; said the party. 

&quot;The International lobby Committee will be formed later this year and is set to start work. As we expect our petition to be ready by then. Transparency is our motto and we have zero tolerance for corruption. All MRP members must stay away from corruption of whatever form or magnitude as we strive for a better Mthwakazi. Finally Mthwakazi omuhle say NO to Harare led political parties let&apos;s protect our space. Now is the time say no to all of them.&quot;
