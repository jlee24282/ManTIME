<TITLE>Breckenridge Ski Resort great for a romantic getaway</TITLE>
<TEXT>Snowflakes floating from a gray sky tickled my face and sent a chill up my spine. 
 
I snuggled closer to my husband, our legs dangling from the lift at Colorado's Breckenridge Ski Resort, where fresh snow dropped onto tree branches and formed a fluffy blanket below as we inched higher up the mountain. 
 
"I'm sooo cold," I said slyly as I laid my head on his shoulder. 
 
He smiled at the inside joke, a flashback to a simpler time in our relationship: before kids, before marriage, and all the other life stresses that had consumed us of late. 
 
Seven years ago, on our third date, we headed to the slopes of Mountain High, a small resort an hour and a half from Orange County, Calif., for a night session on fresh powder. He, apparently, didn't know it was a date and thought I just wanted a friend to hit the slopes with. And he, apparently, didn't realize how sexy I thought his snowboarding skills were. 
 
So I scooted closer to him on the lift and declared that I needed warming up, an invitation to wrap his arm around me. That night, we shared our first kiss. 
 
While most of our weekends are consumed with surfing, snowboarding is a close second when winter months roll around. We've surfed and snowboarded in the same day, taken quick weekend getaways to nearby Big Bear, or made the longer trek to Mammoth Mountain. 
 
We sighed with sadness when we realized last year our snowboard gear had collected dust all season. Having our second child just before winter made it impossible. 
 
So when my husband, Jon, editor for action sports website GrindTV, told me about a trip he had to take in early December to Breckenridge for the Dew Tour festival, I let out a desperate plea. 
 
"Can I come?" I asked. 
 
Don't get me wrong, I love my kids. But any parent with two young children will tell you that sometimes you just need a break from the crying and screaming and servitude that come with being a mom. And thankfully, gracious grandparents allowed us to make our getaway. 
 
The flight from Orange County was easy, a 2 -hour jaunt into Denver. With snow in the forecast, and we being native Californians who freak out about driving in any kind of weather, we opted to hitch a ride with Colorado Mountain Express. 
 
As we got closer to the mountain, the snow really started to come down. We were just about jumping out of our seats at the sight of fresh powder. 
 
A passenger in the caravan had a tip for us as we arrived at the DoubleTree hotel, known for its chocolate chip-walnut cookies at check-in. 
 
"Hit the bar across the street at Beaver Run; the drinks are way cheaper over there," said Phil, a ski judge in town for the competition. It was too late to hit the slopes when we arrived, so the bar across the street would be our first stop. 
 
The next morning, we woke to a winter wonderland - the storm had brought about half a foot of new snow, and the town was buzzing about it. 
 
With my husband already on the mountain covering the competition, I found myself sharing the gondola with local skier Susan Briggs, who was heading up to watch her niece, Keri Herman, in the women's ski slopestyle event. 
 
It turned out Briggs was an expert on the topic of love on the slopes. After meeting on match.com six years ago, she and her now-boyfriend Dan Herman had their first date on the slopes. 
 
With Dan, she knew it was love on first lift. 
 
That got me excited to see my hubby, who was able to sneak away from work long enough to take a few runs with me. 
 
We felt like our younger selves as we raced down the mountain. We stopped, sneaking a kiss as we took a moment to soak in the beauty surrounding us. 
 
The food options in Breckenridge are endless. One night, we stuffed ourselves at Michael's Italian Restaurant, putting back all those calories we burned on the slopes. The tortellini I ordered swam in a basil cream. 
 
On our last night we found a meal to satisfy our chilly bones as the snow continued to fall, at a Vietnamese joint called Pho Real that had opened a few months before. Seems we weren't the only ones who enjoyed hot soup on a cold night, with a line out the door of people putting in their orders.</TEXT>
