<TITLE>Pause to reflect on pet safety during walks</TITLE>
<TEXT>Dear Heloise: I like to walk my dog early in the morning, so I wear a reflective vest. But my dog is black and not easily seen. So, I got another vest and cut it down to fit him. The vests are held together with a hook-and-loop closure, so I can make it fit perfectly snug on my black Lab/greyhound mix, Black Jack. 
 
Now everyone can see us, and I feel safer knowing that we are visible to oncoming traffic.C.P.S. in Virginia

DAILY PILLBOX USES 
 
Dear Heloise: Those weeklong pill-of-the-day medicine boxes are handy for things beside pills. They work well to store portions of fish food, or tiny dried shrimp for turtles, and medications for dogs or cats, too. 
 
I'm sure your readers would have other uses; how about if they suggest some?Brenda in New Hampshire

EASY WAY TO BRUSH 
 
Dear Heloise: I've discovered an easy way to brush the dog. I found an "undercoat rake" at the pet store. It is specially built to loosen and remove more hair from the dog than regular brushing. This is all fur that is loose but doesn't come off without a struggle. The rake makes grooming much easier, and it is safe and painless for the animal. I love it!S. Anderson, via email
