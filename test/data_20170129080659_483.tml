Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif had formed this committee for the clearance of Indian movies to be screened in Pakistan. Marriyum, who is heading the panel, said the clearance to any foreign content will be given according to the Commerce Ministry’s new import order.

“Importing the foreign content will be planned and the content will be shared with the censor board and passed through other procedure,” the Dawn quoted Marriyum as saying.

She clarified the NOC cannot be issued without the consent and endorsement of her ministry, adding the entire process will take some time.
