Not-so-spoiler Alert: Flume topped the Hottest 100 with &apos;Never Be Like You&apos;. But if you&apos;re still asking &apos;where the hell was [insert artist who isn&apos;t Flume]!?&apos; then you&apos;ll want to see if they turned up in the other 100 hottest songs of 2016. 

Today we counted down the Hottest 200 -101 , a list of all your favourite tunes that didn&apos;t make the main countdown, and the artist who just missed the Hottest 100 cut-off was Trophy Eyes . 

The road ready Newcastle punk/rock crew came in at #101 with &apos;Chlorine&apos;

Coming in at #102 was Bon Iver with &apos;33 &quot;GOD&quot;&apos; and main man Justin Vernon popped up again at #190 as a guest on James Blake &apos;s lyrically misheard &apos;I Need A Forest Fire&apos;. 

He was also one of 61 artists who missed out in the Hottest 100, including Drapht, Allday, Kaytranada, Jack Garratt, Phantogram, Emma Louise, San Cisco, Skepta, AlunaGeorge, and &apos;Boysing&apos; sensation Lisa Mitchell . 

Nick Murphy &apos;s &apos;Stop Me (Stop You)&apos; appeared at #108, plummeting a fair way from his #6 ranking with Marcus Marr in last year&apos;s countdown. You&apos;ve also gotta feel for strong historic Hottest 100 contenders Matt Corby, The Temper Trap and Ball Park Music - they each had multiple entries in the Hottest 200 but not in the main countdown. 

Sticky Fingers cracked three songs in the Hottest 100 and got a whopping five more into the second half. King Gizzard, Chance The Rapper, Frank Ocean, DMA&apos;S, Camp Cope, D.D Dumbo and Beyonce were just some of the other artists carrying over into the Hottest 200. 

There&apos;s 16 songs with features in the mix and 6 Like A Version covers, including Sarah Blasko &apos;s heartbreaking tribute to David Bowie . The Thin White Duke himself appeared at #166 with his swansong &apos;Lazarus&apos;.

Just like the main countdown , the Hottest 200 had a strong Aussie presence: 67 songs came from homegrown acts, 16 from the USA, 11 from the UK, 3 from Canada, two from NZ, and one each from Norway ( AURORA ), Japan ( BABYMETAL ), and France ( Madeon teaming up with Porter Robinson .) 

Additionally, 35 songs were from artists with at least one woman: 15 solo female artists, 13 bands with at least one female member, and seven ladies on key features.
