<content type="str">Early civilizations used various types of vessels, made from animal skin or clay, to carry water from its source for consumption in royal palaces, peasant households and war zones. At present, the synonym &quot;bottled water&quot; refers to containers of various sizes that provide drinking water to consumers. The modern water bottling industry was launched in the 1960s when plastic was invented.
