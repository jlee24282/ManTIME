<TEXT type="str">A fan-funding campaign for a follow-up to 2015&apos;s Pillars of Eternity, Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire, is now live. 
 
Obsidian Entertainment, the developer behind Fallout: New Vegas, South Park: The Stick of Truth, and the original Pillars of Eternity, launched the campaign on Fig . The campaign has an overall goal of $1.1 million USD. [ Update: The campaign goal was achieved in under 24 hours. The funding now stands at $1.5m at the time of writing.) 
 
According to Obsidian, Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire &quot;improves upon the rich narrative, beautiful environments, and intricate, tactical combat&quot; that helped make the first game a success. 
 
The sequel sees players return to the world of Eora, this time to explore the Deadfire Archipelago. Traveling &quot;by land and sea,&quot; players move from island to island, exploring the environments and smoothing out relations between the locals, &quot;trading companies, and bands of fierce pirates.&quot; 
 
Obsidian CEO Feargus Urquhart said the goal with Pillars of Eternity II is to improve &quot;on what fans loved about the original while adding features our fans want to see,&quot; such as more freedom for players to explore the world. 
 
In our Pillars of Eternity review , we called it one of the best RPGs since Baldur&apos;s Gate. The crowd-funding campaign for Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire is live on Fig . The game is being developed for PC, Mac, and Linux.
