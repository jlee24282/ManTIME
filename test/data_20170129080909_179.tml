<TITLE>Telly With Melly: Bob Martin of Michael: Every Day talks own phobias</TITLE>
<TEXT>Whether its Every Day or just Tuesdays and Thursdays, Bob Martin is immersed in the world of therapy and one particularly memorable patient. Martin stars as therapist David in CBCs dramatic comedy Michael: Every Day, now in its second season after a five-year hiatus. (Season 1, dubbed Michael: Tuesdays and Thursdays, wrapped up in December 2011.) 
 
Davids patient Michael (Matt Watts) is back working with him and the two are continuing to build on their symbiotic relationship. The final two episodes in the six-part run air Sunday night. Martin spoke about the show, his own phobias and working with old friends. 
 
Q Whats your own personal biggest neurosis? 
 
A I have a severe elevator phobia. Its a huge, huge problem for me. I spend half the year in New York, so its almost impossible for me to escape elevators 
 
Q What is it about elevators? 
 
A Its not about dying in them, its not about the crashing, or the cords breaking. Its just simply about being in a box and not being able to do anything. Its a control thing. But I deal with it. I kind of do the immersion therapy approach: I just get in the elevator, but its extremely unpleasant. 
 
The nice thing is I work in musical theatre, and David Foster is a very successful composer who cannot get in elevators at all. So every time I ask to take the stairs, they always bring up David Foster. So I feel like Im in good company.

Q Youre the co-creator, executive producer, writer and star  do you enjoy being responsible for everything? 
 
A I do. Im very much a control freak. Theres a lot of me in that character, for sure. In fact, I would say that David is all the worst parts of me. I would love to be a psychologist, so its great for me to live vicariously through that character, to enact all my worst possible scenarios in life through that character. 
 
In order to do that, I have to write it too. Although, Matt (Watts) wrote two episodes and Lynn Coady wrote two episodes. I was kind of the head writer, and Don (McKellar) and Matt and I conceived the whole series, so its a very collective effort. 
 
Q Youre working with a lot of same people  it mustve been pretty seamless, getting back together for Season 2. 
 
A Don and I have a long creative history. We went to high school together, and we worked on things all our lives together. The musical that brought me to New York  The Drowsy Chaperone  Don and I wrote that together as well. He really took a lot of the load this season because of my crazy schedule. 
 
And Matt and I are like brothers  weve also known each other since I was in my 20s. This series, its inspired by all Matts craziness. When CBC approached me to develop a series, I was friends with one of the producers and I was talking about something Matt had told me. We both thought it would be a great idea for a series, and what he was describing was really the first episode of Season 1  an exercise he did with his therapist to deal with his issues with small talk. 
 
Jennifer Irwin is an old friend of mine who I worked with at Second City, and she plays Sammy in the series, and Tommie-Amber Pirie (Claire) is a close friend. So for sure, its a group of people who are used to working together and are comfortable with each other.
