<content type="str">Los Angeles - What&apos;s an All-Star Weekend without a little bit of the P.K. Subban show? After Saturday night&apos;s Skills Competition, Subban took over reporting duties for the LA Kings team site and threw some questions at defenseman Doughty, who was a good sport about the entire thing.

Towards the end, Subban asks Doughty what the plans are for hanging out later, to which Doughty is very non-committal. Also, if you listen carefully, you&apos;ll catch Subban asking &quot;was that ok?&quot; as he hands off the microphone.</content>
