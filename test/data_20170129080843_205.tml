<TEXT type="str">Los Angeles - What&apos;s an All-Star Weekend without a little bit of the P.K. Subban show?

Towards the end, Subban asks Doughty what the plans are for hanging out later, to which Doughty is very non-committal. Also, if you listen carefully, you&apos;ll catch Subban asking &quot;was that ok?&quot; as he hands off the microphone.</TEXT>
