<TEXT type="str">Guides laughingly point out that the fellow in this Snapshot is not pointing to the rest rooms in the visitor center. 
 
He is Brigadier General John Stark, and that lofty tower behind him is the Bennington Battle Monument in Bennington, Vt. 
 
Gen. Stark is pointing west, toward the enemy encampment and the site of the battle, a pivotal clash between British troops and American militia on August 16, 1777. 
 
Following a brutal defeat at Bennington, the British forces (mostly Hessian) were weakened and eventually surrendered in Saratoga, N.Y., two months later. 
 
The 306-foot high obelisk is the tallest structure in the Green Mountain State. President Benjamin Harrison dedicated it on the 100th anniversary of Vermont statehood in 1891. 
 
An elevator whisks visitors to the observation deck, where the view from the top extends to the hills of Massachusetts and New York State. 
 
Exhibits and informational placards at the base of the monument and in the visitor center illustrate the importance of the battle 
 
It was Gen. Stark who in a toast to the survivors of the battle at Bennington urged them to &quot;Live free or die!&quot; That quote by that Vermonter became the motto of the neighboring state of New Hampshire. 
 
And, by the way, the restrooms at the visitor center really are over in the direction where the good General is pointing.</TEXT>
