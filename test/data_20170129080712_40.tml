Like many in New Jersey, I am concerned about the extreme agenda that the Republican Congress and President Trump are rapidly implementing. I want to know if my congressman, Rodney Frelinghuysen, will represent a more moderate voice. I recently called his office and the conversation went like this: 
 
Me: Hi, I’m a constituent and I would like to know when the Congressman is holding his next town hall. 
 
Answer: He has them by phone now. 
 
Me: OK, how do I sign up? 
 
Answer: You can’t. It’s random. 
 
Me: Then how do I know when they are happening? 
 
Answer: You don’t. No one does. 
 
Me: Sorry, I’m confused. 
 
Answer: That’s how it is. 
 
I later learned this is an accurate description of “Robo Town Halls”; unsolicited, random calls at unannounced times designed to replace and avoid face-to-face meetings between real live people. 
 
For the record, if I could meet Congressman Frelinghuysen at a local town hall, I would ask him four questions: 
 
• Will he clearly explain how the Affordable Care Act will be replaced? 
 
People deserve to hear a plan. 
 
• Will he disavow Republican tax policies that favor the wealthiest 1 percent and harm the citizens of New Jersey compared to citizens in states like Texas and Indiana? 
 
• Will he protect women’s health and reproductive rights, an issue he had long supported until recently, by allowing Planned Parenthood to be reimbursed by Medicaid for Pap smears and contraception? 
 
• And finally, will he promise to prioritize funding for a tunnel between New Jersey and New York City before any funding for a border wall in the South? Our transit situation is getting desperate and must be addressed urgently. 
 
I don’t expect to be called to attend a “robo town hall” and I would probably be working anyway. But I would appreciate the chance to know where my congressman stands on vital issues.
