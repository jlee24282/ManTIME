What do a fruit grower, a high school student, a mayor, a teacher and a college student have in common? 
 
They’re all immigrants, in one way or another. 
 
Nearly 100 people attended a panel discussion about immigration at the Mesa County Central Library on Saturday, and five Grand Valley residents spanning several decades talked about their experiences living in — and sometimes feeling separated from — their local community. 
 
For a few of them, like Grand Junction Mayor Phyllis Norris and longtime Palisade fruit grower Bruce Talbott, immigration dates back hundreds of years, to when their ancestors first arrived in the American colonies. 
 
For West Middle School teacher Therese Moran, who is Native American, moving across the country was the result of circumstance as often as it was of choice. 
 
For Colorado Mesa University student Shristi Adhikari, who immigrated from Nepal as a child, and Palisade High School student Emad Shahnoushi, who immigrated from Iran as a child, growing up in two countries has produced struggles and victories. 
 
Adhikari was at the panel in place of her father, Kamal, who has worked at the Nepal Restaurant in downtown Grand Junction for more than a decade. She moved to Grand Junction from Nepal when she was 12 years old. 
 
“My dad really wanted us to be able to succeed, and that’s one of the main reasons he came to the U.S.,” she said. “Every day I’m so grateful for my dad and what he’s done.” 
 
Adhikari said it was hard adjusting to the language and culture for the first three years she lived in the United States. 
 
“I have struggled and I do struggle, but through all of those struggles and adversity I’m still very, very grateful,” she said. 
 
Shahnoushi said his father was separated from his family for long periods of time in his efforts to move from Iran to the United States, first for multiple failed attempts to get a visa from the American embassy in Turkey, and later in moving to Hong Kong for two years to obtain a visa there. 
 
“We went through a lot of hardships to get here,” he said. “(My father) is the reason I’m here today and the reason I’m able to have these opportunities.” 
 
Talbott said he doesn’t often experience discrimination within his orchards and farms. 
 
“We are dependent on a quality of worker that we can’t get indigenously,” he said. 
 
But when his workers seek employment other places in the Grand Valley, racial discrimination is a factor. 
 
There were a few moments of visible frustration, and one audience member vocally disavowed President Donald Trump’s recent ban on refugees and travelers from several predominantly Muslim countries, including Syria. 
 
But overall, attendants and speakers spoke of the need for unity. 
 
“It takes each and every one of us to do it, and it takes a lot of hard work,” Norris said.</content>
