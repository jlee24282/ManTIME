<TITLE>Trump, Merkel discussed NATO, Middle East in...</TITLE>
<TEXT>American President Donald Trump and German Chancellor Angela Merkel discussed issues ranging from NATO to Russia to the situation in the Middle East during a 45-minute telephone call on Saturday, their first since the Republicans inauguration.

The conversation affirmed the importance of close German-American cooperation to each countrys security, the White House said in a statement on the call. Trump accepted Merkels invitation to attend the G-20 summit in Hamburg in July and said he looked forward to hosting the chancellor in Washington soon. The talk between the two leaders came an hour before Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and other top White House officials spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump spoke later with French President Francoise Hollande. Merkel has pushed the US to maintain sanctions on Russia over its incursion into Ukraine, and has denounced the Russian leader for his support of Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad amid that countrys bloody civil war.
