<content type="str">LUGANSK, January 29. /TASS/. Units of the Ukrainian Armed Forces over the past 24 hours four times opened fire on the militia’s positions in the self-proclaimed Lugansk People’s Republic (LPR), the republic’s defense authority told LuganskInformCenter on Sunday. 
 
&quot;From Krymskoye they shelled Frunze and Novogrigorovka, using IFV weapons, mortars and small arms,&quot; the agency quoted the authority. 
 
Under fire were also Kalinovo and Kalinovka, the source added. 
 
On December 21, 2016, the Contact Group seeking to find a solution to the Donbass crisis agreed to introduce a ceasefire in Donbass starting from midnight December 24. The current attempt to &quot;indefinitely&quot; cease the fire in Donbass has become the tenth since the conflict erupted in south-eastern Ukraine. 
 
The Package of Measures to fulfil the September, 2014 Minsk agreements, known as Minsk-2, that was signed in Minsk on February 12, 2015, envisaged a ceasefire regime between Ukrainian government forces and people’s militias in the self-proclaimed republics in Donetsk and Lugansk (DPR and LPR) starting from February 15, 2015, and a subsequent withdrawal of heavy weapons from the line of engagement. The deal also laid out a roadmap for a lasting settlement in Ukraine, including local elections and constitutional reform to give more autonomy to the war-torn eastern regions.
