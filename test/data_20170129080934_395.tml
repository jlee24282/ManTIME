<content type="str">Q: I recently booked a flight for my son to fly from Los Angeles to Madrid through American Airlines&apos; website. Within 24 hours, I canceled the flight. My son spoke to American on the phone and was told the refund would be credited to his credit card &quot;soon.&quot; 

It&apos;s been more than a month. My credit card payment is due in three days and the charge still shows as &quot;pending review.&quot; Can you help? - Sampath Radhakrishna, Cupertino, Calif. 

A: Your son&apos;s reservation fell under the &quot;24-hour rule,&quot; which says that if you cancel an airline ticket within a day of making the reservation, you&apos;re entitled to a full and prompt refund. (Certain restrictions apply for last-minute tickets.) 

How prompt? Well, that&apos;s the problem. When a refund is due, the airline must forward a credit to your card company within seven business days after receiving a complete refund application, according to the Department of Transportation. But the credit may take a month or two to appear on your statement. 

Your son was at about the one-month mark. He&apos;d been left with the impression that his refund would be issued &quot;soon&quot; and had interpreted that as less than a month. In fact, American would have been well within its rights to wait two months before returning the money. 

Let&apos;s pause for a moment to consider the absurdity of this situation. An airline is allowed to keep your money for two months - can you say &quot;interest-free loan?&quot; - while the rest of us must pay our bills promptly. Oh, and how long does it take American to withdraw the money from your son&apos;s account? Seconds. 

Something is just not right with this. American should have returned the money. In seconds. 

This isn&apos;t an American problem or even an airline problem. Corporate America creates rules that favor it and allow it to benefit from holding on to your money for a few extra weeks. I&apos;ve asked executives about the sluggish refund process, and they&apos;ve told me, with straight faces, that the problem is exacerbated by credit card billing cycles and overly cautious accounting processes. I think that&apos;s nonsense. If they benefited from speedy refunds, they would have figured out a way to send you the money instantly. But they have no motive, so here we are. 

A brief, polite email to one of American&apos;s customer service executives might have shaken a check loose from the accounting department. I list names, numbers, and emails on my consumer advocacy site: elliott.org/company-contacts/american. 

I contacted American on your son&apos;s behalf and it informed me that your refund had been processed - hopefully in time for him to avoid paying a big credit card bill.
