<TEXT type="str">Dead Rising 4 will be getting two new difficulty modes and a Street Fighter outfit pack for free on January 30, Capcom has announced. 
 
In addition, starting January 31 Dead Rising 4 will be getting an hour timed trial for Xbox One. Players will have access to Story Mode and multiplayer and all achievements earned and saved game progress will carry over into the full game if the game is purchased after the trial. 
 
In the two new difficulty modes, enemies do more damage, Frank’s weapons break faster, and food restores less health than before. The five Street Fighter outfits, some of which can be seen below, can be accessed by visiting your in-game wardrobe.
