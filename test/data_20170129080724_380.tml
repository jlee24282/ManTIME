<TITLE>Buchanan repeats as Hardman Award winner</TITLE>
<TEXT>For The Herald-Dispatch 
   
MORGANTOWN - It's not easy to surprise Kadeisha Buchanan. 
   
Winning the 2016 Hardman Award as the state of West Virginia's top amateur athlete did just that for the former West Virginia University women's soccer star. 
   
Buchanan also claimed the award last year and is the first female repeat winner of the oldest statewide award, which dates to 1934 and honors the late Charleston Gazette sports editor A. L. "Shorty" Hardman. 
   
The award is voted on by members of the West Virginia Sports Writers Association. 
   
"I am very honored and in a bit of shock to hear that I have won the Hardman Award again," said Buchanan, a defender who is playing professionally with Olympique Lyonnais, in France. 
   
"I was lucky enough to win the award once, but to win it again is a true honor, I believe this is a great reflection of my hard work paying off." 
   
Buchanan. a native of Brampton, Ontario, is the first repeat winner since Marshall University quarterback Rakeem Cato, who won the award for 2013 and 2014. 
   
She will be honored May 21 at the 71st Victory Awards Dinner at the Village Square Conference Center in Clarksburg, W.Va. 
   
Buchanan edged out WVU rifle standout Ginny Thrasher in the Hardman balloting. Thrasher led WVU to an 18th NCAA national title and earned the first Olympic gold medal of the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Summer Games. 
   
Ryan Switzer and Segar Bonifant also received support. Switzer is a Charleston native and record-setting University of North Carolina football player. 
   
Bonifant starred for the West Liberty University men's basketball team. 
   
"Any kind of recognition 'Keisha' can bring to soccer and this university she is so proud of," WVU women's soccer coach Nikki Izzo-Brown said. "For her to represent West Virginia University with such a prestigious award throughout the state just means everything to her. She cares so much about West Virginia and obviously the women's soccer team and the athletic department." 
   
Buchanan's remarkable year included leading the Mountaineers to their first appearance in the NCAA Soccer Cup finals and taking home a bronze medal in the Rio de Janeiro Summer Olympic Games with the Canadian women's national team. 
   
She also won the 2016 Hermann Trophy as the NCAA/s top women's soccer player. She is a four-time All-American and four-time Big 12 Conference defensive player of the year. 
   
Izzo-Brown said it was an honor to coach Buchanan and watch her development as a player and person. 
   
"She wouldn't say a word her freshman year on the field to anybody and then she was commander-in-chief this past season on the field," Izzo-Brown said. "No question physically, athletically, tactically, technically and then mentally she grew so much here." 
   
Buchanan said she will look back fondly on her time in West Virginia. 
   
"I'll always remember the tremendous support I received from the WVU staff and the West Virginia citizens," she said. "The love and support they show the WVU women's soccer team is like nothing I've ever seen before. 
   
"Everyone made it very easy for me to call West Virginia University and Morgantown my second home."</TEXT>
