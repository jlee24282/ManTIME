Ravishing in red: Nicky Whelan (L) put on a busty display in a crimson gown as she attended the annual G&apos;Day USA Gala with fiancé Kerry Rhodes (R) on Saturday 
  
In images snapped from the red carpet, the beaming pair cut equally glamorous figures for photographers. 
 
Nicky&apos;s stunning gown tightly hugged her slender frame, as she parsed her plump lips to form an elated smile. 
 
The sleeveless outfit exposed the beauty&apos;s bare chest, her ample cleavage all-but spilling over the top over the low-cut dress 
 
The crimson silk number was accessorised with a small rectangular clutch and simple pearl earrings.  
   
Fancy! The 35-year-old former Neighbours star exposed her ample cleavage in the stunning Alexander McQueen outfit 
  
Earlier, Nicky shared an image to Instagram thanking prolific designer Alexander McQueen for her outfit.  
 
Her hunky lover looked dapper in a traditional black suit and tie combination, as he towered over the blonde beauty. 
 
Kerry, 34, added a more contemporary flair to the look, opting for super-skinny pants and loafers without socks. 
 
He held his wife-to-be just beneath the bust, shooting a rugged gaze to camera. 
   
Natural! Nicky tied her plump hair back into a tight bun, as a close-up snap gave her fans a good look at her radiant, natural complexion

Her alluring blue eyes were accentuated with tasteful winged eyeliner, while she opted for natural-looking makeup for the rest of her radiant face.  
 
Also in attendance at the diplomatic Australia-USA relationship-enhancing event were John Travolta, Nicole Kidman and Ben Mendelsohn. 
   
True love: The couple got engaged one year ago 
  
Kerry and Nicky began dating in 2015, before announcing their shock engagement in February last year. 
 
In September, Kerry was injured by a traumatic car-crash, later taking to Instagram to share an image of his swollen feet. 
 
The pair are still yet to set a date for their wedding.
