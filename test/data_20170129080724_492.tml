<TEXT type="str">By I was a Cold War kid. My father served in England during World War II. A family friend was an American agent in Berlin. It was no surprise I spent a childhood fascinated by espionage, Spy versus Spy in Mad Magazine and the CIA.  
 
What I didn’t know was that the father of the CIA had a summer home in Nonquitt.  
 
Col. Wild Bill Donovan was what we don’t have many of currently — an authentic American hero.  
 
The CIA website has 220 articles detailing his career. Their biography of him notes:  
 
Donovan was the only American to have received the nations four highest awards: the Medal of Honor, the Distinguished Service Cross, the Distinguished Service Medal, and the National Security Medal. After his death, Donovan was awarded the Freedom Award of the International Rescue Committee. He is also a member of the Military Intelligence Hall of Fame.  
 
In June 1942, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt established the Office of Strategic Services, the OSS. It was the predecessor of the CIA. Col. Donovan, a World War I hero, lawyer and student of Europe became director. He already was a close friend of Winston Churchill and Sir William Stephenson, head of the British espionage effort that among other things broke German codes. The president had been using him as an unofficial agent.  
 
Donovan oversaw 7,500 agents overseas during the war. Of those, 900 were women; 116 OSS agents died. The OSS had everyone from historians to baseball players and lawyers working for them. Their job was to collect information and act on it. They knew about the plot to assassinate Hitler. They discovered his plans for the bomb.  
 
It was Donovan’s wife, Ruth Rumsey Donovan, who brought her family to South Dartmouth. Her father had been one of the richest men in America. Her money financed a very WASP lifestyle for Donovan, an Irish guy from Buffalo who was supposed to become a priest. The priesthood could never have held Donovan.  
 
In 1928, according to Donovan’s biographer, Douglas Waller, “Ruth also later bought a sprawling lodge in the upper class resort village of Nonquitt, Massachusetts. It had nine bedrooms and a wide front porch that offered a perfect view of Buzzards Bay. Nonquitt became her and the children’s refuge from Washington’s oppressive heat each summer. Donovan at first spent many weekends there, sailing and playing tennis but soon tapered off because he found the beach house boring.” It remained in the Donovan family until 1979.  
 
William J. Donovan died on Feb. 8, 1959 at 76. On Nov. 3, 1959, his widow was brought in a black limousine out to the countryside of Langley, Virginia. That day President Dwight David Eisenhower laid the cornerstone of CIA headquarters. Under the cornerstone is a box of CIA founding material including: 
 
Memorandum for President Franklin D. Roosevelt from Major General William J. Donovan, director of the Office of Strategic Services, dated Nov. 18, 1944, regarding the establishment of a permanent centralized intelligence service.  
 
The CIA does not forget their own. The stars and names mean something, An OSS Gallery is inside the agency museum.  
 
The exhibition catalog notes: 
 
A statue of Maj. Gen. William J. Donovan stands in solemn watch next to the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) Memorial … Donovan is responsible for developing the five principles of the CIA:  
 
• Be an independent agency, 
 
• Be able to do overt and covert action, 
 
• Set the tone for how intelligence would be gathered in the community, 
 
• Coordinate all the intelligence community, and 
 
• Have no police powers.  
 
The memorial recognizes OSS agents killed during their service. There is a recreation of Wild Bill’s office — desk, medals, map case.  
 
Symbolically, visitors then step from Donovan’s office into a busy hallway of present-day CIA.  
 
While I was writing this column, I found that Wild Bill Donovan lives on not just at Langley, but in films, television series and more. Beginning with Michael Cabin’s novel, Moonglow, a brilliant fiction based on his grandfather’s life, I found Donovan. On Page 37, he is described, “Though he looked like a English lawyer, my grandfather could smell the army on him. The man took the measure of my grandfather coldly and openly, top to bottom.” Chabin’s character has been discovered in a sort of plan to blow up a Washington bridge just to prove it could be done. On Page 38 the man is named — Wild Bill Donovan. He puts the young delinquent soldier to work for him.  
 
The Town of Dartmouth has a lot of memorials. I think Donovan deserves one.</TEXT>
