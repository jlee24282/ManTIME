<TEXT type="str">New Delhi: Delhi High Court is likely to pronounce its verdict tomorrow on several contentious issues relating to the functioning of DDCA and holding of cricket matches by it at the Ferozshah Kotla stadium here.  

A bench of justices S Ravindra Bhat and Deepa Sharma had in September last year reserved its judgment on the plea of Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA) for an occupancy certificate from South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) to hold matches at the stadium. 

While reserving its verdict, the bench had observed that permissions for holding matches would be &quot;tricky&quot; because of the stadium&apos;s R P Mehra block, which is allegedly unauthorised as it was close to a protected monument.  

The court had initially appointed Justice (retired) Mukul Mudgal, former Chief Justice of the Punjab and Haryana High Court, to oversee and streamline the holding of matches at the stadium.  

Thereafter, he was also assigned the task of overseeing the functioning of DDCA in the backdrop of alleged irregularities in the cricketing body&apos;s operations.  

DDCA had opposed the appointment of any person or committee to oversee its affairs, saying it was a company and such administrators were appointed only for &quot;sick&quot; firms.  

It had contended that there was already a machinery in place under the Companies Act to supervise its functions and no administrator can be appointed.</TEXT>
