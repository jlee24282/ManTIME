<content type="str">A company advertising for a &apos;gintern&apos; has cherry picked its favourite applicants from more than 5,000 hopefuls who will now have to prove their drinking abilities.

The dream job will see one lucky person travelling the world sampling different versions of the delicious drink while being paid £20,000 a year.

And so unsurprisingly, when the advert was first posted it generated plenty of interest, so much so that the company behind it – ILoveGin – had to delay their recruitment process.

However, now it is time to move onto the next stage, which will see ILoveGin contact the best applicants to ask them to review a recent gin or mixer. As the process continues, future rounds of &apos;ginterviews&apos; will include visiting distilleries and plenty of taste-testing.

Toby Vacher, who founded ILoveGin.com, said: &quot;We knew people would love the Ginternship, but we never expected more than a few hundred to make the effort to apply.

&quot;&quot;We&apos;ve been blown away by the interest, and even seen news channels in Europe and the USA pick up the story!

&quot;One of them ran a feature preceded by Snoop Dogg singing about &quot;Gin &apos;n&apos; Juice&quot;.

&quot;The world has gone gin-crazy, and we&apos;re hoping to help more and more people discover their new favourite G&amp;T!&quot;

Whoever eventually gets the job will work one day a month in London – but the rest of the time they can set their own hours and travel to discover new drinks. The two-day-a-week internship will run for six months and &apos;may lead to a full-time position&apos;.

The job spec says you&apos;d typically be visiting &apos;1-2 new gin companies each week&apos; and, apart from the day in London, &apos;you&apos;ll be able to work remotely from home (a coffee shop or wherever you wish)&apos;.
