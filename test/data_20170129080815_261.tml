<TEXT type="str">SANAA -- Helicopter-born commandoes, believed to be Americans, launched a raid in southern Yemen at dawn on Sunday that killed several people, including three al Qaeda suspects, residents told Reuters.

The gunbattle in the rural Yakla district of al-Bayda province killed a senior leader in Yemen&apos;s al Qaeda branch, Abdulraoof al-Dhahab, along with his two brothers.

&quot;The operation began at dawn when a drone bombed the home of Abdulraoof al-Dhahab and then helicopters flew up and unloaded paratroopers at his house and killed everyone inside,&quot; one resident said, who spoke on condition of anonymity.</TEXT>
