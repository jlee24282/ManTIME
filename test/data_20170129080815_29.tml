<TITLE>Space still available at this years National Career Showcase</TITLE>
<TEXT>If there are any businesses or participants that still wish to be a part of the National Career Showcase this year, space is available. 
 
This was revealed by the guidance counsellor of the St. Leonards Boys Secondary School, Shernell Belle-Alexander recently during the launch of the National Career Showcase which was held at the University of the West Indies, Cave Hill Campus (UWI). 
 
Belle-Alexander revealed that it would be greatly appreciated if more participants and sponsors came on board for this years event and noted that there are different packages that persons will be able to select from; all they need to do is get into contact with the Barbados Association of Guidance Counsellors (BAGC) or any of the guidance counsellors at the secondary schools.  
 
She went on to formally thank the investors that currently invested in their cause and acknowledged that they could not have pulled off the showcase without them. 
 
This launch could not have been done by counsellors alone and we are very appreciative of the help that we are able to have, she said. 
 
Saul Leacock, President of the BAGC, mentioned that preparing for the showcase took much effort, stress and collaboration and explained that it was a partnership that was developed between the BAGC and participants. 
 
Leacock went on to say that business owners should see their investment in the National Career Showcase as an investment into the future workforce of Barbados because the children are the future of Barbados. 
 
The President added that he was grateful to the investors because they helped and aided guidance counsellors in their role of assisting in the development of productive, well-rounded, focused and organised citizens of Barbados and explained that that was what the showcase was designed to do. He said that it would be a showcase to help them explore their options in any possible career field from an early age. 
 
Representative of UWI and Head of Recruitment and Marketing, Janet Caroo, said that they looked forward to once again hosting the students and assisting them in making the necessary decisions to form their futures. (CLF)</TEXT>
