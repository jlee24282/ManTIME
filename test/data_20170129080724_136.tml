Page 3 of 6 News Qatar  Qatar's trade surplus reaches QR10.75bn in December  A surge in value of crude exports, ahead of the January 1 deadline for production cuts, helped Qatar's trade surplus reach QR10.75bn in December 2016, showing a stupendous growth of 21.7% YoY and 10.7% MoM. Japan, South Korea, India, China and Singapore were among the largest export markets of Qatar, while imports mainly came from the US, the UAE, China, Japan and Germany in December 2016, figures released by the Ministry of Development Planning and Statistics showed. Higher exports and lower imports had resulted in Qatar's MoM gain in trade surplus, while on a yearly basis, imports decelerated much faster than exports. A robust expansion in shipments to Singapore and China led the countrys total exports (valued free-on-board) grow 2.6% MoM to QR19.29bn. On a yearly basis, total exports had fallen 2.6%. The countrys total exports of domestic products increased 3.5% MoM to QR18.58bn in December 2016, while it recorded 3% YoY decline. (Gulf-Times.com)  CI affirms Qatars foreign, local currency ratings, upgrades outlook to stable from negative  Global credit rating agency Capital Intelligence (CI) has affirmed Qatars long-term foreign currency and local currency ratings of AA- and its short-term foreign and local currency ratings of A1+, while upgrading the outlook for ratings to stable from negative. The outlook revision reflects the resilience of the Qatari economy to low hydrocarbon prices, as seen by the continuation of positive economic growth and maintenance of comfortable fiscal and external buffers, CI said, adding the revision also factored in its expectation of narrowing fiscal and external current account deficits in 2017-18. The Qatari economy is expected to have grown by about 3.4% in 2016 against 3.3% a year ago, underpinned by a 6% expansion in non-hydrocarbon gross domestic product (GDP) and is slated to grow at a similar rate in 2017-18. The public finances remain manageable, despite budget deterioration, it said, adding the budget is expected to have posted a deficit of 2.7% in 2016 against 1.2% surplus in 2015. Assuming a modest rise in hydrocarbon prices in the short-to-intermediate term and government measures to rationalise public spending, CI expects the deficit to decline over the coming years. (Gulf-Times.com)  Private healthcare spending to grow at a faster pace  According to BMI, a Fitch company, Qatars private healthcare expenditure is expected to grow at 8.8% in the next 10 years, faster than the 5.8% in public healthcare, offering abundant opportunities especially for global drug manufacturers. Highlighting that the healthcare expenditure in Qatar is slated to grow steadily from QR15.4bn in 2016 to QR27.1bn in 2026, it said, this is a moderate 10-year CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 5.8% in local currency and US dollar terms. Qatars public expenditure was about 84% of overall health expenditure in 2016 but as healthcare costs increase rapidly on an ageing population and a rising chronic disease burden, the model of almost-free medical services will be increasingly seen as unsustainable, and the private sector is being engaged to share some of the financial burden, it said. (Gulf-Times.com)  Qatar economic growth to pick up in 2017  According to Qatar Investment Fund (QIF) report, the recovery in oil price and a strong expansion in non-hydrocarbons should help Qatar effectively manage the future interest rate hikes, helping the country's economic growth to pick up in 2017. London Stock Exchange-listed QIF in its report for 4Q2016 said, "The investment adviser expects Qatari economic growth to pick up in 2017, amid the recovery in oil prices and a strong growth in the non-hydrocarbon sector. Its investment adviser is Qatar Insurance Company. This should help the economy to face the rate hike over the course of the year, whose top 10 Qatari portfolios include QNB Group (19.4% of its net asset value), Industries Qatar (11.7%), Masraf Al Rayan (9.2%), Qatar Electricity and Water (7.9%), Qatar Islamic Bank (7.4%), Nakilat (6.4%), Ooredoo (5.9%), Barwa (4.9%), Gulf International Services (3.8%) and Commercial Bank (3.6%). (Gulf-Times.com)  QIF's exposure to UAE market rises in 4Q2016  Qatar Investment Funds (QIF) exposure to the UAE market has grown up. The exposure of the Fund in the market has reached 6.8% of net asset value (NAV) by the end of 4Q2016. It was 4.3% in 3Q2016, latest data released by the UK-based closed- ended investment company showed. According to the QIFs fourth quarterly investment report, the Fund had 23 holdings, 16 in Qatar and seven in the UAE, while in 3Q2016 it had 22 (17 in Qatar and five in UAE) at the end of 3Q2016. The report revealed that QIF added three holdings during the quarter, which included Qatar International Islamic Bank (QIIK), Air Arabia and First Gulf Bank, while the Fund sold its holdings in Vodafone Qatar and Qatar First Bank. Providing sector wise investment exposure, the report said that QIF remains overweight in the Qatar banking sector (including financial services) at 42.4% of NAV (market weighting 38.4%). QNB group remains QIFs largest holding accounting for 19.4% of NAV. For the period from January to December 2016, credit in Qatar grew 12.1%, mainly driven by the public sector (up 25.7%). The Investment Adviser believes that public sector loan growth will remain strong, driven by the governments infrastructure development plans and a rising population. Industrials remain QIFs second largest exposure at 25.8% of NAV, mainly in Industries Qatar (11.7% of NAV). (Peninsula Qatar)  QNBK: IMF tinkers with growth forecasts, but is still too optimistic  QNB group said that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has kept its forecasts for global growth in 2017 unchanged at 3.4% in the latest update of its World Economic Outlook. QNBK said the overall number masked some tinkering with the composition of global growth since the IMFs last round of forecasts made in October 2016. The projection for growth in advanced economies (AEs) was revised up by 0.1 percentage points (pps) to 1.9%, while growth for emerging markets (EMs) was revised down by 0.1 pps to 4.5%. QNBK said, However, we view the forecasts as over-optimistic and expect them to be revised down in the future, particularly given the IMFs track record in recent years of consistent downward revisions to global growth projections.

(Gulf- Times.com) International  US economy slows on wider trade gap; business spending rises  US economic growth slowed sharply in 4Q2016 as a fall in shipments of soybeans weighed on exports, but steady consumer spending and rising business investment pointed to sustained strength in domestic demand. Gross domestic product increased at a 1.9% annual rate, the Commerce Department said in its first estimate of 4Q2016 GDP. The economy grew at a 3.5% annual rate in 3Q2016. The slowdown masked a surge in home building spending and a rebound in business investment on equipment after four straight quarterly declines. The economy expanded 1.6% for all of 2016, the worst performance since 2011, as it struggled with weak oil prices, a strong dollar and efforts by businesses to reduce a large inventory overhang. (Reuters)  UK consumers turn more confident after December dip  British consumer confidence showed its biggest monthly improvement since last summer in January, a latest sign that the Brexit vote has yet to unsettle the households who are driving Britain's economy. After falling in December, the YouGov/Cebr Consumer Confidence Index rose 2 points to 110.3 in January, its biggest increase since August and its highest level since September. The improvement reflected a better outlook for house prices, businesses and household finances, YouGov and Cebr said. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has said he will keep a close eye on how Britons spend their money in 2017, given the economy's reliance on consumers. Their spending power is expected to be hurt by rising prices caused by the fall in the value of the pound after the Brexit vote. (Reuters)  Eurozone corporate lending accelerates in December  The European Central Bank said bank loans to Eurozone companies grew at the fastest pace in 4- 1/2 years in December and a key measure of money circulating, often an indicator of future activity, rose more than expected. Corporate lending grew by 2.3% in December after a revised 2.1% increase one month earlier, the data showed. Household lending growth in the 19- member currency bloc accelerated to 2.0% from 1.9% in November, the biggest gain since mid-2011. The annual growth rate of the M3 measure of money circulating in the Eurozone, which has in the past often predicted economic activity, rose 5.0% in December from 4.8% in November, slightly beating forecasts for 4.9%. (Reuters)  Japan December core consumer prices fall at slowest pace in nearly a year  Japan's core consumer prices fell at the slowest annual pace in nearly a year in December, a sign that inflation should pick up in coming months on a rebound in oil costs and rising import costs from a weak yen. The data will be among factors the Bank of Japan will scrutinize at a policy meeting early next week, where it is widely expected to keep monetary policy steady and maintain its upbeat inflation projections. Core consumer prices, which include oil products but excludes volatile fresh food prices, slipped 0.2% in December from a year earlier, government data showed, roughly in line with a median market forecast for a 0.3% fall. (Reuters) Regional  Projects spending in 2017 are likely to grow in GCC According to Ed James, Director of Content and Analysis at MEED Projects, the best case scenario for projects spending in the GCC in 2017 is $151bn, whilst the worst case is $112bn. He said, Our analysis suggests that Saudi Arabia and the UAE will be the largest markets in the region in 2017 for projects. With all countries in the GCC, bar Kuwait, experiencing a budget deficit in 2017, we will start to see greater diversification of revenue, including more initial public offerings (IPOs) and borrowing, and a decrease of spending commitments in non-project areas, such as reducing exposure to tariffs and subsidies, employee perks and bonuses. (GulfBase.com)  Saudi Arabia banks likely to outperform GCC counterparts  Despite challenges, with a return on assets of 1.9% as of year- end 2016 versus 2% in 2015, Saudi Arabia banks profitability are expected to continue to outperform other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) banking systems. In 2016, Saudi Arabia banks reported a 5.4% YoY decrease in net profits, mainly because of rising provisioning charges, a credit negative. The provisioning increase reflects asset quality challenges amid low oil prices. Keeping in view the 2016 results, Moodys expect that Saudi Arabia banks profits will remain challenged in 2017 amid an increasing cost of risk and subdued credit growth that, despite easing funding costs, will negatively affect top-line revenues. (Bloomberg)  OPEC cuts will not impact Saudi Arabia oil supply to Japan  Crude supplies to Japan from its biggest supplier Saudi Arabia will not be impacted by 2016 agreement between OPEC and non-OPEC countries to cut output. Saudi Arabia is the number one crude oil supplier to Japan, with its oil accounting for 1.13mn barrels per day, or 33.5% of its total imports in 2015.

Page 5 of 6  S&P GR downgrades Sharjah to 'BBB+/A-2'; keeping outlook Stable  S&P Global Ratings lowered its long- and short-term foreign and local currency sovereign credit ratings on the Emirate of Sharjah to 'BBB+/A-2' from 'A/A-1'. The outlook is stable. The downgrade reflects an accumulation of government debt above our expectations for 2016 and our revised assumption of elevated fiscal expenditure over 2017-2020, leading to a slower fiscal consolidation path. Sharjah's debt as a percentage of GDP has rapidly increased since 2014, due to persistent fiscal deficits and increased capital spending. Although S&P project the Emirate's economy will gradually recover in 2017-2020, fiscal consolidation will be slower than they initially anticipated. S&P said they expect interest expenditures to stay above 5% of revenues over this period, despite the likely introduction of revenue-raising measures. Sharjah's fiscal underperformance below their expectations has resulted in a rapid increase in the Emirate's debt burden. (Bloomberg)  S&P GR affirms Ras Al Khaimah at 'A/A-1'; keeping outlook Stable  S&P Global Ratings affirmed its 'A/A-1' long- and short-term foreign and local currency sovereign credit ratings on the Emirate of Ras Al Khaimah (RAK). The outlook remains stable. RAK's economic structure is relatively diverse when compared with that of other countries in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). The manufacturing sector contributes about 25% of GDP, real estate and business services 9%, and wholesale and retail trade 12%. The oil and gas sector represents only 4.8% of GDP. Tourism, a rapidly growing sector, is regarded as one of RAK's economic priorities and its direct contribution is approaching 3% of GDP. However, four sectors- stone, mica, glass, and ceramics--contribute nearly 85% of exports and are largely active in regional construction.
