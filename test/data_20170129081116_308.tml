<TITLE>11 Calming Games to Help You Relax</TITLE>
<TEXT>When we think about our favorite gaming moments, we tend to think of the high-octane stuff: car chases, escaping heavily-armed guards, racking up a kill streak in the final moments of an online game... 
 
But theres another side to games, too: the peaceful ones that offer us some much-needed variety and help us de-stress at the end of a long day. 
 
If youre looking for calmer games to help you unwind, heres our list of gamings most relaxing titles. 
 Professor Layton and The Unwound Future  
Professor Layton and The Unwound Future commands no extensive knowledge of video game logic , which makes it appropriate for both experienced and inexperienced players. Made up of riddles, visual challenges, and brain teasers, its great for both long play sessions and short bursts. Its this engrossing playstyle and the stunning animated presentation that make it an exceptional short-term antidote to stress. 
 Animal Crossing: New Leaf  
Paying off a loan may not seem like the most chilled out pastime, but spend any amount of time with Animal Crossing: New Leaf and youll soon realize its potential. Whether youre socializing with other villagers or collecting fish, bugs, and fossils to pay off your debt, youll quickly become engrossed in this lifestyle sim. Its simple premise and colorful visuals make for a perfect break away from the hustle and bustle of modern day life. 
 We Love Katamari  

 
The best word to describe We Love Katamari is cathartic. In the title, you assume the role of a prince who must roll up the world into a ball at the behest of his fans. Starting with small objects, youre gradually able to gather larger items, before moving onto enormous skyscrapers and entire solar systems. Its a surprisingly therapeutic venture, made so by its satisfying core mechanics as well as its delightfully eclectic score composed by multiple Namco veterans. 
 Stardew Valley  
Building on the framework of popular games like Harvest Moon and Rune Factory, Stardew Valley, developed by Concerned Ape, transports you to a bucolic paradise where you can create the farm of your dreams. Boasting an impressive variety of objectives and building tools, youll soon find yourself settling into your new rural lifestyle. And who knows? You may even get married. With its plentiful possibilities, Stardew Valley is an absorbing title thats bound to settle the nerves. 
 Monument Valley  
Theres simply no ignoring Monument Valleys outstanding atmosphere. Utilizing a sparse electronic score and pleasant sound effects, the audio design consistently lulls you into a state of calm, as you navigate its collection of puzzling dioramas. Every beep and every chime is just as pleasing to the ears as the last. Youll want to take your time experimenting with each level, which explains why its so effective for alleviating anxiety. 
 The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition  
The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim isnt all about bloody sword fights with bandits and furious dragon shouts. Its also about the hours spent adventuring alone, gazing at the ancient stone structures and the aurora spiraling away in the night sky. Its these intimate moments that make the game so comforting to play for hours on end. So why not put away your greatsword and go for a blithe stroll through this enchanted fantasy realm? Once you experience the continent of Tamriel, you may never want to leave its shores again. 
 Alto's Adventure  
In addition to being one of the best endless runner released in recent memory, Altos Adventure doubles as an excellent way to chill out. So much so, the developer Snowman has added a Zen Mode for players using the game specifically for this purpose. By selecting this mode, players can snowboard down the mountain, accompanied by an ambient soundtrack, without fear of being rushed off their feet by boulders or aggressive elders. Its a delightful distraction and one that I wholly recommend to anyone in need of a quick pick-me-up. 
 Burly Men at Sea  
Have you ever wanted to leave it all behind? To sail away and see where the wild wind takes you? Burly Men at Sea grants you this very opportunity. In the game, youre put in control of three bearded men, who set off on an adventure to complete a mysterious map that theyve found in a bottle. You proceed by swiping either left or right and clicking on key objects, with your choices impacting upon the story being told. Burly Men at Sea features an endearing picture book art style, humorous writing, and a tremendous folk soundtrack  elements that make it gratifying to play more than once. 
 Dragon Quest Builders  
Dragon Quest Builders isnt the most original game ever made, but it sure knows how to tick all the right boxes. It riffs on conventions set by Minecraft, Dragon Quest, and The Legend of Zelda to bring you an overall experience thats both familiar and reassuring. In Dragon Quest Builders, youre responsible for building towns and protecting the villagers that move in, but you can also choose to wander the map and explore, if you so choose. This option allows you to adopt a carefree style of play that prioritizes relaxation over more stressful components, like boss fights and fetch quests. 
 Windosill  

 
Windosill is an environmental puzzle game that requires players to solve problems to advance through its 11 successive rooms. Every item on the screen is interactive and has a corresponding sound effect thats activated whenever you touch it. This means that when you perform an action, youre immediately rewarded with some cool tone or audio clue to aid progression. These encouraging sounds and the steady rate of progression are the key ingredients that make the game so worthwhile. 
 Samorost 3  
Developed by Amanita Design, Samorost 3 is the third title in a trilogy of bizarre point-and-click adventures. It follows a small space gnome and his attempts to locate the owner of a magical flute. Featuring clever audio design and breathtaking artwork fashioned from real photographs, youd be hard pressed to find another game series thats quite like Samorost. Its mesmerizing soundtrack alone will probably be enough to see you off to sleep.
