Crystal Palace 0-3 Manchester City 

■ Man City: Sterling (43’) Sané (71’) Touré (90’+2’) 

It was not just the ability to play the pass that impressed, but also the intelligence to see it in the first place. 

Gabriel Jesus, making his first Manchester City start after a promising substitute appearance against Tottenham Hotspur last weekend, wriggled away from Martin Kelly and provided an inch-perfect through-ball for Raheem Sterling to open the scoring at Selhurst Park on Saturday.

It was one of many examples of the Brazilian’s technical prowess and spatial awareness, with Jesus, 19, starring as part of a thrilling City frontline that possessed too much quality for a struggling Crystal Palace outfit in the fourth round of the FA Cup. City won 3-0. 

Sam Allardyce’s side struggled to gain a foothold in the opening exchanges, as City dominated possession and camped themselves in their opponents’ half of the field.

The former tended to hug the touchline on the right, drawing Palace left-back Jeffrey Schlupp towards him and in turn opening up space in the channel, while the latter drifted infield to combine with Silva and Fabian Delph, who made a number of dangerous darts forward from midfield. 

Jesus, meanwhile, generally stayed central but did not restrict his work to zones in and around the penalty area. The teenager often dropped deep to link the play and encourage runners beyond him, while Pep Guardiola would have been delighted to see him press from the front as City sought to deny Palace an easy way out. 

After plenty of promising moments throughout the opening half, Jesus’ first decisive contribution came just a couple of minutes before the interval. He showed both strength and skill to shrug off Kelly, before his slide-rule pass made it easy for Sterling to break the deadlock. 

City became a little sloppy after the restart, with Palace twice going close to an equaliser, but a fine counter-attacking goal in the 71st minute gave Guardiola’s side some valuable breathing space. Sane timed his run brilliantly to sneak in behind Joel Ward as the visitors broke quickly when a Palace move collapsed, with the excellent Silva measuring a pinpoint pass to the German. 

It was Sane’s third strike in his last three outings, and while there has been justifiable criticism of City’s recent transfer record when it comes to defenders and midfielders, the club’s supporters will be incredibly excited by a talented…</content>
