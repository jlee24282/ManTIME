An emotional Willie Revillame faced the public after he received heartwarming messages during his birthday celebration recently. 
 
In his show, Wowowin, Revillame expressed how grateful he is for getting love and affection from a lot of people, especially from his fans and the televiewers. 
 
“Alam n’yo, napakahirap ng buhay ko.  Hindi n’yo alam, lagi ko kayong iniisip, araw-araw, laging kayo,” he said; trying to hold back his tears. 
 
[You know what, I have a very difficult life. You don’t know it, but I always think of you, every day, it’s always you.] 
 
“Kasi naman wala akong pamilyang tunay. Wala akong asawa, walang magulang, walang lahat, ako lang lagi umuuwi mag-isa. Pagkatapos ng taping, uwi. Gigising sa umaga, magkakape mag-isa,” he further stated. 
 
[Because I have no real family. I have no wife, no parents, everything. I go home alone. After the taping, I go home. In the morning I wake up, drink coffee alone.]
