The Super Bowl 51 Stephen Gostkowski and they have no bull returned to practice today at Gillette Stadium. The pats had perfect attendance at practice for the first time. All week the big game is one week from tomorrow the patriots are three point favorite over the Atlanta Falcons . And for those not in the Super Bowl the Pro Bowl kicks off. This weekend what is it tomorrow night at 8 o&apos;clock and ESPN to be on the front I&apos;ve got to that a Pro Bowl.

And taken you off phone call 61777979837. 61777979837. In the clarify my Pro Bowl schedule for those who do can&apos;t. Approvals tomorrow night at 8 o&apos;clock on this yesterday can imagine losing in an NFL playoff game. And that Dolan to play dodge ball against other NFL players or not in the Super Bowl is that all about. I mean that&apos;s going to be a pretty humbling experience and it&apos;s like they&apos;re out there having fun. But if you are a player that was not a team for someone whose season has been all this week it like there there&apos;s some guys in the Pro Bowl that. Obviously new bye week seven and we gate they had no shot even get the playoff nevermind. You know have a chance to ensure normal but did you answer this why is that I can understand that happy to be needed to be on the big stage and to just be seen again on national TV. But there are sure other guys super stop players who were on playoff teams that are having a blast playing dodge ball. All we&apos;re in a weighing on people and Atlanta are talking about the Super Bowl and Super Bowl 51 I just. I try to put myself in the shoes of someone who lost in the playoffs and was. And then I had to go to the Pro Bowl chose to go to pro ball once been selected I&apos;d think to myself. I wouldn&apos;t wanna be played dodge ball against other NFL players who didn&apos;t. Make the Super Bowl it just doesn&apos;t seem fun to me and federal situations like ice our video clip of Ezekiel Elliott. Slide it around out on the grass like on his needs and if I am a Dallas Cowboys . If I&apos;m Jerry Jones and having a hot attack undone what I adored don&apos;t this slide around on the grass like that. He is sick you know in my opinion is the NFL MVP for misty and it&apos;s as and you wanna see. It to Jerry Jones of the Dallas Cowboys but this weekend and this coming weekend next weekend it&apos;s not about the Pro Bowl it&apos;s not about. Any of those players who are seemingly having fun playing dodge ball right now. This is about. The best team in the L receivers the best team and and a seed you know England patriots first the Atlanta falcons&apos; super ball 51 in Houston. A week from tomorrow right now the patriots a three point favorite in this scam. Going to the Super Bowl . Even at the end of the regular season the AFC team was at three point favorite over an FC team and I think. That was baggage Nolan that the patriots had the best chance to get there and at the patriot to be at three point favorite. Indiscernible so we&apos;ve actually known this for awhile but that&apos;s the spread now that we know the opponent. The patriots falcons patriots a three point favorite this week and I told it is an all stock dams on NHL and even in the NFL. I get some golf on TV but. The focus. Is. People are gonna stop travel on a trickle in and now to Houston and the players will trickle in on Monday they will have media night. Monday night the last couple years they&apos;ve changed the scheduled to media day what used to be Tuesday or Wednesday afternoon and morning afternoon now it&apos;s. It&apos;s Monday night they have media night prime time. Roger Goodell used to speak on Friday now he&apos;s gonna speak on Wednesday I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if they. Flip flopped that schedule around for Goodell a couple times just to make it a little bit more difficult for maybe some people. Cover the patriots to debt at a press conference I would Roger Goodell because you know all. The questions that are going to be asked I gotta be deflate gate related. And I think in this past week. And net you know did you get that you week&apos;s tip to look at this game so there&apos;s a lot of story lines there&apos;s a lot of different things to talk about. Sometimes. I would get it Nidal. I I don&apos;t want that extra week because. Certain story lines can get blown out of proportion all brought up again that because people just need to kill time like all of those. You know shows that on TV and get three guys sit in the seats and a raw arguing about some and they need to they needed to talk about to placate this past week right they needed that they needed to bring to placate up again not as they get it on the patriots which they do. Because they did things the talk about again x.s and always. Falcons patriots for two full weeks maybe get someone at this week you still have some. Crazy story lines that maybe I won&apos;t even be thinking of right now but this past week I did hear a lot of deflate gate. Someone wants to dip back into that I can understand it. The fact that this season with a flight data that the flake a punishment and the four game suspension for Tom Brady . He served that he accepted it he served at the patriots went three and one. That not all. There in the super ball Goodell is banned dodged the patriots he&apos;s van that refused to show up in Foxboro at Gillette Stadium I don&apos;t care if he shows up or not. But he has been reputed to do what it as some people fired up and potentially. We could be seen. Roger Goodell and the Lombardi trophy. What Robert Kraft and meant you know let the MVP. Possibly to Tom Brady I mean that&apos;s the way that bad. Celebration goes down they get elevated podium the confetti fallen at it&apos;ll be on fox strike the shoot malls on fox show. I have someone down math I I assume that I think in the past that they had Terry Bradshaw may be on the podium. But keep away whoever they have done then do any interviews on that podium good Dell&apos;s going to be on a podium at the patriots ran a they&apos;re gonna have wrapped telecheck and Tom Brady and Brady about the MVP somebody else. The patrons when the short ball which I actually expect and predict that they will. Tom Brady&apos;s gonna beat. The most valuable player because I do not see Atlanta&apos;s defense stopping Tom Brady in this game will get into that I&apos;m here for three dollars. Today on the of the three dollars tomorrow. I want you a phone calls throughout the shows 61777979837. But regardless of the MVP is you know you gonna see Brady on that podium you know Belichick will be Daniel craft will be that if they win. And you know Dell&apos;s going to be so that&apos;s the story line. The thought. Of that meeting taken place in Houston on that stage with the confetti fall with the Lombardi trophy infidels and haven&apos;t and that over the patriots that thought. Knowing what Adele went out of his way to do to Tom Brady and the New England Patriots knowing how this season began with Brady not just. Being unable to plan a football game for the patriots. The other cable for the first four weeks even. Show up at Gillette Stadium would be and communication or contact with anybody and a major doting attention. Fell. Got to get a sitter put an extra dollars in debt and to deflate gay and why it was route we always stupid okay we know why it was stupid. But since it was so stupid. And since it actually happened Brady accepted the punishment and and that&apos;s how he began the season unable to show up at Gillette Stadium or talk to anybody on the team. The patriots don&apos;t want 31. They finished the season with a bad stretch of football at fourteen to two and I also want to or some other stuff. Which is. These Jamie Collins trade during the bye week which the patrons can compensation pick. Lot of people say that would be the thing that would. That would finish job Bill Belichick that&apos;s the bendable crossed the patriot way you can only make so many of these modes and get away with it and still have success. Fourteen to number one seed in the AFC we&apos;re all in into the super ball OK Roland and that is super ball. Then add some other situations the ball Sheehan situation retarded people look at and say well maybe something is going on inside that locker room and major it&apos;s continued to weather that storm Rob Gronkowski who began the season injured. He finished the season on injured reserve. Gunner against the Seahawks returned a couple of weeks later against the jets had a back injury had surgery. She&apos;s ending injured reserve people said well patrons can&apos;t win without rock. Not gonna happen. And it. There are the patriots Roland into the cerebral sold any things have actually gone wrong. They&apos;re going on patriots this season that I think out of all the story lines you can look at. I wrote this in my column for the Boston metro this week. This story on to many is that this is BC&apos;s in the perfect storm of events. This is this season. That is driving. The patriots critics. Crazy more than any other season. This season of fourteen and don&apos;t finish. And number one seed the home field advantage throughout the playoffs. You know through my favorite in the short ball without Rob Gronkowski. Knowing that it was suspended the first four games. This season. And the patriots success this season. Is drive and Brady and bella judge critics nuts like what can it possibly say now. What&apos;d they say. And people. Really have. That you can&apos;t argue the success that team had and things that they had to go through today it will immediately go back to how the season began. And outside talking about why Kate made will say but the patriots cheat that&apos;s what they&apos;ll say. I mean I&apos;m not talented to read his column. Put some guy in Atlanta wrote a piece and I just read the headlines because I don&apos;t think anybody. Should have to go through overrated some in this stupid their entire lives. I just read that line it said what to tell you our kids about to placate. And my biggest issue with that is. If you all wake up that morning and you ought actually had a conversation with your kids about deflate gate. I think someone needs to sit you down and have a conversation. With you about why you are talking to kids about. Ridiculous. Like you&apos;ll have the problem. Brady the patriots not. It&apos;s the PSI have all you really have a chat with your kids about that. If you thought this something wrong with you. OK and I think the question that this columnist Atlanta asked was. The late can&apos;t mean that and the success that the patriots haven&apos;t afterwards. Visit me that. We should it isn&apos;t really the message to the kids should be well if you cheat you get even get away with it have success. That&apos;s that&apos;s basically what this columnist was hesitant. And tell if they&apos;re any message about the flight date instead the tide of. All those and a pretty proven that. The last time they turn through the Super Bowl . As you know to he has got to beat the Seahawks Malcolm but a miraculous interception. You go from being down on the ground on hands and knees. Ryan and and slam and and onto the ground like I was. John good majority. The Dem second I don&apos;t knock Obama picks out on top of the flight gate the gate and did two weeks before and I didn&apos;t. So the flight eight we hadn&apos;t even really know they hadn&apos;t even gone into. The house report and all that craziness help. Now the patriots are back and it&apos;s a season in which Brady. Janet. Went to the certainly don&apos;t like it four game suspension and anybody that&apos;s gonna argue anything about the patriots coming into this one next Sunday. All saying that they are really gonna argue. Is gonna go back to. To placate and they got a call the patriots cheated once again now you don&apos;t I&apos;m not. I I don&apos;t get it that anymore I&apos;ve been done I did so done with the flight gate before the wells reporting it came out. But this is what you got some people don&apos;t now. All that said when you actually forget about the PSI as a football and it. You wanna break down these two teams the patriots and the falcons an X is and always portion of it. I heard John Tomas CNY show at the beginning of the show say something I completely agree with. Which is that a lot of talk is going to be a ball. The quarterbacks and you know Matt Ryan and and more specifically when you talk about the falcons their offense Lotta people got to raved about that offense. You&apos;re right we sell. And people money compliant again against Green Day and the first half and say well let his defense shut out Aaron Rodgers and green Bay&apos;s offense in the first half. And that NFC championship. And along with that Dodd and the thought of raising Atlanta&apos;s offense. The one thing that I think is gonna be overlooked. Is that Atlanta&apos;s defense. Is terrible. It&apos;s awful. Atlanta&apos;s pass defense. Is one of the worst in the National Football League OK is. But depends. In part that&apos;s a fact. Atlanta&apos;s best defense is one of the worst and the National Football League in a regular season Atlanta&apos;s pass defense toy may eighth in the league. Only 32 teams in NFL Atlanta&apos;s pass defense alone 266. Point seven yards in the year I get away from us that&apos;s for men have you watched Atlanta&apos;s pass defense most of the season you should know that it&apos;s no good. Not you might argue well and is pass defense and their defense in general looked pretty damn good against Aaron Rodgers in Green Bay. Let&apos;s last week and NFC championship. You know what you&apos;re right especially in the first half. Atlanta 1241 up lead at the half out of four is Green Bay in the some mistakes. But I think that Atlanta deeper into performance was deceiving. That&apos;s is a this even defense of performance as you&apos;ll ever gonna see. In my opinion in the NFL what fun. Because that place was rock and whether it was real crowd noise or not that George at all. Was rocking and you cannot tell me that that didn&apos;t affect Aaron Rodgers and the Green Bay offense it did that&apos;s a real and that affects them. And Mitt Atlanta loves planet home okay and they love it. And when you jump out to a lead like that. Aaron Rodgers degree they put some points in the second half but it point green Bay&apos;s defense now can&apos;t stop a nose bleed in general so that they&apos;ll be at home mom and play at all. They weren&apos;t going to be stopped acting like it was over at the end of the first court. All land and needed was a two touchdown lead but I came to be over the degree you know green Bay&apos;s defense wasn&apos;t stop and Matt Ryan. In Atlanta at the Georgia Dome shell that sent judges pick Atlanta&apos;s defense of performance. Last week was deceiving. And new people might point out and say well they got a shot against the patriots I don&apos;t think Atlanta&apos;s defense as a shot against the patriots I don&apos;t. I think that this is going to be won those games with Tom Brady just pops up Atlanta&apos;s past the. It adds I said it&apos;s about the Steelers last week I&apos;ll say it again. What that lamp that the only shot they really have is if they can get the Tom Brady but the one thing I will say about Atlanta&apos;s the eight the last couple weeks. If there is one phrase I do have but it defense is that they have shown the ability. Where at some big fast guys up front to be able to get the quarterback with outset and outs they they have that ability to do. However I also think that ability the last couple weeks is deceiving because Green Bay had some offensive line issues at least I saw at the beginning of the season. And Seattle offensive line issues which were much more well documented. Than anyone else is in the lead. All you right Russell Wilson was running for his life. In Atlanta couple weeks ago. But when games are an Atlanta icy Atlanta I watched them completely different team in this game&apos;s at a neutral site. Don&apos;t tell Jack. I have to talk pretty two weeks to prepare. I&apos;m sorry I think that. I don&apos;t I don&apos;t even think this is an opinion. I think this is the fact this is the worst defense that Brady&apos;s gonna face in this season. But it&apos;s close. With regards to throw the football. So protect pretty. This game shouldn&apos;t even be close and the only way it will be. Of the patrons protect Brady is up and up Atlanta&apos;s defense like expect them to know this game is going to be close is if Matt Ryan is perfect. Perfect Matt Ryan needs to be perfect in this game if he&apos;s not helpful behind Brady will score every single possession against this Atlanta team and that&apos;s what appealed. Now the over under on this one is fifteen on dirt speck in a shootout if it&apos;s a shootout the patriots are gonna win that shootout. And a again maybe the most overlooked and coming into this game is the fact that the patriots difference I mean you wanna match up the patriots defense and Atlanta&apos;s defense trying to close. Coach and don&apos;t get it led beyond bell missed. Most of that game left early last week. And you&apos;ll still have an elite quarterback you&apos;re still that the best wide receiver in my opinion of football Antonio Brown. Do you do against a white and they did and did they leave again. Patriots stopped. Pittsburgh&apos;s offense they defense stopped Pittsburgh&apos;s offense so if people wanna talk about a test. With the goal which are not support they got it tests last week. And Mitt. They didn&apos;t failed a test they passed that test with flying colors and does what now they go up against Atlanta offense that is. I obviously everybody is. Be much more powerful right Julio Jones Matt Ryan got the two headed monster and Coleman of Freeman of the backfield. You gotta you should know he was a big pop that Atlanta game plan early and often against Green Bay last week he got the kid Gabriel can do some damage she&apos;s a. He can be. Passed out there he so small and so fast that he can make big plays. What I just feel like the defense is. That. You know when you match these two defense is up the patriots and Atlanta&apos;s big nightclubs. And if I have my money on one of these two quarterbacks. Who like to put up big numbers Brady and Ryan. I&apos;d put my money on whom would have the big day. Against their opposing defense is it&apos;s just it&apos;s not even a question I don&apos;t even think twice about gritty. Should. Pop up the Atlanta Falcons defense. And the Patriots defense should slow all have to do Sloane Matt Ryan battle that. He won&apos;t be able to keep up with Andre and tell my prediction that is one. A week from tomorrow and used to shoot the ball 51 patriots when they come out in fact this one we need to be. Fourteen did you need to be a fourteen point spread for me to even think about it. Even think about taken points aidid the patriots should women added they should win this one break I honestly. I don&apos;t think that. Matt Ryan is going to be able Ricky pop into neutral site of this game was in Atlanta the Georgia don&apos;t it was rocket like that a signal that they get a chance that creates some habit early may be get to Brady. And it did ever shot it&apos;s not it&apos;s in a neutral site it&apos;s not going to be anywhere close to his a lot of the Georgia Dome was. Atlanta doesn&apos;t. You know a big they don&apos;t seem to be as comfortable offensively. On the road. As they are home and certainly did defense. I can not. Matched their defense up against Tom Brady and then that Atlanta&apos;s defense is gonna have a good day I just can&apos;t do it 617. 7797983761777979837. Where a week away from Super Bowl 51 and I want you are thoughts and predictions yup phone calls after this time out. The weekend new England sports conversation continues with the Danny put cards right now on Sports Radio. We&apos;ve EI. 61777979837. On it till 6 o&apos;clock taking your phone calls.

And here&apos;s senator Roger Goodell who used to speak on Fridays at the Super Bowl . Now speak on Wednesday 61777979837. Let&apos;s go to Thailand. Is in Iowa egg ally good how you drag your outlook apart by a couple things. You know I hate to tell. Adults so much but not a lot of other people that only opposite. There are no I got some of the blame as well like. Gotta you&apos;ve got guys like you know Greg I know I&apos;ll have black art. Moderate to work archive did not actually got chat well. You know obviously you know is accused from the start. They&apos;re not mad at. Matchup that&apos;s so loud it all worked out you know what I lied about attorney client privilege it. Pat well where are. You know bought over the outlook report knocked it. Not. Oh yeah lawyer. We live it we lost pile of them. You wanna use doc and flight gate the NF LPI lawyers. And maybe don&apos;t call back Tyler would we busted phone connection so try to dent Denny&apos;s in Montreal it&apos;s up Danny. I know. So what&apos;s going on in. The government. But did you know now it does you have to show up the the other AFC or an and that&apos;s championship game RW&apos;s Alec requirement. I don&apos;t know all what the job description says on that comment was shown that if you&apos;re the commissioner of a legion you have. Through championship games you should be out at you should be out one of. This say about of our boat than it has to be in this NATO policy yesterday. Where do you think you go. And the saints. He&apos;d go to New Orleans. I noticed anybody go to new loans I think this is. This is fresh not him in bed the Brady saying it was fresh he would have even gone into loans he was not gonna come a joint stating it&apos;s good but anyway he was not coming to Gillette Stadium season. Not side I figured that probably. Republican ten notes and it patriots. I think it&apos;s in the actually think you&apos;re going to be audible though there is going to be around like 351430. Seventeen. Yeah I think you&apos;re on the money I think you&apos;re on the the right spot without one. I just don&apos;t see. How Atlanta&apos;s defense is gonna stop Brady you know I&apos;ll outstanding delegates at about Pittsburgh you gotta get to Brady get in his face. Win that game is not in Atlanta yeah. You know Houston an odd G stadium is that what they call it used to be Reliant Stadium that place is not going to be rocket like the Georgia Dome was. So Brady&apos;s not going to be rattled. And and I think Atlanta&apos;s pass rush don&apos;t think it&apos;s a big athletic guys up front that in the last couple weeks have been able to disrupt. Because what the quarterback can do blood. I think that when you look at Green Bay stoppage of lie and they had major injury issues right this season and Seattle&apos;s it is. Big time offensive line issues which Seattle all season long the Patriots offense of if that thing. We haven&apos;t really talked about on the up until that Houston playoff game put before that in. We weren&apos;t talking about it and all that&apos;s a great thing is it doing their job I I just don&apos;t think Atlanta&apos;s defense is going to be able to slow down Tom Brady . This is the worst deeper and Brady will face in his post season. And it&apos;s Dutch economy Matt Ryan will have to play in my opinion a perfect game to just keep up with the score in other expect I scorn over on its 59. Matt Ryan&apos;s gonna need a perfect game shall bomb built bella Jack and Matt Patricia and I got two weeks. I got two weeks the dial up a defense. That&apos;s got to basically prevent Matt Ryan from having a perfect day am I mean I&apos;m gonna put my money that they&apos;ll be able to do that. And I then yeah you&apos;re gonna see some some sneaking as early on I had Logan Ryan comment on a blitz. Com and just basically just dropped and Matt Ryan&apos;s rhythm that he&apos;s been on the last couple weeks. So. I expect the Patriots defense to slow down Matt Ryan and up where he is not gonna keep up with Tom Brady . Who will be I then throw the ball at will against this Atlanta. Passed defense Bob is in layman puts Obama. Pay Balata ball on how it&apos;s happened dude. And that I did I. As much as I agree with you on the falcons&apos; defense I do think one thing is you know walked in with so often that they have. You know before the game and not erupt fourteen point so being sucked constantly slowing the ball. Against Atlanta defense which you know kind of you know that&apos;s out to me a little bit. Would you agree with that. Well what what do I tell you that there is a defense that&apos;s not gonna allow Atlanta to get up fourteen points. And and that&apos;s fine but obviously in the stats aren&apos;t that may to Atlanta secondary ultimately may be worse than may not because when you constantly get it wrong on all game you know. You know I don&apos;t think it makes the bat a little water and they might. Are you got to look at it this way and you know art I. It has Atlanta but I&apos;ve based in goods bought as they spotted themselves fourteen points in most of the games they played out and finally put up big numbers are right and all. I know that that is a prolific offense Don Aaron Atlanta. Hi a solid and high speed and they put up you know some of the biggest numbers and football offensively they love doing. But let&apos;s say that is date they are up fourteen points and were up fourteen not in every game. And UA defense. It&apos;s they had run the football witness not to pass yeah I would not make it easier for you to stop the pass. That&apos;s actually I don&apos;t keep adamant and not play devil&apos;s advocate that&apos;s mean look at what the falcons pass defense. Should be JoAnne. I guess under the theory that you have of Apollo Atlanta begins games but I have that were the case. It gave Rick a look at the short oval Tom Brady could. I ain&apos;t the Tom Brady&apos;s gonna throw the football and and in I would Garret blunt didn&apos;t get as much planned time in the first playoff game the followers to not ever heard again against Pittsburgh. So courage I don&apos;t know with the patriots can&apos;t run the football against Atlanta I think they&apos;d be crazy to I think they&apos;d be crazy to around that they&apos;re gonna be thinking of a period like that mean you look at the numbers in your a look at the film. Age you know the do you control on Atlanta&apos;s defense and I and no one you can draw on Atlanta&apos;s defense especially in a neutral site announcing by the patriots wouldn&apos;t do they will do. And I&apos;ll have success doing Mike is in Quincy atop might. What&apos;s up I can&apos;t get a little bit of the different take on it let me and aren&apos;t god that I&apos;m you know not Ryan I&apos;m not too sure he can win the big game and and I don&apos;t know how many. You know NFL big games he&apos;s been in power. Well I&apos;m an easy just 1200 one&apos;s the last two weeks. You&apos;re right you&apos;re right playoff games in open I&apos;m talking about you know I wanna go back to his 07 season as a senior BC not followed him a lot more when you play college. And he actually had BC and number two in the country going central Florida State game at home. But he ended up getting beat on throwing an interception at the end of the game run back for a touchdown. And then later on that he&apos;s in. Actually made peace CC championship against Virginia Tech and did the exact same thing lost. I&apos;m just not too confident he can actually win that big stage big game to put these came over the top. Well I mean to be honestly in my thanks for the call I could care less what Matt Ryan did a PC I really don&apos;t care when it comes to this game. And what he&apos;s gonna do against the Patriots defense what he did for the Boston College Eagles. At least to me is meaningless I think if you spend time going back to look at Matt Ryan&apos;s college paper right now. I don&apos;t know I mean I think I I think yet too much time on your hands I I don&apos;t think that has any of that is not to have. Any effect on an ad that&apos;s not a knock on people like BC football but that&apos;s fine. I mean I&apos;m I&apos;m just I&apos;m not a college football guy. In general it&apos;s just it&apos;s just not many. So. What whatever you want to do you a big cultural pop and a fine you like Boston College football it&apos;s fun not knocking you for that. But right now in this specific instance. Whip. Falcons and the patriots in the super ball. Do you really wanna go back and stop looking at what guys did in college to figure out of they&apos;re gonna have success and this one. But Mike. Where might makes a point. He&apos;s not crazy with this is that when he asked the question can Matt Ryan when the big debt and not sort of interrupted a man I said. Well he just won two big ones against Seattle again that I didn&apos;t think he was gonna win but they did and then against green bank. I picked on a big Green Bay got a lot of people picking the package based on what Aaron Rodgers who&apos;s doing how good he looked and the way he was Rolen. I people thinking that he was just gonna have a special season and he wasn&apos;t going to be stopped. Well he got stopped I think because they were on the road that it was in one small difference or. You know different story but but you have to go back to the beginning of the season you know I may be Green Bay didn&apos;t have as much success. They have some offered a lot of injuries an issue was because and so. A question. Ten Matt Ryan win a big damn. It&apos;s it&apos;s going to be asked because we bastards so many times in the past in his NFL career forget about college in his NFL career. I was saying the same things about him coming into this post season. I show I think when they play Seattle even though it&apos;s in Atlanta. I just think the way Matt Ryan&apos;s career has gone he&apos;s gonna soil himself in the big spot and and not wasn&apos;t just. How big that was a crazy got a regular a lot of lot of people that knew that. That was the potential based on what he&apos;s done in his NFL career which is drone that big pick and a big spot wrote that big interception not when the big game. But may feel like that a couple weeks ago even some like myself has to acknowledged that and I think Mikey did you have to acknowledge. That the last two games that Matt Ryan is one had been big games you can&apos;t tell me and not. I&apos;m not a big Matt Ryan fan when it comes to win in the big dance. Like you&apos;ll put you have to bring your beat Seattle like that and big difference regardless of the injuries Seattle&apos;s defense that can be Seattle. And then you beat a great big team got a lot of people had picked him at the VU general relevant that well. The rewards and to not acknowledge those high paying too. I think is a little crazy you have to acknowledge it but now this is the biggest one right this is the biggest one from that. I got up kitty when the big game. Question now is Kenny when the biggest one. And at it that to me it as a as it follows client I just. His college career. Matt Ryan&apos;s college career has nothing to do. Out with what he could or could not do in the Super Bowl against the patriots 617. 7797983761777979837. Matt Ryan. Needs the hope that his defense can have in my opinion what&apos;s gonna need to be a miraculous performance against a Tom Brady led offense that I think. Is gonna pop up that falcons. 617779. 79837. More got phone calls after this timeout. But card talks about all new England sports on Sports Radio coming. I wrapped enough Apollo one. On me until 6 o&apos;clock taking your phone calls. 61777979837. 61777979837. As we have sort of will call it the Super Bowl bye week. Patriots practice today don&apos;t practice again tomorrow and they will head to Houston on Monday Monday night. Will be immediate night in Houston. And then the big game a week from tomorrow patriots three point favorite. Over the falcons when this line first came all I know old AFC team was at three point favorite. Going to the Super Bowl before they even knew the teams. By. I thought that land net may do winner of the match up patriots found those. I I didn&apos;t think that the patrons would be maybe a six point favorite. What is to three point fit. And so to me got a jump all over and a patriot when I think they went by more than three I know some people are gonna hold up their predictions. Maybe till next week. They needed some time to take it all and look at all the matchups I&apos;ve looked all the matchups I&apos;ve watched Atlanta&apos;s defense a lot this season. You know if you are a daily fantasy play you are always interested in the falcons because their offense is so high pollen. You know Matt Ryan what you&apos;ll look to see. What they match up saw Julio Jones Matt Ryan and that&apos;s a duel that you what you call a stack. Yes back and Matt Ryan Julio Jones a lot Dovonte for it and someone you look at if your daily fantasy plant. Ma so. If that&apos;s where you stay and you know what the falcons are offensive. But. I also think maybe you pick some of those guys in your daily fantasy sports lions because. Well. You know they&apos;re gonna be involved and assure the public good defense just is an act and other teams are gonna score on. And met when it third. Tom Brady and what he could do against this Atlanta defense. The fact that it&apos;s not going to be an Atlanta. I&apos;m sorry I just I did don&apos;t think they have what it takes to slow him down and all I really don&apos;t soul. I agree with sort of the high school orange. Prediction Namibia bag it says over on his 59. But. Outfit is I escorted because I think the patriots put up the most points to three point spread in this one patriots. A three point favorite I jumped all over early is noted for me to wait to get my prediction of where you know what&apos;s gonna happen. Patriots minus 361777979837. Much coach who would John and Sean avail what&apos;s up John. Anyway Chatman and on lodged with a lot. 100 legitimate candidate and I&apos;m sure you&apos;re most proper notice there&apos;s a lot of movement in the mud can&apos;t. Okay yeah actual actually delay what type of movement are we talking about Jonny boy yeah. Probably the point after I&apos;m OK I believe that I honestly believe that when the money just to commend you know we sort of format like. And I don&apos;t got a job my job it&apos;s it was important right. You know. The shock to peak at the BC docs. The Atlanta Falcons locker that would escape and want to them deliberately. Bred and re. I like. I like that I like that bags at a college let&apos;s go to jello and some notes on joint. That grabbed me on the odds are a dual purpose but saying. Huge patriots spent a cute and they&apos;re gonna win pretty handedly but I&apos;d do what rollout at. I think that out and keep that is getting a little bit. Underrated here. And I have been following them throughout the season and I do I do realize that you know they&apos;ve. They have been struggling at unit throughout all year and given up by us pretty high scoring games. But I want just. Like you know. Having no such. Probably televised games in the playoffs typically in the last weeks. It seemed like he. But the falcons had been looking. Fairly sharp I mean just to point out you know and I agreed that the that the two game they played ball and you know coming up to the Super Bowl . I wouldn&apos;t expect not to went in there and not only that but gains were kind of what can mean by the third or what quarter the game was older. And guess specifically look at a game. Score sheet. That by have to Wear and I think what the Seahawks. Put up. Ten point I think I had time on the falcons defense and then and then thirteen total. Entry in the fourth quarter but you know when the game is over. And the packet that they did they are shut out at. Least one in Atlanta at the in an innocent and the Contra Packers are entrenched. You know hyped up in Oakland from the numerous media gauntlet this is Aaron Rodgers to. You know make an argument for one of the greatest quarterbacks our generation and possibly alt chimed in just looking at his numbers you know you&apos;d. He had a boost in the whole second after the season we&apos;re acutely in. Fantastic and I and I and I understand that the practice. We&apos;re a little bit optic and there Roger this year and a guy like that playing at such a higher level did beat shutout and halftime there. By that falcon defense that. Are being claim to being you know one of the worst intentional leak. I I you know I got to do. Throughout debt you know at least these last two games. Opt in my view the Pittman played pretty well and they are a little bit underestimated. And I actually won one sort thing that I I think it a little bit wild card come into the soup Campbell I don&apos;t think the patriot to get that much trouble with it. But you&apos;d think they&apos;re being under undervalued. By at least the last two games that they&apos;ve played. Well where we agree actually called Joseph mean you agree wood on the the Patriots offense is gonna have too much trouble with Atlanta&apos;s defense and also agree with you that Atlanta&apos;s defense the last two games. And a big playoff games against Seattle in Green Bay. Atlanta&apos;s defense they&apos;ve shown up and you know a bit it&apos;s been obvious from from the opening kick off Atlanta&apos;s defense with what they were joined. Is that didn&apos;t make him cornerback. Don&apos;t make quarterbacks like typical. Byte by Russian Russian four and get a little and I didn&apos;t need this in the house to get the call it a bit Russell Wilson run around like crazy and I came Aaron Rodgers sometimes it seems like. He enjoys ran around anyways so it may be that it&apos;s tough to tell with him what. You really could tell on that Seattle game they would get into the quarterback and the I think against Green Day . Am and maybe this plays into both of those games the way the crowd was that affect an offense I don&apos;t how good your offenses. It&apos;s gonna affect you especially if your conference that has had a offensive line injuries and issues throughout the season. Like Seattle&apos;s and I guess to a lesser extent Green Bay. This salt. And we always have a defense and success in the last two games at least in the first capital games. When that you know Atlanta hadn&apos;t. I had all the way. Basically they haven&apos;t success because they get the quarterback and but I think a big part of that. Was not just offensive line is they were going up against but also the fact that they were playing ball. I really do think that is a major at that that was a major major issue for. Bald Seattle and green Bay&apos;s offense planned that George Ballmer. You know it the last two games that they ever gonna play there. Sentimental value I have no idea but they don&apos;t fight it up and net. It was loud whether it was real crowd noise a fake crowd noise was loud enough I think to affect both of those offenses that are forward gave Atlanta&apos;s defense an average. I have that edge in this game. I should Atlanta&apos;s defense played on the road this season and I&apos;ve seen that has defense at times you don&apos;t play at all and struggle against. High powered offenses. But on. If there&apos;s one thing about Atlanta beat. That definitely jumps off the screen via a common and that is Super Bowl look and at the last two games. Is that they&apos;re big athletic guys up front have been able to win their one on one battles with offensive linemen and and get that a quarterback and given some threats. And you know what if they&apos;re gonna do that the Tom Brady didn&apos;t didn&apos;t they have a shot but a tight that they won&apos;t do it to Tom Brady because Dan. I have that edge of being the home team and haven&apos;t plays rock and form. Went when Tom Brady has the football the Patriots offense of the football Atlanta&apos;s V for Ed read a defense is gonna have a marriage and on top of it. What I&apos;ve seen from the patriots upwards of one season as an offensive line on that a Dante Scarnecchia coached offensive line once again is. Did they have commons room. With even a halftime adjustments that are gonna change the game floater up and so if they do struggle early I would expect the second apple but different. And it did fix whatever is going on upfront. Right protect Tom Brady you will win this game. And it. That means that Matt Ryan the other and if I gave it what happened to the Patriots offense. That happened Tom Brady puts up big numbers. Matt Ryan on the other hand he&apos;s gonna have to keep up that he&apos;s gonna have to be perfect because the Patriots defense out last column mentions Atlanta&apos;s defense not getting enough credit. I still think we haven&apos;t been talking about the Patriots defense enough. We haven&apos;t because business I do float around in this town that well. The numbers in the stats don&apos;t match up pretty I tested does it did not doing what the stats show did not as good as maybe the numbers will give. They haven&apos;t played only quarterback to cancer airplane only quarterback in big big planner and we quarterback last week and then drop as part and it did. And only quarterback who is an oh please. Wide receiver Antonio Brown so you can&apos;t make that argument anymore and from people who say well let me on doughnut chart. I got nursery even before Delgado hurt it didn&apos;t look like the patriots are going to be that CNET. It&apos;s sort of figured out that hesitation status that the line of scrimmage right and that&apos;s the way I start from the get. At a point where I&apos;m sitting their goal and even the first couple times Bogut abolish it he&apos;s not gonna he&apos;s not gonna do damage to. He&apos;s not doing damage to. But injury aside you&apos;re still playing much reduced to play against an elite quarterback. And an elite wide receiver don&apos;t tell me didn&apos;t attempt to pitcher&apos;s defense did what happened. What happened. The Patriots defense. Once again. They&apos;d they&apos;d pass the test. This will be the biggest as much like it will be the biggest us Matt Ryan this will be the biggest that&apos;s a patron difference by a if I&apos;m gonna pick one of these two defense is to have the better at night. In the Super Bowl it&apos;s going to be at the Bill Belichick act Matt Patricia defense that as two weeks to prepare for a quarterback. That is gonna have to be perfect in this wanna keep up with a pump ready who&apos;s gonna cob up and Atlanta Falcons defense just don&apos;t that&apos;s just the way I seed has been planned out. But you can&apos;t that I Atlanta&apos;s defense they have had success the last couple weeks in big spots now given that 617779. 7983761777979837. More to phone calls after this final.
