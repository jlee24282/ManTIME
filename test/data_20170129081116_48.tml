<TITLE>Letter: Say good riddance to Electoral College</TITLE>
<TEXT>A recent In My View column headed Problem is rigid ideologies, not Electoral College, treated two different subjects as one to justify the Electoral College. The writer illuminated rigid ideologies but obfuscated the issue of the Electoral College. At a time when we have elected a president while the opposing party received 2.6 million more votes, this deserves honest scrutiny. 
 
To quote the writer: The purpose of the Electoral College is to select a winner who represents a geographically broader portion of the country despite not receiving the majority vote. This is as good a definition as I have found, but what does it really mean? It means that the Electoral College is a device to override the popular vote. 
 
Another way this is often put: to give the states with small populations more weight against those with large populations. But why? How can the people of geographically broader portion, or smaller states, benefit, beyond having all of their votes count? If the Electoral College strengthens the vote of one portion, does it not do so at the expense of another portion, and undermine the bedrock democratic principle of one person, one vote? 
 
That reveals this institution for what it is  undemocratic and open to manipulation. 
 
So why do we still have it? Because those who support it do not wish to entrust the outcomes of presidential elections to the people! We may vote, but the outcome is managed beyond our reach. 
 
The test of any election system is the fair, democratic result it yields. When we wind up with results in which millions of voters are deprived of their voice, it is clear that the process is neither fair nor democratic. How, then, can the Electoral College be justified? 
 
The words to select a winner offer a clue. Above and beyond our voting, there is a power that selects the ultimate outcome, regardless of how we vote. Powers hiding behind a complex, archaic construct can overrule the will of the people and have the ultimate say. And that in no way qualifies as democratic. 
 
In the last election, 2.6 million voters were essentially disenfranchised. This could include you, or me, and equals the populations of our four smallest states. It renders arguments about voting fraud picayune in comparison. 
 
Democratic arguments against the Electoral College are often countered with the vacuous notion that American is not a democracy, but rather a representative republic. This may be technically correct, yet is hardly convincing. Does this mean that we Americans are OK with something less than fair and democratic in our national elections? If you are for the Electoral College today because it helped your champion win, consider that next time your side may just as easily lose because of it. 
 
We live today in a deeply troubled nation. Voter turnout is pitifully low. Too many have come to believe that their votes dont matter and point to what has just happened again as proof. It behooves us to measure our institutions by todays effects, rather than by an outdated reverence for their original intent. Change is the primary constant in human affairs. No human institution can usefully endure forever. 
 
It comes down to what kind of nation we want to be. Are we content to live in a nation in which our vote may count, or not count, depending on what serves an apparatus beyond direct accountability? Or do we want to live in a nation of transparent and accountable voting, based on one person, one vote? In that case we need to recognize the Electoral College for what it is, and say good riddance.
