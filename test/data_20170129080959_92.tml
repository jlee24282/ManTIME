Family say they found her dehydrated and exhausted. When Snoke was taken to the hospital, there were no signs of drugs in her system. 
 
Since being found, Snoke has been resting and getting her health back to normal. According to family, she had no cell phone service to contact them about where she was. 
 
The family was able to locate her when a person who saw the Eagle Point Police photo on their Facebook page recognized the unknown man. The person then gave the family a general location of where the man lived and what he drove.
