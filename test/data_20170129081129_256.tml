<TITLE>Cong-SP partnership is to defeat fascist forces: Rahul Gandhi</TITLE>
<TEXT>"Our alliance with Samajwadi Party is for development, prosperity and peace," said Congress leader Rahul Gandhi at joint press conference with Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav. 
 
Mr. Gandhi said that the partnership between Congress, SP is an answer to divisive politics of anger. 
 
Mr. Yadav said, "We are like two wheels of bicycle...There is not much of a difference in age between us; today is the beginning. Rahul and I will take UP ahead on the path of prosperity." 
 
Mr. Gandhi said that the alliance is the confluence of Ganga and Yamuna out of which the Saraswati of development will come out. "I hailed Akhilesh earlier too & pointed out that he was not being allowed to do good work." 
 
The Samajwadi Party and the Congress will fight the 2017 Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections together.</TEXT>
