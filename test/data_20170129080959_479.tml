<content type="str">Former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe could make a comeback after his fall from grace, this time potentially occupying a ministerial position 
 
Brian Molefe could be on his way to Parliament, according to a report by the Sunday Times . 
 
It’s reported that the ANC in North West has put in a request at Luthuli House to have Molefe added to the list of members it wants sent to Parliament. It’s alleged that President Jacob Zuma could soon be initiating a cabinet reshuffle, and Molefe’s appointment as an MP could pave the way for this. 
 
The paper also reported that supporters of Zuma have been trying to persuade the president to get rid of Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and replace him with Molefe.

Secretary General Gwede Mantashe wouldn’t comment on whether or not Molefe had been added to the list of standby MPs, but explained that any ANC member could be added to the list of 10. 
 
The expected reshuffle by Zuma has also been reported to make provision for outgoing president of the African Union Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, who’s been fingered as one of the strongest candidates to succeed Zuma as president of the ANC. 
 
Molefe resigned from his position as CEO of Eskom last year after he was implicated in the Public Protector’s report on state capture.
