<TITLE>Footwear Without Back Straps Are Sandals, Says Delhi High Court In Case Of Duty Drawback</TITLE>
<TEXT>Have you ever wondered whether a footwear without a back strap is a sandal or a chappal? I am sure not. But if reports are to be believed, the Delhi High Court has ruled that it is a sandal and not a chappal. 
 
The Hindu reports that the high court gave its order in a case where a Chennai-based footwear manufacturer, Wishall International, challenged the Centre over the issue. The footwear manufacturer had demanded duty drawback at 10% saying that they export sandals and not chappals. 
 
According to the report, sandal exports attract 10% customs duty drawback and that of chappals attracts only 5%. 
 
The newspaper reported that the dispute began in 2003 after a shipping bill filed by the company to export "ladies leather sandals." The Customs Department in New Delhi had said these were chappals and not sandals. 
 
The Council of Leather Exports too had said that the consignment was of sandals and not chappals. 
 
But after the Footwear Design and Development Institute in Noida said that they were chappals, the report says, the matter was taken to the high court.
