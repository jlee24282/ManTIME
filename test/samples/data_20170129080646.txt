The Nets are hapless, and despite keeping it close for a while, their lack of defense and consistent offensive fire power beyond Brook Lopez meant they were never able to really make a game of it. The Wolves rolled offensively, making 51 percent from the field, nine threes, getting to the line 32 times and grabbing 12 offensive rebounds. It was easy for them much of the night. \n\nOnce the Wolves cleaned up their transition defense, a problem in the first half when they allowed 17 fast break points for the Nets, they were able to pull away. \n\nWire to wire victories are rare things for the Timberwolves. This was their third such win of the year, and it should not be taken for granted. There were some hiccups, but the Wolves established that they were the better team early, and didn\u2019t let this get away, as we\u2019ve seen far too many times this season. \n\nThe individual story for the Wolves tonight, as it often is, was Karl-Anthony Towns. He finished with 37 and 13, added four blocks, and there were stretches in the second half that he simply dominated. His ability to shoot it or drive it from the perimeter remains astounding for a big man, and he took advantage, with two threes and several impressive forays into the paint. His three pointer-blocked shot-three point play off an offensive rebound sequence in the fourth quarter was the final nail in the coffin and showed off his immense talent. \n\nTowns did all of this while playing under the weather. He almost didn\u2019t play in the game tonight. \n\nMeanwhile, both Andrew Wiggins and Zach LaVine got to 20 tonight, and it was especially nice to see LaVine find his shooting touch. Three for six from three and six for 11 overall is where we expect him to be. Wiggins has also been sick for the last few days, but both he and Towns were able to push through their illnesses. \n\nIt\u2019s nice to win a game you are expected to win, and to do so with a minimum amount of drama. The Wolves face another struggling Eastern Conference team at home on Monday when the Orlando Magic come to town. \n\nNotes \n\nKris Dunn had a nice game in relief of Ricky Rubio, who was in foul trouble most of the night. Dunn didn\u2019t score, but dished out seven assists and grabbed five boards, and the offense rolled along with him in there. He\u2019s had his moments this season. \n\nRubio himself had a bit of a scoring run keeping the game out of reach for the Nets in the fourth and finished with 14 points and six dimes in 22 minutes. (I wonder if he regrets taking an intentional foul early when Towns was down at the other end of the floor.) \n\nShabazz Muhammad once again produced off the bench for the Wolves, finishing with 18. That guy lives to score. He remains hot from three (two for three,) and just grinds for buckets inside. Also grabbed five offensive boards. \n\nBrook Lopez can score. 25 in 30 minutes on 10-15 from the field. \n\nI like the looks of that Caris LeVert. Finished with 11 points, four boards, two steals. Looks like there\u2019s a player in there. \n\nGorgui Dieng finished with 12 points, 10 rebounds, and 4 assists. It was his seventh double-double of the season and first since Jan. 6 at Washington. \n\nMinnesota now moves to 18-29 on the season and have now won five out of their last six games at Target Center. \n\nWolves are 11-14 at home on the season and 7-3 over their last 10 games. \n\n129 points is a season-high. \n\nWiggins made the 1000th free throw of his career in the first quarter tonight. \n\nQUOTES \n\nTom Thibodeau \n\nOn pulling away in the third quarter: \n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a great game but they can score, I liked the way we started the game a lot. I thought we got loose for a little while and this is a tough team to let your guard down, you know for a minute they can make a run quickly on you and so I thought we did that but I thought we responded. The second half was better, I liked what we did offensively. I thought moving the ball was very good, we got good shots, we shared it, made quick decisions, that part was good. Defensively we still have a lot of work to do.\u201d \n\nOn Dunn stepping in for Rubio because of foul trouble: \n\n\u201cI thought Kris [Dunn] gave us really good minutes, I thought Shabazz [Muhammad] gave us really good minutes off the bench. I thought Zach [LaVine] was good again. Karl [Towns] was terrific, he was still a little under the weather but obviously (I\u2019m) very pleased with his work.\u201d \n\nOn tightening their game up: \n\n\u201cWe want to have 13 turnovers or less in a game so, I thought we\u2019re doing a lot better job with that by keeping the turnovers down. If we don\u2019t hang on to it too long, you don\u2019t dance with it just make quick decisions. If you have the shot take it, if not move it quickly. When we do that we\u2019re very good offensively.\u201d \n\nKarl-Anthony Towns \n\n\u201cToday was a long day for me. I\u2019m glad it ended well. I was real close to getting a DNP tonight. I decided when I walked in, about 20 minutes, I was going to play. I\u2019m happy that we got a W and that I was able to contribute. I really can\u2019t talk too much and not too loud. I\u2019m just glad I found a way to get out of bed today.\u201d \n\nOn feeling sick during the game: \n\n\u201cOh yeah, it was hard to breathe. Coughing the whole time. You just have to find a way. You have to. I made the decision to play. We have a great training staff, a great family, too. It was fun to be out there and get a win. Both Towns\u2019 are down, but not out.\u201d \n\nOn the team\u2019s performance in the second half: \n\n\u201cWe did a great job of executing and staying disciplined. We had a game plan. We weren\u2019t flawless, but close to it. We did a great job of making them take tough shots. At the end they started driving to the basket and we started adjusting. We did a great job of changing to the game, making things happen.\u201d \n\nGorgui Dieng \n\n\u201cHe (Towns) was sick. But I don\u2019t know\u2026 I thought if he was going to play like this, we need to have him sick for the rest of the season.\u201d \n\nOn the team\u2019s current play: \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting better. We\u2019re getting better as a team. Coach is going to throw a lot of stuff at you and we are starting to pick it up and understand all of his terminology and the stuff he wants to do on the court. Long process, keep learning and getting better. 7 out of 10, that\u2019s good. If you keep scratching wins like this, like four wins, five wins, we have a chance.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: NBA - Brooklyn Nets news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: NBA - Minnesota Timberwolves news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: NBA news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: basketball news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest scores","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Wolves Roll Over Nets, 129-109","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Yard Barker","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"459817831","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Yard Barker","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Basketball","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.yardbarker.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194224067","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:55:15Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:13:53Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The only unknown was how dominant his double-double would be in front of scouts from what Fox Sports' Aaron Torres estimated as 25 NBA teams.In Adebayo's place, it was Kansas' de facto power forward who balled out in his audition for the pros, as Jackson finished with 20 points, 10 rebounds, three assists and two stealsincluding what was effectively a game-sealing putback layup with just over a minute remaining.Sporting News' Sam Vecenie added his thoughts on Jackson's performance:Aside from the one-game losing \"streaks\" each squad carried, the big story heading into the clash between the two winningest programs in college basketball history was the lack of a backup power forward.Carlton Bragg Jr. was indefinitely suspended from the Jayhawks on Thursday, as the Kansas City Star's Jesse Newell first reported. From that moment, the options for slowing Adebayo became Landen Lucas or bust. And with Adebayo's No. 20 ranking in fouls drawn per 40 minutes, one guy shouldn't have been enough to contain him.Even before losing Bragg, Kansas had more than its fair share of problems slowing opposing big men. West Virginia's Esa Ahmad had 27 points against the Jayhawks on Tuesday. Texas' Jarrett Allen exploded for 22 points and 19 rebounds against them last weekend. TCU's Vladimir Brodziansky put up 28, Stanford's Reid Travis had 29 and Georgia's Yante Maten went for 30.Remove one of the pieces of that frontcourt and put it against arguably the best physical big man in this year's draft class, and the sky was the limit for Adebayo.Contrary to logic and popular assumption, though, he struggled all night.In what was supposed to be a dunk highlight reel for the big man, he only had one slam while racking up four turnovers and four personal fouls. Moreover, he missed six of his 10 free-throw attempts and struggled on the defensive glass, allowing Kansas to turn nine offensive rebounds into 17 second-chance points.Rather than worrying about who on the Jayhawks would guard Adebayo, it seems we should have been wondering who on the Wildcats could slow Jackson.When he is making outside shots like he has been lately, though, there are only a handful of teams in the country that can even pretend to have an answer for him.For the first two-plus months of the season, the knock on Jackson was he couldn't shoot. Considering he started 9-of-38 (23.7 percent) from three-point range and 53-of-93 (57.0 percent) from the free-throw line, it was a fair complaint. He has borderline unstoppable in transition since middle school, but the game plan in the half-court offense was to let him shoot threes and give up the foul if he tried to drive past you.Now that he is 8-of-14 from downtown in his last three games, it's even harder to find weaknesses on a versatile team with its sights set on a 13th consecutive Big 12 title.Here's the thing everyone seemed to forget when the Bragg news broke: Jackson has been thriving as the small-ball 4 for Kansas since late November.According to KenPom.com, the 6'8\" wing has been Kansas' power forward for 75 percent of its minutes over the past five games; its other 6'8\" wing, Svi Mykhailiuk, was holding down that job 15 percent of the time. The only thing that changes without Bragg is the 10 to 15 minutes per game Lucas spends on the bench will now be divvied up between Mitch Lightfoot and Dwight Colebya duo that held its own for 14 minutes against Kentucky.As B/R's C.J. Moore wrote before the game, the small-ball approach is a significant change of pace for Jayhawks head coachBill Self compared to the past decade, but it's working beautifully. Kansas beat Kentucky at its own game and showed it is prepared to run up and down with anyone, anywhere.Yes, there are still concerns for the Jayhawks. They shot 10-of-18 from the free-throw line and remain one of the worst free-throw shooting teams in the country. And they'll stillstruggle to slow opposing big menthe main reason Adebayo never got going is De'Aaron Fox and Malik Monk were pushing the pace every chance they could and never allowed the freshman to establish position or dominance.But in a week when nearly every title contender east of Arizona suffered at least one loss, winning at Rupp Arena makes Kansas once again look like the team to beat in men's college basketball.

But by all accounts the relationship between the quarterback and coach is straightforwardly transactional. \n\nBelichick treats Brady the same way he does every other player: with that distant, flat, emotionless voice straight from the catacombs. \n\n\"They have never even gone out to lunch or dinner,\" Brady's father, Tom Sr., said. \"That's not what they do.\" \n\nCan it really be true that two men who have shared so much pure winning are so impersonal? Or are they hiding something? Surely, behind the scenes, the relationship warms to a nice rapport; there must be an affinity, the gunslinger affection of Butch and Sundance. Or at least the dueling banter of James Bond and his black ops quartermaster, Q. \n\nQ: \"I'll hazard I can do more damage on my laptop sitting in my pajamas before my first cup of Earl Grey than you can do in a year in the field.\" \n\nBond: \"Oh, so why do you need me?\" \n\nQ: \"Every now and then a trigger has to be pulled.\" \n\nInstead, the repartee between Brady and Belichick is largely composed of highly technical, heavily operational talk.Advertisement Except when Belichick is blistering Brady for something in practice, which he does periodically for the benefit of the team. The success of their collaboration rests on two simple understandings, neither of which is particularly deep. \n\nFirst, they share a workaholic absorption in the tedium of football strategy, a love for cataloging tendencies and almost mechanistic work habits. Last February, Brady had a digital clock installed in his workout room at home that ticks down the days, hours, minutes and seconds to the 2017 Super Bowl, so that he would know \"he had exactly 11,325 minutes and 14 seconds to go,\" Tom Sr. said. \n\nSecond, they share an instinct that self-deprecation is the heart of real leadership. One of the marvels of their collaboration is that they have been able to fight the corrosions of stardom so consistently and build a culture that, for all of its disparate personalities, is essentially egoless and sublimating. As Brady remarked on his weekly radio show last week, the Patriots are \"brainwashed.\" \n\n\"We have a sign on our wall that says 'Doing the right thing for the team when it may not be the right thing for you,'' ' Brady said. \"And that's just putting everything aside and ignoring the noise and all the positive things that people may say about you, all the negative things people may say about you and just believing in yourself and not making excuses. ... I think our coach does a great job of never buying into that B.S. He never makes it about one player; he never makes it about one play. He never makes it about one call or one situation. ... And he never lets his foot off the gas pedal, so really, when you come to our team, it's just, you're brainwashed. It's just the way it goes.\" \n\nBut if Belichick is a brainwasher, Brady has been the lead hypnotist. According to close observers, the Patriots' ethos begins with Brady's fundamental acquiescence to Belichick's authority, even when it hurts. \n\n\"Players learn from players, and when you walk into that place and watch how Brady conducts his business, you know that's how you do it there,\" says Damon Huard, who served as a backup quarterback for the Patriots from 2001 to 2003. \n\nBrady willingly lets Belichick use him as the example, in everything from renegotiating cap-friendly contracts to absorbing Belichick's scathing sarcasm for mistakes. One team insider notes that no matter how brilliant Belichick's game-planning and personnel decisions, \"If Brady had a different personality and didn't buy in and wasn't this type of leader, it would be difficult.\" \n\nAccording to someone who knows both men, the tone was set during Brady's rookie season, when he sat impatiently in meetings that would halt while former starter Drew Bledsoe left the room for a bathroom break. Brady determined then not to be a quarterback who could make a room revolve around him, even unintentionally. \n\nFormer players cite example after example in which Brady has served as Belichick's company man, without resentment. Gary Myers documented in one of his books, \"Brady vs Manning, The Untold Story of the Rivalry That Transformed the NFL,\" how Belichick would intentionally resist praising Brady for individual records, finally relenting only when he surpassed 50,000 yards. Former Patriots cornerback Aqib Talib told ESPN of one day in practice when Brady threw an interception on a seam route and Belichick exploded at him in full view of everyone, \"You got 130 career interceptions, and half of them are on this route. You keep doing the same s over and over, and this is what happens.\" \n\nHis father cites an instance when Belichick told Brady witheringly after an incompletion, \"You're supposed to be an all-pro, and I can go down the street to the local high (school) and find a quarterback who could complete that pass.\" \n\nThe message is that Belichick demands from all players equally, and Brady has been secure enough to accept it - though not without feeling as if he has taken, as Brady's father puts it, some \"piercing shots\" from Belichick, even at 39. \n\n\"When you've been doing this a lot of years, you don't expect to keep taking shots,\" Tom Sr. said. \"On the other hand, there is a process to team-building. If any player on the team holds himself out to be better than somebody else, then the team-building is not solid. If you can shoot the big dog, all the other dogs in the pack are going to pay attention. ... And the players love it because it signals that they're all in this together. ... When he gets knocked down, they all kind of revel in it.\" \n\nBrady has told his father that he aims to be \"the perfect soldier.\" That doesn't mean he always has understood his orders, or that there haven't been clashes. If there is a fundamental difference between the two men, it's in temperament: Brady is fierce, Belichick famously detached. Brady has struggled to understand some of Belichick's cooler roster decisions, how he could discard players who seemed essential or with whom Brady was close, such as Lawyer Milloy, Deion Branch and Logan Mankins. It was apparently hard for Brady to see how it was for the betterment of the team to trade Mankins, his best offensive lineman, just before the 2014 season, over financial calculations. \n\n\"When trades are made or changes are made, they impact Tom emotionally,\" says Tom Sr. \"Bill is not the emotional leader of the team. He does not make emotional decisions; he makes intellectual decisions, financial decisions, strategic decisions. He is involved with those rational parts of team-building, whereas the players have to connect emotionally. When Bill makes decisions, he knows what's behind Door No. 2 or Door No. 3, whereas players are dealing with it more myopically.\" \n\nThe relationship works, observers say, because they have a mutual regard for the other as the absolute best in the NFL, and a tacit agreement to stay out of each other's backyards and disagree without blowing up the organization. \n\n\"It wouldn't work this long if it wasn't a fundamentally healthy relationship,\" Huard said. \n\nBelichick has made it clear he believes Brady is the best of all time, and Brady has learned to admire Belichick's ability to build and manage highly flexible rosters that withstand losses to injury, \"his ingenious way of putting the team together and having so many moving parts that can adjust to any occasion,\" Tom Sr. says. \n\nIt's an odd dynamic: an impersonal relationship that has nevertheless steadily defined them personally over the years, until each has become sharply defined as among the greatest ever. A shared determination to build a faceless, egoless organization has made each of them, in his own way, the unmistakable frozen-in-time face of the franchise: Belichick, hooded and inscrutable on the sideline, Brady so poised under center that he seems almost pensive. \n\n\"Bookends,\" Tom Sr. said. \"Complementary bookends.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Sally Jenkins"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: NFL - New England Patriots news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: American football news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Their game's all business","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Middlesex","zipCode":"01850","state":"Massachusetts","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Lowell","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Lowell Sun","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169660764","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1259"},"name":"Lowell Sun","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.lowellsun.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194229220","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:13:48Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site105/2017/0129/20170129_121131_LS_012917_BRADY-BELICHICK.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

The first step in doing so' Determining the next challenger for reigning champion Amanda Nunes.While picking out the top contender can sometimes be a difficult task, the women's bantamweight was down to a two-horse race between UFC on Fox 23 main eventers Julianna Pena and Valentina Shevchenko.Pena established herself as one of the most compelling young talents at 135 pounds on The Ultimate Fighter18. Racking up wins over women's MMA pioneer Shayna Baszler, former rival Sarah Moras and accomplished boxer Jessica Rakoczy, she set herself up to become an instant contender in what was at the time a shallow division.A catastrophic knee injury saw her shelved for a prolonged length of time. But any doubts about her progression or health were dismissed when she returned in 2015 and broke off three consecutive wins, including a clean decision over former top contender Cat Zingano. That put her on strong footing for a title shot and likely would have been enough to secure her one, if not for Shevchenko's sudden rise.That rise came at UFC on Fox 20. After taking a solid win over Sarah Kaufman in her UFC debut, Shevchenko was given a bout against Nunes in her second fight with the promotion. While she lost a straightforward 29-28 decision, she demonstrated strong cardio, resiliency and grappling to go along with her established striking. And that earned her a high-profile fight opposite Holly Holm.Despite entering the fight as an underdog, Shevchenko shocked fans and pundits by neutralizing the former champ's offense and scoring a unanimous 49-46 decision win. That win, and the strong ratings it produced, vaulted Shevchenko right back into the title picture, despite her owing a loss from the champ that is less than a year old.That gave this UFC on Fox 23 tilt big, clear stakes in the bantamweight division and beyond. And that bright spotlight gave Shevchenko a big opportunity to shine.From the very beginning, both women's approaches were clear. Pena inched forward and steadily lowered herself for a shot while Shevchenko fought behind her punches. At first, it seemed like this would favor Pena, as she controlled much of the action with her clinch work, but Shevchenko managed to keep her striking in check with well-timed trips. Pena hunted for submissions from underneath, but ultimately Shevchenko took the round, likely on her minutes-long control from the top.The second round was much of the same, but this time, Pena managed to avoid Shevchenko's sneaky clinch takedowns and eventually score a takedown of her own. That moral victory, however, was quickly followed by a legitimate loss.After absorbing some punches in full guard position, Shevchenko whipped her hips around and locked up a lightning-quick armbar. Pena attempted to roll her way out, but Shevchenko stuck with her every move and forced the tap.It was a shocking ending to a fight where Pena was expected to own a major advantage on the ground, and one that cements Shevchenko's place as an elite-level bantamweight. After the official decision was read, Nunes entered the Octagon and seemingly accepted a proposed rematch with the former muay thai champion.Whether that rematch happens is a question for another time, but it's hard to dismiss Shevchenko's chances, should it come to pass.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Bleacher Report on Sun, 29 Jan"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: MMA news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Pena vs. Shevchenko Results: Winner and Reaction from UFC on Fox 23","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Western Africa","countryCode":"NG","country":"Nigeria"},"editorialRank":"5","name":"Latest Nigerian News.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"552291450","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Latest Nigerian News.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.latestnigeriannews.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194230263","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:01:51Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:13:48Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

On December 2, 2015, in San Bernardino, while an American woman of Iranian descent fell victim to that terror attack, another American of Iranian descent was among the first responders on the scene. America again watched in horror, grieving the cruel effects of terrorism on our homeland. But regardless of gender, faith, or national origin, we were all Americans on that tragic day.Fast forward, 13 months later, and President Trumps executive order imposing a ban on the very same Americans, now prevents their families from visiting, denies them access to emergency medical treatment in the U.S., and separates them from their loved ones indefinitely.We are all too familiar with adversarial relations between our government and that of Iran. However, the great majority of Iranians who came to America, as many other immigrant groups and refugees before them, did so to leave behind persecution and oppression. They are victims, not terrorists, and by virtue of that very fact, Iranians are the least likely to engage in terrorism. Furthermore, by using a broad brush to label all Muslims as enemies of America, the order ignores the fact that there has never been a single act of terror committed by anyone of Iranian descent in the United States. Iranians were not among the perpetrators of 9/11 or the San Bernardino attack or any of the other acts of terror that have taken place in the United States. If anything, Iranians are today a primary target and victim of ISISwhich targets not only Christians, Jews and other infidels, but also rejects Irans Shia Islam as a perversion of the faith. This is all the more remarkable given the fact that countries whose nationals have been active in committing acts of terror on U.S. soil are entirely exempted from this order, calling into question its efficacy and intent. Moreover, we cannot turn a blind eye to the fact that the people of Iran have consistently demonstrated their affinity for the core values of our American democracy including liberty, freedom, and the rule of law. On 9/11 they spontaneously held emotional candlelight vigils expressing solidarity with our victims. So, by unfairly targeting all Iranians, the executive order undermines the solidarity between those who live in democratic countries like America and those working hard to implement these ideals in their own countries. Here, Iranian Americans prove every day that we are patriotic and fully support our national security concerns. We serve on the front lines of our national defense, whether on the battlefield, in government, or as technology-providers and first responders. However, given the questionable legality of such a widespread ban based on national origin or faith, today we offer our loyal opposition to the blanket ban on the entry of Iranian nationals, viewing it as misplaced punishment and detrimental to our national security. This sentiment is consistent with what then-Governor Pence declared in December 2015: Calls to ban Muslims from entering the U.S. are offensive and unconstitutional.Instead, we believe a balance can be struck that addresses our national security concerns without alienating more than two million Americans of Iranian descent, 70 million Iranian nationals and Muslims worldwide while imposing unnecessary pain and human suffering on the innocent. Accordingly, The Public Affairs Alliance of Iranian Americans (PAAIA) urges the president to make clear that his executive order does not ban the re-entry of established permanent residents, dual nationals and those who have secured valid visas, and to avoid a policy based on national origin and faith. Even President Reagan exempted the relatives of Americans in 1986 with respect to the entry of Cubans into the United States. This in no way contradicts the need for rigorous background checks, which we agree is essential. As a nation of immigrants, America has always made room for the next wave of the tired, the poor and the huddled masses yearning to breathe free ... Without exception, each wave of immigrants has had to pay its dues before fully assimilating into America: The fact is, street discrimination is a simple reality every immigrant faces, but that immigrant has always looked up to the Constitution and the Office of the President to act as his or her champion, guaranteeing that they will never be violated by way of legalized discrimination. As the leader of a nation of immigrants, it is our sincere hope that President Trump will adhere to the best of American values and reevaluate his executive order, keeping it consistent with our constitutional values and the governing immigration laws of the land, while ensuring our national security. Accordingly, we urge the amendment of the order to exclude relatives of American citizens as well as permanent residents and students, no matter what their national origin or faith. -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

One week and you're already the worst president in US history. It's unbelievable. You delivered an inaugural speech that was divisive and hateful.You reaffirmed that you're a size queen -- you lied about the size of your crowd and of your vote, just like you lie about the size of of your small hand.You already broke your promise to working people by appointing lobbyists, billionaires, anti-worker CEOs, and Goldman Sachs bankers to your government.You refused to do what every reputable expert urged you to do: divest from your businesses. Instead your business lieutenants are aggressively touting your new power to sell your hotel rooms and club memberships. Next they'll be restarting your predatory Trump University.You've turned our American democracy into American kleptocracy.As you and our cronies get richer, Americans get poorer.You started tearing up the health care system that protects so many people, with no plan to replace it.You chose an uninformed enemy of public schools, Betsy DeVos, to be Secretary of Education.You declared that taxpayers' money will be spent instead on a pointless wall, nothing more than a symbol of your fear and bigotry, and you took a break from tweeting at Meryl Streep, SNL, and Hamilton, to resume hurling insults at an entire nation, our neighbor Mexico.You continued your bizarre love affair with the Russian dictator Putin. And you picked his business partner Rex Tillerson to be Secretary of State.You abandoned America's urgent work to slow the undeniable danger of climate change, and you picked the polluters' best friend Scott Pruitt to trash the EPA.You picked an enemy of civil rights, Jeff Sessions, to be our attorney general, just as you attacked our great civil rights hero John Lewis.You've stocked your White House with angry anti-muslim bigots like Flynn and Bannon.You told the nation that torture works, so you're for it. King Donald, if you decided that the police shooting suspects on the street, instead of arresting them, \"works,\" would you endorse that' King Donald, torture isagainst the law.And you capped off your first week with an illegal, anti-Muslim immigrant ban -- not based on facts, not focused on the threats to our people, but based on fear and prejudice.It's a ban that punished honest people fleeing unspeakable violence. It's a ban that locked up courageous people who risked their lives helping our government.But on Saturday night, King Donald, not one but two judges blocked your Muslim ban -- they said it was illegal.They made you a loser.There's a long, long way to go, but King Donald, your downfall began Saturday night. You're gonna start losing, big league.People of good will aregonna fight this arrogant, childish, bigoted tyrant. People who voted for Trumpare turning away, wishing they hadn't.We're gonna fight, and we're gonna win. And we're gonna get King Donald out of the White House.And we will have jobs with good wages, and health care. And we will have a clean environment.And we will have racial justice, and safe communities, and the right to vote.And we will defend and preserve a free press that tells the truth instead of spreading lies, like you do, King Donald.And we will make our country safe, protecting ourselves without resorting to torture, without Guantanamo and secret prisons, and all the other things you support that would actually weaken America.King Donald, you are a loser.

He has a new role for a new coach in a new system. \n \nBut he\u2019s still the same, ol' Z-Bo, even at the ripe old age of 35. \n \n\u201cI don\u2019t see anything different, man,\u201d point guard Mike Conley said after Randolph\u2019s season-high 28 points led the Grizzlies to a 102-95 victory Saturday over the Utah Jazz . \u201cIt\u2019s the same guy making the same moves. We joke all the time. I\u2019m like, \u2018Man, you\u2019re never going to stop playing. You don\u2019t look like you age. You don\u2019t look like you\u2019re slowing down.\u2019 It\u2019s fun to see him just continually doing his thing.\u201d \n \nThat\u2019s a polite way of saying that Randolph has been getting buckets his entire career despite a vertical leap that can be measured with your thumb and index finger. \n \n\u201cThey say it\u2019s an old-man game, old-school game,\u201d Randolph said with a smile. \u201cI\u2019ll take it how it comes.\u201d \n \nRandolph\u2019s role has changed this season, as he sacrificed by accepting a sixth man role, but his per-minute production hasn\u2019t dipped. His player efficiency rating (19.2) is right about his career norm. He\u2019s putting up 20.7 points per 36 minutes, which is actually 1.5 points better than his career average. \n Zach Randolph scored a season-high 28 points on Saturday night, much to the appreciation of Mike Conley, James Ennis and the rest of the Grizzlies.  Jeff Swinger/USA TODAY Sports \nThe major dip for Randolph has been in his minutes. He\u2019s playing only 24.2 minutes per game, his fewest since he was a 21-year-old pup in Portland. \n \nHowever, Randolph\u2019s playing time is trending upward as he\u2019s in the midst of his best month of the season. He\u2019s averaging 27.9 minutes in January while putting up 15.9 points and 9.8 rebounds per game. Three of his five 20-plus-point performances so far this season have come this month. \n \n\u201cI\u2019m just in a rhythm, man,\u201d Randolph said. \u201cI had to get my legs under me and get a feel. Coach is playing me more minutes and longer stretches. I\u2019m getting a chance to get my rhythm.\u201d \n \nFirst-year coach David Fizdale: \u201cHe\u2019s worked his way to that. I needed to get him on the court more, but it also came with his conditioning level going up.\u201d \n \nThat has meant more minutes alongside All-Star center Marc Gasol . For years, that duo formed a punishing one-two punch as the Grizzlies built their six-year postseason streak on a bullying style of basketball. With the league trending toward a space-and-pace style, Fizdale was hesitant about using the two bruisers together a lot, primarily due to concerns about Randolph defending small-ball power forwards. \n \nFizdale made a deal with Randolph: Prove he can defend pick-and-rolls and prevent opposing power forwards from getting open 3-pointers and he\u2019d get to be on the floor with Gasol more. \n \nThe 6-foot-9, 260-pound Randolph has responded to the challenge. As a result, he\u2019s a crunch-time regular again, which is much more important to Randolph than starting games. His presence down the stretch is paying dividends: Randolph has 21 points on 10-of-15 shooting in 31 clutch minutes this month, according to NBA.com stats. \n \nThe Gasol-Randolph pairing is perhaps more potent than ever on the offensive end, in large part due to Gasol emerging as a lethal long-range shooter after operating primarily around the elbows for most of his career. Gasol serves as a stretch-4 these days when he plays with Randolph, who remains a crafty bull on the block. \n \nThe Grizzlies have a sky-high offensive rating of 114.6 points per 100 possessions in the 220 minutes Gasol and Randolph have played together this month. They played only 219 minutes together this season before January. \n \n\u201cI know where he wants the ball and I know how to get it there,\u201d said Gasol, who had 18 points and five assists Saturday. \u201cI\u2019ll do that. It\u2019s something that we\u2019ve been very productive at. I know how to pass it, where to pass it, and I\u2019m pretty good at it. If they try to front him, it\u2019s a wrap because I\u2019m going to get it to him with an advantage. \n \n\u201cAnd once he gets going and in a rhythm, then you\u2019re guessing what to take away. When he\u2019s in a rhythm, it\u2019s hard to stop him.\u201d \n  \nCheck out the team site for more game coverage \n  \nCheck out the team site for more game coverage \n \nThat\u2019s true regardless of who\u2019s guarding Randolph. There certainly aren\u2019t many second-team bigs who can disrupt his rhythm. But he proved Saturday that he could still score against even a dominant defender. Randolph\u2019s 12-of-20 shooting night included four buckets on seven attempts when he was guarded by Defensive Player of the Year candidate Rudy Gobert , highlighted by a beautiful, old-school, up-and-under move when he got the NBA\u2019s best shot-blocker to leave his feet. \n \n\u201cHe just gave him the business!\u201d Grizzlies shooting guard Tony Allen said gleefully. \u201cYou saw it! I mean, you saw it! I ain\u2019t making this s--- up.\u201d \n \nRandolph raved about Gobert\u2019s impact as a defender after the game, but he certainly wasn\u2019t surprised to have some success against the Jazz big man. \n \n\u201cI\u2019ve been doing it my whole career,\u201d Randolph said as he strolled to the Grizzlies\u2019 bus. \u201cAnybody. It don\u2019t matter.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: NBA - Memphis Grizzlies news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: NBA news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Old-school Zach Randolph is rolling for the Grizzlies","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"GB","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"ESPN.co.uk","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657842","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"65"},"name":"ESPN.co.uk","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Basketball","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.espn.co.uk"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://espn.go.com/nba/player/_/id/1017/zach-randolph","http://espn.go.com/nba/player/_/id/3195/mike-conley","http://espn.go.com/nba/player/_/id/3206/marc-gasol","http://www.nba.com/grizzlies","http://www.nba.com/jazz","http://espn.go.com/nba/player/_/id/3032976/rudy-gobert","http://espn.go.com/nba/player/_/id/2367/tony-allen"],"sequenceId":"695194242441","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T11:42:56Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:13:56Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Organisers claim this a record number of the little dogs in the one place at the one time. exit   \nMark Ellis, the organiser of Sunday's Werriwa Wiener Dash at the Bungendore Show, believes the turnout of 154 dachshunds for the event constitutes a world record for the number of the sausage dogs in one place at one time. \n \n\"We had miniatures, long hairs, short hairs, standards and wire hairs,\" he said. \"They came from all over; some even travelled from Melbourne. \n \nWhile Mr Ellis wasn't able to engage the attention of the people from Guinness, who ruled the record being sought was too \"specialised\" to interest them, he is happy to claim the record with any other contenders needing to prove him wrong. \n \nAlthough the quirky event, which has captured the imagination of dachshund lovers from across NSW and the ACT, is only in its second year it has already become one of the feature events of the Bungendore Show. \n \nThis year's dash winner was Buddy, owned by Jacqueline Winzenberg of Page in the ACT. Buddy's award was presented by NSW Deputy Premier and local member John Barilaro. \n \nOne hundred and twenty seven dogs turned up for the inaugural event in 2016. \n \nBungendore Show, which was first held in the 1840s, has gone from strength to strength in recent decades, this year's showgirl, Hanna Darmody, 22, said. \n \nMs Darmody, whose family own a Bungendore butchery, said she could recall helping with the catering at the show as a toddler almost 20 years ago. \n \n\"I've seen the event grow as the town has grown,\" she said. \"It is a great bridge between country and city; the showgirl competition is a good way to get young people involved and promotes opportunities in agriculture.\" \n \nShow organisers said this year's event, which enjoyed the best weather conditions in three years, was an unqualified success with more than 2000 people passing through the gates before lunch. \n \nIn addition to the usual attractions in the show ring and the pavilions and the dachshund dash, the 2017 event offered visitors a chance to get a close look at the Anzac Centennial 18 pounder gun. \n \nThe World War I-era weapon, which also saw service during World War II,was restored by the Royal Australian Artillery Company in conjunction with veteran coach builder Jim Frecklington. \n \nThe story Werriwa Wiener dash claims world dachsund record first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald .","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Werriwa Wiener dash claims world dachsund record","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"AU","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Cessnock Advertiser","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169693779","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"Cessnock Advertiser","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.cessnockadvertiser.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194242944","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:14:00Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Recent, câțiva cercetători de la Cambridge, Yale și Universitatea George Mason au început să studieze modul în care publicul pune botul la epidemia asta și au găsit o metodă similară unui vaccin pentru a opri răspândirea. \n \nPentru studiu , 2 000 de participanți americani au primit două versiuni diferite despre încălzirea globală. Una era un grafic real, care arăta că 97% din oamenii de știință sunt de acord că a fost provocată de om, și cealaltă era o petiție mincinoasă care afirma că \u201eipoteza încălzirii globale produsă de om nu e validă din punct de vedere științific\" și era susținută cu mii de semnături false, printre care găseai nume ca Charles Darwin și Spice Girls. \n \nCercetătorii au remarcat că atunci când le-a fost prezentat graficul, 20% din participanți erau dispuși să fie de acord că există un consens științific despre schimbarea climatică. Când participanților le-a fost prezentată informația falsă, 9% erau dispuși să creadă că nu are bază științifică. Când le-au fost prezentate ambele versiuni, opiniile celor mai mulți nu s-au schimbat față de ce au declarat la început. \n \n  Citește și:  Cum a fost la protestul în care zeci de mii de români au luptat antigrațiere și RTV a manipulat iar \n \n\u201eAtitudinea multor oameni față de schimbarea climatică nu e fermă\", a declarat autorul studiului Sander van der Linden. \u201eEi sunt conștienți că e o dezbatere în derulare, dar nu sunt siguri ce să creadă. Mesajele care se contrazic îi fac să simtă că nu înțeleg nimic.\" \n \nMai mult, când cercetătorii au introdus și un avertisment despre dezinformare, în același fel în care un vaccin introduce un virus în corp, oamenii s-au descurcat mai bine la a recunoaște știrile false. \n \nAutorii studiului au făcut asta prin oferirea de date suplimentare, care explicau că sunt grupuri cu interes politic interesate să convingă oamenii că cercetătorii nu se pot pune de acord și că asta implică tactici diversioniste, cum ar fi semnăturile false, pentru a manipula. Când participanții au văzut petiția falsă după grafic, erau mai predispuși s-o catalogheze drept falsă și 6,5% erau dispuși să accepte că există unanimitate din partea oamenilor de știință în privința schimbărilor climatice. \n \n\u201eDezinformarea poate prinde repede și se poate replica și răspândi ca un virus\", a spus van der Linden. \u201eIdeea e că trebuie furnizat un cadru cognitiv care să-i ajute pe oamenii să își crească rezistența la dezinformare, astfel încât data viitoare când mai văd știri false să fie mai greu de convins.\" \n \nVestea bună e că \u201eimunizarea\" a funcționat la fel de bine, indiferent de afilierea politică personală (deși republicanii, față de democrați, sunt statistic mai predispuși să creadă în informații false despre schimbarea climatică).

Letaba Rest Camp \n \nLetaba Rest Camp is situated on the bend of the Letaba River. The camp is midway between the southern and northern boundaries, reports the  Lowvelder . \n \nThe name means \u201criver of sand\u201d. The riverbed is an excellent location for game viewing, particularly elephant. \n \n\n \n2. Orpen Rest Camp \n \nOrpen Rest Camp is situated on the western border of the KNP. It derived its name from the surname of the donor of the land, Eileen Orpen. \n \nIt is an area of scattered trees and wide-open plains populated by the three big cats. You can also look forward to encounters with wild dog. \n \n3. Talamati Bushveld Camp \n \nTalamati Bushveld Camp is situated in a large open valley. Talamati is a Xitsonga word that means \u201clots of water\u201d. \n \nDespite the meaning of the name, the river is actually dry. The clay soil acts as a giant sponge holding a vast reservoir of underground water. The vegetation there is lush all year round and attracts grazers. \n \n4. Sirheni Bushveld Camp \n \nSirheni Bushveld Camp nestles on the edge of the KNP\u2019s northern plains. \n \nThe Mphongolo River flows close by. Sirheni is a Tsonga word that means \u201ccemetery\u201d. There is an elephant graveyard at a site near to the camp. From the camp\u2019s bird hides a wide variety of game and birds can be watched. \n \n\n \n5. Skukuza \n \nSkukuza is a Shangaan word meaning either \u201che who sweeps clean\u201d or \u201che who turns everything upside down\u201d. It is the biggest camp in the park. \n \nSome Krugerholics even call Skukuza the \u201ccapital\u201d of the Republic of Kruger! \n \nIt is close to the Kruger Gate and an excellent springboard to the rest of the Park. \n \n\n \n6. Punda Maria \n \nThe name of the Punda Maria rest camp was given in 1919 by the first ranger to be posted to the area, Captain JJ Coetser. \n \nHe mistakenly named his post Punda Maria in the belief that this was the Swahili name for zebra, the first big game he saw on arrival. \n \nThe correct Swahili name is actually \u201cpunda milia\u201d or striped donkey. When the error was pointed out to him, he chose to retain the name, in honour of his wife, Maria. \n \nDr. Salomon Joubert said that in 1959, the Parks Board changed the name to Punda Miliya. \n \nDr. Van Warmelo, a well-known ethnomologist, said that the name should be spelt Punda Milia and the board accepted that. \n \nIn 1981 Dr. Tol Pienaar did a submission to the board and two acquaintances of Coetzer Hewit Ivy and Astley Maberley said that this is the correct version of how it came about. \n \nThe board accepted the explanation and the name was restored in 1981. \n \n\n \n\u2013  Caxton News Service \n \nRead original story on lowvelder.co.za","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"This is how these six Kruger camps got their names","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Southern Africa","countryCode":"ZA","country":"South Africa"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Rising Sun Lenasia","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"555757755","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Rising Sun Lenasia","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://risingsunlenasia.co.za"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194245624","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:14:01Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Despite being begged to do so, it also failed to send a grader to allow firefighters access to the Hamabuya farm nor to get aerial support to combat the fire. \n \nThis was despite the Letaba Fire Protection Association having a spotter plane and helicopter on standby and a Working on Fire team being on standby. \n \nMopani insisted it could not call for aerial support because it was not a member of the Fire Protection Association, but the chairperson of the Letaba Fire Protection Association, Trevor Phillips, testified the municipality had been asked in vain many times to become a member. \n \nHe said Mopani was entitled to request aerial support if it wished to do so. \n \nJudge Fourie ruled that Mopani had a legal duty to have taken positive measures by calling for aerial support before the fire became uncontrollable. \n \n\u2013 Caxton News Service \n \nRead original story on citizen.co.za","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"\u2018Negligent\u2019 Mopani municipality to pay for timber farm blaze","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Southern Africa","countryCode":"ZA","country":"South Africa"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Rising Sun Lenasia","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"555757755","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Rising Sun Lenasia","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://risingsunlenasia.co.za"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194245786","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:14:01Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It's scandalous and another deal that is counter to the public interest.\" \n \nMeanwhile, the troubled relationship between the NSW attorney-general and minister for police has been addressed, with Ms Berejiklian confirming a reshaping of the much maligned \"justice cluster\". \n \nThe arrangement, whereby as justice and police minister Mr Grant held a more senior position than then attorney-general Gabrielle Upton, was heavily criticised by the legal profession. \n \nThe NSW Bar Association said it provided Mr Grant \"with unprecedented power in determining legal policy without the historical checks and balances\". \n \nThe NSW Law Society warned the arrangement meant police were \"ostensibly responsible for criminal law policy, while at the same time, the traditional roles of the attorney-general as first law officer of the state, which includes preserving civil liberties, are being eroded\". \n \nMs Berejiklian has confirmed the cluster has been reworked so that new attorney-general Mark Speakman, SC, is the lead minister. \n \nThe story New counter terrorism role slammed as 'against the public interest' first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald .","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Terrorism news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"New counter terrorism role slammed as 'against the public interest'","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"AU","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Cessnock Advertiser","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169693779","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"Cessnock Advertiser","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.cessnockadvertiser.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194245978","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:14:01Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Image:   for Vanity Fair By Ariel Bogle 2017-01-29 07:07:57 UTC  \nLinks to President Donald Trump are shaping up to be a liability for Silicon Valley's golden boys. Case in point: Uber.  \n \nThe hashtag #DeleteUber has been spreading on social media amid protests against Trump's Muslim travel ban. The ride hailing service was accused of \"strike breaking\" in New York Saturday, while others condemned remarks made by Uber CEO Travis Kalanick indicating he would work with the president.  \n \nIn a Facebook statement, Kalanick said the \"ban will impact many innocent people.\" \n \nHundreds travelled to New York's John F. Kennedy airport Saturday to demonstrate against Trump's executive order, which prohibits citizens of seven majority Muslim countries from entering the U.S. for 90 days. \n \nIn response to the ban, the NY Taxi Workers Alliance called for an hour work stoppage at the airport in protest. After Uber tweeted that surge pricing had been turned off at the airport, the company was quickly accused by some of \"strike breaking.\" \n \nTwitter and Facebook users began to share screenshots of themselves deleting their Uber accounts, including the message they were sending to the company. \n \n\"Uber has actively chosen to support racism, xenophobia, and bigotry,\" @katebergie wrote. \n \n\"Uber CEOs are collaborators with Trump and therefore support fascism,\" @flwrwrk wrote. \n \nIn response to the criticism, Uber's New York account tweeted late Saturday that its \"last tweet not meant to break strike.\" It also pointed to Kalanick's Facebook comment on the ban. \n \nUber's CEO has weathered criticism for being a member of the President's Strategic and Policy Forum, alongside Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX and Tesla, and Indra Nooyi, chairman and CEO of PepsiCo. \n \nIn his Facebook statement, Kalanick defended his decision to join the forum. \"We've taken the view that in order to serve cities you need to give their citizens a voice, a seat at the table,\" he wrote.  \n \n\"We partner around the world optimistically in the belief that by speaking up and engaging we can make a difference. Our experience is that not doing so shortchanges cities and the people who live in them.\" \n \nHe said he'd raise the Muslim travel ban with the president at a meeting of his business advisory group on Friday. \n \nUber CTO Thuan Pham is one Uber executive who has spoken out against the president in an internal email, according to Business Insider , calling the president a \"deplorable person.\" \n \n\"How can we sleep peaceful at night for the next 4 years knowing that the biggest societal problems rests on his lack of intellectual curiosity, judgment and temperament? It is indeed terrifying!\" Pham wrote in the leaked email. \n \nDespite Uber's official response, it does not appear the #DeleteUber campaign is slowing down.  \n \nWhile the American technology industry's ethos has been mostly one of open borders and free market principles, Trump's populist agenda will test the strength of those values.  \n \nThe coming months will show what any openness to Trump's agenda, the Muslim travel ban notwithstanding, means for a company's public image and bottom line. \n \nUber has been contacted by Mashable for comment.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Ariel Bogle"},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Social media news","group":"Internet"},{"name":"Internet latest","group":"Internet"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Thanks to Trump ties, #DeleteUber campaign grows on social media","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"Mashable","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169680286","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"119062"},"name":"Mashable","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["InformationTechnology","Professional","Internet"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.mashable.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://money.cnn.com/2017/01/25/technology/uber-ceo-trump/index.html","https://twitter.com/NYTWA/status/825463758709518337?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet","https://twitter.com/Uber_NYC/status/825502908926066688","https://greatagain.gov/president-elect-trump-announces-additional-members-of-presidents-strategic-and-policy-forum-8aa8822eced9#.udbavdgzr","http://www.businessinsider.com.au/uber-cto-internal-email-donald-trump-deplorable-2017-1?r=US&IR=T"],"sequenceId":"695194248866","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:14:04Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

He did some shoveling outside his Williston home, and then went inside to take ibuprofen for a nagging pain in his arm. \n\nHalf an hour later, the pain was gone, and Boone was celebrating the holiday with his family. \n\nBut later that night, he woke up from an early evening nap in front of the television to raging pain in his arm, back and chest. \n\n\"I was hurting so bad I started breaking out in a sweat,\" Boone said. \"The chest pain was the worst it felt like somebody was sitting on me.\" \n\nSoon he was sick, and his wife called for an ambulance, which managed to make the trip to his subdivision on Harvest Hill Drive, but paramedics had to borrow Boone's snow-blower to clear a path to load him into the vehicle. \n\nThe weather that earlier had meant little more than a blustery white Christmas was now suddenly a terrifying barrier to the life-saving medical treatment that emergency room staff at CHI St. Alexius Health in Williston almost immediately knew Boone needed. \n\n\"We stabilized him as best we could, but at that time I realized our resources were exhausted and he would not survive if we didn't get him elsewhere,\" said Karen Johnson, a certified registered nurse anesthetist, who tended to Boone that night. \n\nThe 45-year-old was having a massive heart attack due to double blockages, and needed to be transported to Trinity Hospital in Minot for surgery. \n\nHigh winds were keeping a medical flight crew on the ground, and local ambulance drivers said the snow was piling up too high to make such a long trip possible. \n\nBy 1 a.m., after Boone's heart had stopped for a second time, Johnson made a call to Rick Sigvaldsen, Williston's Department of Transportation district maintenance supervisor. \n\nShe asked if a snowplow could escort an ambulance to Minot, and the response was immediate. \n\n\"Absolutely,\" he said. \n\nWith snowplow driver Ed Nelson clearing a path, an ambulance carrying Boone, a paramedic and members of the Valley Med-Flight crew made its way to Minot, where a cardiologist put a stent in Boone's heart. \n\nThe trip took four hours. \n\n\"There's absolutely no way we would have done it without the snowplow,\" Corey Johnson, a Williston paramedic who rode in the back with Boone, said. \n\nThe decision to call wasn't made easily, Johnson said, pointing out that she would not have asked others to travel in risky conditions if so much hadn't been at stake, the Williston Herald (http://bit.ly/2kjDsZD ) reports. \n\n\"I would never have considered calling anybody out into those conditions if it hadn't been to save someone's life,\" she said, adding that the response she got was not unexpected. \"I was relieved, but not truly surprised because of the nature of the people in this community.\" \n\nBoone, a Mississippi native, is back to work in the oil industry, and enjoying his first grandchild, who was born a month ago. The two met for the first time after Boone's discharge from the hospital. \n\n\"I can't thank them enough. If it was not for them I wouldn't be here today \u2014 the snow plow driver played just as much a part as the doctors,\" he said. \n\n--- \n\nInformation from: Williston Herald, http://www.willistonherald.com \n\nAn AP Member Exchange shared by the Williston Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Elizabeth HackenburgThe Williston Herald"},"topics":[],"title":"Man suffering a massive heart attack saved by snowplow","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Fayette","zipCode":"40507","state":"Kentucky","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Lexington","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Kentucky.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169658700","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4463"},"name":"Kentucky.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Health","Lifestyle","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.kentucky.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://bit.ly/2kjDsZD","http://www.willistonherald.com/"],"sequenceId":"695194261668","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:14:13Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Marilyn van Dijk, a veterinary assistant, kept treats in Meyer's hands or in front of the dog at all times. \n\nHe'd forget that he had a bum leg, put his paw down and reach around for the treat. \n\nMeyer, keeping hold on Tigger via a harness, cooed in the dog's ear: \"I've got you. I've got you.\" \n\nAnd then Tigger relaxed. He'd move his front paws forward as if on automatic pilot. Walk, walk, walk. \n\nMeyer moved up the speed on the treadmill, and Tigger walked, walked, walked some more, as if he's been doing it his entire young life. \n\nExcept he hasn't. \n\nTigger has never walked or run on four legs like most canines. \n\nHe has jumped like a kangaroo on his hind two legs or inched forward on his belly. But he has never kept up with his foster parents' other dogs because his front two legs were congenitally deformed by a defect called ectrodactyly, or split hand or lobster claw. \n\nThese days, Meyer has him on the underwater treadmill and doing planks on a large plastic peanut to help develop callouses on the limb and strengthen his core to protect his other limbs. He hopes to introduce the dog to cavalletti exercises (small jumps) soon to help him further strengthen his muscles and improve his balance. \n\n\"He's been compensating his whole life, so we take this slow,\" Meyer said. \n\nTigger weighs slightly more than his optimal weight of 55 pounds, said his surgeon, Dr. Jennifer Warnock. The physical therapy sessions may help with that. \n\nDr. Warnock hopes to perform the second repair surgery on Tigger's other front leg at the end of March. But Good and her partner, Troy Riggs, have some fundraising to do first. When the Statesman Journal first broke Tigger's story last summer and it spread across the country through the USA Today Network and The Huffington Post, more than $17,000 was raised in a few weeks. \n\nMore than $10,000 was spent on Tigger's first surgery, ICU stay, bandaging needs, and his medication. At least $2,000 or $3,000 still needs to be raised to pay for this next round of surgery, which will repair the second front limb and fuse one portion of the other newly fashioned leg. Dr. Warnock expects Tigger's condition to regress a bit as he recovers from the second surgery, but she's cautiously optimistic the dog could be walking on both front legs by summer. \n\nTigger may or may not need prosthetics.

Meanwhile, a federal judge blocked a portion of Trump's directive in an emergency hearing in Brooklyn. The court ordered that refugees and immigrants with legal documents to enter the US not be returned to their home countries. It effectively paused the program, without ending it. \n \nThe judge\u2019s order cites the danger these immigrants would face if returned, and the potential of a violation of their due process rights, the constitutional guarantee of fair treatment under the law. The judge did not, however, order that they be released from government custody, nor did she rule on the constitutionality of the executive order itself. \n \nThe decision prevents federal agencies \u201cfrom, in any manner or by any means, removing individuals with refugee applications approved by US Citizenship and Immigration Services as part of the US Refugee Admissions Program, holders of valid immigrant and non-immigrant visas, and other individuals from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia, and Yemen legally authorized to enter the United States.\u201d \n \nLuis Mancheno, an immigration attorney and fellow at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law, which represents one of the unnamed petitioners to the lawsuit, says that the judge\u2019s language was strong. In court, Mancheno says, she said, \u201cNobody is to be removed.\u201d \n \nThe order came just in time for his organization\u2019s client, who was scheduled to be deported at 9:30 p.m. Saturday. \n \nIt is unclear how many people are being detained at airports across the country, but advocacy organizations estimate hundreds of people with valid travel documents are in federal custody. Mancheno says the judge asked how many people have been detained but the attorney representing the government did not know. \n \nPRI has asked the Department of Justice for details about the detentions that have occurred since Trump signed his executive order on Friday evening. The justice department has not responded. \n \nAt San Francisco International Airport, as the order came down, protesters chanted, \u201cLet them out! Let them out!\u201d Organizers of the protest there believe there are two people from Yemen and three from Iran in custody at that airport, but like the government attorney, couldn\u2019t say for sure. One of them, an 80-year-old Iranian man in a wheelchair with legal permanent resident status, was released at 7 p.m., according to reporters and organizers. \n  \nEighty-year old Iranian who landed 6 hours ago was just let out says: \"Trump is America's Ahmadinejad\" pic.twitter.com/yc7iO8B9FV \n \n\u2014 Sana Saleem (@sanasaleem) January 29, 2017 \n  \nThe executive order that Trump signed Friday gave federal agencies broad power to detain or deny entry to anyone arriving as a refugee from any country or as an immigrant of any kind from the so-called \u201ccountries of concern.\u201d Late in the day, the State Department said this includes people holding dual-citizenship from a country of concern and another country that is not the US. \n \nElica Vafaie, a lawyer with nonprofit Asian Americans Advancing Justice, was at SFO Saturday. She said she was gathering the names of Iranian Americans who came through the airport but were not detained to find out what agents were asking while vetting them. This kind of questioning, she says, was another matter not addressed in Saturday\u2019s emergency hearings. \n \n\u201cWe were operating in a legal world where legal permanent residents have much more rights than what was written in that executive order. So we\u2019re kind of seeing what these new practices are in the first week of this new administration,\u201d Vafaie said. \n \nZahra Billoo of the Council on American Islamic Relations Bay Area chapter said her organization too is getting ready for a fight. \n \n\u201cWe don\u2019t know how the Trump administration will fight back,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat we are advising people is that if they have a valid visa or if they are a legal permanent resident outside of the country, particularly from the seven Muslim-majority countries that are being targeted, you should return immediately.\u201d \n \nShe also advised that travelers coming to the US from these seven countries should be in touch with lawyers before they return. She and others, she said, will stay at the airport until all the detained immigrants are safe, she said. \n \nHundreds came to John Fitzgerald Kennedy airport in New York Saturday, where 12 refugees en route to a new life in the US were detained. They chanted, \u201cBuild the wall, we\u2019ll tear it down\u201d and, \u201cNo hate, no fear, refugees are welcomed here!\u201d \n \n\u201cI\u2019m here today because this Muslim ban is against America\u2019s ideals,\u201d said Justin Hendrix, a father from Brooklyn. \u201cAmerica has always stood for welcoming immigrants, refugees, the vulnerable and yesterday\u2019s executive order flies in the face of everything this country is about.\u201d \n \nWhen he saw news of the protest on social media, he got in his car and decided to be part of it. \n  \nAt JFK protests today.

At Kennedy Airport, they gathered at terminal 4, where at least some of the refugees were being held. \n \nHameed Khalid Darweesh, 53, and Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, 33, two Iraqis who filed the lawsuit for themselves and others in similar situations, were released from the New York airport before the emergency hearing Saturday. \n  \nImmigration ban not sitting well with America. pic.twitter.com/PV6NQZml10 \n \n\u2014 ian bremmer (@ianbremmer) January 29, 2017 \n  \nDaniel Altschuler of Make the Road NY, an immigrant rights organization that helped organize the New York protest, says the day had two sides. \u201cIt is a dark moment where families are being separated. There\u2019s a moral crisis in this country. At the same time, we\u2019re seeing an incredible response from the community.\u201d \n \nEarlier on Saturday, Trump told reporters that his executive order was working well. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s not a Muslim ban, but we were totally prepared. It\u2019s working out very nicely. You see it at the airports, you see it all over,\u201d he said, according to a White House press pool report. \n \nFrom PRI's The World ©2016 PRI","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Angilee Shah, Tiziana Rinaldi, Sahar Habib Ghazi"},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US Federal Government news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Lawsuits news","group":"Business"}],"title":"Federal judge deals Trump administration its first defeat \u2014 perhaps temporary \u2014 over its immigration restrictions","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Davidson","zipCode":"37228","state":"Tennessee","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Nashville","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Nashville Public Radio","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"198417690","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"96"},"name":"Nashville Public Radio","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.nashvillepublicradio.org"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://t.co/yc7iO8B9FV","https://twitter.com/sanasaleem/status/825543745701425152","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/27/us/politics/refugee-muslim-executive-order-trump.html?_r=0","http://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-visa-ban-also-applies-to-citizens-with-dual-nationality-state-department-says-1485628654","https://twitter.com/TizianaSRinaldi","https://t.co/RBXZBQxhS4","https://twitter.com/globalnation/status/825525016167071744","https://t.co/PV6NQZml10","https://twitter.com/ianbremmer/status/825538918238060544","http://www.pri.org/"],"sequenceId":"695194269514","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:49:35Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:14:14Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/shared/pmp/styles/big_story/pmpshared/201701/3558efcd-6ec6-4bc1-ac03-bc01c7703022.jpg"},{"url":"https://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/shared/pmp/201701/3558efcd-6ec6-4bc1-ac03-bc01c7703022.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

He remembers the stigma his parents faced while he was growing up. \n\n\"Now it's cool,\" he said. \"If I was a teenager now, I'd get a lot more dates than I did in the '80s.\" \n\nDuring his 20 years as a performer, Wann's parents have remained an inspiration for his comedy show, he said. \n\n\"I feel like I want to sign in case my parents ever came to a show,\" he said. \n\nWhile his wife has served as his speaking interpreter for his comedy shows, Wann said he also often has local people \u2014 such as Happy Hands adviser Liza Bancroft \u2014 interpret sign language into speech. \n\n\"He's so well-respected and well-known in the deaf community,\" Bancroft said. \"So it's a real unique opportunity.\" \n\nOpportunity awaits the students continuing their ASL education as well, Wann said. \n\n\"You are learning our language,\" Wann signed during his show. \"You have two choices: You can use that language to help deaf people ... or you can use it to hurt them.

He spends it reading and charming the people who filter in for chitchat or new soles. A crooked mishmash of framed pictures of Abraham Lincoln, Bill Clinton and our own Rep. Rick Larsen stare across the room at a wall festooned with shoelaces and polishes. \n\nThe tools of the trade stood at the ready behind the counter. \n\nPapadimitriou showed me around. He put a finger on a switch of an ancient contraption that trims, burnishes, polishes, sands and grinds. \n\n\"Stand back,\" he instructed. \n\nThe man and the machine came to life with a burst of noise and dust. It was like being at ground zero of a rocket launch. \n\nHigh heels. Holsters. Handbags. Belts. It's all done the old-fashioned way. \n\nNot all shoes rate his time and affection. \n\nIn the first 30 minutes I was at his shop, a man stepped in hoping to find redemption for his beloved work boots that were splitting at the seams. Papadimitriou said it would be cheaper for him to buy a new pair and sent him on his way. \n\nA woman called from Kenmore asking his hours. \"Monday through Friday, 10 to 5:30,\" he said, holding a phone tethered by a long coiled cord. \n\nShe wasn't sure she could make it by closing. He told her he would come to the store on a Saturday morning to meet her. \n\nHe's that kind of guy. \n\nThe next two times I went to his shop he turned away more work than he accepted, often expressing disapproval even before reading the label where the shoe was made. The massive import of cheap shoes gets his goat. \n\n\"No good. These are plastic. Nothing you can do about it,\" he told several customers. He has resurrected many pairs from near-death, but he knows when a shoe is DOA. \n\nSome owners refuse to give up. \n\nWhen he told Colleen Stillabower it would be $45 to replace the broken plastic zipper on one boot, she unflinchingly told him to do it. \n\n\"Forty-five dollars,\" he repeated. \n\n\"That would be fine,\" she said. \n\n\"Oh, boy,\" he said. \n\nShe asked him to replace the zippers on both boots. He said he'd give her a discount. \n\nIt was the Lake Stevens woman's first time to the shop. \"I found him on the internet,\" she said. \"I asked for the best shoemaker in Everett and his shop was the first one to pop up. Said he'd been here forever.\" \n\nPeople's has been in business in Everett since 1934. It was started by Papadimitriou's uncle, who sponsored his move here in 1967 from Greece, where he'd repaired and crafted shoes. \n\n\"I worked in 1967-68 in Seattle, before you were born,\" Papadimitriou told me, winking. Told you he was a flirt. \"At that time I made $2.45 an hour. I had a skill.\" \n\nHe bought People's from his uncle in 1968. He later moved the shop from Rockefeller Avenue to 2827 Wetmore Ave. \n\nPapadimitriou used to do more than mend rips and save soles. He also made orthopedic adjustments. \"If you have a pigeon toe, we put this wedge in here and make it straight,\" he said in his Greek-English syntax. \n\nHis wife, Dona, died in 2013. She didn't work in the shop with him. Not a good idea for husbands and wives to work together, he said. \n\nHis daughter, Nikki, and grandkids recently moved from Everett to North Carolina. Papadimitriou is all alone now in the town that has been his home for 50 years and the house where he's lived almost as long. \n\nLoneliness isn't what bothers him. These three words make him cringe: \"Made in China.\" \n\nSure enough, that's what it said inside my shoes, and a number of the dozens of pairs of shoes scattered, stacked and strewn about. \n\nDon't believe the sign that says \"Not responsible for shoes left more than 30 days.\" \n\nHe's had some for two years. Every pair of shoes gets a handwritten ticket. That's Exhibit A. \n\nHe took me on a tour of The Shoes Left Behind. \n\n\"What size do you wear?\" he asked, holding up a large pair of red leather kick-ass cowboy boots. \n\nI figured he could have sized up my feet in one glance, and I told him so. Really, can't he spot a size 6.5 from across the room? \n\nHe shrugged and went back to offering me more shoes that people didn't pick up. \n\nI changed the subject to purses. \"I bring out for you,\" he said, then disappeared in a back room only to appear with a bevy of handbags. \n\nWhy don't people pick up their things? \n\n\"Long stories,\" he said. \n\nHe donates many unwanted items to the thrift shop run by Domestic Violence Services of Snohomish County. \"I give it to them so they can sell and make money for women,\" he said. \n\nI admired the flashy leopard shoes with 6-inch platform heels that were on a shelf above the can of salmon that someone gave him for Christmas. \n\nThe average person has about 20 pairs of shoes. Papadimitriou owns six pairs, including the ones on his feet and a twin pair he keeps under his desk. That's it. \n\n\"I hear many women say, 'Oh, I love my shoes,'\" he said. \"I love people. I don't love shoes.\" \n\nWhat he cares about is making his work shine and fit like a glove. \n\n\"He stretched loafers for me that were too tight,\" said Gerry Provencher, who lives nearby and likes to stop by to shoot the breeze. \"He's an artist in his approach because he wants to take something that somebody cares about and is not of any use to them and bring it back to life. He takes the time and effort that an artist would take.\" \n\nPapadimitriou keeps things simple. Cash and checks only. \"I don't ask for ID,\" he said. He's had only three bad checks in almost 50 years. \n\n\"I have good customers,\" he said. \n\nHe has outlived many of them. \n\nIs the shop for sale? \n\nYep. Everything in it. Even him. \n\nIf you think you get to sit around all day and read and listen to music, think again. \n\nHe tells about the only person so far who expressed an interest. \n\n\"A man came from Whidbey Island and asked me to train him,\" he said. \"He said, 'How long did it take you to learn this business?'

Police were called to attend following reports of a man touching women on the number 12 bus in the Dulwich area. \n \nA 22-year woman was travelling home when the suspect deliberately sat next to her, despite there being many free seats on the bus. \n \nThe suspect asked her whether she was alright and engaged her in further small talk. As she got up to leave, he sexually assaulted her. \n \nThe woman then moved to a different part of the bus and witnessed the man approach another victim, a 17-year-old girl, who confronted him. The incidents were reported to the bus driver, and the man alighted in Barry Road, Dulwich. \n \nThree days later on Friday, January 27, a different 17-year-old girl boarded a 176 bus at around 15:15hrs. A short time later, the same suspect boarded the bus and sat opposite her. After trying to speak to her, he intentionally fell onto the victim and touched her inappropriately. \n \nLater on that day at around 17:00hrs, a 13-year-old girl reported that she was sexually assaulted whilst travelling on a 363 bus. A second 13-year-old also subsequently reported a man of the same description trying to engage her in conversation on the 197 bus near Dulwich Library, SE22, which made her feel uncomfortable. \n \nAt around 17:50hrs, a-15-year-old girl boarded a 171 bus at Catford Train station. The suspect, coming from another part of the bus, sat opposite from her and started to touch her knee. Feeling frightened, she got off the bus nearly Bromley Road, SE6. The man followed her and tried to engage her in conversation before groping her. The victim then ran off. \n \nPolice are treating these incidents as linked and want to public's help to trace the suspect. He is described as a black male, aged in his twenties, with short black hair and facial stubble. He was wearing a black bomber jacket with a white fur trim on the hood and blue baggy jeans. \n \nDC Alex Price from the Met's Road and Transport Policing Command said: \"We are keen to trace the suspect carrying out these despicable attacks on young girls and women in public. Five victims have been targeted by this man and we believe there could be many more victims who are yet to come forward.\" \n \nMembers of the public are advised not to approach the male if spotted but to call 999.

The goal for Starship Technologies robots is to carry about nine kilograms of goods within a radius of three kilometres for $1 or less | © AFP/File | Mandel Ngan    \nby Rob Lever \nWashington (AFP) | 29 January 2017 6:13 \n \nThe six-wheeled, knee-high robots from startup Starship Technologies are part of a new wave of automated systems taking aim at the \u201clast mile\u201d delivery of goods to consumers. \n \nStarship is launching a pilot project of robotic deliveries of parcels, groceries and prepared foods in early February in the US capital Washington, with a similar test taking place in Redwood City, California. \n \nThe startup, created by two of the founders of Skype, Ahti Heinla and Janus Friis, has already begun testing in several European cities as part of an effort to bring new efficiencies to local delivery. \n \nThe goal is to enable delivery within a radius of two miles (three kilometers) within 15-30 minutes of an order, for $1 or less, with the autonomous robots traveling on sidewalks and alerting consumers of their arrival via smartphone app. \n \nStarship spokesman Henry Harris-Burland said the founders were looking to \u201cdisrupt\u201d an industry which had seen little efficiency improvement from new technology. \n \n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to solve real social and economic problems,\u201d Harris-Burland said during a demonstration of the delivery bots in Washington. \n \n\u201cThis will take cars and vans off the road. We can also provide deliveries to the elderly and handicapped who have difficulty getting around.\u201d \n \nThe company, which has its business office in London, engineering in Estonia and some 90 employees, announced in January it had raised $17.2 million, led by Daimler AG with other investors as it moves to expand its testing and partnerships. \n \nWhile the Starship robots roll at a modest pace of around four miles (six kilometers) per hour, Harris-Burland said they offer a more efficient and economical delivery model than drones, which are being tested by online retail giant Amazon and others. \n   Starship Technology spokesman Henry Harris-Burland says the founders are looking to \u201cdisrupt\u201d an industry which has seen little efficiency improvement from new technology | © AFP/File | MANDEL NGAN   \nThe rolling robots are far less expensive to build and operate than drones and face fewer regulatory issues. \n \nHe said drones might be better-suited to remote and rural areas, while the Starship bots are designed for cities and suburbs, where they can roll along on sidewalks. \n \n\u201cWe don\u2019t see these as competing with drones, we see it as complementary,\u201d Harris-Burland said. \n \nThe Starship robots, which look like high-tech plastic picnic coolers, can carry about 20 pounds (nine kilograms) of goods, suited to three to four grocery bags. They do not offer heating or chilled compartments because rapid deliveries would not need them, according to Harris-Burland. \n \nThey will not have the capacity to leave items on doorsteps, he said, because \u201ccustomers will get delivery within 30 minutes, when they are home\u201d and collect the goods at the door. \n \n\u2013 Mapping sidewalks \u2013 \n \nStarship has agreements for testing with the delivery firm Postmates in Washington and DoorDash in California, as it works toward a commercial model with other partners and retailers. \n \nWhen the pilot begins in February, consumers will be able to order pizza, toothpaste, milk or eggs through the services which may use humans or robots. \n \nStarship is not the only robotic delivery startup looking to disrupt the sector. \n \nCalifornia-based startup Dispatch has raised $2 million in venture funding to begin testing of its rolling robots. Another California firm, Savioke, has agreed to provide delivery bots to hotels and apartment complexes. \n \nStarship says one of its strong points is its \u201cvisual localization\u201d technology that allows for real-time mapping using nine cameras on each robot to help navigate along sidewalks and circumvent obstacles, people and pets. \n \n\u201cWe can see every crosswalk, every traffic light, every pothole,\u201d Harris-Burland said. \n \n\u201cA lot of companies have mapped roads but no one has mapped sidewalks.\u201d \n \nThe navigation is done by artificial intelligence, and the bots are \u201c99 percent autonomous,\u201d according to the spokesman. \n \n\u201cWe want a human being able to oversee the robot\u2019s journey and to intervene whenever there is a problem,\u201d he said. \n \nHarris-Burland said the company\u2019s tests so far in Europe have shown the system works, with no problems related to theft or vandalism. \n \nThe lids of the devices are locked until the customer opens it with a smartphone. If anyone tries to steal it, an alarm will sound, and if it is hijacked the company can track it \u201cto the nearest inch,\u201d he said. \n \n© 2017 AFP \n   AUTHOR  AFP","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Robotics news","group":"Technology"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"New wave of robots set to deliver the goods","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Southern Africa","countryCode":"ZA","country":"South Africa"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Northglen News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"533460279","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4"},"name":"Northglen News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Business"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://northglennews.co.za"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194279685","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:14:19Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

He posted the sole Nazareth fall of the night and delivered in the clutch in a way that had Crowell smiling.\n\n\u201cA guy not known as a pinner went out and got a pin for the team,\u201d Crowell said. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to do something for yourself. To do it for your teammates in a big spot \u2013 that was awesome.\u201d\n\nKeifer was happy to help the team, but disappointed the Blue Eagles couldn\u2019t knock off the defending EPC, District 11 3A and PIAA 3A champions.\n\n\u201cWe are hoping to get another shot at them,\u201d Keifer said. \u201cWe have to fix up some mistakes and sharpen things up so we can win the close ones the next time.\u201d While nothing is certain, rematches in the D-11 and PIAA team tournaments are a very realistic possibility.\n\nOne thing Keifer has personally sharpened up is his conditioning, helped by some dawn-patrol activity.\n\n\u201cWe run every morning from 6:20 to 6:45 a.m.,\u201d Keifer said. \u201cIt has made a huge difference for me staying in shape and being able to go six minutes on the mat.\u201d\n\nOf course, if Zac Keifer starts becoming more of a pinner, he won\u2019t need to spend six minutes on thet mat all that often.\n\nBrad Wilson may be reached at bwilson@lehighvalleylive.com.

The caller does not give up. Pottstown police were contacted. This is just to let everyone be aware that the caller is very shrewd. The Prize Patrol is also going to be coming to my door which is a big scam. Publishers Clearing House never asks for any money. \n \nThe following is a quote from Mother Teresa, \u201cAbortion is profoundly anti-woman. Three quarters of its victims are women, half the babies and all the mothers.\u201d I don\u2019t recall seeing that sign at the women\u2019s rights march last week. \n \nThe approval ratings survey cited for Obama and Trump were in all probability taken by the same people who said Hillary was going to be the next POTUS. Questions to consider: who was surveyed, how many were surveyed, where do they live. If you slant the demographics in a particular direction you can get the results you want. \n \nI think they should nickname Trump \u201cOld Yeller.\u201d I never saw anybody with yellow hair like he\u2019s got. That\u2019s a new one, a president with yellow hair. \n \n \nI love all those Trump lovers out there. They were saying about Obama breaking the Constitution by signing all these bills without Congress or Senate approving them. What is Trump doing right now? Exactly the same thing. What a bunch of hypocritical people. \n \nJay Miller \n \nHillary wants Trump to stop tweeting. She should keep her big mouth shut; her, Obama, the whole Clinton team and the Democrats. This is the only way he can talk freely with the people without being misquoted and the newspapers are such liars. President Trump, do not give up your tweeting. You are keeping in touch with the people. The Democrats, these women and everybody protesting against you, they\u2019re jealous, they\u2019re mad. Grow up and stop badgering our new president. \n \nTrump is correct on NATO defense spending. Only five of its 28 members meet or exceed the 2 percent of GDP threshold \u2014 Estonia, Poland, Greece, the UK and us. Seven members spend 1 percent or less including our neighbor to the north. \n \nMark Furlong \n \nWomen are tired of being pushed around, hollered at and generally disrespected. They\u2019re standing up for themselves and that certainly does not make them sore losers. They\u2019ve had enough. \n \nWow, Hawaiian Punch Party is starting to sound exactly like Glenn Beck. Buy gold. Hide your money under the mattress , it is not worth the paper it is printed on. This is a great description of the economy under Obama. However, sit down and watch a successful billionaire run this country like a business. I know you\u2019re not used to it. Just sit tight and watch. \n \nOne Who Really Really Knows \n \nA friend who knows I don\u2019t follow sports bet me $100 I couldn\u2019t guess the Super Bowl score before it\u2019s played. It was the easiest $100 I ever made. The score is always 0-0 before it\u2019s played. \n \nJim Fitch \n \nHey Hawaiian Punch Party it\u2019s plain you\u2019re not an investor or you would have known that the dollar is only worth the paper it\u2019s written on and it\u2019s been like that for the last 20 or 30 years. It isn\u2019t just now that the money isn\u2019t worth anything. It\u2019s been like that for a long time and the Democrats were in charge. \n \nI have a postal incident that\u2019s been bothering me since Dec. 23. I received two orders in brown mailing envelopes that I ordered for gifts. When they arrived both envelopes were cut open. Much to my surprise the merchandise and paperwork were in there but how and when did this happen? The merchandise was shipped from South Carolina and couldn\u2019t have happened there. With all the handling the contents in the envelope would not have made it. \n \nN \n \nHow is that swamp draining working out? It looks like it\u2019s getting deeper and dirtier than ever. You won\u2019t be getting any information on what\u2019s going on. So far the Interior Department and the EPA have been put on media blackout. Probably more will be blacked out. It doesn\u2019t matter though because what you hear isn\u2019t true; we\u2019re getting alternative facts. Trump doesn\u2019t want to hear anything negative about himself. His ego will be his downfall. Just give him time to self-destruct. \n \nThis is to the banana environmentalists. Spilled absolutely nothing anywhere near anyone. Looks like the Keystone pipelines want to go through. Drill baby drill. \n \nThe number somebody gave for reporting Welfare fraud it turns out to be for LifeLock and not Welfare fraud.

Marilyn van Dijk, a veterinary assistant, kept treats in Meyer's hands or in front of the dog at all times. \n\nHe'd forget that he had a bum leg, put his paw down and reach around for the treat. \n\nMeyer, keeping hold on Tigger via a harness, cooed in the dog's ear: \"I've got you. I've got you.\" \n\nAnd then Tigger relaxed. He'd move his front paws forward as if on automatic pilot. Walk, walk, walk. \n\nMeyer moved up the speed on the treadmill, and Tigger walked, walked, walked some more, as if he's been doing it his entire young life. \n\nExcept he hasn't. \n\nTigger has never walked or run on four legs like most canines. \n\nHe has jumped like a kangaroo on his hind two legs or inched forward on his belly. But he has never kept up with his foster parents' other dogs because his front two legs were congenitally deformed by a defect called ectrodactyly, or split hand or lobster claw. \n\nThese days, Meyer has him on the underwater treadmill and doing planks on a large plastic peanut to help develop callouses on the limb and strengthen his core to protect his other limbs. He hopes to introduce the dog to cavalletti exercises (small jumps) soon to help him further strengthen his muscles and improve his balance. \n\n\"He's been compensating his whole life, so we take this slow,\" Meyer said. \n\nTigger weighs slightly more than his optimal weight of 55 pounds, said his surgeon, Dr. Jennifer Warnock. The physical therapy sessions may help with that. \n\nDr. Warnock hopes to perform the second repair surgery on Tigger's other front leg at the end of March. But Good and her partner, Troy Riggs, have some fundraising to do first. When the Statesman Journal first broke Tigger's story last summer and it spread across the country through the USA Today Network and The Huffington Post, more than $17,000 was raised in a few weeks. \n\nMore than $10,000 was spent on Tigger's first surgery, ICU stay, bandaging needs, and his medication. At least $2,000 or $3,000 still needs to be raised to pay for this next round of surgery, which will repair the second front limb and fuse one portion of the other newly fashioned leg. Dr. Warnock expects Tigger's condition to regress a bit as he recovers from the second surgery, but she's cautiously optimistic the dog could be walking on both front legs by summer. \n\nTigger may or may not need prosthetics. His X-rays currently show bone fusion, which is excellent, Warnock said. If his therapy continues to help him develop callouses where he never had them before, she believes the prognosis to be very good. \n\n\"We want to get him functioning without pain,\" Warnock said. \"I want him jumping on the couch, something most dogs take for granted. But Tigger does not.\" \n\nNow about those treats ...","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"CAROL MCALICE CURRIEStatesman Journal"},"topics":[],"title":"Tigger starts water therapy as leg improves","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Manatee","zipCode":"34205","state":"Florida","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Bradenton","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Bradenton Herald","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657775","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"626"},"name":"Bradenton Herald","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Health","Lifestyle","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bradenton.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://stjr.nl/2iLOWc1"],"sequenceId":"695194309025","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:06:04Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:14:33Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Even an offer which might remind everyone of what happened with former contestant Kishwar Merchant in the last season. Remember how Kishwar quit the show during its Ticket to Finale taking Rs 15 lakhs? Something similar has happened this time too, but with a difference. So while Kishwar was forced to quit, Bigg Boss 10's most favourite aam aadmi, Manu Punjabi has left the show taking home Rs 10 lakhs. \n \nAccording to a report in Bollywood Life, like every year, Bigg Boss offered all the four finalists - Manveer Gurjar, Manu Punjabi, Bani Judge and Lopamudra Raut, a sum of Rs 10 lakhs. This meant if anyone of them chose the money, they'll have to leave the show right away. And to the surprise of everyone, it was Manu who came forward and put his hands of the amount. Yes, according to inside sources, Manu has bargained the tenth season of Bigg Boss for Rs 10 lakhs. \n \n © Provided by Screen Manu has always been one of the strongest contestants on the show from the very start. He was the one who kept the commoners hooked together, and gave a tough fight to the celebs. He was instrumental in the \"M3\" bond between Manveer, Mona Lisa and himself. While he was the toughest competitor in any task, he even won hearts due to his charming personality and the way he fought his personal loss during the show. \n         \nReplay Video \n      \nFlight 666 Lands in HEL On Friday The 13th \n \nFinnair Flight AY 666 was enroute to HEL on Friday the 13th and landed on schedule without any problems!

We are reminded of the task where he had to ask for public votes against best friend Manveer. And we saw how Manveer won the task and the eventual Ticket to Finale, with a huge margin. That surely gave a jolt to Manu and showed him the clear picture that Manveer has much more following that him. Also, considering Bani has remained the most popular contestant on the show, and Lopamudra has a good following too, maybe he thought this was the right step to take, as chances of him winning the season looked bleak. Nevertheless, his decision might leave his fans disappointed, he isn't going home empty-handed. He has the big amount, the love of his followers, and face that has become quite know today. It's definitely a win-win situation for Manu. Let the other three fight it out in the grand finale. \n \nRecommended: Everything you need to know about Bigg Boss 1","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"},{"name":"Entertainment: television news","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"This 'Bigg Boss 10' finalist quit the show for Rs 10 lakhs","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"MSN News US","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"530694805","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"MSN News US","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Television","Arts","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.news.msn.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.lehren.com/"],"sequenceId":"695194313579","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:14:31Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

I was working as administrative assistant for the dean of the School of Education at the University of Houston at Clear Lake City. \n \nBesides balancing the school's $12 million budget, my job responsibilities included maintaining personnel files for the adjunct professors and collecting the class syllabus from each of them each semester. In doing so I came to know them quite well. June Scobee was one such professor. But, I also knew June and her husband as my neighbors. Both friendly and personable, they always greeted me with a smile. My son, Tim, and I were shopping at one of the local malls when we encountered June and Dick. When she introduced Tim to Dick, and Tim was immediately awestruck. He had just met Richard Francis Scobee, the astronaut. Dick was somewhat shy and unassuming, but he was quick to answer all of Tim's questions and explain some of the workings of NASA to him. He later brought us back a patch from one of his space flights. \n \nIt wasn't unusual to run into astronauts, as they all lived in our area. We shopped at the same grocery stores. Their children went to the same schools as our children, played little league together and participated in church activities together. By 1986, space flights had become routine. Those of us living in the space community no longer held parties to watch the launchings on TV. We just more or less took it for granted that the space program was a common occurrence. \n \nJan. 28, 1986, began as routinely as any other day in South Texas. Everyone went about their business and didn't give a second thought to the launch scheduled that day. \n  \n  \nI had been invited by one of the professors to fly to Florida for the launching that day. A group usually flew on a cargo plane out of Ellington Air Force Base, and there was room for a few more to board before leaving, but I had to decline the offer. I was in my office when the call came in around 11 a.m. CST. One of my neighbors told me the Challenger had just fallen into the ocean and I needed to get home right away. As I drove home I thought surely everyone was all right. After all, it fell into the ocean, so certainly they would be rescued. \n \nAt 11:38 a.m. EST on that January day the Challenger had lifted off with Dick Scobee as its commander. Then, 11 miles high and 9 miles downrange, just 73 seconds into the flight a fireball lit up the sky as the Challenger disintegrated over the ocean. That day I lost a good neighbor and friend and the country lost a great citizen. After one of the many memorial services, June gave me an autographed picture of Dick and the flight crew from a previous launch. \n \nI had it placed in a frame, along with the flight patch and hung it in my office. One year to the day of the tragedy the picture fell off the wall and crashed to the floor damaging the frame. \n \nThis year, I met with the principal of Frederick High School and presented the photo and patch still in the damaged frame along with other mementos of that tragic day to add to their collection at the school. I think maybe Dick would want it that way. \n \nEmail Betty Heath at begeheath690@aol.com","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Betty Heath: Memories of the Challenger","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Boulder","zipCode":"80501","state":"Colorado","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Longmont","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Longmont Daily Times-Call","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169688214","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"421"},"name":"Longmont Daily Times-Call","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.timescall.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194314843","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:14:31Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

These may not also necessarily follow the requirements observed under the PRDP. \n \nAgriculture secretary Manny Piñol expressed his appreciation of the Bank\u2019s continued interest, saying that even during the implementation of Mindanao Rural Development Program\u2014which eventually evolved into what the PRDP is now\u2014the engagements with the Bank have shown good potentials. \n \nAsked for his initial ideas, Piñol cited Sulu as a particular province in Mindanao the current administration feels in need of immediate response because of security-related issues. \n \nThe World Bank is planning to conduct field scoping missions in the last week of January, with various teams looking into possible engagement areas like trade, connectivity, human development, road network and logistics, and agricultural productivity. \n \nTags: 2021 , agricultural projects , Department of Agriculture , Manila Bulletin , Manny Piñol , Mindanao , , Philippine Rural Development Project , PRDP , World Bank \n  Related Posts","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Noreen Jazul"},"topics":[{"name":"Agriculture news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Economics news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Philippines news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Mindanao eyed for World Bank\u2019s additional agricultural projects","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"South-Eastern Asia","countryCode":"PH","country":"Philippines"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Manila Bulletin","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659313","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"48"},"name":"Manila Bulletin","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.mb.com.ph"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194315242","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T15:04:42Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:14:35Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

And Small Business Saturday was a busy day, said David Borlaug, president of the Lewis and Clark Fort Mandan Foundation, which runs the gallery. \n\n\"In spite of the bad weather, in terms of original art, sales have been great,\" he said. \"It validates Bismarck was ready for this kind of gallery.\" \n\nBorlaug said Bismarck has been \"blessed\" with a multitude of galleries, each with a different niche. Bismarck Downtown Artist Cooperative, Bismarck Art & Galleries Association and Gallery 522 all feature member artists' works. There's also Art Gallerie on Main, where Lydia Richez-Bowman features her own work and that of several other local artists, as well as teaching classes. \n\nBorlaug said Capital Gallery is focused on featuring two artists on its walls \u2014 one expressive and one traditional \u2014 along with several others who work in various other media, such as glass or bronze. The gallery sets itself apart by limiting the number of artists and featuring them for longer periods. And because it does not cater to member artists, \"the world's our oyster,\" he said. \n\nBorlaug has artists lined up for the foreseeable future, with Deane Collin Fay of Gackle alongside Bismarck native Vern Erickson's western Americana pieces coming up in Februarym The Bismarck Tribune (http://bit.ly/2joTPY3 ) reports. \n\n\"There is a thriving art culture in Bismarck,\" Borlaug said. \"We're just glad to be part of it.\" \n\nHe points to Jessica Wachter as an up-and-coming Bismarck artist who has a \"real following across the country,\" with works featured in galleries in Los Angeles and Scottsdale, Ariz. \n\nStephanie Delmore of Gallery 522 agrees. \n\n\"I think we're just getting to that point of there being enough galleries\" that they could partner on events, like gallery hops, she said. \"We can start to thread ourselves together.\" \n\nAs Bismarck's population has become more diverse, Delmore said there are more people who are used to going to galleries on a regular basis. \n\n\"I think the traffic is picking up,\" she said, with the public understanding what art adds to a community. \n\nSince starting 32 years ago, Gallery 522 has wanted all local artists to be able to show their work daily rather than wait five years for their turn at a larger show. \n\n\"We've always meant to be of service to artists,\" Delmore said, and on a day-to-day basis, the gallery has a multitude of artists covering its walls. \n\nBismarck Downtown Artist Cooperative works much the same way, though with slightly different rules and organization, while BAGA has become more well-known for hosting larger shows for its member artists, Delmore said. \n\n\"I think we've got a lovely base of artists in the area,\" she said, and having more galleries showcasing those artists could result in more art-focused events come spring. \n\nBorlaug said he thinks Bismarck is where Fargo was a couple decades ago in terms of growing from a big town to a small city \u2014 and art \"makes cities.\" \n\n\"I feel Bismarck is more than ready to grow its arts community,\" he said. \n\nIn turn, that community could help grow the city, attracting more residents. Borlaug said one of the first things people want to know about before moving somewhere is the arts scene: Is there a symphony? An orchestra? Visual arts? \n\n\"It could help get people to move here,\" he said, and the art produced here is helping tell this area's story. \n\n--- \n\nInformation from: Bismarck Tribune, http://www.bismarcktribune.com \n\nAP Member Exchange shared by The Bismarck Tribune.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"JESSICA HOLDMANThe Bismarck Tribune"},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: celebrity gossip","group":"Entertainment"},{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"},{"name":"Entertainment: fine arts news","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"Number of art galleries increases for Bismarck","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Thurston","zipCode":"98501","state":"Washington","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Olympia","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Bellingham Herald","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169658696","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1606"},"name":"Bellingham Herald","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Gossip","Lifestyle","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bellinghamherald.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://bit.ly/2joTPY3","http://www.bismarcktribune.com/"],"sequenceId":"695194317594","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:14:32Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It was my fault and I want to apologise to the travelling fans,\" said Frampton, 29. \n\n\"I hope we can do it again - we need to do it again.\" \n\nThousands of fans had travelled from Northern Ireland to help create a feverish atmosphere at the MGM Grand Garden Arena. \n\nThey saw Santa Cruz, a three-division champion, get off to a fine start, making better use of his height and reach advantage than he had when he lost to Frampton in July. \n Santa Cruz won on a majority verdict after a gruelling contest \nFrampton, who had won all 23 of his previous fights as a professional, warmed to his task more after a slow start. \n\nBut he found Santa Cruz, relentless with a productive jab, in determined mood to avenge that points defeat in Brooklyn. \n\nFrampton won some rounds back and finished strongly in the 12th, but Santa Cruz held firm to take the belt. \n\n\"My feet were a bit slow. I needed to let my hands go a bit more when I got close,\" added Belfast man Frampton. \n\n\"We had a fantastic training camp, I felt completely prepared. I feel like I've let the people down.\" \n\nFrampton said he would like Santa Cruz to come to Belfast for the third meeting between the pair. \n Frampton, from north Belfast, suffered the first defeat of his professional career \nAnd Santa Cruz said both he and Frampton 'deserved' a third fight. \n\nHe said: \"He is a great fighter and a great counter-puncher. \n\n\"It was tough to change my style. In my head I wanted to go for it, but I was told to box him and that's what I did. \n\n\"I am a man of my word. Let's go again.\" \nReaction - 'Carl has the ability to beat him again' \nBarry McGuigan, Frampton's manager, on Sky Sports \n\nThese two young men are fantastic for boxing - they represent everything that is good about the sport. Carl emptied his tank, but didn't fight technically as well as he could. It was a magnificent fight. I thought Leo deserved to win it. \n\nI hope they will go back to Belfast, repaying these travelling fans for spending their hard-earned money. We owe it to them to bring it back to Belfast. \n\nShane McGuigan, Frampton's trainer, on Sky Sports \n\nNo excuses, it was a nip-and-tuck fight. I think we will get Santa Cruz again, and I know Carl has the ability to beat him again. \n\nWe weren't really expecting to box on the back foot, but we were a bit sluggish. He was a bit tired down the stretch but it is one of those things. \nAnalysis - 'A non-stop, toe-to-toe, all-Mexican fight' \nFormer unified light-welterweight world champion Amir Khan \n\nI think it'll probably happen again. Both fighters fought a great fight, it was non-stop, toe-to-toe - an all-Mexican fight. \n\nIt was always going to be close because they have styles that suit each other. They've both got great boxing skills. One's a fighter, one's a boxer but then they have to change their skillset and gameplan a bit which makes it tough. \n\nSanta Cruz was not the pressure fighter. He was the one who was moving back.

He doesn\u2019t represent the aristocracy.\u201d \n \nAnd he had fun along the way, inviting all of us to join him. Chrome has his own Facebook page. So do his fans. He also has a Twitter account. He has been sponsored by, among others, Breathe Right and Skechers. \n \n \nThis horse is so popular that it\u2019s almost as if people could line up for a turn to ride him, not unlike kids running the bases after an Angels game. \n \nAt this track, a ritual developed over the past three years that saw fans congregating in the early morning chill and darkness just for the chance to watch Chrome go through the most basic of workouts. \n \n\u201cThe world is holding onto Chrome,\u201d said Dr. Don Moore, a San Clemente chiropractor who works on the horse. \u201cHe is that Seabiscuit, that Secretariat. Everybody\u2019s just grabbing on. The country is circling around him.\u201d \n \nChrome made a celebrity out of Art Sherman, the now 79-year-old trainer who previously was a journeyman in this game. \n \nSherman, in fact, had to work part-time as a mutuel clerk during some of his barn\u2019s more desperate times. \n \nNow, everyone knows the trainer and the stories, like the one of how Sherman would rise most mornings at 4:45, drive to his barn here, walk over to Chrome\u2019s stall and feed him a cookie. \n \nOn Sherman\u2019s cell phone, he has pictures of his star doing everything from racing to lounging. He also has photos of Chrome awesomely rearing on his hind legs during otherwise simple trips to the track for training. \n \n\u201cHe can get wound up,\u201d Sherman explained recently. \u201cWhen he does, he\u2019s a lot of horse. That\u2019s just him feeling good out there. He\u2019s a stallion. He has other things on his mind sometimes.\u201d \n \nRacing, however, apparently never fades too far away for Chrome. Sherman\u2019s son and assistant, Alan, has the \u201cCall to Post\u201d bugle blast on his phone. Every time it\u2019s played, Chrome genuinely comes to attention. \n \nBut it\u2019s on to his second career now, Chrome scheduled to ship from Florida to the breeding shed at Taylor Made Farm in Kentucky. \n \nThe breeders last week posted photos on Twitter of the brass plate that will mark Chrome\u2019s new home. \n \nMeanwhile, his double-wide stall at Los Alamitos is now being occupied by Grade I winner Dortmund, who lost three times to Chrome in 2016 and a month ago was transferred to Sherman\u2019s barn. \n \n\u201cChrome has a big second career coming up,\u201d Sherman said. \u201cHe\u2019ll have a lot of good mares to mess around with. I just hope I\u2019m around to train some of his babies.\u201d \n \nImmediately after the race Saturday, not much was said among our group at Los Al. Most of the people walked away in silence. One fan, wearing a T-shirt that read, \u201cThis Guy Needs a Beer,\u201d just kept shaking his head. \n \nThe TV was positioned so that watching it meant facing out onto the track. Right there, maybe 100 yards away, was the finish line that California Chrome crossed first in December at the Winter Challenge. \n \nIt would be the final victory for this greatest of racehorses.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Jeff Miller jmiller@scng.com"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"California Chrome's career has disappointing ending, but oh what a career","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Los Angeles","zipCode":"90601","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Whittier","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Whittier Daily News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169692538","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3"},"name":"Whittier Daily News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.whittierdailynews.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194321905","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T08:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:14:33Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://image.whittierdailynews.com/storyimage/LE/20170128/SPORTS/170129433/AR/0/AR-170129433.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

But never had she had a weekend quite like the last one. \n \nKaren Chen, a 17-year-old, 4-foot-11 sprite from Fremont who trains under Gambill at Riverside Icetown, stunned the figure skating community by swiping the Ladies Senior gold at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships in Kansas City. \n \nThe next night, Vincent Zhou, a 16-year-old from Palo Alto via Icetown who won the national junior title three years ago as a 13-year-old, finished second in the Men\u2019s Senior competition to Nathan Chen, no relation to Karen. \n \nOne more level crossed off. It may have been just a matter of time. \n \n\u201cIt is a building process,\u201d said Gambill. \u201cI guess that just means we\u2019re on the right track. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s fun because now I\u2019ve had every national champion: Juvenile boy and girl, intermediate boy and girl, novice boy and girl, junior boy and girl, and now senior girl. Karen is my first senior champion, so that makes it special, that elusive senior title. And Vincent was very close.\u201d \n \nWhich would make her, um, an overnight success? \n \n\u201cExactly,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cI\u2019m an up-and-coming coach.\u201d \n \nGambill, a Redlands resident who declined to state her age but acknowledged her skaters now give her anniversary cards on her birthday \u2014 anniversaries of turning 39, get it? \u2014 grew up in the Sacramento area and was a good enough skater at 14 to leave home to train, much as her pupils now do. \n \nShe began coaching in Stockton 30 years ago. \n \n\u201cThe Oak Park Ice Arena,\u201d she recalled. \u201cThen I moved down to Southern California, and had two kids and started coaching down here. My son (Matt) is now 27, so it was 27 years ago that I started down here.\u201d \n \nHer first teaching gig in Southern California was in Palm Desert, at a long, skinny rink in the middle of the Town Center Mall \u2014 \u201ccalled a hot dog rink,\u201d she recalled. Her pupils there included Yorba Linda\u2019s Sandy Rucker and Indio\u2019s Dennis Phan; both went on to win age group national championships, Phan in 2003 and Rucker in 2005. \n \nShe later began commuting from Redlands to Anaheim three times a week to teach on a bigger ice surface, and also used the Ice Castle international training center in Lake Arrowhead when it was still open. \n \n \nAnd then Icetown opened, in 1997, an easier commute with no need to navigate mountain roads. \u201cPerfect,\u201d she said. \n \nThe accolades have accumulated over the years. Gambill was named the USOC Developmental Coach of the Year in 2005 \u2014 an honor that encompasses all sports \u2014 and has been similarly honored by U.S. Figure Skating and the Professional Skaters Association in 2005, 2012 and 2013. \n \nBut it\u2019s about her pupils, as it should be. She has coached world or national medalists Richard Dornbush, Shotaro Omori, Tyler Pierce and Caroline Zhang. \n \nFour of her skaters will be competing at either the world championships or world junior championships this year. Chen and Brendan Kerry of Australia will compete in the 2017 World Championships March 29-April 2 in Helsinki, Finland (and both will also compete in the Four Continents competition Feb. 15 in Gangneung, Korea, the site of next year\u2019s Olympic competition). \n \nMeanwhile, Zhou and Yarrick Paniot of the Ukraine will compete in the World Junior Championships beginning March 15 in Tapiei City, Taiwan. Zhou will also be the first alternate for the U.S. at the Worlds should there be an injury. \n \n\u201cI like it when they come in young and I can build them back up again,\u201d Gambill said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s fun to get some of the older ones. Yaro (Paniot) just came in a couple of weeks ago. He\u2019s super talented, so I\u2019m very excited to see what I can do with him as well.\u201d \n \nShe has around 20 skaters total, and her preference is to have everyone on the ice together. She barks orders \u2014 her own description \u2014 and, along with assistant coach Ryan Berning, gives technical guidance. She doesn\u2019t discourage the idea among her skaters that she has eyes in the back of her head, a fiction that works as long as she can see their reflections in the Plexiglas. \n \nAnd she listens as well as instructs. \n \n\u201cI\u2019ve been with her for three years now, and I feel like I really do love her as a coach,\u201d Chen said. \u201cShe can be strict, but she\u2019s definitely very understanding as well. She listens to my opinion. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s always been something I struggled with in my interaction with my coach, but I feel like I\u2019m getting better. Sometimes if I\u2019m having a bad day or my knee\u2019s bothering me or something, it\u2019s hard for me to speak up and tell her, because I feel like I want to give my 100 percent in training and I don\u2019t want to let this affect anything ... (but) she\u2019s let me know this: It\u2019s important that if I\u2019m not feeling 100 percent today I need to let her know, so she can make adjustments to my training and it\u2019ll be beneficial for us both.\u201d \n \nChen is one of many skaters who have relocated from elsewhere specifically to train under Gambill. Her mother, Hsiu-Hui Tseng, is with her and her younger brother Jeffrey, an ice dancer, in Southern California during the week while her husband, Chih-Hsiu Chen, has stayed in the Bay Area. \n \n\u201cI like the way she teaches kids,\u201d Tseng said. \u201cSometimes you need to be strict. (But) she\u2019s a coach you can communicate with.

President Donald Trump discussed Syria and the fight against Islamic State with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Saturday (28/01) in one of several calls with world leaders that the new United States president used to put his stamp on international affairs. \n\nTrump's call with Putin was their first since the New York businessman took office and came as officials said he was considering lifting sanctions on Moscow despite opposition from Democrats and Republicans at home and European allies abroad. \n\nNeither the White House nor the Kremlin mentioned a discussion of sanctions in their statements about the roughly hour-long call. \n\n\"The positive call was a significant start to improving the relationship between the United States and Russia that is in need of repair,\" the White House said. \"Both President Trump and President Putin are hopeful that after today's call the two sides can move quickly to tackle terrorism and other important issues of mutual concern.\" \n\nFormer President Barack Obama strongly suggested in December that Putin personally authorized the computer hacks of Democratic Party emails that US intelligence officials say were part of a Russian effort aimed at helping Trump beat Democrat Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 election. \n\nTrump's relationship with Russia is being closely watched by the European Union, which teamed up with the United States to punish Moscow after its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. \n\nTrump spoke to two top EU leaders, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande, on Saturday in addition to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. \n\nHis call with Merkel, who had a very close relationship with Trump's predecessor, former President Barack Obama, included a discussion about Russia, the Ukraine crisis, and NATO, the US and German governments said. \n\nTrump has described NATO as being obsolete, a comment that has alarmed long-time US allies. A White House statement said he and Merkel agreed NATO must be capable of confronting \"21rst century threats.\" \n\nTrump's executive order restricting travel and instituting \"extreme vetting\" of visitors from seven Muslim-majority countries already puts him at odds with Merkel, whose embrace of Syrian refugees was praised by Obama even as it created political problems for her domestically. \n\nTrump has said previously that Merkel made a \"catastrophic mistake\" by permitting more than a million refugees, mostly Muslims fleeing war in the Middle East, to come to her country. \n\nIn his call with Hollande, Trump \"reaffirmed the US commitment to NATO and noted the importance of all NATO allies sharing the burden on defense spending,\" the White House said. \n\nHollande warned Trump against taking a protectionist approach, which he said would have economic and political consequences, according to a statement from the French president's office. \n\nThe refugee order created confusion and chaotic scenes in airports on Saturday and largely overshadowed the news of Trump's calls with foreign leaders, which took place throughout the day and which photographers captured in photos and video outside the Oval Office. \n\nDuring his call with Japan's Abe, Trump affirmed an \"ironclad\" US commitment to ensuring Japan's security. The two leaders also discussed the threat posed by North Korea. They plan to meet in Washington early next month. \n\nTrump spoke to Australia's Turnbull for 25 minutes and emphasized the close relationship between the two countries. \n\nReuters","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Russia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Japan news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Trump Talks to Putin, Other World Leaders About Security Threats","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"South-Eastern Asia","countryCode":"ID","country":"Indonesia"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Jakarta Globe","feed":{"genre":"Blog","tags":[],"id":"169658055","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3"},"name":"Jakarta Globe","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://thejakartaglobe.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://jakartaglobe.id/world/trump-talks-putin-world-leaders-security-threats/#show-hide","http://jakartaglobe.id/tag/islamic-state","http://jakartaglobe.id/tag/security-threat","http://jakartaglobe.id/tag/russian-president-vladimir-putin","http://jakartaglobe.id/tag/us-president-donald-trump","http://jakartaglobe.id/international/duterte-pleads-philippine-rebels-rebuff-islamic-state-advances/","http://jakartaglobe.id/news/100-indonesians-deported-turkey-trying-join-syria/"],"sequenceId":"695194338835","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T00:00:09Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:14:38Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://img.thejakartaglobe.com/2017/01/2017-01-03T140605Z_1_MTZGRQED137J6E73_RTRFIPP_0_CHINA-TAIWAN-USA.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

It marks 40 years of deadlines, 36 in national syndication. That\u2019s more than 5,000 columns and more than 3.5 million words. It\u2019s the equivalent of 44 books, or six tomes the size of War and Peace . \n \nIt has been a wonderful run, and I couldn\u2019t have done it without you. \n \nThat was a literal statement, not a sentimental one. It was your gift of trust, your letting me be your itinerant learner and observer that made the last 40 years possible. \n \nI\u2019ve received many reader letters about the column. Some tell how you\u2019ve achieved a secure retirement by following this column. One letter spoke for two generations, of columns passed from father to son. It doesn\u2019t get any better than that. \n \nOther letters urge me to keep on writing. \n \nBut 40 years is a long time. I\u2019ve begun to develop a 700-word mind, an ability to deal with anything as long as it is not shorter than, or longer than, the traditional length of a newspaper column. \n \nI\u2019m also acutely aware that every hour spent doing one thing I love, writing, is an hour that I\u2019ve lost to do other things I love. And, at 76, I may not be able to do them if I wait too long. \n \nMy wife and I were in Puerto Vallarta earlier this month; in February we\u2019ll be at the annual meeting of the Philosophical Society of Texas; in March I\u2019ll be sailing with my brothers. And I\u2019ll be driving my personal \u201cretirement vehicle\u201d \u2014 a recently purchased 2004 Porsche Boxster. \n \nI\u2019ll be sharing it, and working on it, with my son Ollie, maybe doing a few things to make it faster on the draw. And I\u2019ll continue the more difficult project of personal restoration by walking still more. \n \nWill I come back to writing? I think so. But for now, I\u2019m looking forward to living life without deadlines. One obvious project is a portfolio cookbook for Couch Potato investors. \n \nAnother is an exploration of what I call \u201cthe menu of life and death\u201d about choices we make, individually and nationally, about life itself \u2014 and how long it lasts. \n \nAnd I\u2019m not abandoning you. I\u2019ve asked my friend Laurence J. Kotlikoff to pick up the challenge. Many readers will recognize his name. \n \nHe\u2019s been ranked as one of the top 25 economists in the world. He understands Social Security and Medicare better than anyone. I\u2019ve co-authored three books with him, but make no mistake about it, I\u2019m Boswell, he\u2019s Dr. Johnson. I\u2019ve learned a lot from Larry. You will, too. \n \nOne of the wonderful things about writing a newspaper column is that you are exposed to a cornucopia of human ability and talent. I wish I could name all the people I\u2019ve written about and drawn from in the last 40 years, but it would take volumes, not 700 words. \n \nI have others to thank as well: editors. I\u2019ve been blessed with editors who focused on what the two of us could do to deliver a better read. We\u2019ve re-paragraphed, expunged word echoes, made shorter sentences and excised obscure references. \n \nThey have hidden my crippling failure to master the possessive. And they have scattered hyphens where they were needed when this scribbler remained oblivious. \n \nI owe a particular debt to Miss Ozgood, my 11th-grade English teacher. I wanted to be an engineer and an astronaut, but she started the fire. She asked her students to write sentences instead of diagraming them, and I did. \n \nI have a parting gift for you, almost ready. It has nothing to do with investments. It has everything to do with living in the world. \n \nI\u2019ve called it \u201cStill at Large,\u201d a collection of columns I wrote by leaving my computer, office and comfort zone. They\u2019re the columns I wrote while riding a motorcycle along the Texas/Mexico border, sailing in Belize and visiting other spots around the world, but mostly in our great country. \n \nSend me an email with \u201cStill at Large\u201d in the subject line, and I\u2019ll send you the PDF file as soon as it is done. \n \nFinally, you can always reach me at sburnscolumn@yahoo.com.

One reason is that tax laws change often, said Rosamaria Bravo, a certified public accountant with the firm MBAF in Miami. \n \nOne of this year\u2019s big differences: Partnership returns must be filed by March 15, a month earlier than in the past. And companies known as C corporations have a filing deadline of mid-April, after having a March due date in past years. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to stay on top of all the information,\u201d Bravo said. \u201cThe average business owner is more worried about their day-to-day operations.\u201d \n \nHere\u2019s a look at some lessons small business owners learned: \n Use software wisely  \nWhen Christina Divigard started an advertising agency, she bought accounting software and began keeping the company\u2019s books herself. When tax season arrived, she discovered that out of inexperience, she\u2019d incorrectly entered some information and misclassified some types of deductions. It took two weeks to get her books in order. \n \n\u201cIf I had to do it all over again, I would have put more effort and budget behind setting up systems properly from the get-go,\u201d said Divigard, managing director of New York-based Valvespring. \n \nDivigard subsequently hired a bookkeeper to help set up accounts and understand how to input income and expenses. She also learned more about the need to put expenses into different accounting categories \u2014 for example, meals during a business trip are different from meals to entertain customers under the tax law. \n \nHaving a system that is correctly set up has reduced the chance of errors, and even if Divigard has to do repair work, \u201cnow it takes me a day rather than two weeks.\u201d \n Keep up with the changes  \nComplying with tax law revisions can be hard even with a bookkeeper and accountant, Barbara Karpf has learned. As of this year, businesses must file W-2 forms and 1099 forms with the IRS by Jan. 31. \n \nWhile companies were previously required to give those forms to workers by the end of January, they didn\u2019t have to get them to the government until the end of February. The government can charge a penalty if it gets the forms late. \n \nThat created extra pressure for Karpf. Her home decor company, DecoratorsBest, moved offices in New York right after Black Friday and Cyber Monday, two of its busiest sales days. After she hired movers and a painter for the new space, she realized she needed to get information like Social Security numbers and addresses from eight people. \n \nWell into January she was still getting all the information together so 1099 forms for freelancers and other contract workers could get to the government, as well as the workers, on time. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s more work in a shorter period of time,\u201d Karpf said. \n Keep track of expenses  \nWhen an owner is running a business day by day and also trying to do long-term strategic planning, details like tax-deductible expenses can get lost in the shuffle, creating a headache later. \n \nDeborah Sweeney has learned to look at her books monthly to be sure expenses like charitable donations and the costs of employee meetings are entered properly. \n \n\u201cThat way, we don\u2019t have to scramble at the end of the year,\u201d said Sweeney, owner of MyCorporation.com, a Calabasas, California-based company that helps businesses incorporate online. \n \nSweeney recalls errors of past years, such as not taking a deduction for a service contract on a printer. She has also learned to take her questions to her accountant to be sure she\u2019s not missing some of the finer points of rules about deductions. \n \nFor example: \u201cHow do we categorize new furniture \u2014 do we write it off or depreciate it? What amount of an owner\u2019s health care costs is deductible?\u201d \n Find the best help  \nDiane Hamilton, though, has struggled to find an accountant who\u2019s a good fit for her company, which makes computer and phone apps. \n \nShe has worked with large accounting firms in the Richmond, Virginia, area where her Binary Formations business is located. But the bills climbed as she called with questions. \n \n\u201cYou look at how much they charge and the amount of revenue you bring in, and it isn\u2019t working,\u201d she said. \n \nWhen Hamilton switched to a much smaller accounting firm, she found herself doing as much work as when she tried to handle her taxes herself. \n \nShe\u2019s still hoping to find the right tax professional for her company. \n \nTry to hold costs down \n \nBrad Chandler estimates it costs his real estate company $70,000 a year to compile returns for the federal government and for Maryland, Virginia, and Washington, D.C. That\u2019s a five-fold increase in five years. \n \n\u201cA lot of it is the sheer complexity of the laws, which are changing so much,\u201d said Chandler, CEO of Springfield, Virginia-based Express Homebuyers. \n \nFor example, Chandler said, depreciation laws are shifting annually, and the health care law brought more paperwork. \n \nOccasionally, the company gets additional tax bills, which raise a question for Chandler and his chief financial officer. \n \n\u201cDo we send it to our CPA [to handle] for $200 or $300 an hour, or just pay the bill?\u201d he said.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Joyce M.

But when it comes to racial and gender diversity, its leading companies are no trailblazers. \n \nDespite loudly touted efforts to hire more blacks, Latinos and women, especially in technical and leadership positions, diversity numbers at the largest tech companies are barely budging. \n \nIn 2014, 2 percent of Googlers were black and 3 percent were Hispanic, numbers that have not changed since. The picture is similar at Facebook and Twitter. Microsoft is slightly more racially diverse (though not when it comes to gender) and Apple even more so, though still not reflective of the U.S. population. Amazon is more racially diverse still, although it counts a large, lower-wage warehouse workforce in its totals. \n \nWomen, meanwhile, make up less than a third of the workforce at many companies \u2014 even less in engineering and other technical jobs. \n \nTech companies themselves tend to blame a \u201cpipeline problem,\u201d meaning a shortage of women and minorities with technical qualifications. But a number of academic experts, industry employees and diversity advocates say there\u2019s a bigger problem. Silicon Valley, they argue, has failed to challenge its own unstated assumptions about what makes for great tech employees. \n \n\u201cThe people who are doing the hiring are not changing their thinking around what they view as qualified,\u201d says Leslie Miley, engineering director at the message-service startup Slack. \n \nHiring managers, he says, spend too much time worrying that applicants who don\u2019t fit techie stereotypes aren\u2019t \u201cGoogle-y enough or Facebook-y enough or Apple-y enough or Twitter-y enough.\u201d \n \nMiley, who is African-American, previously worked as an engineer at Twitter, Apple, Google and Yahoo. \n Industry trying  \nCompanies are spending a lot of time and money on improving diversity. Two years ago, Intel splashily set itself the goal of achieving full representation in its workforce by 2020. Despite committing $300 million to the effort and making some early progress, Intel acknowledges there is \u201ca great deal of work to be done.\u201d \n \nSimilar programs are in place throughout the industry, from outreach at high schools and historically black colleges to internship and mentoring programs and sponsorships for coding boot camps. So far, to little avail. \n \nWhy? Interviews with more than 30 tech workers, executives and diversity advocates suggest the blame lies with subtle biases in hiring, unwelcoming work environments and a paucity of diverse role models in top positions. \n \nAniyia Williams, founder and CEO of the startup Tinsel, says companies should focus on their own culture rather than blaming external factors they can\u2019t control, such as limited computer-science education in U.S. schools. It\u2019s not enough to release diversity reports and say, \u201cOh, not a lot has changed, but it\u2019s the world, not us that\u2019s the problem,\u201d she says. \n \nWilliams, who is African-American, says she has made sure to hire women as well as underrepresented minorities. Tinsel makes tech jewelry targeted at women. \n Why it matters  \nDiversity isn\u2019t just about fairness. It\u2019s about having designers who reflect the diversity of the people they are designing for. For tech companies hoping to reach millions or billions of users, a lack of diversity could mean their products \u201cwill not appeal to a large population,\u201d says Lillian Cassel, chairwoman of computer sciences at Villanova University. \n \nDiverse perspectives can also help prevent grievous errors \u2014 such as a problem that arose at Google in 2015, when a photo-recognition feature misidentified black faces as gorillas. \n \nSome related missteps: \n \nSnapchat released two photo filters that contorted facial features into bucktoothed Asian caricatures or blackface. One was later withdrawn after public outcry. The other \u201cexpired,\u201d and the company said it won\u2019t put it back into circulation. \n \nAirbnb initially took no steps to prevent hosts from discriminating against guests whose profile photos showed they were black. The practice was corrected after an outcry. \n \nTwitter took nearly a decade to tackle the harassment of women and minorities on its service. \n \nIn a New York Times opinion piece, Microsoft researcher Kate Crawford urged companies working on artificial intelligence to address diversity, warning that otherwise \u201cwe will see ingrained forms of bias built into the artificial intelligence of the future.\u201d \n Into the pipeline  \nSome 11 percent of computer science graduates were black and 9 percent were Hispanic in the 2013-14 school year, according to the latest data from the U.S. Department of Education. Yet only 4 percent of Google\u2019s 2015 hires were black, and 3 percent were Hispanic. At Intel, fewer than 5 percent of hires were black and 8 percent were Hispanic. Numbers at other tech companies are comparable. \n \nMajor tech companies have a long tradition of hiring applicants from top-tier universities \u2014 and those universities also have a problem with diversity, even if they\u2019re doing slightly better than the companies. Some minority applicants, meanwhile, earn their computer-science chops through community colleges or coding boot camps instead \u2014 places often overlooked by recruiters. \n \nThe few minorities hired into big tech companies can often feel alienated in overwhelmingly white (and sometimes Asian) environments. \n When the culture doesn\u2019t fit  \nSilicon Valley startups like to talk about \u201cculture fit\u201d \u2014 in theory, the question of whether a job candidate\u2019s attitude and behavior meshes well with a company. In practice, though, it can mean that since a lot of people are white and male, they \u201chire what they know,\u201d says Dave McClure, a prominent angel investor in Silicon Valley. \n \nLarger companies such as Facebook publicly eschew discussions of \u201cfit,\u201d although the notion can unwittingly seep into hiring practices. For example, a 2013 study found that words used in engineering and programming job listings could serve to discourage women from applying. Words like \u201ccompetitive,\u201d \u2018\u2018dominant\u201d and \u201cleader,\u201d can make a job seem less appealing to women in a field that is already male-dominated.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Barbara Ortutay"},"topics":[{"name":"Internet latest","group":"Internet"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Little progress in tech diversity","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Denton","zipCode":"76201","state":"Texas","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Denton","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Denton Record-Chronicle","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169660450","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"115"},"name":"Denton Record-Chronicle","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Business","Professional","Local","Geographic"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.dentonrc.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.google.com/diversity/","http://newsroom.fb.com/news/2016/07/facebook-diversity-update-positive-hiring-trends-show-progress/","https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/diversity/inside-microsoft/default.aspx","http://www.apple.com/diversity/","https://www.amazon.com/b?node=10080092011","https://bigstory.ap.org/0e806720877242cfb96d187511c09eb3","http://bigstory.ap.org/ad72803420e84e51a09ceff025e6ea35","http://www.fortefoundation.org/site/DocServer/gendered_wording_JPSP.pdf?docID=16121"],"sequenceId":"695194344405","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:14:40Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Without funds for an attorney, I accepted deferred probation. It has followed me my entire life. \n \nI graduated from college, law, and graduate school, yet I had to endure a hearing to ascertain my fitness to practice. It also caused employment rejection. \n \nLater, as assistant county attorney in El Paso, and elected district attorney in Willacy County, I routinely dismissed pot cases. Prosecutor\u2019s offices have limited budgets, yet mountains of cases. Dismissing marijuana offenses, allowed me to send more dangerous criminals to prison. \n \nEven probation for pot was wasteful. Curfews and reporting requirements should be for prowlers and burglars, not pot smokers. \n \nThis problem persists, as 620,000 Americans were arrested for pot last year. Yes, illegal marijuana creates jobs for probation officers, prosecutors, bailiffs, chemists, clerical staff and many more; however taxpayers get soaked. \n \nCalifornia and three other states legalized marijuana on Nov. 8. Voters were persuaded by the Colorado experience, where $2.4 billion in revenues and 17,000 jobs were created in legalization\u2019s first year. Some of this boom comes from visiting Texans. \n \nThe Denver Post polled, \u201cWould you repeal legalization?\u201d The answer; \u201cNo\u201d, by a 51 percent to 36 percent margin. Gallup\u2019s 2016 poll showed support for legalization has grown to 60 percent nationally, and recent studies demonstrate no increased use among youngsters since legalization. Colorado is booming, and other states want what they\u2019re smoking. \n \nThe old \u201cReefer Madness\u201d arguments against marijuana have been dispelled. Today\u2019s legalization opponents such as Insys Therapeutics, which develops synthetic painkillers, poured $500,000 into the \u201cNo\u201d vote in Arizona. It\u2019s these legal painkillers which cause so much addiction and harm. \n \nPrescription drugs increase our health costs and Big Pharma doesn\u2019t want competition. The Catholic Church was also a huge contributor, with the Boston Archdiocese donating $850,000 to oppose Massachusetts\u2019 marijuana initiative. \n \nOne lingering anti-pot argument is that people will ingest and drive. This happens anyway and it will be illegal everywhere. \n \nNot satisfied, opponents wonder how they will test for marijuana. Field tests still work, but how about we just arm each officer with a chocolate bar, and they could cuff the stoned drivers as they grab for it. \n \nLegalization will come eventually, as it\u2019s only the oldest age groups who are opposed. \n \nAn estimated 15 million Americans use marijuana regularly, and about half our population has admitted trying marijuana. \n \nMarijuana decriminalization bills for the 2017 Texas Legislature, have been filed, including one by El Paso\u2019s own Joe Moody. \n \nRepublicans are increasingly in favor, because of the fiscal benefits and individual freedom arguments. Democrats are already there, and almost everyone wants to decrease the power of the violent drug cartels who smuggle pot across our border. \n \nLet\u2019s legalize it, and have Mexico put up the wall to keep Texans from trafficking marijuana into their country. \n \nEl Paso attorney Steve Fischer has been a professor of criminology and a Texas State Bar director.

Let us be honest. As the governor of Edo State, we have had to sponsor, and the records are there, first, Nigerian medical doctors, who request for it in black and white that they had to be treated in India, the UK or US and they give me a variety of reasons why they need that foreign medical check. \n \n\u201c\u200eI have seen villagers approaching me that they had prostrate (cancer).

Organisers claim this a record number of the little dogs in the one place at the one time. exit   \nMark Ellis, the organiser of Sunday's Werriwa Wiener Dash at the Bungendore Show, believes the turnout of 154 dachshunds for the event constitutes a world record for the number of the sausage dogs in one place at one time. \n \n\"We had miniatures, long hairs, short hairs, standards and wire hairs,\" he said. \"They came from all over; some even travelled from Melbourne. \n \nWhile Mr Ellis wasn't able to engage the attention of the people from Guinness, who ruled the record being sought was too \"specialised\" to interest them, he is happy to claim the record with any other contenders needing to prove him wrong. \n \nAlthough the quirky event, which has captured the imagination of dachshund lovers from across NSW and the ACT, is only in its second year it has already become one of the feature events of the Bungendore Show. \n \nThis year's dash winner was Buddy, owned by Jacqueline Winzenberg of Page in the ACT. Buddy's award was presented by NSW Deputy Premier and local member John Barilaro. \n \nOne hundred and twenty seven dogs turned up for the inaugural event in 2016. \n \nBungendore Show, which was first held in the 1840s, has gone from strength to strength in recent decades, this year's showgirl, Hanna Darmody, 22, said. \n \nMs Darmody, whose family own a Bungendore butchery, said she could recall helping with the catering at the show as a toddler almost 20 years ago. \n \n\"I've seen the event grow as the town has grown,\" she said. \"It is a great bridge between country and city; the showgirl competition is a good way to get young people involved and promotes opportunities in agriculture.\" \n \nShow organisers said this year's event, which enjoyed the best weather conditions in three years, was an unqualified success with more than 2000 people passing through the gates before lunch. \n \nIn addition to the usual attractions in the show ring and the pavilions and the dachshund dash, the 2017 event offered visitors a chance to get a close look at the Anzac Centennial 18 pounder gun. \n \nThe World War I-era weapon, which also saw service during World War II,was restored by the Royal Australian Artillery Company in conjunction with veteran coach builder Jim Frecklington. \n \nThe story Werriwa Wiener dash claims world dachsund record first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald .","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Werriwa Wiener dash claims world dachsund record","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2153","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Bella Vista","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Hills News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169714159","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2"},"name":"Hills News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.hillsnews.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194347691","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:14:43Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

He alleged that the Liberals wanted to wrest police from Mr Grant, a senior Nationals MP. \n \n\"The Nationals wanted police, the right wing faction of the Liberals wanted police,\" he said. \"So she split it in two.\" \n \n\"It's the police who keep us safe from terrorism,\" Mr Foley said. \n \n\"The police commissioner now has to report to two people. It's scandalous and another deal that is counter to the public interest.\" \n \nMeanwhile, the troubled relationship between the NSW attorney-general and minister for police has been addressed, with Ms Berejiklian confirming a reshaping of the much maligned \"justice cluster\". \n \nThe arrangement, whereby as justice and police minister Mr Grant held a more senior position than then attorney-general Gabrielle Upton, was heavily criticised by the legal profession. \n \nThe NSW Bar Association said it provided Mr Grant \"with unprecedented power in determining legal policy without the historical checks and balances\". \n \nThe NSW Law Society warned the arrangement meant police were \"ostensibly responsible for criminal law policy, while at the same time, the traditional roles of the attorney-general as first law officer of the state, which includes preserving civil liberties, are being eroded\". \n \nMs Berejiklian has confirmed the cluster has been reworked so that new attorney-general Mark Speakman, SC, is the lead minister. \n \nThe story New counter terrorism role slammed as 'against the public interest' first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald .","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Terrorism news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"New counter terrorism role slammed as 'against the public interest'","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2153","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Bella Vista","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Hills News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169714159","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2"},"name":"Hills News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.hillsnews.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194348329","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:14:43Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

We\u2019re starting in downtown Denton at the PointBank Black Box Theatre on Hickory Street, and we\u2019ll head west toward the Square. \n \nBefore we take our first step, though, let\u2019s look down at the sidewalk. Notice the pattern? On both sides of Hickory Street between Bell and Locust streets, a brick band runs parallel to the concrete. Evenly placed within this band, granite squares are laid into the concrete. \n \nWe are on the Denton Arts Walk of Fame. \n \nThis stone here in front of the Black Box Theatre celebrates musician Louise Tobin. Her\u2019s was the first marker unveiled back in 2015, the Walk of Fame\u2019s inaugural year. Twelve granite squares were engraved between 2015 and 2016 honoring artists with Denton connections. Texas Poet Laureate Karla Morton\u2019s was next after Tobin\u2019s. \n \nEvery one of the honored-in-granite are artists of myriad genres ranging from music, literature and theater to film, architecture, visual arts and more. Brave Combo, Pops Carter, Midlake, O\u2019Neil Ford and Jesus Morales are examples of other recipients. \n \nAs we make our way along the Arts Walk of Fame, you\u2019ll notice many more granite stones than the 12 engraved thus far. That\u2019s because the Walk of Fame funding happens in waves, by fiscal years. Someday, every granite stone will be engraved. A multitude of talent connects to Denton, but there\u2019s only money enough to tackle such a vast project a step at a time, so to speak. \n \nThis past Thursday, the Denton Main Street Association announced the 2017 Arts Walk of Fame inductees. There are eight on this year\u2019s list. In case you haven\u2019t seen the lineup yet, here it is: \n \nLeon Breedon, musician \n \nJohn Ford Coley, musician \n \nPaula Blincoe Collins, sculptor \n \nCarlotta Corpron, photographer \n \nMargo Jones, producer/director \n \nTom \u201cBones\u201d Malone, musician \n \nLou Marini, musician \n \nNeal Slater, musician \n \nThe Arts Walk of Fame is a facet of the Downtown Master Plan, a plan that resulted from a citizen-driven idea developed in 1995 called \u201cVision for Denton \u2014 the 21st Century.\u201d That idea included an arts and entertainment corridor along East Hickory as a major priority. \n \nToday, we Dentonites and thousands of visitors to our city enjoy the fruits of that focus every day. Downtown is the thriving, culturally rich city center, and still growing. \n \n\u201cThere are more than 100 names on a list compiled by the Arts Walk of Fame Committee,\u201d said Julie Glover, downtown development manager and city staff liaison for the project. \u201cWe envision anywhere from eight to 12 inductees each year long into the future. Public input will continue to be valuable in their considerations.\u201d \n \nHow does the committee assess potential inductees? Nominees must have been born in Denton, or attended school or spent their formative/creative years here or had a national impact on our cultural heritage. \n \nOther considerations include longevity of career, professional achievements, contributions to the Denton arts community or contribution to national arts. \n \nThe more honorees are engraved in granite, the more value I believe the Arts Walk of Fame will be to our Denton tourism product. It memorializes talented individuals who have contributed to the local arts community and expresses appreciation to them. \n \nGranite stones include the name of the artist and their claim to fame, such as musician, sculptor, actor, journalist. For those who want to delve deeper, understand artists\u2019 bodies of work and their Denton connection, those details are available at www.discoverdenton.com. \n \nIn the business of delivering the best possible #dentoning experiences, we all see a day in the not-too-distant future when people will linger at each granite marker and employ augmented reality on their smartphones to get the full stories. \n \nOne 2017 Arts Walk of Fame event is already on the books. John Ford Coley, American singer and musician best known for the 1970s hit duo England Dan & John Ford Coley, will participate in person when his marker is unveiled on Saturday, June 10. \n \n\u201cI\u2019m highly honored that I am included in the Denton Arts Walk of Fame,\u201d Coley said. \n \nEveryone is invited to all of these events, and when possible, artists are there, too. Louise Tobin was. Karla Morton was. John Ford Coley will be. Many more in the days and years to come will be, too. \n \nOur walk today was Hickory Street to Locust Street and then back again on the other side of the road. This year, we\u2019ll add eight more names among these granite markers for a total of 20. Imagine the wealth of this walk in just a few more years. It\u2019s happening, one step at a time. \n \nKIM PHILLIPS is vice president of the Denton Convention & Visitors Bureau at the Denton Chamber of Commerce.

But what about accelerating federal action on natural gas pipelines important to our region of the country? \n  \nFormer President Barack Obama held up the Keystone XL pipeline for much of his term in office, citing environmental concerns. That was despite the fact his own State Department investigated and concluded there were no environmental concerns about the pipeline that would bring Canadian oil to refineries in the United States. \n \nObama\u2019s action on the Dakota Access pipeline was more egregious. The oil transportation line already was under construction when, late in his presidency, Obama chose to shut work down solely because of protests against the project. \n \nGood for Trump for ordering federal officials to stand aside and allow construction of both pipelines. They will be better for the environment than other methods of transporting oil, not to mention safer. \n \nHere in West Virginia and Ohio, we have other concerns. During the Obama administration, federal officials have consistently \u201cslow walked\u201d permitting and other actions needed to clear the way for construction of pipelines to carry gas produced here to processing facilities and overseas shipping terminals. As a result, a substantial amount of natural gas in our region has been locked up. \n \nA gas company official put it this way, \u201cOurs is an industry on a leash.\u201d \n \nOf course, considerations of safety, preservation of valuable natural areas and other environmental concerns should not be dismissed. No one has asked the federal government do that. \n \nBut the Obama administration\u2019s policy of hampering any fossil fuel initiatives it could not kill needs to end. If Trump\u2019s order on the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines does not make that clear to federal agencies, the president should reinforce his intentions.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Pipelines: President Trump can unleash our resources","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Wood","zipCode":"26101","state":"West Virginia","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Parkersburg","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"News and Sentinel","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169707085","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"287"},"name":"News and Sentinel","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.newsandsentinel.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194358674","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:14:46Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

I had to laugh reading about that moment when you all realized that the path was much longer than anyone expected or was prepared for. Haven\u2019t we all done that? Somewhat lost, stuck in the mud, on slippery slopes and even turning on each other a bit before refocusing on the task \u2014 what great analogies for the situation we\u2019re in. \n  \nWhat can we do to avoid the pitfalls so well described here? We each need to assess the situation for ourselves, to think for ourselves, and speak up about our concerns and cautions. That means asking how do we know what we know. Some decisions are made on how we feel in our gut, but there are decisions where the gut needs the mind. More information is called for. Talking it over with trusted friends and family. Talking it over with someone different than you. Being curious, investigative. Knowing history is called for. Knowing what inspires you. Knowing the sources of your information, and knowing the sources\u2019 biases and financial incentives \u2014 who stands to gain? Would a powerful leader have prevented this predicament? Maybe, but a leader can be just as lost and afraid to admit something was a bad idea as anyone else. So, yes, I would say we keep questioning leaders as well as ourselves. \n \nWe have elected President Trump. I\u2019m thinking about that and asking what are the signs saying? In the soap operas and movies, the greatest betrayals occur right after the words \u201cTrust me.\u201d Trust is earned. And Mr. Trump will earn our trust by releasing his tax returns, disclosing conflicts of interest, and divesting of his business interests. He is accountable to us, the American people. We pay his salary, his expenses, and protect him and his family. How do we know where his debts, obligations, deals, or profits, are \u2014 who is he beholden to, who is he profiting from? Is he being blackmailed? We don\u2019t know. Why would a president, who has pledged to uphold the highest law of the land, fudge on something this crucial to our country\u2019s well-being?

The stories covered the period from his days at Glenville State College to his time with Wood County Schools. \n  \nMany people and businesses were involved in making this event a reality. Former delegate Tom Azinger and Mr. Jim Hameric, former AD at Parkersburg High School, worked very hard promoting the event. Colombo\u2019s Restaurant provided the meat; Jim Oppe from Foodland provided the utensils, and the local Pepsi Cola Company provided the drinks. The Great Steak Grill in the Grand Central Mall donated the bread and the manpower to help serve the dinner. The food was prepared by Officer Chris Jackson, a state trooper for the West Virginia State Police. \n \nPeople came from as far away as Mingo and McDowell counties to attend Clyde\u2019s roast. Mayor Joyce and Mayor Rapp were in attendance as well as a state senator and two circuit judges. The outpouring of respect and honor for this man shows what a compassionate and generous community we live in. We should all be happy that we live in the Mid Ohio Valley that honors and respects those who have worked to make our community a better place in which to live. We are proud of our teachers, policemen and public servants. \n \nAt the conclusion of  the event, several door prizes were given away, one of which was a basketball signed by Bob Huggins of WVU, provided by Shane Lyons of WVU, who was one of Clyde\u2019s former players. The ball was won by Mike Hayden, who graciously donated it back to Mrs. Brewer. What a wonderful outpouring of support and appreciation this event was! \n \nIt was my great pleasure to have worked many years with Clyde and his wife at Wood County Schools. My very best to you and your family. \n \nJohn Coe \n \nParkersburg","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Support appreciated","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Wood","zipCode":"26101","state":"West Virginia","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Parkersburg","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"News and Sentinel","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169707085","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"287"},"name":"News and Sentinel","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.newsandsentinel.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194359396","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:14:46Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Had the NPVIC been in effect, W.Va. electors would have been required to cast their votes for Hillary Clinton because she won the nationwide popular vote. The same would be true in all the states Trump carried. The NPVIC would have made electors puppets of Clinton and the Democratic Party. \n \nThankfully, the NPVIC was not in effect in 2016. \n \nWe elect our members of congress and senators to represent us in Washington. We should choose our electors to do the same in the Electoral College. If electors aren\u2019t free to represent their constituents, why have electors? Why have an Electoral College? \n \nThe Electoral College concept reflects our founding fathers\u2019 concerns with separation of powers and checks and balances to prevent a future tyranny in our country. That is the reason they gave the individual states so much power and latitude in the selection of their electors and the rules concerning how electors vote. \n \nThe NPVIC negates those separations of powers and checks and balances by shifting the power to decide elections into the blue state population centers and leaving rural red states out of the process. \n \nAllowing too much power in the hand of any one individual, political group or area of the country is a form of tyranny. \n \nThe , period. \n \nIn his Jan. 15 letter, Ralph Chambers correctly states \u201cCongress shall make no law respecting the establishment of a religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof\u201d appears in the First Amendment. \n \nMr. Chambers graciously makes my case for me. No where is the term \u201cseparation of church and state\u201d mentioned in the Constitution. \n \nThe term \u201cseparation of church and state\u201d was coined in the 1960s when liberal judges began their attacks on our religious freedoms by banning prayer and Bible reading in public schools. Those decisions should be made by parents, local schools and local officials, not the federal government. \n \nSince then, nativity scenes have been banned from public squares, praying before football games, even saying \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d is forbidden for fear of offending some atheist. \n \nNow one atheist can restrict the free exercise of religion by the majority. \n \nWhat part of \u201cprohibiting the free exercise thereof\u201d can\u2019t liberals understand? \n \nSteve Wolverton \n \nParkersburg","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"NPVIC is a bad idea","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Wood","zipCode":"26101","state":"West Virginia","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Parkersburg","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"News and Sentinel","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169707085","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"287"},"name":"News and Sentinel","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.newsandsentinel.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194359570","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:14:46Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

major employer of foreign workers, hit back on Saturday at President Donald Trump's sudden executive order on immigration, with some leaders calling it immoral and un-American. Trump's order temporarily bars citizens of seven majority-Muslim countries from entering the United States even if they hold valid visas or permanent residence permits, a move that caught many companies off-guard.\n\nNetflix Inc Chief Executive Reed Hastings called it \"a sad week\" and added: \"It is time to link arms together to protect American values of freedom and opportunity.\"\n\nApple Inc CEO Tim Cook sent a letter to employees saying Trump's order was \"not a policy we support\" and promised to help affected employees.\n\n\"We have reached out to the White House to explain the negative effect on our coworkers and our company,\" Cook added.\n\nElon Musk, the South African-born founder of Tesla and SpaceX who met recently with Trump, said on Twitter: \"The blanket entry ban on citizens from certain primarily Muslim countries is not the best way to address the country\u2019s challenges.\"\n\nAirbnb co-founder and CEO Brian Chesky said: \"Not allowing countries or refugees into America is not right and we must stand with those who are affected.\"\n\nAirbnb will provide free housing to anyone not allowed into the United States, Chesky said.\n\nAaron Levie, the outspoken founder and CEO of online storage company Box Inc, said: \"The executive order on immigration is immoral and antithetical to our values.\"\n\nStranded\n\nFriday's order could be a major headache for tech companies, potentially leaving employees stranded overseas and unable to return to the United States.\n\nAlphabet Inc's Google urgently called back employees from overseas and told ones who might be affected by the ban not to leave the United States.\n\nCEO Sundar Pichai said in an email to staff that more than 100 Google employees were affected by the order, according to a Google executive.\n\nOne Google employee of Iranian nationality with legal US residency made it back to the United States just hours before the order took effect, the executive said.\n\n\"We're concerned about the impact of this order and any proposals that could impose restrictions on Googlers and their families, or that could create barriers to bringing great talent to the US,\" Google said in a statement.\n\nMicrosoft Corp President and Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith said in a company-wide email posted on LinkedIn that 76 company employees were citizens of the seven countries in question and held US work visas, and thus were directly affected by the order.\n\nHe said the company had not determined how many people with green cards, or permanent residence status, might be affected.\n\n\"As a company, Microsoft believes in a strong and balanced high-skilled immigration system,\" Smith said in the post. \"We believe in the importance of protecting legitimate and law-abiding refugees whose very lives may be at stake in immigration proceedings.\"\n\nUber Technologies Inc CEO Travis Kalanick, who has faced criticism from some employees for participating in President Trump's business advisory council, said in a statement that the company would compensate drivers from the seven countries who might not be able to return to the United States for three months or more. He said the company knew of about a dozen affected employees.\n\n\"This ban will impact many innocent people - an issue that I will raise this coming Friday when I go to Washington for President Trump\u2019s first business advisory group meeting,\" Kalanick said.\n\nFacebook Inc CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a post on Friday that was \"concerned\" about the order and voiced support for immigrants.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Tech latest","group":"Technology"},{"name":"Internet latest","group":"Internet"}],"title":"Tech leaders bash Trump ban","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"BD","country":"Bangladesh"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Bdnews24.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169667953","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"128"},"name":"Bdnews24.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["InformationTechnology","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bdnews24.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://bdnews24.com/technology/2017/01/29/us-tech-leaders-sound-alarm-over-trump-immigration-order&src=sdkpreparse","http://www.printfriendly.com/","http://delivery.ritsads.com/w/1.0/rc?cs=ff614e8f84&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE","http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript","http://disqus.com/","http://delivery.ritsads.com/w/1.0/rc?cs=9e5f0d291c&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE"],"sequenceId":"695194360944","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:14:46Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://d30fl32nd2baj9.cloudfront.net/media/2017/01/29/sundar-pichai.jpg/ALTERNATES/w640/Sundar-Pichai.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Perhaps I\u2019ll see something I\u2019ve never seen before or do something I\u2019ve never done before. My motto is, \u201cWhere there\u2019s hope, there\u2019s adventure.\u201d \n \nTwo years ago, for example, my wife and I visited friends in New Mexico. We survived a nighttime lightning storm as our tram descended from Sandia Peak. We hoped we wouldn\u2019t see any rattlesnakes, despite signs at every rest stop reading, \u201cBeware \u2014 Rattlesnakes!\u201d \n \nSometimes it takes years returning to the same place to see a particular species. It took me nine years to find a Swainson\u2019s warbler in West Virginia\u2019s New River Gorge. This year I plan to visit Ohio\u2019s Magee Marsh in mid-May to find a migrating Connecticut warbler. It\u2019s the only eastern warbler I\u2019ve never seen. \n \nAnd then there are hoped for surprises. One year we crossed the Texas panhandle on I-40 when we saw a sign for Palo Duro Canyon State Park near Amarillo. We had never heard of it, so we checked it out. Teeming with prairie dogs and southwestern birds, this little-known gem remains one of our favorite discoveries. \n \nI have yet to decide where to travel this year, but I do plan two return trips to places visited years ago. The West Virginia State Wildlife Center is only about two hours from home, so a late April trip sounds good. The Center is essentially a zoo featuring West Virginia wildlife. The grounds include a picnic area and a fishing pond. \n \nA 1.25-mile wheelchair accessible interpretive trail winds through a mature hardwood forest and connects spacious enclosures. The trail provides excellent photo opportunities for many species on display. \n \nThe center is located in north-central West Virginia about 12 miles south of Buckhannon on State Route 20. For more information, visit wvdnr.gov/wildlife/wildlifecenter.shtm or call 304-924-6211. \n \nThe other location I plan to visit is The Wilds in Ohio, located south of I-70 between Columbus and Wheeling. The Wilds is a 9,000-plus acre safari park and conservation center located on reclaimed strip mines. \n \nThe best way to enjoy the Wilds is on an open-air tram tour. You will get great looks at larger species in their expansive enclosures, and periodic stops give close up looks at the smaller species. \n \nYou\u2019ll see familiar species such as ostrich, rhinos, giraffes, zebras, and cheetahs and new or less familiar species such as African painted dogs, Przewalski\u2019s wild horses, Persian onagers, and Sichuan takins. And the open expanses that comprise the Wilds provide excellent birding for native grassland species. For more information, visit thewilds.org or call 740-638-5030. \n \nWhile we\u2019re in the neighborhood, a side trip to the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium (columbuszoo.org) will be hard to resist. It\u2019s one of the country\u2019s great zoos. The favorite part of my most recent visit was the best bear exhibit I\u2019ve ever seen. \n \nFinally, for a four to six day road trip, I suggest driving 400 miles along U.S. Route 6 across the northern tier of Pennsylvania from Lake Erie to the Delaware River. Among the highlights along the way are the Allegheny National Forest (fs.usda.gov/allegheny), the Lumber Museum in Coudersport (lumbermuseum.org), and the Pennsylvania Grand Canyon (pacanyon.com) near Wellsboro. The canyon runs along Pine Creek Gorge and measures 1,500 feet deep at some points. A strenuous one-mile hike leads into and out of the gorge. If you\u2019re not in a hurry to start the Route 2 crossing, begin by combing beaches and birding trails at Presque Isle State Park (presqueisle.org). Then take a quick jog northeast to visit the Roger Tory Peterson Institute in Jamestown, N.Y. (rtpi.org). It celebrates the life and career of the iconic artist, writer, and naturalist. And the nearby Audubon Community Nature Center (auduboncnc.org) is a great place to enjoy five miles of hiking trails through a 600-acre wetland preserve. \n \nSo when warmer weather returns, take Willie Nelson\u2019s advice and get \u201cback on the road again.\u201d \n \n*** \n \nScott Shalaway can be heard on Birds & Nature from 3 to 4 p.m. Sundays on 620 KHB Radio, Pittsburgh or live online anywhere at khbradio.com.

We, as citizens, need to stand by him and give him our allegiance and honor. This is America and this is the way things are done here. \n \nThe citizens have spoken and those who wanted someone else must accept the fact that there is one winner and one loser in any election. \n \nSome recent events have shamed our country and caused other nations to lose confidence in our way of government. No one group of persons is better or worse than any other group and the color of one\u2019s skin or being male or female doesn\u2019t give any group the right to think they are better than anyone else or to try to destroy our country. True Americans stand together, united, even if they wish another candidate had won. Riots never did any good to anyone and only show the ignorance of those destroying what does not belong to them. \n \nLet\u2019s hope and pray that we, as a nation, can get past this disobedience and become what we used to be, the example of being a noble nation. \n \nAs a citizen of the United States, this is what I believe. Laws have been made to help citizens live together in peaceful communities. I may not agree with all of them, but I will do my best to obey them. That is the duty of every citizen. \n \nThere are only ten basic laws that govern all mankind. These fundamental laws are the basis on which the laws of our country are based. Many thousands of patriots have given their lives to protect and keep America. It is the duty of every one of us to help keep her free. As a citizen, I pledge to honor and obey the laws of this country, honor our flag, support our leaders, and to support those who risk their lives to preserve our freedom. I am proud to be an American citizen. \n \nIt is important for the youth of our country to know the history of our country and the history of their ancestors. There has been a push to record the stories of fathers and grandfathers who were in World War II. \n \nTime is of an essence since that generation is thinning rapidly. It is traumatic for those who have faced the horrors of war to talk about it, and only decades after their experiences have many of them told their stories. It has been helpful for those in later years to record what they have experienced and it is what young folks today need to know about those who protect all of us. \n \nThe ancestors of all of us (except the Native Americans) came from somewhere else, and many of those came to this country because of war. The stories of how they became citizens and learned the language and culture of their new country are important for each family. The traditions they brought with them is part of our culture now. \n \nI met many folks in Europe when I lived there that told me what they, as children, went through during the war in their country. You do not want your children to have to face some of the horrors that they faced. I remember how scared I, as a child was, during World War II, and there was no fighting here in this country. We cannot let our county become so weak that anyone thinks they can \u201ctake us on\u201d and create war on our shores. \n \nWe need to let our young family members learn what their ancestors had to endure to become citizens in a strange land so that they can prevent harm on our shores as they become the governing age. Educate them in the traditions of your family. Leave them with journals of your life and the recipes of their grandmothers. Teach them the morays of family life so that they will have a contented and happy life. There is so much hate and violence in our world today that we have to show them that there is a better way to live. We need to show, by example, that no one should tolerate lawlessness and violence, or the loss of our freedom and our country. They need to learn to be Americans, as there is so much against our way of life at the present time, and much of it is internal. \n \nThe recipes today are for comfort foods. We all need them, especially, when we feel depressed and worry about our country. Pray for our president. And, add to your prayer list all those who protect us, those who need a \u201chelping hand.\u201d \n \nMay God Bless you and God Bless America. \n \n*** \n \nBAKED CUSTARD \n \n3 large (or 4 smaller) eggs \n \n1/3 cup sugar \n \n1 teaspoon vanilla extract \n \nPinch of salt \n \n2 1/2 cups warm milk (120 to 130 degrees) \n \nGround nutmeg \n \nBeat eggs, sugar, vanilla, and salt in medium bowl. Gradually add milk. Pour into custard cups or a casserole baking dish and sprinkle with nutmeg. Bake in preheated 350-degree oven for about 30 minutes for custard cups or 45 minutes for baking dish. Custard is done when a knife inserted between center and edge of dish comes out clean. Cool before serving and keep leftovers in refrigerator. \n \nNOTE: I never bother to warm the milk although most recipes mention doing it. Many recipes recommend setting the cups or baking dish in a larger pan and adding hot water to the pan, up to the level of the custard, for the baking process. I tried it once and nearly scalded myself when I splashed the hot water on myself while taking the baked dish out of the oven. I am clumsy, so I don\u2019t bake custard with a surrounding hot water bath and they come out fine and without the chance of hot water cascading over me and the kitchen floor. \n \nMy \u201cnever measure\u201d recipe is \u2014 per each cup of milk; 2 eggs, 2 tablespoons sugar, 1/2 to 1capful of vanilla, pinch of salt and nutmeg sprinkled on top and baked in moderate oven. \n \n*** \n \nGRANDMA NICHOLS\u2019 STOVE-TOP RICE PUDDING \n \n1 quart milk \n \n1 teacupful (about 3/4 measuring cup) uncooked rice \n \n1 large egg \n \n1/2 cup sugar \n \n2 full capfuls (2 teaspoons) vanilla extract \n \nPinch salt \n \nGround nutmeg or cinnamon \n \nWarm milk, in medium size saucepan, over low to medium heat and stir in rice as soon as milk starts to warm up. Bring to a simmer and cook, uncovered and stirring frequently, until the rice is very tender, about 30 to 35 minutes. In a bowl, beat the egg and add sugar, vanilla and salt. Gradually add the cooked rice to the egg mixture until well blended, and then return all to the saucepan. Cook and stir for a minute or two to cook the egg.

Overdose death caused by narcotic prescriptions have nearly quadrupled since 1999. From 1999 to 2014 the number of prescription related deaths exceeded more than 165,000 people \u2014 three times the number of U.S. military deaths from the Vietnam War. The numbers of overdose prescription pain medication deaths has risen in every county of every state reaching a new peak in 2014 at 78 deaths per day or three per hour. Simply put, the current health care treatment policies fail the very people seeking help. \n  \nIn a bold and pioneering move, the St. Joseph\u2019s Regional Hospital in Paterson, N.J., recently announced it has become the first hospital in the country to implement a program that will manage patients\u2019 pain in the emergency room with integrative care and without narcotic painkillers. Painkillers most frequently used in the emergencies rooms are OxyContin, Vicodin, and Percocet, according to Dr. Mark Rosenberg, the Emergency Department Chair. Dr. Andrew McLachlan, professor of the University of Sydney, reported narcotic use for chronic pain control exceeding three months has no clear studies, yet one point is understood, these medications do have harmful side effects including addiction and death. \n \nAnswers to address this public crisis are currently available, but not utilized to their fullest potential here in the Mid-Ohio Valley or the surrounding counties. Here is what we know when the public has greater access to chiropractic services: cost savings of 40 percent; back surgeries when choosing a surgeon occurred 42.7 percent versus 1.5 percent when going to a chiropractor first; reduced disability, 9.1 out of 10 patients reporting satisfaction with care, and most of all, saving lives. \n \nIt is time for an open and honest forum between the medical and chiropractic communities. We must put aside past harmful and deceptive rhetoric and work to integrate services that best serve the public. Discussion and demonstration for improved access of chiropractic services in the emergency rooms, pain management facilities, and physician offices is a great first step. Let us start now to reduce our drug epidemic for the love of the patients and public we all work to serve. \n \nByron Folwell \n \nParkersburg","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Alternate pain care","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Wood","zipCode":"26101","state":"West Virginia","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Parkersburg","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"News and Sentinel","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169707085","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"287"},"name":"News and Sentinel","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.newsandsentinel.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194362670","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:14:47Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Psychobabblers speculate that low self-esteem can drive an individual to achieve great heights as a way to show the world, and himself, that he's not as worthless as he thinks he is in his heart of hearts. It also can motivate someone to act in bizarre ways just to get attention and to deflect for another instant one's intense self-doubt. If he's in a position to influence people's lives, he's not only self-destructive; he can cause a lot of misery. \n \nYou know where I'm going with this: straight to Donald Trump. Even becoming president of the United States and being the constant center of attention while doing all that cool chief-executive stuff that presidents get to do doesn't seem to fill his egotistical black hole. So he can be counted on to nurse his wounds by hiding them behind repeated grandiose claims that he would have won the popular vote were it not for the millions of people who fraudulently cast ballots against him. Never mind that the evidence is overwhelmingly against that; he's doubling down by saying he'll commission some sort of investigation. Of course, there's that self-demeaning bitter battle with \"dishonest media\" over the size of his inaugural crowd. It's a constant embarrassment to those around him, but he just won't let it go. \n \nThe list goes on and on: He can't stop himself from picking fights over past grudges and slights. It's easy to conclude, frankly, that the leader of the free world has mental problems. But perhaps it's more insidious than that. Maybe he and his aides are putting out this outlandish pettiness to mask the substantive steps he's taking to abandon all civility and to dismantle the federal government's ability to protect its citizens. Where do we start? His executive orders aim to gut regulation enforcement, sabotage health care, withdraw from or reshape trade deals, build that ridiculous wall, yada, yada, yada. \n \nExcept these are not yada, yada, yadas. Each time these major attacks on the nation's structures or international structures occurs, the president becomes a petty Twitter tyrant, tweeting something so ridiculous that it takes the focus off the poorly thought-out, destructive actions he's taking. So maybe he's not such a nutcase at all. Maybe he and his posse are just master media manipulators. \n \nDonald Trump occupies the White House because he played those of us in newsbiz while his opponent frittered her claim to history away in the fog of boredom. So what we see here is either someone who is crazy as a loon or someone who is presiding over an administration that constantly outmaneuvers the best efforts of journalists to challenge him. It should be noted that these are not mutually exclusive. Maybe he is diabolically that clever, even while he constantly battles with his emotional demons. He certainly wouldn't be the first one in history. \n \nThe only hope might be that the United States of America was not set up to be governed by one man who could snap his fingers and get things done. He usually has to get things past Congress. That being said, \"political courage\" is a huge oxymoron. The members of Congress, even President Trump's fellow Republicans, have their fingers in the air always testing the winds, which might start to shift as the damage from his decisions and impulsive actions become more obvious. He also will have to deal with an emboldened opposition, which has its collective finger in the air, too. \n \nSo eventually, this may come crashing down on Fragile Donald. Eventually.

The address was widely panned, but early polling indicates the public didn\u2019t share the revulsion of the commentariat. The speech\u2019s broadly nationalistic sentiments were bound to strike people as common sense. \n \n\u201cAt the center of this movement is a crucial conviction: that a nation exists to serve its citizens.\u201d Who else would it serve? \n \n\u201cFrom this moment on, it\u2019s going to be America first.\u201d Why would anything else come first? \n \nTrump\u2019s speech was less poetic, but in one sense more grounded than George W. Bush\u2019s call for universal liberty in 2005 or Barack Obama\u2019s vision of international cooperation leading to a new era of peace in 2009. Trump spoke of \u201cthe right of all nations to put their own interests first.\u201d \n \nIf Bush was a vindicator of universal freedom, and Obama, in his more soaring moments, a citizen of the world, Trump is a dogged citizen of the United States, concerned overwhelmingly with vindicating its interests. \n \nHis executive order authorizing the building of the wall is an emphatic affirmation of one of the constituent parts of a nation, namely borders. \n \nIn general, immigration is an important focus for Trump\u2019s nationalism because it involves the question of whether the American people have the sovereign authority to decide who gets to live here or not; of whether the interests of American or foreign workers should be paramount; of whether we assimilate the immigrants we already have into a common culture before welcoming even more. \n \nThe Trump phenomenon is pushback against what the late political scientist Samuel Huntington called in his 2004 book \u201cWho Are We?\u201d the \u201cdeconstructionist\u201d agenda, a decadeslong project of the country\u2019s \u201cde-nationalized\u201d political and intellectual elites. \n \nBeginning in the 1960s and 1970s, Huntington argues, \u201cthey began to promote measures consciously designed to weaken America\u2019s cultural and creedal identity and to strengthen racial, ethnic, cultural and other subnational identities. These efforts by a nation\u2019s leaders to deconstruct the nation they governed were, quite possibly, without precedent in human history.\u201d \n \nIf Trump is a welcome rebuke to this attitude, caveats are necessary: \n \nA proper American nationalism should express not just an affinity for this country\u2019s people, as Trump did in his inaugural address, but for its creed, its institutions and its history. These are absent from Trump\u2019s rhetoric and presumably his worldview, impoverishing both. \n \nTrump\u2019s nationalism has the potential to appeal across racial and ethnic lines, so long as he demonstrates that it isn\u2019t just cover for his loyalty to his preferred subnational group. \n \nIf Bush was overly expansive in his international vision, Trump could be overly pinched. Bush\u2019s anti-AIDS program in Africa was unvarnished humanitarianism \u2014 and will redound to his credit, and the credit of this nation, for a long time. \n \nFinally, Trump\u2019s trade agenda also is an expression of his nationalism. Trade deals should have to pass the national-interest test. But protectionism is, historically, a special-interest bonanza that delivers benefits to specific industries only at a disproportionate cost to the rest of the economy. \n \nAll that said, the nation-state is back, despite all the forecasts of its demise. It is no more in eclipse than religion, which we also were told would fade away as humanity embraced a more secular, cosmopolitan future. \n \nThe lesson is that it\u2019s a mistake to predict the inevitable decline of things that give meaning to people\u2019s lives and involve fundamental human attachments. The nation is one of them, something that Trump, if he gets nothing else, instinctively understands. \n \n\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n \nComments.lowry@nationalreview.com","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Lowry: Revenge of the nation-state","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Pinal Central","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"612808623","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"Pinal Central","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.pinalcentral.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194370021","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:45:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:14:52Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Wade decision in January 1973, and as they did again Friday, they barely get a nod from the media. \n \nOf course, anti-abortion activists are far less flamboyant. They don\u2019t bring in rock stars like Madonna to address the crowds in expletives. They don\u2019t carry signs with graphic pictures of women\u2019s sexual organs. They are not vulgar. \n \nDespite deep differences between the pro-life movement and President Obama, there was no denigration or character assassination of our former president, even though he ignored the March for Life, while becoming the first sitting president to address the annual meeting of Planned Parenthood. \n \nHere\u2019s the difference. Pro-life means respect for the sanctity of life, and respect for life means respect for everyone. Although we use the language of rights, it is really about responsibilities. \n \nIn contrast, the droves of marching, screaming women getting so much attention, are defined by one thing: me. So they can be vulgar, disgusting, outrageous and crass, because you and I don\u2019t matter. It\u2019s all about them and getting their hurt feelings out. \n \nWhen it comes to abortion, there is no good news as long as the life of one child is pointlessly and cruelly extinguished. \n \nBut the abortion numbers are down. And this is good. \n \nAccording to a new report from the Guttmacher Institute, abortions in the U.S. in 2014 totaled 926,200. The lowest since 1974. \n \nThe author of the study speculated that the drop might be explained by more sophisticated and widespread use of birth control measures and possibly by tighter abortion laws in many states. \n \nAbortion is down, but births are not up. So perhaps some of this also can be associated with broader acceptance of sexual practices that in previous times were viewed as deviant. \n \nThe screaming ladies on the mall in Washington may be happy about the \u201cme\u201d culture and want more of it, but for anyone looking to a future for America, it does not bode well. \n \nThe basis for a society is human beings, and the \u201cme\u201d culture produces fewer new people. Bringing children into the world and raising them takes three things that don\u2019t work well with the \u201cme\u201d culture: work, sacrifice and love. \n \nAccording to the latest report, which appeared several weeks ago from the Centers for Disease Control, the nation\u2019s Total Fertility Rate, which is the average number of children produced by an adult American woman during her lifetime, is now 1.84. It is estimated that a Total Fertility rate of 2.08 is necessary to maintain a population where it is. So America is shrinking. America\u2019s Total Fertility Rate in 1970, three years before Roe v. Wade legalized abortion, was 2.50. \n \nThis means also that America is aging. There will be fewer in the work force to pay taxes and keep our economy growing to support the retirement and health care requirements of an elderly population. There will be more Americans growing old alone, growing old without children and family to care for them, physically and emotionally. \n \nMarching on Washington, screaming profanities to excite reporters looking for a story, may get a rise today. \n \nBut our country is slowly disappearing. \n \nThe Bible, something the \u201cme\u201d crowd enjoys denigrating, says that a man and woman should get married, that they should procreate and that they should \u201cchoose life.\u201d \n \nThe pro-life crowd is less flamboyant because it is steeped in a culture of respect, reverence for life and the wisdom of the ages. It may get less press. But without it, we have no future.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Political unrest news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Star Parker: Marching for life, and for our future","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Pinal Central","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"612808623","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"Pinal Central","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.pinalcentral.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194370203","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:45:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:14:52Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Doctors, nurses and hospitals who provide services to our neighbors are alarmed at the prospect of losing important federal dollars that cover the costs of care. With so much uncertainty in Washington, Arizona families and seniors are left not knowing whether they will be able to continue to access health care in their communities. \n \nSince its creation, Medicaid has been a cornerstone of the safety net that protects our most vulnerable across the nation. The current partnership between federal and state governments allows for flexibility when Medicaid enrollment increases and gives states the necessary resources to meet their needs. Medicaid has given health care coverage to millions of Americans and allowed providers to continue offering their services. However, recent proposals put forth by congressional leaders and President Trump would radically alter how the federal government allocates resources to states for that coverage. Under these plans, states would receive a block grant, or a fixed amount of federal dollars, to provide coverage to their populations without guaranteed coverage for seniors in nursing homes, disabled Arizonans or children of low-income families. \n \nA change like this raises a number of logistical questions and would likely create financial burdens for state governments, requiring them to make difficult choices that impact families. In Pinal County alone, more than 73,000 people could be affected by a move to block grants. \n \nThis is not a partisan issue. A letter to congressional leaders from Democrat and Republican governors stressed the need for the federal government to maintain its role in the Medicaid partnership and avoid shifting the cost of coverage to the states. The American people deserve to know how this new funding formula will impact their care. \n \nMedicaid is a vital program for Arizonans from all walks of life, but with nearly 60 percent of the costs of Medicaid going to nursing home and other elderly care, the current proposals put an inordinate strain on low-income and middle-income families caring for aging loved ones. In fact, Medicaid is the single largest payer of long-term care in Arizona and across the country. These families deserve to know the details of these proposals. How much will Arizona receive from the federal government for Medicaid? Will there be adjustments to account for inflation or an increase in the cost of care or drugs? We cannot afford to play games with the health care of more than 70 million Americans. \n \nWhile we do need to work to lower the cost of health care, improve access and quality, and manage government spending, we cannot do it on the backs of seniors, disabled workers, veterans, pregnant women and children who rely on Medicaid for health and economic security. Health care in America is at a critical juncture, and Republicans and Democrats must work together to find solutions that work. \n \nThe current proposals on the table would gut Medicaid as we know it and disrupt a decades-long agreement between the federal government and states. I am hopeful that a bipartisan coalition of governors and legislators on state and federal levels can work together on a proposal that will protect the millions who rely on programs like Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security.

Her father had worked for President Thomas Jefferson at Monticello and moved to the namesake city in 1839, according to her obituary on May 24, 1919, in the Jefferson City Democrat Tribune. \n \nThe Parsons family enjoyed a spacious setting for their home overlooking the Missouri River and featuring a stone stairway to the river's edge, prior to the installation of Jackson and State streets, according to the Daily Capital News on March 20, 1942. \n \nBefore her marriage in 1857, three of her sisters had died, including Mary Ann, who married a nephew of Jefferson. \n \nThe Standishes had two sons \u2014 Richard and Austin \u2014 before the Civil War began. Their youngest son, Monroe, was born in January 1862. By that December, Mildred's youngest brother, Gustavus Adolphus Jr., died in Van Buren, Arkansas, after enlisting at age 16. \n \nHer other brother, Monroe Mosby (M.M.), had distinguished himself early in the military, commanding a company of mounted volunteers from Cole County in the Mexican War. He commanded the 6th Division of the Missouri State Guard before being promoted to Brigadier General in the Confederate Army. \n \nMildred's husband, Austin, also joined the 6th Division, eventually rising to the rank of colonel and served on Gen. M.M. Parson's staff. \n \nStandish served from the beginning of the war and was once wounded when his horse was shot from under him, and his life was saved at the battle of Wilson Creek by his watch, which was badly crushed by a bullet meant for him. \n \nThe 1942 newspaper reprinted a letter in Mildred's own words, detailing her last visit with her husband and brother inside the Confederate lines. \n \nFollowing the election of Lincoln to his second term, her father encouraged Mildred \"to go south and try to persuade my husband Col. Standish to leave the Confederate Army and take a position of less danger than that of Chief of Staff to my brother Gen. Monroe M. Parsons,\" she wrote. \n \nShe braved travel through enemy lines with her three young sons in tow. After weeks aboard boats, trains and wagons, she reached his camp in Arkansas. For a southerner crossing through enemy lines, Mildred Standish found courtesy and hospitality. \n \n\"In view of the fact that I had not asked any favors, good fortune meeting me at every point was most remarkable,\" she said. \"Surely a kind providence guided me to find friends among strangers to help me through the difficult places.\" \n \nFrom Arkansas, she had traveled with her husband and brother to their Louisiana camp, where they were for the last days of the Confederacy and when word of Confederate Gen. Robert Lee's surrender arrived. \n \nUpon receiving that news, Gen. M.M. Parsons and his brother-in-law, Col. Standish, with other Confederate officers chose to seek better futures in Brazil. \n \nMildred wrote the officers in particular felt anxious and uncertain about the future, including her husband. They \"decided at once to leave the country believing that better opportunities of practicing their professions could be found elsewhere,\" she wrote. \n \nWith her young sons, Mildred returned from Shreveport, Louisiana, to Jefferson City. \n \n\"While on their way south, both Gen. Parsons and Col. Standish were cruelly murdered,\" Mildred's obituary said. \n \nThe soldiers still wearing their Confederate uniforms were attacked by Mexican soldiers June 10, 1865, near Chino, Mexico, by the San Juan River. \n \n\"At first, the bloody deed was supposed to have been committed by guerrillas, but it was afterwards found that they were soldiers,\" noted the May 5, 1875, Troy Herald. \"It was a fiendish massacre, and several noble men were butchered.\" \n \nStandish was remembered \"as gallant an Irishman as ever drew a sabre or mustered a squadron.\" \n \n\"Legend surrounding the Standish house tells that Mildred, refusing to believe reports of the deaths of her husband and brother in 1865, kept a burning candle for them in the front window waiting for their return,\" according to the Historic City of Jefferson's \"Capitol Avenue Historic District.\" \n \nAt the same time, she had a young family to care for. In addition to serving as matron of the School for the Blind in St. Louis for more than 30 years, Mildred also won restitution from the Mexican government. \n \nIn September 1875, she was awarded $40,000 in gold plus replacement of the $1,500 Standish had with him at the time of his murder. Her nephew and another Missouri widow also won claims of $50,000 each. \n \n\"Although crushed by the double tragedy which came to her as the result of the war and it's subsequent financial responsibilities, Mrs. Standish faced the future with a grace and dignity which caused her to be one of the most beloved personages of the city,\" the 1942 newspaper said. \n \nMildred was an honorary member of the Confederate veterans M.M. Parsons Camp and was one of the oldest members of Grace Episcopal Church at the time of her death. \n \nIn February 1919, just three months before her death at her niece's home in St. Louis, Mildred was one of 35 patients rescued from a fire at the St. Mary's Catholic Hospital. \n \nShe is buried at Woodland-Old City Cemetery, sharing a headstone with her son, Richard, a Cole County clerk. Sons \u2014 Austin, a physician, and Monroe, involved in the wholesale drugs business \u2014 also are buried there, as well as memorial stones for her husband, brother and several other Parsons family members. \n \n108 Jackson Street \n \nAn eye-catching example of Queen Anne architecture, 108 Jackson St. was built about 1890. \n     \nThis Jan. 26, 2017 photo shows the house at 108 Jackson Street in Jefferson City. \n   \nThis Jan. 26, 2017 photo shows the house... \n \nPhoto by Julie Smith /News Tribune. \n   \nThe brick 2 1/2-half-story home features several decorative elements, including the pyramidal tower, according to the Capitol Avenue Historic District nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. \n \nThe north corner boasts a rounded two-story bay, and the center of the gable has a three-light round window. The first floor also features a wrap-around porch that bows out around the rounded bay and curves around the southeast corner tower. \n \nBy the late 1960s, the property was used as blended office space and residential. \n \nEmployees of state offices, International Shoe Company and others lived there for short periods of time. \n \nRoy and Maye Ottinger bought the property from the estate of Ethel Gibler in 1969. \n \nBorn in 1891, Gibler studied at Central Missouri State College and returned to her hometown to work at Exchange National Bank before retiring in 1956. \n \nGibler was a member of First Presbyterian Church and active in the Charles Still Hospital Guild. She died suddenly in a two-car collision in 1966. \n \nMaye Ottinger hosted social gatherings with the Cole County Republican Women's Club and the First Baptist Church Women's Missionary Union. \n \nIt also was the headquarters for the State Association of Mentally Retarded Children, organized in 1954. \n \nThe voluntary organization established and coordinated local associations, provided programs and services consultation and instituted special services to the \"mentally retarded,\" as well as providing preschool classes, diagnostic evaluations, social and recreation activities, vocational training, counseling and public information. \n \nThe Ottingers sold the property to Barbara and Betty Buescher in 1975. \n \nJewell Pratt lived there for about a decade beginning about 1985. \n \nShe served the Jefferson City public schools as nurse for 35 years. \n \nPratt was born in 1908 to Judge John and Maude Leslie. She was a charter member of the Jefferson City Symphony Orchestra, playing both the violin and viola, and she performed with the St. Louis Symphony at the Capitol dedication in 1924. \n \nShe was among the first graduating class from Jefferson City Junior College, and she went on to become a registered nurse, working for a time in St. Louis at St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital and Nurses Home. \n \nShe married Burt Pratt, who died in 1945, leaving her to raise three children. \n \nPratt was active at First Baptist Church and involved with Missouri State Nurses' Association, Delta Kappa Gamma Educators' honorary, fellow of the American School Health Association and invited member of Royal Society of Health in London. \n \nShe left her mark on the Capital City's health by organizing health parades, an annual tradition through the mid-20th century, as well as organizing immunization clinics to vaccinate Cole County children from polio, typhoid and diphtheria. \n \nPratt also organized aid to provide eyeglasses and dental services for needy children. \n \n401 East Capitol Avenue \n \nAn \"orator of distinction, eloquent and logical in his arguments,\" according to the Missouri Bar Association, Attorney General Daniel McIntyre called 401 E. Capitol Ave. home while he argued one of the greatest legal victories for the state. \n     \nThis Jan. 25, 2017 photo shows the house at 401 East Capitol Avenue in Jefferson City. \n   \nThis Jan. 25, 2017 photo shows the house... \n \nPhoto by Julie Smith /News Tribune. \n   \nIn the famous litigation against the Hannibal and St. Joseph Railroad, McIntyre fought through the federal courts and saved the state more than $3 million. \n \nMcIntyre first arrived in Jefferson City to complete the state Senate term of Charles Hardin, newly elected governor in 1874 and under whom McIntyre had studied law in Audrain County. \n \nHe was elected in his own right to represent Audrain County in the statehouse from 1876-80. He won the statewide election to attorney general for the 1881-85 term and chose to remain in Jefferson City, where he continued his law practice, as well as serving as president of Merchants Bank. \n \nIn 1886, he was re-elected to the statehouse, this time representing Cole County until 1891. \n \nBorn in Callaway County in 1833, McIntyre was raised in Mexico and attended Westminster College, where he graduated in absentia in 1861, as he was already an officer in the Missouri State Guard. \n \nMcIntyre was elected captain of Company A in the 1st Infantry Regiment, which formed from Callaway County and saw action at Carthage and Springfield. He was severely wounded in the jaw at the Battle of Wilson's Creek. \n \nHe returned home to recuperate but was captured Dec. 19, 1861, at Blackwater River near Milford and sent to Alton Prison (Camp Chase and Johnson's Island Prison). He was exchanged at Vicksburg, Mississippi, in September 1862. \n \nAfter his release, he enlisted in the regular Confederate army, serving as a lieutenant in Company K of the 10th Regiment Missouri Cavalry under Confederate Gen. Sterling Price until the surrender at Shreveport, Louisiana. \n \nMcIntyre married Susan Simpson in Adams County, Illinois, in March 1866 and returned to Salt River near Mexico as a farmer until 1871, when he took up law. \n \nHe was elected Audrain County prosecuting attorney from 1872-74. \n \nFor about 10 years, the McIntyres called Jefferson City home. They made their mark, building the Italianate, three-story, yellow brick home at 401 E. Capitol Ave. about 1883. \n \nAfter his last term representing Cole County in the statehouse about 1891, he returned to Mexico after his war wound caused him to go blind. \n \nBy 1902, his wife, Susan, had been judged insane and was committed to the Fulton State Hospital. \n \nUpon his death in 1910, the Mexico Ledger described him as \"a man who for 40 years was active in public life in his city, county and state life, public and private, was without a blemish, and he was honored and respected for his ability and integrity.\" \n \n500 East Capitol Avenue \n \nBuilt to host prominent guests for elaborate parties, Ivy Terrace at 500 E. Capitol Ave. still retains most of its grand designs 120 years after being built by local architect Charles Opel. \n     \nThis Jan. 25, 2017 photo shows the house at 500 East Capitol Avenue in Jefferson City, better known locally as Ivy Terrace. \n   \nThis Jan. 25, 2017 photo shows the house... \n \nPhoto by Julie Smith /News Tribune. \n   \nThe striking, red home \"once served as the center of gaiety prevailing in Jefferson City and throughout the country in the 1890s,\" according to the Dec. 3, 1967, Sunday News and Tribune. \n \nThe home was built in 1893, following the election of Lon Stephens, of Boonville, to the state treasurer's office. \n \n\"Records of the period described the many parties held in the home with dancing on the third-floor ballroom and guests including state officials, prominent local residents and relatives from the Boonville area,\" the newspaper said. \n \nThe entertaining tradition began by Stephens and his wife, Maggie, continued when they sold to local druggist and civic leader Gustavus A. Fischer in 1903. The Stephens only lived in the home for three years before he was elected governor and moved into the Governor's Mansion, according to the 1990 National Register of Historic Places nomination. \n \nDistinguished by its open-air turret and extensive wrap-around porch, \"Ivy Terrace is one of the most intact Queen Anne representatives of this architectural style in Jefferson City,\" according to the Historic City of Jefferson's \"Capitol Avenue Historic District.\" \n \nIt retains eight hand-carved fireplaces complete with Italian tile, art glass windows and the grand entry oak staircase. \n \nThe national register nomination said its \"most significant characteristics are its rounded tower, wrap-around porch, high and irregular roof, fish scale shingles and asymmetrical facade.\" \n \n\"All of Opel's homes were good examples of Queen Anne style, but few have survived \u2014 Ivy Terrace is the only one substantially unaltered,\" the nomination said. \n \nMost of the \"historic east\" was influenced by Opel, a 1992 Urbana architectural survey said. \n \nHe designed several prominent buildings in town including several at Lincoln University, First Methodist Church, First Baptist Church, Second Baptist Church, the Tweedie home at 601 E. High St., parts of the Missouri State Penitentiary and other buildings in Russellville and California. \n \nBorn in 1857 to immigrants Adam and Charlotte Opel, he learned his trade from his father, a successful contractor who arrived from Bavaria in 1852. Charles Opel was a cabinet maker before going into partnership with his father in 1882. \n \nLater he partnered with another local architect, Fred Miller, with an office in Columbia by 1898 and expanded further by 1911 to offices in Kansas City and Springfield, where he partnered with his son-in-law A.N. Torbitt. \n \nOpel also was active in the community. By 1900, he was the business manager and treasurer of the Missouri Illustrated Sketch Book Company, vice president of the Commercial Club (forerunner to the Chamber of Commerce), director of the Town Mutual Fire Insurance Company, treasurer of the First Church of Christ Scientists and state president of the Single Tax League. \n \nThe Jefferson City sketchbook said he was a fluent writer and speaker, \"taking an interest in every measure to its artificial beauty, as well as other means material progress.\" \n \nOpel married Myrtle Hughes in 1881. They had eight children \u2014 six, including an adopted daughter, who were still alive in 1915 following his death due to kidney failure in Kansas City. \n \nThe Opels' teenage daughter Jessie died in 1901 when her clothing caught on fire from a lamp near where she was curling her hair. \n \nOpel's grand architectural achievement at 500 E. Capitol Ave. served the 18th state treasurer for three years. \n \nStephens, born 1855 in Boonville, was educated at Cooper Institute, Kemper Family School, and Washington and Lee University. He was appointed March 1890 by Gov. D.R. Francis to fill the term of Edward Noland and then elected in 1892. \n \nHe was elected governor in 1896 on the Free Silver platform, serving one year during which time the State Fair was established in Sedalia. \n \nIvy Terrace passed in 1903 to Gustavus and Jennie Fischer, who married in November 1889. Jennie was the granddaughter of Dr. Bernard Bruns, founder of Westphalia and pioneer physician and civic leader. \n \nIn 1887, Fischer founded the G.A. Fischer Drug Company at 105 E. High St., which he handed down to his son Clifford Hess Fischer. He also helped Fred Ott establish East End Drug at 700 E. High St. \n \nThe Fischers called Ivy Terrace home from 1903-48. Gustavus died in 1933, and Jennie remained there until her death in 1947. \n \nJefferson City \"loses one of her best known, most highly respected and successful business men, druggist and bankers,\" the Daily Capital News reported April 29, 1933. \n \nFischer graduated from the Jefferson City schools and then from the St. Louis pharmacy school. He started as clerk at J.R. Riddley Drug Store, which he later bought and renamed. \n \nIn 1902, Fischer was a \"prime mover\" in organizing the Central Missouri Trust Company, his obituary said. Upon Sam B. Cook's death in 1931, he became chairman of the board of directors. \n \n\"He inspired the Central Missouri Trust Company building and was the leading spirit and financial genius that gave Jefferson City this outstanding office and business building,\" the Capital News reported. \n \nFischer was involved in the opening of the Jefferson City Country Club in 1922 and organizing the Capitol Telephone Company at the turn of the century. \n \nMary Woods bought the home in 1948, where she operated the Mariwood College of Beauty Culture until 1966, when it was sold to Thomas Whitecotton, who lived there until about 1987 with his wife, Dee. \n \nWhitecotton \"restored the building to its original splendor,\" a 1967 Sunday News and Tribune article said. \n \nHe was one of the original members of the Missouri Highway Patrol, retiring in 1965 after 34 years. He was involved in a major gun battle with the infamous Barrow Gang in Platte County July 20, 1933, according to his 1987 obituary in the News Tribune. \n \nWhitecotton was appointed warden of the Missouri State Penitentiary and chairman of the Penal Commission in 1945. He was appointed director of the Department of Corrections in 1953. \n \nHe was born in 1905 in Ralls County, coming to Jefferson City from Monroe County. \n \nIn the community, Whitecotton served as a Ward 2 councilman and president of the Society of Retired State Highway Patrol Employees and member of Immaculate Conception Church. The current Jefferson City Police Station was named in his honor.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Mexico news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Houses in initial urban renewal plan steeped in history","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Cole","zipCode":"65101","state":"Missouri","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Jefferson City","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Jefferson City News Tribune","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"174477660","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"461"},"name":"Jefferson City News Tribune","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.newstribune.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194373645","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:14:52Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Only that we beat the Nazis, and commies were bad. And that Eisenhower was a kindly old man who smiled and waved to the camera. \n \nThen came John Kennedy. I remembered he smiled and waved. He looked serious, though, when talking about the Cuban Missile Crisis. He was on TV. Movie newsreels were on their way out. \n \nWe lived next to the Air Force base where my dad worked. I\u2019m sure the Russians had an ICBM or two aimed at it. But Kennedy was reassuring. We didn\u2019t get blown to dust. I learned later it was a very close call. \n \nOther than that, Kennedy didn\u2019t stay around long enough to make an impression. His death was shocking. In hindsight, I\u2019d say he was inspiring but fell short on accomplishments. When it came to civil rights and voting rights, Lyndon Johnson did the heavy lifting. \n \nThese are things that I appreciate now. I probably didn\u2019t at the time. His Great Society, in any case, was eclipsed by the Vietnam War. It played out every night on the evening news. The smiling and waving president had been replaced by soldiers returning in body bags. By scenes of thatched-roof villages in flames. \n \nRichard Nixon followed. The month after his election, in 1968, I attended a Doors concert in Phoenix. Jim Morrison went on something of a tirade during \u201cThe End,\u201d which has a long interlude. \n \n\u201cI hear we got a new president,\u201d he said. \u201cHe ain\u2019t done nothing wrong yet. But when he does, we\u2019re gonna get him!\u201d \n \nJim Morrison the prophet, it turned out. Six years later, facing impeachment over Watergate, Nixon resigned. Newspapers played a big role in uncovering the facts. \n \nNow, of course, we have alternative facts. And fake news. If you heard something awful about Hillary Clinton, it was probably fake news. \n \nExcept for Anthony Weiner. He wasn\u2019t fake. Too bad for Clinton. \n \nI went with her anyway. Losing, though, had its upside. \n \nI\u2019m thinking about her dogs. The day after the election Clinton took them for a walk in the woods. A walk in the woods? What more could a dog want? It\u2019s every dog\u2019s dream. And now, with Citizen Hillary, every day is a walk in the woods. \n \nTrump doesn\u2019t have dogs, as far as I know. If he did, they\u2019d probably be golden retrievers. They\u2019re nice dogs. And they wouldn\u2019t clash with the new drapes. Which, I understand, are gold. Or gold colored. So I heard on NPR. \n \nAnd Trump would always be gold in his dog\u2019s eyes. His dog would love his alternative facts \u2014 like the massive fraud Trump said deprived him of the popular vote. \n \nWho\u2019s to say 5 million dead people didn\u2019t claw their way out of the ground on Nov. 8 and head to the polls? And maybe stop for a few brains along the way. \n \nMost people might roll their eyes. But Trump would always have his dog\u2019s vote. I think he\u2019d name his dog Midas. \n \nTrump could give Midas a pat. \u201cWho\u2019s the greatest jobs president God ever created?\u201d \n \nYou know what the dog\u2019s thinking: \u201cYou are! You are! You\u2019re the greatest! The greatest ever! I\u2019m hungry!\u201d \n \nThat\u2019s why I have dogs. They like you no matter how bad your day was. And presidents are going to have some bad days, to be sure. So Trump could follow in Bill Clinton\u2019s and Obama\u2019s footsteps. \n \nThey didn\u2019t need Fox News to show the love. They had Buddy and Bo. \n \n\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n \nReach contributing writer Bill Coates at bccoates@cox.net .","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Coates: Bumper stickers, Jim Morrison and Hillary\u2019s dogs \u2014 but I digress","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Pinal Central","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"612808623","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"Pinal Central","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.pinalcentral.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194374004","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:45:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:14:52Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

They have never been good about managing money. They are both retired now and on a fixed income, and they have been asking me or one of my four adult siblings for money to help with their bills each month. \n \nI don\u2019t mind giving, but recently my siblings and I have become annoyed because, while they continue to ask for money, at the same time they are also taking short trips, which include hotels and rental cars, and inviting friends out to dinner. \n \nThey also have a storage locker full of junk that eats up several hundred dollars a month. We have offered to help them clean out the locker, and possibly make money from some of the items in there, but they never commit. Should my siblings and I continue to help, or should we put our collective feet down? \u2014 ANNOYED IN ALAMEDA, CALIF. \n \nDEAR ANNOYED: Put your collective feet down. You and your siblings are good children, but it\u2019s time for an intervention. Before giving your parents more money, you should all sit down with them and help them to create a budget, taking into account their fixed income and what you children can afford as a supplement. Then tell your parents they must live within that budget. Period. Their expenses must be trimmed, and the storage unit would be an excellent place to start. \n \nDEAR ABBY: How do you discourage someone\u2019s friendliness without being rude? \n \nAn elderly man recently moved in with his family in our neighborhood. He roams the neighborhood and approaches anyone he sees to introduce himself and start a conversation. He doesn\u2019t seem to have dementia, as he knows where and who he is, but his behavior is a little odd (such as asking for the precise spelling of everyone\u2019s first name). \n \nUnfortunately, now that he has met my husband and me, he comes up and knocks on the door to chat \u2014 weekdays, evenings, weekends. The last time I was outside with my three kids, he approached with a stack of photos and proceeded to show me at least 100 prints of a trip he had taken abroad \u2014 10 years ago. \n \nI feel trapped because I don\u2019t want to be mean to an old man, but I dread seeing him stroll down the road. What is the best way to deal with this situation? \u2014 WANTING TO WITHDRAW \n \nDEAR WANTING: The poor man is probably lonely and looking for human contact. Because you are not prepared to engage in his \u201cneighborly\u201d conversations, the next time he strolls by, tell him that you do not have time to chat right now. If he knocks on your door, tell him that you are busy or that you will be leaving shortly. And suggest to him that he may want to find a senior center so that he can make friends with contemporaries and won\u2019t feel so isolated. \n \n\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n  \nDear Abby is written by Abigail Van Buren, also known as Jeanne Phillips, and was founded by her mother, Pauline Phillips.

Why can\u2019t we move on, and let President Trump govern. Here is my answer.Want to know why I am so angry that Trump is now our president? First and foremost, it has nothing to do with Hillary, Bernie, or any third party candidate. This has nothing to do with Republican, Democrat, or Independent. Just get that out of your head right now.I am angry because my friends, people I care about, people I thought I knew voted for a vile disgusting human being. It has nothing to do with policy, and everything to do with the man himself. If Trump had run as a Democrat, and agreed with me on every single policy position\u2014I would not have voted for him based on character alone.He has mocked the disabled, and the handicapped. He was endorsed by the KKK. He ran on a platform of division and hate. He has an avowed racist on his staff, Steve Bannon, who has allowed Breitbart to be used as an outlet for \u201calt-right\u201d propaganda. I have no doubt in my mind that Trump is a racist. It bothers me that my friends voted for a racist. There is no defense for that.He treats women as objects; you actually voted for a man who said that he could grab a woman by the pussy, he said this while his wife and newborn son were at home in New York. Better candidates have lost races for lesser things. He is a misogynist.

Emboldened by their slim electoral win in the form of popular vote loser Donald Trump, conservative extremists are chomping at the bit and frothing at the mouth at the thought of eliminating research that might produce inconvenient facts, and going full Lysenko on the rest. And when we say science is under assault, what we really mean is scientists, and by extension, all of the rest of us who depend on their work. There may be a science-based demonstration in the early stages of planning:We have not settled on a date yet but will do so as quickly as possible and announce it here. Although this will start with a march, we hope to use this as a starting point to take a stand for science in politics. Slashing funding and restricting scientists from communicating their findings with the public is absurd and cannot be allowed to stand as policy. This is a non-partisan issue that reaches far beyond people in the STEM fields and should concern anyone who values empirical research and science. There are also organizations already up and running that protect science and foster an open, progressive atmosphere. We\u2019re going to need them and more. Because here\u2019s just a few highlights of Trumpco\u2019s first few days in office:Trump admin officials initially decreed that EPA climate science pages would be \u201cscrubbed.\u201d After that was leaked, they appeared to back off. But no one really knows what to do because the Trump administration is, so far, mostly incompetent when it comes setting and implementing even the most basic policy.At NASA there has been no direction, no suggestions, no policy forthcoming of any sort. The new administration stumbled badly over crowd size photos and estimates, allegedly due to Trump\u2019s own raging insecurities. When Trump lashed out via surrogates to the National Park Service, rogue Twitter accounts popped up roasting him even more.More rogue science Twitter accounts then followed suit. The barely announced science march skyrocketed in two days to almost million followers.There is resistance in this nation, a sort of vicious, national immune response to a foreign pathogen invading the body politic. It is already huge, it is at every level and in every community, and it is growing. Join it.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"This week in science: science marches on?","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Broward","zipCode":"33021","state":"Florida","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Hollywood","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"5","name":"DailyMe.Com","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"443216558","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"DailyMe.Com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://dailyme.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194376567","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T02:45:25Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:14:54Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

You do it fast. You do it while people still think traditions have meaning. You do it while people still expect policies to be followed. You do it while people still believe that institutions have value. And if it takes coming in on a weekend to erase democracy \u2026 you make that sacrifice.On Friday, Donald Trump signed an executive order abruptly cutting off travel from seven predominantly Muslim nations. But Trump\u2019s order avoided nations where he does business as well as those that were home to the 9/11 terrorists. If the religious bigotry wasn\u2019t obvious enough, Trump followed up by making it clear that Christian refugees get special treatment while Muslims are left behind\u2014a blatant violation of the first amendment.Trump\u2019s order was so poorly planned and executed that the result wasn\u2019t just clearly immoral, it was also confused and chaotic. With not just refugees, but ordinary immigrants, including many who were already working in the United States, caught up in the misrule.Watching not just US policy, but the last grains of the nation\u2019s moral standing scrawled away with Trump\u2019s bigoted order didn't bother Republicans. Who found they had something to say on every topic \u2014 except that of families torn apart, legal immigrants stranded in airports, and people who had put their lives on the line to serve with the United States being denied the admission they were promised. But Democratic legislators did come forward and continue to speak out against Trump\u2019s \u201cxenophobic\u201d order and in defense of the people trapped between two worlds by a regime that would rather frighten Americans with the boogeyman of nonexistent danger than uphold the values that truly made America great.As Trump signed a new brace of executive orders , Trump was asked about his Muslim ban. His response was to deny that it is a Muslim ban and also to deny the evidence of world-snarling f*ck up visible on every television screen.And above all this was a reminder to Democrats that there is no nominee, no policy, no subject on which they should support Trump.I\u2019ll say it this way: Trump is a madman with delusions of tyranny. Every vote for him, no matter how innocuous, is one step closer to his dystopian fascist America. ","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Religion news","group":"Society"}],"title":"And on the 7th day, Trump violated the first amendment prohibitions against a state religion","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Broward","zipCode":"33021","state":"Florida","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Hollywood","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"5","name":"DailyMe.Com","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"443216558","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"DailyMe.Com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://dailyme.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194376975","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T01:30:25Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:14:54Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Darweesh spent a decade working for the United States military in Iraq as an interpreter and engineer and had been granted an entry visa after background checks; Alshawi had been granted a visa in order to join his wife and son who are already permanent residents of the US after their similar service with the US military.xJudge: \"Class is pretty well defined as outline in the papers - otherwise would be reviewing stays for a hundred people\" so stay is national\u2014 Jackie Vimo January 29, 2017x4 factors have been met: Irreparable harm established, likelihood of success on merits, no harm to govt.

There's a very strong nexus between our immigration and visa programs and terrorist plots and extremist networks inside the United States,\" the official continued. \"Look at the recent, high-profile attacks that have occurred inside the country -- an immigration nexus is not at all uncommon. I won't go through the list of them all now. One obvious example would be Tashfeen Malik and the San Bernadino incident with the K1 visa.\" \n\nA K1 visa is a non-immigrant visa issued to the foreign-citizen fiance of a US citizen. Tashfeen Malik was from a family of wealthy landowners in Pakistan and later moved to Saudi Arabia with her immediate family. Her husband, Syed Rizwan Farook, was a US citizen. \n\nPakistan and Saudi Arabia, however, are not on the list of countries subject to the new ban. \n\nThe administration is facing criticism from leaders in the U.S. and around the world for taking steps their critics say are unconstitutional and anti-American. \n\nThe second mention of San Bernardino came when the official was trying to explain why there was no grace period before the executive order went into effect, to help ease implementation. \n\n\"Imagine if this had been an executive order that had been contemplated the day before the San Bernardino shooter entered the United States?\" the official asked. \"Would have delaying its implementation served the best interests of the country? The reality is we don't know who the next individual is who will exploit our immigration programs successfully. If you choose that something is necessary to do for the sake of national security, it should be done immediately.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Inland Empire news","group":"US regional"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Trump official incorrectly justifies travel ban","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Shasta","zipCode":"96001","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Redding","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"KRCR-TV","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"187807149","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"11"},"name":"KRCR-TV","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Politics","Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.krcrtv.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194377638","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:11:06Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:14:57Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://static.lakana.com/bmg-global-us-east-1/photo/2016/04/06/Farook%20and%20Malik%20together_36804152_5747184_ver1.0.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his first Mann ki Baat this year, focused on students set to appear in the Boards and other competitive examinations across the country. The PM, in his address, urged the students to focus their time only on studies. He encouraged them to treat exams like festivals, adding that if the students take exams as a pleasure activity, there will be no pressure on them. He asked parents to create an atmosphere of festival in the house. The PM said proper rest, adequate sleep and physical activity are the three requirements for a student at the time of exams. He insisted parents should mentor their children to be part of society. They should accept their children as they are instead of comparing and asking them to be like others.\n\nThe top quotes from his speech-\n\n# You should not run after marks. You should strive to gain knowledge.\n\n# If your mission and ambition are in sync, marks will follow.\n\n# Compete with yourself rather than others, it will give you confidence.\n\n# Mentor children to be part of society. Accept them the way they are.\n\n# Proper rest, adequate sleep, physical activity are the three essential requirements during exams.\n\n# Some people spend all their time in finding out ways to cheat. If they cheat what will they teach their children. Students should focus on studies.\n\n# The exams that you\u2019ll give are a test of this year not of a lifetime. Exams are not a benchmark of your success in life.\n\n# When you are relaxed, the recall value will be more; Relaxation is the best tonic for memory\n\n# Smile more, score more\n\n# Exam is like a festival. If the students take pleasure in exams there will be no pressure.

The defence counsel representing Salman Khan in the infamous poaching case here, has claimed that he received a death threat from an \u201cinternational gangster\u201d for getting the film star \u201cacquitted\u201d in the case. H M Saraswat claimed two days ago, the caller, identifying himself as an international gangster, threatened him for getting Khan \u201cacquitted\u201d in the Arms Act case, saying \u201che was not happy with it\u201d. According to Saraswat, the caller asked him \u201cto be ready to face dire consequences and none could save him\u201d. Saraswat filed a complaint with the police and has been provided an armed policeman as security. \u201cWe have provided him the armed policeman for his security and have started investigating the matter,\u201d Police Commissioner Ashok Rathore said. Saraswat claimed the same person had called Khan and demanded \u201cprotection money\u201d which the actor refused.\n\nMeanwhile, denying every report of their rift, long-time friends Ajay Devgn and Salman Khan are at it again. Salman recently dropped in to surprise Ajay and director Milan Luthria on the sets of the upcoming movie Baadshaho. Salman, who was in Jodhpur to record his statement for the black buck poaching case along with Saif Ali Khan, Sonali Bendre and Tabu, took time off from the court proceedings and visited Ajay during the shoot. Director Milan Luthria took to twitter to share the picture of the duo, saying, \u201cBoth the sultans on the sets of #BAADSHAHO @BeingSalmanKhan @ajaydevgn\u201d. Also Read: Reports of a fallout between Salman and Ajay started when Salman signed Akshay Kumar for a film and happened to borrow the same plot as Devgn\u2019s Sons Of Sardaar.

Maruti Suzuki India has quietly discontinued sales of lower variants of its premier crossover S-Cross featuring 1.6 litre diesel engine, due to low demand. The company is now selling only the top-end Alpha variant of the vehicle featuring 1.6 litre diesel engine, priced at Rs 12.03 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi), from its premium retail channel Nexa. MSI, however, continues to sell all the three variants of the crossover powered by a smaller 1.3 litre diesel engine. These are priced between Rs 8.78 lakh and Rs 10.63 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi. When contacted a MSI spokesperson told PTI: \u201cIn this segment (1.6 litre engine), customers go for highest trim that has all the features. Therefore, it is business prudence to keep the number of variants at an optimum level in line with customers requirements.\u201d The model\u2019s performance is in line with the company\u2019s expectation, the spokesperson added.\n\n\u201cWe started a new segment called premium crossover with S Cross. Volume-wise, S-Cross continues to do an average of 2,000-2,100 units monthly,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nS-Cross, the first model from the stable of MSI to be sold through its premium retail chain NEXA, has had a chequered history.\n\nMSI had introduced the S-Cross in two options of 1.6 litre and 1.3 litre engines in 2015 coinciding with the launch of its premium retail outlet chain Nexa. However, pricing issues hindered sales of the vehicle forcing the company to go for price correction.\n\nLast year, the company had cut price of the vehicle by over Rs 2 lakh. The reduction in the price of 1.6 litre variant was Rs 2,05,000 for all the three trims, while that of 1.3 litre variant ranged from Rs 40,000 to Rs 66,000.\n\nS-Cross along with Vitara Brezza have helped the company enhance its market share in the utility vehicle (UV) segment.\n\nWhile Vitara Brezza has been a runaway hit, S-Cross has been a slow starter for the company.\n\nAcknowledging the fact, the spokesperson said: \u201cEvery brand has a specific role in the overall portfolio. While some are mass models that sell in big numbers, others may not sell as much as a mass model but contribute to the overall brand objectives of the company for the medium and long term\u201d.\n\nS-Cross helps Maruti Suzuki in expanding its range and presence with an eye on the future, the spokesperson added.\n\nGrowth in the UV segment for MSI is over 120 per cent for the April-December period this fiscal. Volume wise the company has sold 1,43,254 units during the April-December period as compared to 63,924 units in the previous fiscal.\n\nThe company now commands over 65 per cent market share in the total UV segment.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Maruti discontinues sale of lower variants of S-Cross","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"Indian Express","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169660698","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"351"},"name":"Indian Express","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["AutomobilesComponents","Industrials","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.indianexpress.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194386013","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:04:59Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:14:59Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://images.indianexpress.com/2015/07/maruti-suzuki-s-cross480.jpg?w=480"},{"url":"http://images.indianexpress.com/2015/07/maruti-suzuki-s-cross480.jpg?w=450"}],"video":[]}}

Led by seniors Luke Seber and Luke Smith, Monrovia charged out of the gate and didn't look back claiming a 67-53 victory over the visiting Edgewood Mustangs.\n\nNow, for the first time in recent memory, the team sits above the .500 mark going into February action.\n\nA big part of that accomplishment comes from the efforts of Coach Kyle Swafford in his first year.\n\nSwafford was elated with his team's effort after the game saying, \u201cAt this time of year, I couldn't be happier with our effort. We played 10 kids and every single one of them goes in and competes\u201d\n\nOf those 10, Luke Seber had the most dominant performance against a worthy Edgewood frontcourt. Despite fouling out midway through the fourth period, Seber notched 22 points, including a pair of 3\u2019s. Trailing Seber was his counterpart in Luke Smith who recorded 21 points. The two combined to shoot 15-18 from the free throw stripe, 11 of which came from Smith alone.\n\nThe sophomore Max Newman got into the action with 11 points, but it was his protection at the rim that paid dividends for his teammates on the other end of the floor. Senior Sam Whitaker accounted for four and guards Zach Cottrell, Brock Stader, and Jaylen Sprague rounded out the scoring with a basket each.\n\nThe Bulldogs got off to a hot start as forwards Luke Seber and Sam Whitaker went work in the paint offensively. The duo combined for all 15 first quarter points.\n\nBut it was Monrovia\u2019s relentless perimeter defense that stood out in the early going. The Bulldogs were able to hold Edgewood without a field goal until the 2:30 mark of the 1st quarter. After Monrovia jumped out to a 13-1 lead, the Mustangs responded with a seven point run cutting the Bulldogs lead to 15-8 after the first quarter.\n\nThe Bulldogs continued to look to the paint for offense in the second quarter. Sophomore Max Newman took the feed from Zach Cottrell to the square for quick bucket. On the ensuing possession the Edgewood Capitalized on a defensive lapse by the Bulldogs to claim a basket of their own. With Seber on the bench in foul trouble, Edgewood continued to chip away at Monrovia\u2019s lead. On the final possession of the half the Mustangs\u2019 Joe Kido took the inbounds pass from basket to basket beating the buzzer to cut Monrovia\u2019s lead to just three.\n\nThe Bulldogs came out of the break with the same tenacity with which they began the game. Luke Smith stayed active on defense creating problems for Edgewood\u2019s offense. Smith recorded 19 of his 21 points in the second half alone, including 7 straight to start the final period.\n\nThe Bulldogs defense had some letdowns in the second half, but their \u201cbend not break\u201d approach allowed them to maintain control from start to finish. Edgewood struggled to find open looks and when they did the out stretched arms of Max Newman and Luke Seber were constantly closing in.\n\n\u201cThey rally around each other. If one guy slips up he knows he'll have help behind him. And that's exactly what we look for. I trust all 10 of them, and this time of year is when it means the most.\u201d, Swafford said in closing.\n\nThe Bulldogs play again next Thursday against Greencastle at Branch McCracken Memorial Gymnasium with tip off at 7","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Jack Atwell"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest scores","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Bulldogs boys stomp Mustangs, 67-53","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Morgan","zipCode":"46151","state":"Indiana","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Martinsville","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Martinsville Reporter-Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169665162","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Martinsville Reporter-Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://reporter-times.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194388561","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:15:01Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/reporter-times.com/content/tncms/custom/image/7d384d9e-2b1f-11e5-b573-6b82e880093f.png?_dc=1436984995"}],"video":[]}}

But it's not clear the measures will help prevent attacks on American soil, and they could wind up emboldening extremists who already view the U.S. as at war with Islam. \n \nRecent acts of deadly extremist violence have been carried out either by U.S. citizens or by individuals whose families weren't from the nations singled out. And the list of countries in Trump's order doesn't include Saudi Arabia, where most of the September 11 hijackers were from, or other places with a more direct link to terrorism in America. \n \nThe admissions ban announced Friday also does not directly address a more urgent law enforcement concern: homegrown violent extremists already in the United States who plot their attacks without any overseas connections or contacts. \n \n\"The primary terrorism-related threat facing the U.S. today comes from individuals living here who become inspired by what they see on the internet, who carry out attacks independent of any terrorist organization,\" said John Cohen, a former Department of Homeland Security counter-terrorism official who worked in government under Democratic and Republican administrations and who has been involved in refugee vetting policy. \n \nThe FBI has for years been concerned by the prospect of airplane bomb plots and terrorists dispatched from overseas to commit violence in America. But the ascendancy of the Islamic State, and the group's ability through slick and easily accessible propaganda to reach susceptible young Americans in all corners of the country, has been a more immediate challenge - and a more realistic danger - for counterterrorism officials than any threat posed by refugees from abroad. \n \n\"Dealing with that threat should be a top priority for this administration,\" Cohen said. \n \nThe executive order suspends refugee admissions for 120 days and bars all immigration for 90 days from Muslim-majority countries with terrorism concerns: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. \n \nIt indefinitely bars the processing of refugees from Syria, a country that's been of particular country to the FBI even though the number of Americans who have looked to travel there to fight with the Islamic State has been dwindling. \n \nBut the culprits of recent deadly terror attacks aren't linked to the countries singled out by Trump's order. \n \nOmar Mateen, the man responsible for the Orlando nightclub shooting, the deadliest terror attack in the U.S. since the Sept. 11 attacks, was born in New York to Afghan parents. \n \nSyed Rizwan Farook, who took part in the December 2015 San Bernardino attack, was born in Chicago. His wife, Tashfeen Malik, had been living in Pakistan and visiting family in Saudi Arabia before she passed the background check and entered the U.S. \n \nThe brothers who bombed the Boston Marathon were ethnic Chechens who had been living in the U.S. \n \nIn general, Islamic extremists have accounted for a minuscule amount of the roughly 240,000 murders since Sept. 11, 2001, said Charles Kurzman, a sociology professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. \n \nKurzman said his research identified zero fatalities since Sept. 11 caused by extremists from the seven nations in Trump's order. He said people with ancestry from those countries have accounted for only a small fraction of extremist-related arrests and disrupted plots during the same time period. \n \n\"I can only conclude that this is whipping up fear and hostility toward Americans who have family background from these countries,\" Kurzman said. \n \nStill, while refugees are subject to screening - including in-person interviews, checks with law enforcement databases and collection of biometric data, when available - the process is not perfect. \n \nFBI counterterrorism officials have long expressed concern about the lack of background information about refugees from Syria, a home base of the Islamic State, and Director James Comey has said that he could not guarantee a mistake-free vetting process. \n \nThere have been isolated incidents of refugees later accused in terror-related plots. \n \nAn Iraqi refugee who entered the U.S. in 2009, for instance, pleaded guilty in Houston in October to attempting to provide material support to the Islamic State. Two Iraqi refugees who lived in Kentucky are now in prison after having been convicted in a plot to send sniper rifles, Stinger missiles and money to al-Qaida operatives waging an insurgency back home. \n \nAnd the man accused in the November car-and-knife that injured 11 people at Ohio State University was a refugee originally from Somalia who, as an adolescent, moved with his family to the United States in 2014 after living in Pakistan. \n \nThough not immune from lapses, the screening process has improved over the years, Cohen said. He said he was concerned that the refugee ban could deter Muslim-majority countries from cooperating with the U.S. on policy matters and could embolden an extremist already bent on violence. \n \n\"That's something,\" Cohen said, \"that law enforcement folks are going to be factoring into their violence prevention efforts.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Trump shuts door on refugees, but will the US be safer?","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Deccan Chronicle","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169673440","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"137"},"name":"Deccan Chronicle","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Global","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.deccanchronicle.com/"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194390835","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:15:03Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The latter was not only the tournament\u2019s top seed at 170 pounds; he also was Indiana Mat\u2019s top-ranked wrestler at that weight.\n\nThat win propelled Eli Stock into the championship match, where he controlled the tempo en route to an 8-2 decision of Center Grove junior Jonah Hays.\n\n\u201cI have a huge target on my back now,\u201d said Eli Stock, now 31-1 on the season. \u201cThere are still some things I need to work on. I can\u2019t slow down.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Ethan Stock pushed the tournament\u2019s top-seeded wrestler, Mappes Gleason of Center Grove, to the limit, building a 2-0 lead before Gleason rallied for a 3-2 decision in the final 30 seconds and first place at 160 pounds.\n\n\u201cHe definitely sparked me up,\u201d Ethan Stock said of Eli. \u201cWatching my brother beat the No. 1 wrestler in the state was an accomplishment for both of us.\u201d\n\nMonrovia coach Kevin Blundell was not surprised.\n\n\u201cThe biggest match was Eli beating Burk,\u201d Blundell said. \u201cWith the work ethic Eli and Ethan both have, I knew I would see results.\u201d\n\nAs a result of those results, Eli Stock will take a No. 1 seed into the Feb. 4 IHSAA sectional, again in Mooresville\u2019s Curry Center Gymnasium. Ethan takes a record of 26-4 and a second seed to the regional.\n\nIt was a pretty darned good day for the Bulldogs.\n\nDespite hailing from the smallest school in the 10-team tournament, the Bulldogs totaled 126.5 points to place fifth.\n\nCenter Grove won it all with 197.5 points, followed by Indian Creek at 153.5, Franklin at 136.5, Plainfield at 134, Monrovia, Greenwood at 105, Martinsville at 95, Mooresville at 77.5 and Decatur Central at 44.\n\nJunior Brycen Denny, 35-6 this year and a state qualifier last season, finished second to unbeaten Indian Creek senior Alex Mosconi when Mosconi managed a 3-0 decision in the championship match.\n\nThere appeared to be some controversy when the official awarded Denny a takedown for a 2-1 lead in the second period, but the official then waved off his decision, noting that Denny was unable to maintain his grip.\n\nAlso finishing second was Monrovia\u2019s Mr. Football, senior Camryn Smith. He pinned his way the title tilt at 182 before falling 8-1 to top-seeded Jake Moore of Franklin. Smith takes a 29-4 record to regionals.\n\nGarrison Lee will take a 32-13 record and a second seed at 220 pounds to the regional.\n\nThe Monrovia senior, ranked 12th, battled to the championship match, where third-ranked and unbeaten Clayton Scroggs of Martinsville posted a 7-2 decision.\n\nMonrovia wrestled without 285-pound veteran Riley McCubbins, lost to a shoulder injury and subsequent surgery.\n\nThe top four finishers in each weight advanced to the regional tournament.\n\nBut other wrestlers, including four Bulldogs, made their marks as well.\n\nFreshman Hunter Rutherford, 20-9, took fifth at 113 pounds, winning his final match by injury default.\n\nJunior Austin Clark followed suit, taking fifth at 138 with a spectacular comeback. Clark trailed Plainfield sophomore Gage Jacobs 10-6 with time running out in the third period, but scored a reverse and a near fall to force the match into overtime. There, he took Jacobs to the mat to score a tie-breaking two points and complete his season at 19-15.\n\n\u201cWe told him to finish his season with a victory, and he came back and got it,\u201d noted Blundell.\n\nFreshman Jake Smith, 8-13, finished sixth at 106 pounds.\n\nSophomore Clay Whitney, 23-11, was sidelined by injury in the fifth-place match at 195.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Steve Page"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest scores","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Taking Stock: Twins go 1-2 in sectional","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Morgan","zipCode":"46151","state":"Indiana","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Martinsville","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Martinsville Reporter-Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169665162","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Martinsville Reporter-Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://reporter-times.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194395141","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:15:07Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/reporter-times.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/2/4b/24bd729c-e98d-5a30-b6b9-c5c121e1fa3d/588d69bca7c7f.image.jpg?resize=300%2C167"},{"url":"http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/reporter-times.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/2/4b/24bd729c-e98d-5a30-b6b9-c5c121e1fa3d/588d69bca7c7f.image.jpg?resize=800%2C446"}],"video":[]}}

Throw a chair, a shoe (at him), he\u2019s going to shoot it.\u201d \n \nBut there once was a time where Speights wouldn\u2019t drift beyond the 3-point line, a place once reserved for the league\u2019s guards. \n \nBut when Steve Kerr got hired to coach the Golden State Warriors and Speights, he decided to see if the 6-foot-10 big man had a little Larry Bird in him. \n \n\u201cI went to him and said, \u2018Do you think you could take one more step out and become a 3-point shooter?\u201d Kerr remembered. \u201cI watched a ton of tape of him when I got the job and he was making one 22-footer after another. He was a pick-and-pop guy. He had a big Game 7 against the Clippers the previous year and had 10 or 12 points in limited minutes and hit some huge shots. But, he was never outside of that line. \n \n\u201cI just asked him what he thought.\u201d \n \nIn the first year after they spoke, Speights actually took 13 fewer 3\u2019s than he did the season before. But last year, his second with Kerr, Speights launched 62 3\u2019s \u2013 a new career high. And after making 38.7 percent of them, he signed with Clippers and got the greenest of lights. \n \nPrior to Saturday\u2019s game back in Oakland, Speights had taken 166 3-point shots \u2014 more than he attempted over his entire career. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s been natural for him,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cThree\u2019s aren\u2019t a hard shot for him. You can see it. It\u2019s a natural shot. ... Telling Mo to shoot is not that hard to do.\u201d \n \nThe increased volume hasn\u2019t come with a dip in efficiency, with Speights making over 40 percent from deep this year. \n \n\u201cI think he spent a lot of time in that offseason two summers ago, really working on his 3-point shot. He just seemed to get more comfortable with it last year, and this year, he\u2019s automatic.\u201d \n DJ an \u2018automatic\u2019 All-Star  \nPrior to DeAndre Jordan turning in kind of a stinker Saturday night, the Warriors\u2019 head coach sure made it seem like he voted to include Jordan on the Western Conference All-Star team. \n \n\u201cHe absolutely deserved it,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cHe was, to me, one of the automatics when you consider what he does night in and night out.\u201d \n \nKerr said he loves the way the Clippers\u2019 defensive-minded center plays. \n \n\u201cWe used to always say you know guys of value on the other team, offensively or defensively,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cThere are certain guys who you know bother your team when they\u2019re on the floor. When D.J. is on the floor, he bothers the other team.\u201d \n \n Quick hits  \nDoc Rivers continues to battle an undiagnosed illness. \u201cIt\u2019s hasn\u2019t been fun,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been three weeks now, so it\u2019s not been a fun stretch. I\u2019ll get through it. I just want to find out what the hell it is to be honest.\u201d ...

The quarterback attended several camp and felt he was on the cusp of making his decision when Brohm and much of his staff replaced Darrell Hazell at Purdue. \n \nThe coaching staff stayed in contact with Northern, and on Friday Brohm visited Northern\u2019s high school. Northern said the move is ideal in a lot of ways because he\u2019ll be able to get in-state tuition and be just 180 miles from home on I-65. \n \n\"It was the perfect move once they moved there,\" Northern said. \"It just set things up.\u201d \n \nPurdue currently has five quarterback on its spring football roster.

Marilyn van Dijk, a veterinary assistant, kept treats in Meyer's hands or in front of the dog at all times.\n\nHe'd forget that he had a bum leg, put his paw down and reach around for the treat.\n\nMeyer, keeping hold on Tigger via a harness, cooed in the dog's ear: \"I've got you. I've got you.\"\n\nAnd then Tigger relaxed. He'd move his front paws forward as if on automatic pilot. Walk, walk, walk.\n\nMeyer moved up the speed on the treadmill, and Tigger walked, walked, walked some more, as if he's been doing it his entire young life.\n\nExcept he hasn't.\n\nTigger has never walked or run on four legs like most canines.\n\nHe has jumped like a kangaroo on his hind two legs or inched forward on his belly. But he has never kept up with his foster parents' other dogs because his front two legs were congenitally deformed by a defect called ectrodactyly, or split hand or lobster claw.\n\nThese days, Meyer has him on the underwater treadmill and doing planks on a large plastic peanut to help develop callouses on the limb and strengthen his core to protect his other limbs. He hopes to introduce the dog to cavalletti exercises (small jumps) soon to help him further strengthen his muscles and improve his balance.\n\n\"He's been compensating his whole life, so we take this slow,\" Meyer said.\n\nTigger weighs slightly more than his optimal weight of 55 pounds, said his surgeon, Dr. Jennifer Warnock. The physical therapy sessions may help with that.\n\nDr. Warnock hopes to perform the second repair surgery on Tigger's other front leg at the end of March. But Good and her partner, Troy Riggs, have some fundraising to do first. When the Statesman Journal first broke Tigger's story last summer and it spread across the country through the USA Today Network and The Huffington Post, more than $17,000 was raised in a few weeks.\n\nMore than $10,000 was spent on Tigger's first surgery, ICU stay, bandaging needs, and his medication. At least $2,000 or $3,000 still needs to be raised to pay for this next round of surgery, which will repair the second front limb and fuse one portion of the other newly fashioned leg. Dr. Warnock expects Tigger's condition to regress a bit as he recovers from the second surgery, but she's cautiously optimistic the dog could be walking on both front legs by summer.\n\nTigger may or may not need prosthetics. His X-rays currently show bone fusion, which is excellent, Warnock said. If his therapy continues to help him develop callouses where he never had them before, she believes the prognosis to be very good.\n\n\"We want to get him functioning without pain,\" Warnock said. \"I want him jumping on the couch, something most dogs take for granted. But Tigger does not.\"\n\nNow about those treats ...","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"CAROL MCALICE CURRIEStatesman Journal"},"topics":[],"title":"Tigger starts water therapy as leg improves","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Stanislaus","zipCode":"95350","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Modesto","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Modesto Bee","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657476","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"584"},"name":"Modesto Bee","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.modbee.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://stjr.nl/2iLOWc1","http://stjr.nl/2iLOWc1).But"],"sequenceId":"695194398201","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:06:04Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:15:08Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.modbee.com/static/images/modbee/facebook.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Scientists, have identified a brain hormone that can trigger fat burning in the gut.\n\nResearchers from The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) in the US found a brain hormone that specifically and selectively stimulates fat metabolism, without any effect on food intake. The findings, published in the journal Nature Communications, in animal models could have implications for future pharmaceutical development.\n\n\u201cThis was basic science that unlocked an interesting mystery,\u201d said senior author Supriya Srinivasan, an Indian origin researcher and a member of the TSRI. The researchers experimented with roundworms called C. elegans, which are often used as model organisms in biology.\n\nWhat else is making news These worms have simpler metabolic systems than humans, but their brains produce many of the same signaling molecules, leading many researchers to believe that findings in C. elegans may be relevant for humans. They deleted genes in C. elegans to see if they could interrupt the path between brain serotonin and fat burning.\n\nThis process of elimination led them to a gene that codes for a neuropeptide hormone named FLP-7 (pronounced \u201cflip 7\u201d). They found that the mammalian version of FLP-7 (called Tachykinin) had been identified 80 years ago as a peptide that triggered muscle contractions when dribbled on pig intestines. The next step in the new study was to determine how FLP-7 was directly linked to serotonin levels in the brain.\n\nThe study revealed that FLP-7 was, indeed, secreted from neurons in the brain in response to elevated serotonin levels. FLP-7 then travels through the circulatory system to start the fat burning process in the gut.\n\nThe newly discovered fat-burning pathway works like this \u2014 a neural circuit in the brain produces serotonin in response to sensory cues, such as food availability. This signals another set of neurons to begin producing FLP-7 and then activates a receptor in intestinal cells and the intestines begin turning fat into energy.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Now, a hormone in brain that can trigger fat burning: Study","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"Indian Express","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169660698","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"351"},"name":"Indian Express","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Health","Lifestyle","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.indianexpress.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194398754","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:07:47Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:15:09Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://images.indianexpress.com/2017/01/weight-watch_480_thinkstockphotos-599109418.jpg?w=480"},{"url":"http://images.indianexpress.com/2017/01/weight-watch_480_thinkstockphotos-599109418.jpg?w=450"}],"video":[]}}

We have a break for cookies and coffee on practice nights, once a week. I have made homemade cookies for our break for more than 25 years. \n \nIn May, we have an outdoor concert. I have brought cookies each year for after our performance. This year, one of the newer band members asked me if I had \"rat poison\" in them! \n \nI was shocked and asked him to repeat what he said to make sure I heard correctly! His response, \"It was just a joke.\" I don't understand this type of humor. I have continued to make cookies for the band, but I think about his comment each week. \n \nShall I continue to make cookies for our breaks in 2017? \n \n\u2014 Shocked on the West Coast \n \nDear Shocked: People sometimes make awkward and, unfortunately, unkind comments, because another person's generosity makes them uncomfortable. \n \nThis person immediately tried to reassure you that he was making a \"joke.\" This comment was not funny in any context, so it can't be characterized as a joke, but I hope you will forgive his graceless reaction to you. \n \nI raise a toast to all of the generous bakers who bring in treats to share with others. It is a very kind, sweet and generous impulse, and sharing these treats helps to bring others together. Don't let this person's sarcasm ruin this sweetness for you \u2014 or the rest of your ensemble. \n \nDear Amy: Is there a polite way to respond when you are in a room with someone who has \u2014 or is getting over \u2014 a cold, who coughs or sneezes all over the place without bothering to cover up? \n \nI've gotten sick twice this winter and both times it was a day or two after being around someone who is too inconsiderate to cover their mouth when they cough or sneeze. I know I can't be sure that the colds came from these people, but I'm betting they were the cause. \n \nI travel to people's homes for my job and usually spend two to three hours there, so when I am sick, I reschedule to prevent spreading anything. \n \nI don't want to be a jerk. But at the same time, rescheduling an appointment costs me a few hundred dollars. \n \nDo you have any suggestions on how to get my message across politely? \n \n\u2014 Worried \n \nDear Worried: It is common courtesy to cover one's mouth when coughing or sneezing; school children are now taught to cover their mouths with the inside of their elbows, instead of their hands, which may help prevent spreading illness. \n \nIf you are in a room with someone who appears to be sick and is not covering their mouth, you should simply respond, \"I'm so sorry you seem sick. Would you mind covering your mouth when you cough or sneeze? I seem to catch everything, and I'd really appreciate it.\" \n \nObviously, you should make sure you keep up with your own hand-washing hygiene. This will help to protect your clients. \n \nDear Amy: \"Concerned Sister\" was relating an issue where the sister-in-law wants to use her surname for the third child (the other two children have the husband's surname). You say that, \"Rarely, families choose to divide the spouses' surnames between children; and this can cause paperwork hassles and some issues when traveling as a family...\" \n \nTwenty-one years ago, my wife and I flipped a coin that determined that our oldest daughter took her last name. Seventeen years ago, our next daughter took my last name. \n \nWe expected bureaucratic hassles and snide comments. My mother asked me whether the girls were going to be confused about who their father really was. \n \nI can truly say, with great surprise, that we had no problems navigating this. Everybody who mattered knew who was related to whom at every step of the way, including during foreign travel. I cannot recall a single issue we had that lasted longer than 10 seconds of pleasant conversation, nor any extra form that we needed to fill out. \n \nI do appreciate your first piece of advice on this: this is the parents' issue, not an issue for the in-laws, cousins and grandparents. \n \n\u2014 John D. Faucher \n \nDear John: I have encountered minor challenges as a parent traveling with a minor child with a different surname (one border guard queried her to determine if I was really her mother \u2014 completely understandable). But I agree that this is absolutely manageable. \n \n\u2014 Amy Dickinson is a Tribune Media Service national columnist.

Young\u2019s new time of 7:49.76 will most likely qualify him for February\u2019s NCAA Indoor Track and Field Championships. \n \nBehind Young in the 3000 meters on Saturday, finishing in eighth and ninth places with sub-eight-minute times, were Rory Linkletter in 7:58.81 and Jonathan Harper in 7:59.17. Mitchell Briggs took 15th in 8:08.31, and Daniel Carney finished 20th in 8:12.70. \n \nThe women\u2019s distance runners gave an equally impressive performance in the 5000 meters. The Cougars took fifth, sixth and seventh places overall with Olivia Hoj finishing in 16.22.10, Yesenia Silva in 16:25.62 and Laura Young in 16:25.76. Natalie Connolly took 12th place with a time of 16:42.26, and Alice Jensen rounded out the Cougar competitors, finishing 16th overall in 16:56.50. \n \nIn his first official race as a BYU track athlete, junior college transfer Abraham Alvarado took first place overall in the men\u2019s 800 meters. He finished in 1:50.34. Close behind Alvarado was Connor Ross , who took third and finished in 1:50.55. Marcus Dickson finished in 10th place, recording a time of 1:51.42. Ross currently claims seventh place overall in the BYU records for the indoor 800m with a time of 1:49.60. \n \nBYU record-holder Shea Collinsworth finished the 800m in fourth place overall with a time of 2:04.39. She was followed by teammates Madelyn Brooks , who took 16th place (2:11.88); Anna Camp , who took 19th (2:12.92); McKenna Neyman in 30th and Sidney Reilly in 33rd. \n \nSprinter Tatenda Tsumba had a big weekend for BYU, taking first place overall in the 200 meters with a time of 21.48, with Curtis Brown behind him in seventh place (22.03). Tsumba also placed fourth in the men\u2019s 60 meters with a time of 6.75. \n \nIn the women\u2019s 400 meters, Brenna Porter took fifth overall in 56.91, with Lauren Rawlinson claiming ninth in 57.32. Behind Rawlinson were Elsja Mecham who took 21st (58.68) in her first collegiate race and Kaitlyn Gunnerson who took 23rd (58.85). \n  \nTalem Franco took 14th place overall in the men\u2019s mile with a mark of 4:06.44. Teammate Chase Horrocks finished in 22nd, recording a time of 4:08.17. \n \nErica Birk took 13th overall in the women's\u2019 3000 meter with a time of 9:23.23. Fellow Cougar Courtney Wayment set a personal best of 9:38.43 and took 32nd overall. \n \nIn the 400 meters, Max Scheible placed ninth overall in 48.76. Scott Mecham was behind him, finishing in 16th and logging a time of 49.32. On the women\u2019s side, distance runner Kristi Rush improved her personal record and maintained her place in the BYU records for the indoor mile, claiming the ninth spot with a time of 4:44.76. Ashleigh Warmer took 10th place (4:45.60), with Whittni Orton taking 15th (4:48.81) and Rachel Stewart finishing in 19th (4:52.62). \n \nAdditionally, the men\u2019s 4x400m team won first place with a time of 3:13.11. \n \nRepresenting the field events, Zachary Blackham took fourth overall in the men\u2019s high jump with a mark of 2.15m. Women\u2019s high jumper Andrea Stapleton placed second overall in her event with a mark of 1.75m. Teammate Margaret Appiah finished right behind Stapleton in third with a 1.70m mark. \n \nMen\u2019s weight thrower Jacob Foutz set a personal best of 18.01m and took fourth place overall. Sadie Nielsen recorded a personal record in the weight throw with a mark of 15.44m. Nielsen finished in 18th place overall, just ahead of Siale Vaitohi , who took 21st place with a mark of 15.29m. \n Comment on this story  \nTomi Adegoke placed fourth overall in the men\u2019s long jump, finishing with a mark of 7.15m. Teammate Rickey Fantroy took 17th place and logged a mark of 6.45m. \n \nThe Cougars take a week off from competition before participating next in the Iowa State Classic on Feb. 24-25. \n \nCaitlan Wrubell is a student at BYU studying communications. \n \nContact her at: caitlanwrubell@gmail.com","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"BYU track: several Cougars move up in school records, log personal bests at UW Invite","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Salt Lake","zipCode":"84110","state":"Utah","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Salt Lake City","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Deseret Morning News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169663405","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4002"},"name":"Deseret Morning News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Geographic","Local","Sports"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.deseretnews.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://byucougars.com/staff/w-track-field/ed-eyestone","http://byucougars.com/athlete/m-track-field/clayton-young","http://byucougars.com/athlete/m-track-field/rory-linkletter","http://byucougars.com/athlete/m-track-field/jonathan-harper","http://byucougars.com/athlete/m-track-field/mitchell-briggs","http://byucougars.com/athlete/m-track-field/daniel-carney","http://byucougars.com/athlete/w-track-field/olivia-hoj","http://byucougars.com/athlete/w-track-field/yesenia-silva","http://byucougars.com/athlete/w-track-field/laura-young","http://byucougars.com/athlete/w-track-field/alice-jensen","http://byucougars.com/athlete/m-track-field/abraham-alvarado","http://byucougars.com/athlete/m-track-field/connor-ross","http://byucougars.com/athlete/m-track-field/marcus-dickson","http://byucougars.com/athlete/w-track-field/shea-collinsworth","http://byucougars.com/athlete/w-track-field/madelyn-brooks","http://byucougars.com/athlete/w-track-field/anna-camp","http://byucougars.com/athlete/w-track-field/mckenna-neyman","http://byucougars.com/athlete/w-track-field/sidney-reilly","http://byucougars.com/athlete/m-track-field/tatenda-tsumba","http://byucougars.com/athlete/m-track-field/curtis-brown-0","http://byucougars.com/athlete/w-track-field/brenna-porter","http://byucougars.com/athlete/w-track-field/lauren-rawlinson","http://byucougars.com/athlete/w-track-field/elsja-mecham","http://byucougars.com/athlete/w-track-field/kaitlyn-gunnerson","http://byucougars.com/athlete/m-track-field/talem-franco","http://byucougars.com/athlete/m-track-field/chase-horrocks-0","http://byucougars.com/athlete/w-track-field/erica-birk","http://byucougars.com/athlete/w-track-field/courtney-wayment","http://byucougars.com/athlete/m-track-field/max-scheible","http://byucougars.com/athlete/m-track-field/scott-mecham","http://byucougars.com/athlete/w-track-field/kristi-rush","http://byucougars.com/athlete/w-track-field/whittni-orton","http://byucougars.com/athlete/w-track-field/rachel-stewart","http://byucougars.com/athlete/m-track-field/zachary-blackham-0","http://byucougars.com/athlete/w-track-field/andrea-stapleton","http://byucougars.com/athlete/m-track-field/jacob-foutz","http://byucougars.com/athlete/w-track-field/sadie-nielsen","http://byucougars.com/athlete/w-track-field/siale-vaitohi"],"sequenceId":"695194409154","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:42:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:15:11Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

But, still, in the middle of the locker room, the biggest reasons why the Clippers suffered their worst loss of the season were printed in easy to read letters. \n \nLong after the Golden State Warriors beat the Clippers 144-98, the white board \u2014 where the game plan is scribbled before each game \u2014 four two-word sentences were the only words not erased. \n \n\u201cPlay hard. Play smart. Play together. Have fun.\u201d \n \nThey\u2019re written there every game, and Saturday, they\u2019d never been ignored more. \n \n\u201cI agree,\u201d the Clippers\u2019 DeAndre Jordan said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to figure it out because if not, we\u2019re going home early.\u201d \n \nThat Jordan is reflecting on the team\u2019s fate in April while the calendar still says January perfectly encapsulates the Clippers\u2019 issues against the Golden State Warriors \u2014 issues that couldn\u2019t have been easier to see if the team wore highlighter-green uniforms. \n \nAgainst the Warriors, everything seems bigger and more important because the Warriors \u2013 the NBA\u2019s best team \u2013 are better. \n \nThe Clippers\u2019 wins over San Antonio or Cleveland don\u2019t mean a thing inside Oracle Arena, where Golden State\u2019s beaten the Clippers 10 straight times. Against the Warriors (who have now won the last eight meetings between the two, no matter the venue), the Clippers just freeze. \n \n\u201cYou want it to so bad, you almost psyche yourself out of it,\u201d Blake Griffin said. \n \nIt\u2019s why Austin Rivers unleashed a few four-letter words when asked if the Warriors hold a mental edge over his team. It\u2019s why two early fouls to Griffin feels like a death sentence. It\u2019s why the first pass that sails into the seats seems to lead to another and another. And, it\u2019s why each Golden State basket \u2013 and boy, do these guys make baskets \u2013 feels like it\u2019s worth two or three times the points it puts on the scoreboard. \n \n\u201cThe mistakes kind of build,\u201d J.J. Redick said. \u201cAs they take advantage of it, it becomes like an avalanche. You saw that at the end of the first half.\u201d \n \nThe Warriors scored 17 points in 2 minutes and 38 seconds to close the second quarter, a stretch Redick described as \u201csome (expletive)\u201d that happened. \n \nStephen Curry, who scored 25 of his 43 points in the third quarter, closed the first half by sinking a one-footed jumper from beyond midcourt to beat the buzzer. \n \nWhile it\u2019s hard to simulate stopping Curry, the Clippers had the NBA equivalent to a bye week \u2014 three days off \u2014 to prepare. But once they got on the court, all the work and preparation simply got erased. \n \n \n\u201cA loss like this, it\u2019s made a lot worse with the type of effort we gave in stretches. For the whole game, we didn\u2019t play with the right type of attitude. We kind of went through the motions,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t attack. We had two great days of practice where we were attacking. Guys were playing hard. Defensively we were great. And, then to come out here on the stage that you were practicing for and not to do it, it\u2019s embarrassing.\u201d \n \nThey didn\u2019t play hard enough. They didn\u2019t play smart enough. They weren\u2019t together, and they sure didn\u2019t have fun. \n \n\u201cWe were horrible,\u201d Doc Rivers said. \u201cI thought we gave in way too easy. You should never lose by this much in any game, in any situation. But they\u2019re better right now. \n \n\u201cUntil we improve, they\u2019re going to keep beating us.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: NBA - Golden State Warriors news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: NBA - Los Angeles Clippers news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Golden State Warriors blast L.A.

And then his god-given talent can become a lot better.\"\n\nGilbert's been a successful coach, having helped Andre Agassis win six of eight major titles.\n\nHe led Andy Roddick to his 2003 US Open triumph and also worked with current No.1 Andy Murray and Kei Nishikori.\n\nWhen pressed on whether he'd been keen to work with the 21-year-old, Gilbert didn't rule it out.\n\n\"I've never spent time with him, so that would be the first thing ... you never say never about anything, you never know,\" he said.\n\nStubbs, who won four grand slam doubles titles during her career, said because Kyrgios was a \"special person\" he was the only one who could decide on who his coach should be.\n\nKyrgios has been linked with Roger Rasheed, Lleyton Hewitt and Radek Stepanek, although the latter is still playing.\n\nBut Stubbs felt the decision he was facing was much more than just whether to get a coach and if so who, but just how good he wanted to be.\n\nIf he wanted to be great, like the Australian Open men's singles finalists Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, then it was up to him.\n\n\"He's a special person.

By 12.30am she had carted her seventh Daphne Akhurst trophy back outside, to squeeze in one last pose for the photographers.\n\nBy lunchtime on Sunday she was on her way home; the tennis circus doesn't pause for record holders or even let them get much sleep. \"I'm leaving,\" said Williams, asking if she would stick around for Federer v Nadal. \"Man, I got to watch that match.\"\n\nFans were ready for Williams to win her 23rd grand slam title, and break her tie with Steffi Graf. They had been ready for a while.\n\nSerena wore red and black Nike Jordan boots featuring the No. 23 for the post-match presentation (you can also buy them in pink), Berlei had a new ad ready to run on social media and straight after the match Williams signed a set of gold racquets made by Wilson, strung to her specifications and featuring a 24-carat trapdoor on the butt cap. On sale for $960, with all proceeds headed for her foundation. All 23 were sold online within minutes.\n\nNone of this is to say that Serena is done, or satisfied. Graf was 30 when she retired, fresh off her first grand slam finals in three years at Roland Garros and Wimbledon in 1999, but with a hamstring injury and a lost love for the sport. Williams was 35 when she beat her older sister Venus on Saturday night, and plans to enjoy this one. \"It's a great number. I know she would like to have a little more,\" said Venus, while Serena conceded that it had sat somewhere at the back of her mind since she was 22.\n\n\"I guess after Wimbledon,\" said Williams, who went on to lose her US Open semi-final to Karolina Pliskova last year. Those Nikes had been sitting in a cupboard somewhere since. \"I obviously was thinking, 'OK, the next one.' I got it so fast, it didn't stay on the radar so long.\"\n\nSo is No. 24 \u2013 the Margaret Court pre-Open era record \u2013 just around the corner? \"No,\" said Williams. She hasn't forgotten: it took a year and three tough losses to creep from 21 up to 22. \"One thing I learned in the past is you have to enjoy it. That's the beauty of winning Australia, you have a few months to relax. If you win the French it's like back-to-back-to-back. Australia, you have time to enjoy the moment before the next grand slam.\"\n\nWilliams met Court in Perth last year for a \"really interesting\" chat, but grew up watching Graf, Monica Seles, Pete Sampras and can remember feeling inspired as a nine-year-old by Zina Garrison's run to the Wimbledon final. Now she knows that she, Graf and Navratilova are \"hands down leading the conversation\" when it comes to talk about which player is the greatest of all time.\n\n\"Yeah, just one thing about a champion, they keep fighting, they keep going,\" she said. \"I just feel like those four really are incredible fighters. They're mentally tough as well. They always kept going. It's something that I learned from them a lot, is how to hopefully do the same, which hopefully I've been able to do.\"\n\nSo what's next. A \"Serena Slam\"? Nope. \"A Serena Slam doesn't start in Australia,\" Williams said. \"It starts any other Grand Slam outside of Australia.\"\n\nA regular 'slam? \"I don't think about that either.\" How about one of the best-ever sporting stories to tell?

It was a longer day for the men, as they competed in two events and finished the day with their hardest dives on the platform. I think we showed a force that is just getting stronger and prepping us for conference.\u201d \n \nOn Friday, Matt Denkers , Kevin Dreesen , Eric Muir and Jordan Tuckfield ranked top eight in the 3-meter. The same four members of the dive team ended in the top eight in the 1-meter, in a different order. \n \nDreesen finished second overall in the 1-meter with a score of 316.75, an improvement on his preliminary score of 295.35. Denkers came in fourth place, posting a final of 297.10. Tuckfield recorded a sixth-place finish with 279.95, and Muir followed close behind in seventh with 277.45. \n \nThe platform event is more challenging for the BYU dive team because BYU doesn't have facilities in its home pool that supply the platform board. Because of this, the team has minimal time to prepare for and compete in the platform event. In spite of this, the men's dive team finished with five of their six divers in the top 10 in the platform diving. \n \nDenkers placed third in the platform event with a total score of 279.30, and he was followed in fifth place by teammate Trayton Speth , who scored 269.05. Dreesen ranked seventh overall with 248.85, and Tuckfield came in eighth with a total of 233.00. \n \nThe BYU women's dive team competed in the 1-meter and platform events on Friday and participated in the 3-meter event on Saturday. \n Comment on this story  \n\u201cThe women\u2019s team has improved in their consistency through all six dives and will be ready to score points at conference,\u201d Routson said. \"The format of the conference will be more spread out with only one event a day, and their focus will be to defeat their closest competitors.\u201d \n \nThe final scores for the women\u2019s 3-meter event have not yet been released.

The manager is evidently unhappy with the options at his disposal and is looking to add a few players to the squad and the latest name extensively linked with a move to Liverpool is Bayer Leverkusen winger Julian Brandt. \n \nThe 20-year old is one of the most exciting talents in German domestic circuit at the moment and Jurgen Klopp\u2019s Liverpool are ready to pounce on him in the summer. But who is this new guy on the Anfield radar? Here is a peek into his scout report: \n \nBorn and bought in Bremen, Germany, the 6ft 1in started his youth career at SC Borgfeld, as a 5-year-old and only moved to the Bundesliga back in 2011 with Wolfsburg. He created waves at the academy in Wolfsburg and even before he could make a senior appearance for the side, he was snapped up by fellow Bundesliga outfit Bayer Leverkusen back in 2014. \n \nHe stayed in the junior side for 6 months and broke into the first team in the 2014-15 season making a super start to his senior club career. He now has 80 league appearances and at his age and is easily one of the best young players around in his position. \n \n\n \nCapable of playing in every position in the final third, the 20-year old is a smart winger, who is a goal scoring threat in most positions he plays. His vision, technique and passing ability make him a superstar for his age while his pace and ability to get past the opponents only make him more dangerous. \n \nHe loves to take on his man in danger areas but is equally adept at finding his teammates in space in the final third. He is a player who will improve most squads in Europe as at his age, as he is only getting better performance after performance. \n \nThe winger loves to help his side out by dropping back when needed but he is at his best when he tries to go beyond his team\u2019s striker to create havoc among the back line of the opposition. However, he is not the strongest player in the air and could be a liability if he fails to work on that part of his game. He is also not the best finishers around but that is something he can learn with the more time he gets at the highest level. \n \nAt just 20, he is already capped at the international level for Germany and is a player who is destined for great things and Jurgen Klopp will want to be the one helping him to those things. At Anfield, the likes of Sadio Mane and Sheyi Ojo are the only two recognized wingers and Brandt will surely add more width to the squad when needed. At his age, he need not walk into the first team and can take his time to settle into the conditions in England before helping make Liverpool better. \n \nDo you think Julian Brandt is a decent option for Liverpool? \n \nThe post appeared first on SoccerSouls .","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Aakarsh Bommakanti"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: EPL - Liverpool news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: soccer news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: Premier League news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Everything You Need To Know About The New German That Jurgen Klopp Wants At Liverpool","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"SoccerSouls","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"398325119","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"6"},"name":"SoccerSouls","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer","Soccer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.soccersouls.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/25/football-transfer-rumours-leverkusen-winger-julian-brandt-to-liverpool"],"sequenceId":"695194415953","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:33:30Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:15:15Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://soccersouls.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Klopp.jpg"},{"url":"http://media.minutemediacdn.com/process?url=http%3A%2F%2F90min-images-original.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduction%2F588b6ba0f93f3a8946000001.jpg&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bw%5D=0.9023569023569022&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bh%5D=1.0&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_x%5D=0.025137085137085135&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_y%5D=0.0&amp;filters%5Bquality%5D%5Btarget%5D=80&amp;type=.jpg&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bw%5D=630&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bh%5D=472"}],"video":[]}}

So they\u2019re probably going to focus their efforts in the UEFA Champions League until the end of the season. \n \nNevertheless, they have other issues that need to be fixed in order to face the next campaign, as they\u2019re in a big danger of losing two of their most important players and they need to be planning ahead if they don\u2019t want the next season to become a nightmare from start to finish. \n \nAnd over the course of the last few weeks, the rumour that states that Marco Reus is the main priority on Arsene Wenger\u2019s agenda and is just getting stronger and stronger, and it seems like the Gunners are keen to make a \u20ac60m bid for the former Borussia Monchengladbach star. \n \nEven if he hasn\u2019t been able to contribute for his team on a regular basis over the course of this season, it seems like the extremely talented, yet extremely injury prone Borussia Dortmund and Germany star Marco Reus is once again on Wenger\u2019s team radar. \n \nApparently, the veteran boss wants Reus to be a potential Alexis Sanchez replacement if (when) the Chilean star decides to leave the Emirates Stadium, as Sanchez has been strongly linked with a move to the Italian Serie A , where he already thrived playing with Udinese before making his great jump to FC Barcelona. \n \n\n \nReus is arguably the most versatile offensive player in Germany since his surge at Monchengladbach, with the ability to play on either flank of the pitch, as an offensive midfielder and even as a pure striker, being a lethal player wherever his boss decides to use him. \n \nOver the course of the year, Marco has only been able to step on the pitch 5 times and has scored 1 goal to go along with 3 assists, showing no signs of rust and demonstrating that value and incredible talent that once made him one of the most scouted players in the world. Of course, he has had his injury issues, but whenever he is on the field, he is a threat \n \nDuring Klopp\u2019s Dortmund spell, Reus was probably the most important player in a team that also featured Mario Gotze, Matt Hummels, Robert Lewandowski, Shinji Kagawa and Nuri Sahin, but unfortunately, injuries stopped him in becoming one of the top 3 players in the world, even missing the last World Cup where Germany took the trophy back home. \n \nReus could totally be a more than capable replacement for Sanchez, or for every single star in the world, as a matter of fact, considering how extremely talented the forward is with both feet, his ability to make plays and his outstanding pace, as well as his breathtaking passing and finishing abilities. \n \nNevertheless, considering his long and sad history with several injuries, Arsenal is on the verge of making one of the riskiest signings in history, so let\u2019s hope it all works out fine for both parties. \n \nThe post appeared first on SoccerSouls .","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Ernesto Cova"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: EPL - Arsenal news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: soccer news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: Bundesliga news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: Premier League news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Is This \u20ac60m Bundesliga Superstar The Perfect Replacement For Alexis Sanchez At Arsenal?","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"SoccerSouls","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"398325119","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"6"},"name":"SoccerSouls","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer","Soccer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.soccersouls.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.whoscored.com/News/Ha173ybuu0eyt60q9j2L-w/Show/Exclusive-Arsenal-readying-%E2%82%AC60m-Reus-bid-should-Alexis-exit-Emirates","http://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/748807/Arsenal-news-transfers-Alexis-Sanchez-contract-Juventus-revenues-latest-gossip"],"sequenceId":"695194417045","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:11:32Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:15:15Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.bvb.de/var/ezdemo_site/storage/images/media/bilder/galeriebilder/g_muenchen_reus_4/1773677-1-ger-DE/G_Muenchen_Reus_4_bvbnachrichtenbild_regular.jpg"},{"url":"http://soccersouls.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/sanchez.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

The \u201csanitised\u201d report was declassified recently by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). \n \nThe report, whose complete title is not entirely available as it is part deleted, was prepared on the basis of inputs available to the CIA till January 1986. \n \nThe very first sentence of the report\u2019s available (undeleted) page reads: \u201cPrime Minister Rajiv Gandhi faces at least an even chance of assassination before his tenure in office ends in 1989.\u201d It, however, later clearly said that \u201cassassination is the major near-term threat\u201d to him. \n \nOver five years later, Gandhi was assassinated at Sriperumbudur in Tamil Nadu on May 21, 1991. \n \nThe first section titled \u201cKey Judgments\u201d analyses and deliberates upon what likely scenario would emerge in the domestic and international political situation if there is a sudden change in leadership minus Rajiv Gandhi and the likely impact on India\u2019s relations with the US, the then USSR and the region. \n \nIt also dealt with the threats posed to Gandhi\u2019s life by various extremist groups at that time and the likely fallout of his murder. \n \n\u201cIf Gandhi fell to a Sikh or Kashmiri Muslim assassin, widespread communal violence probably would erupt even if strong preventive security measures \u2013 including deployment of Army and paramilitary troops across northern India \u2013 were taken by the Indian President \u2026\u2026(deleted),\u201d it said. \n \nInterestingly, it also names P V Narasimha Rao and V P Singh, who could be the \u201cinterim successor\u201d and \u201clikely candidates\u201d in case of sudden exit by Rajiv. Rao took over as the Prime Minister in 1991. \n \nIn a section, titled \u2018The Threat of Assassination: Stability in Jeopardy\u2019, the report says \u201cIn our view, there is at least an even chance in the next several years of an assassination, most likely by extremist Sikhs or disgruntled Kashmiri Muslims who have targeted Rajiv,\u201d besides \u201ca fanatical Hindu\u201d. \n \nSince a significant portion of this section is deleted, it is not clear whether Sri Lankan Tamil extremists were also dealt with in the analysis. However, another section deals in- depth with Rajiv\u2019s mediation efforts to resolve \u201cthe conflict between militant Sri Lankan Tamils and the Sinhalese-dominated government in Colombo\u2026\u201d (More) \n \nThis is published unedited from the PTI feed.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Press Trust of India"},"topics":[{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"}],"title":"\u2018CIA assessed Rajiv assassination 5 yrs before he was killed\u2019","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"India.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"597540856","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"India.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.india.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194420182","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:12:08Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:15:18Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://s3.india.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/indiacom-image-banner_02.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

And Small Business Saturday was a busy day, said David Borlaug, president of the Lewis and Clark Fort Mandan Foundation, which runs the gallery.\n\n\"In spite of the bad weather, in terms of original art, sales have been great,\" he said. \"It validates Bismarck was ready for this kind of gallery.\"\n\nBorlaug said Bismarck has been \"blessed\" with a multitude of galleries, each with a different niche. Bismarck Downtown Artist Cooperative, Bismarck Art & Galleries Association and Gallery 522 all feature member artists' works. There's also Art Gallerie on Main, where Lydia Richez-Bowman features her own work and that of several other local artists, as well as teaching classes.\n\nBorlaug said Capital Gallery is focused on featuring two artists on its walls \u2014 one expressive and one traditional \u2014 along with several others who work in various other media, such as glass or bronze. The gallery sets itself apart by limiting the number of artists and featuring them for longer periods. And because it does not cater to member artists, \"the world's our oyster,\" he said.\n\nBorlaug has artists lined up for the foreseeable future, with Deane Collin Fay of Gackle alongside Bismarck native Vern Erickson's western Americana pieces coming up in Februarym The Bismarck Tribune (http://bit.ly/2joTPY3 ) reports.\n\n\"There is a thriving art culture in Bismarck,\" Borlaug said. \"We're just glad to be part of it.\"\n\nHe points to Jessica Wachter as an up-and-coming Bismarck artist who has a \"real following across the country,\" with works featured in galleries in Los Angeles and Scottsdale, Ariz.\n\nStephanie Delmore of Gallery 522 agrees.\n\n\"I think we're just getting to that point of there being enough galleries\" that they could partner on events, like gallery hops, she said. \"We can start to thread ourselves together.\"\n\nAs Bismarck's population has become more diverse, Delmore said there are more people who are used to going to galleries on a regular basis.\n\n\"I think the traffic is picking up,\" she said, with the public understanding what art adds to a community.\n\nSince starting 32 years ago, Gallery 522 has wanted all local artists to be able to show their work daily rather than wait five years for their turn at a larger show.\n\n\"We've always meant to be of service to artists,\" Delmore said, and on a day-to-day basis, the gallery has a multitude of artists covering its walls.\n\nBismarck Downtown Artist Cooperative works much the same way, though with slightly different rules and organization, while BAGA has become more well-known for hosting larger shows for its member artists, Delmore said.\n\n\"I think we've got a lovely base of artists in the area,\" she said, and having more galleries showcasing those artists could result in more art-focused events come spring.\n\nBorlaug said he thinks Bismarck is where Fargo was a couple decades ago in terms of growing from a big town to a small city \u2014 and art \"makes cities.\"\n\n\"I feel Bismarck is more than ready to grow its arts community,\" he said.\n\nIn turn, that community could help grow the city, attracting more residents. Borlaug said one of the first things people want to know about before moving somewhere is the arts scene: Is there a symphony? An orchestra? Visual arts?\n\n\"It could help get people to move here,\" he said, and the art produced here is helping tell this area's story.\n\n---\n\nInformation from: Bismarck Tribune, http://www.bismarcktribune.com\n\nAP Member Exchange shared by The Bismarck Tribune.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"JESSICA HOLDMAN The Bismarck Tribune"},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"},{"name":"Entertainment: fine arts news","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"Number of art galleries increases for Bismarck","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Jackson","zipCode":"64108","state":"Missouri","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Kansas City","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"KansasCity.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657780","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"362"},"name":"KansasCity.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Arts","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.kansascity.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://www.kansascity.com/entertainment/article128985149.html","https://twitter.com/share?text=Number%20of%20art%20galleries%20increases%20for%20Bismarck&url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.kansascity.com%2fentertainment%2farticle128985149.html","http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.kansascity.com%2fentertainment%2farticle128985149.html&title=Number+of+art+galleries+increases+for+Bismarck","https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.kansascity.com%2fentertainment%2farticle128985149.html","http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.kansascity.com%2fentertainment%2farticle128985149.html&description=Number+of+art+galleries+increases+for+Bismarck&media=http%3a%2f%2fwww.kansascity.com%2fstatic%2fimages%2fkansascity%2ffaceb","http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http://www.kansascity.com/entertainment/article128985149.html","http://www.mcclatchyreprints.com/","http://bit.ly/2joTPY3","http://www.bismarcktribune.com/","http://www.bismarcktribune.comAP/"],"sequenceId":"695194422469","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:15:19Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.kansascity.com/static/images/kansascity/facebook.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

They do not have the same overheads as the bigger players, so that is what most retailers are up against,\u201d said Mutashu, in a telephone interview. \n \nHe also said most were running promotions and avoiding price increases as a survival mechanism to stay afloat. \n \n\u201cIn fact, price increases are detrimental to retailers mainly because of the competition between informal and formal retailers. Consumers will walk away. \n \n\u201cRetailers do not increase prices, they are just a conduit and act on how manufacturers peg against supply and demand,\u201d the CZR president said. \n \nThis comes as food prices for basic food stuffs have gone up over the past few months as retailers reportedly put premium mark-ups on United States Dollar (US$) purchases. \n \nBeef is now sold at $7 per kilogramme (kg) from an average of $4,50 per kg in October while chicken reached the unprecedented price of $3,45 per kg. \n \nA 2-litre cooking oil bottle, which used to trade at $2,99 before the import restriction in June last year, now costs an average of $3,40. \n \nBattling a cash availability crisis, Zimbabwe has left consumers with very little choice but to transact using cash-lite methods. \n \nOver the past few months, cash-lite transactions have been going up with Mutashu saying this was the competitive advantage formal retailers had over their informal counterparts. \n \nHarare-based economist Issis Mwale said the country\u2019s economic meltdown was the reason prices were going up with retailers getting the short-end of the stick. \n \n\u201cThe retailer is not making the goods they are selling in most cases, they are just the link with the consumer.

While Zimbabwe may have gone out in the group stage, Billiat was one of their stars of the tournament, particularly impressive against Algeria, where he proved himself against defenders used to playing at the top level in European football,\u201d the Daily Mail said. \n \n\u201cAt 26, Billiat is probably too old to be signed as one for the future. He is fairly lightweight, and would probably take time to adapt to the English game. That said, his ability to cope with some dreadful pitches in Gabon, and still trick his way past opponents suggests he is more than capable of adapting quickly. \n \n\u201cProbably not a top Premier League side, but a mid-table club looking for a versatile goal-threat could consider Billiat to be worth a try. There is reported interest from clubs in the French and Belgian top flights, but don\u2019t rule out a move to England down the line.\u201d \n \nBilliat has been outstanding for Sundowns, and was named the 2015-16 PSL Player of the Season in South Africa. \n \nNot only has the wonderfully-gifted forward terrorised PSL defences, but he also played a major role in helping Sundowns win the African Champions League and was voted only behind team-mate and Ugandan international keeper Denis Onyango in Caf\u2019s best-player-based in Africa awards. \n \nSamuel Kuffour, a European Champions League winner with Bayern Munich, and a pundit on SuperSport, also offered praise for Billiat after watching his first game against Algeria. \n \n\u201cI think Billiat is one of the best African talents I have seen in a long time. This guy can be on another level because he has everything. I think you have to move him to Europe,\u201d Kuffour said during his post-match analysis. \n \n\u201cIt would be very disappointing for Africa not to see him playing here. But in terms of his career and what he can do at 26 years, you have to move him to Europe. \n \n\u201cHe is amazing to watch. For me being a defender it would be very difficult to play against this boy. He is small and you don\u2019t know what he is going to do. He is so quick with the ball he has everything. For me I would love to see him go outside (overseas) for his future.\u201d \n \n[GoogleAd]","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Godknows Matarutse"},"topics":[{"name":"Eastern Europe news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Europe news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Billiat tipped to make Europe move","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Eastern Africa","countryCode":"ZW","country":"Zimbabwe"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Daily News Zimbabwe","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"427574606","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"11"},"name":"Daily News Zimbabwe","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.dailynews.co.zw"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194440197","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:50:59Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:15:27Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.dailynews.co.zw/data/media/00000638/Original__zoom.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

All things being equal, we will have a rally at the airport next week when he returns from the African Union summit in Addis Ababa,\u201d the bigwig said. \n \nAnother senior party official corroborated the claim saying there had been real fears that there could have been a bloodbath at the airport if Mugabe\u2019s usual reception routines had not been changed. \n \n\u201cGushungo\u2019s (Mugabe\u2019s) travel arrangements were successfully kept a hush-hush affair, with only very few people in the know about when and how he would return. \n \n\u201cI think this was very smart of the president and his close lieutenants because anything could have happened today had the usual routines been followed, with large crowds of bickering supporters there,\u201d the official said. \n \nIndeed, there were neither the usual crowds of rank and file supporters, nor the large contingent of Cabinet ministers and other senior government officials and top securocrats who normally throng the airport to welcome the nonagenarian each time he leaves or returns home from his myriad trips. \n \nEven the police details who usually man all the capital city\u2019s major intersections and traffic lights, along his home route from the airport, were conspicuous by their absence. \n \nAccording to well-placed sources, Mugabe did not say much to the few officials who welcomed him upon his arrival, including vice president Emmerson Mnangagwa, telling them about his leave, as well as his State visit to China. \n \nOn Thursday, disaffected war veterans threatened to beat up ruling party supporters who belong to Zanu PF\u2019s Generation 40 (G40) faction who were planning to denounce Mnangagwa upon Mugabe\u2019s return. \n \nThe war veterans, who want Mnangagwa to succeed Mugabe, claimed that the G40 group, which is rabidly opposed to the Midlands godfather\u2019s ascendancy, was planning to transport thousands of party supporters to Harare International Airport, to not only welcome the nonagenarian and his family back, but to also humiliate Mnangagwa. \n \nAnother source who spoke to the Daily News last night also said it was in this light that intelligence operatives had deliberately sent the media and the warring Zanu PF factions on \u201ca wild goose chase\u201d about Mugabe\u2019s travel arrangements. \n \n\u201cIn the interests of everyone, it was felt that it was safer to confuse the warring factions and allow the president to arrive without facing this difficult situation of having to choose one faction over the other. \n \n\u201cSo, it was decided to do what we did for the sake of Gushungo and making sure that no faction would claim psychological victory in the raging succession wars,\u201d the senior Zanu PF official said. \n \nSpeaking on Thursday, the disaffected leadership of the Zimbabwe National Liberation War Veterans Association (ZNLWVA) said it had \u201cimpeccable intelligence\u201d suggesting that the G40 had mobilised its supporters to embarrass Mnangagwa at the airport by brandishing placards denouncing the Midlands godfather for hobnobbing with sacked party officials during the festive season. \n \n\u201cWe want to warn them (G40 kingpins and their supporters) that they are going too far. Kana vachienda kunogamuchira Mugabe ngavaende vanogamuchira Mugabe (If they want to go and welcome Mugabe, then they should do just that),\u201d warned combative ZNLWVA secretary-general Victor Matemadanda. \n \n\u201cVakada kusimudza maplacards ekunyomba (if they wave placards to embarrass and provoke) VP Mnangagwa, we as the group from the liberation struggle will fight back, not because we are saying Mugabe is not the president, but because we are fighting on behalf of a fellow comrade. \n \n\u201cWe know that they are making placards and we have put our people on standby. Ngavafambe nawo maplacards acho tivone. Tinodzigura zviuno chembere idzodzo. Vakangofamba nemaplacards vachiti Ngwena kudii-dii tinovadira. Ende kumajere kwacho tavakukuziva tinokudzokera (Let them wave their placards against Mnangagwa and we will teach them a hard lesson. We will beat them up. We are not afraid to go back to jail),\u201d he added. \n \n\u201cIye president wacho ngaazive kuti varikuronga zvinhu zvavo vachida kusvoora ED (Mnangagwa) he must reprimand them. Even vasina kuita, he must tell them that this nonsense must come to an end, otherwise tozoti ndiye arikuvatuma. (Mugabe himself must stop them and if he does not we will conclude that he is the one who is behind them),\u201d Matemadanda charged further. \n \nTwo weeks ago, the Daily News also reported that some G40 members were planning a meeting with Mugabe upon his return from his holiday, to raise their concerns over Mnangagwa\u2019s alleged plotting against the nonagenarian, as well as against the infamous \u201cCupgate\u201d saga. \n \nSince the images of Mnangagwa holding the much-obsessed about coffee mug (written I Am The Boss) emerged in the public domain, the G40 had gone to town about the issue, interpreting it as the VP\u2019s open statement that he had unbridled presidential ambitions. \n \nG40-linked party officials, who subsequently met at the Zanu PF headquarters in Harare, issued a statement in which they called for a probe into Mnangagwa for hobnobbing with the likes of war veterans\u2019 leader Christopher Mutsvangwa and maverick businessman-cum politician, Energy Mutodi. \n \n[GoogleAd]","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Fungi Kwaramba"},"topics":[{"name":"Zimbabwe news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Africa news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Mugabe sneaks back into Zim","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Eastern Africa","countryCode":"ZW","country":"Zimbabwe"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Daily News Zimbabwe","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"427574606","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"11"},"name":"Daily News Zimbabwe","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.dailynews.co.zw"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194440597","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:40:23Z","adultLanguage":"true","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:15:27Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.dailynews.co.zw/data/media/00001315/Original__zoom.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

He added that many of them wanted to mount an official protest. \n \nLabour-led Derby City Council wants to introduce the new system, which would see powers taken away from councillors and put into the hands of council officers, using a points-based system based on previous convictions, from June 30. \n \nIt will cost almost £140,000 to pay for five additional staff to run the system, which is meant to be self-funding and intended to stop rogue taxi drivers operating in Derby. \n READ MORE: How shock £138,500 for more staff could drive up taxi fees and fares  \nAccording to officers, \"any additional costs the council may incur in introducing some or all of the proposals, will need to be met by the trade\". \n \nThis has caused members of the council's licensing committee to question the new system and Mr Quayum said they are right to be concerned. \n \nHe said: \"Taxi drivers are having to work all hours now \u2013 sometimes up to 15 a day to make a decent living. But the extra cost of increased fees because of a new system they do not want will be the final straw for many of them. \n \n\"Others who do not want to pay the extra will go elsewhere to get licences, where there isn't a points-based system, ensuring that the council is powerless to stop rogue taxi drivers in Derby.\" \n \n\n \nThere are 1,300 drivers licensed with the city council but estimates suggest that there are around 2,800 working in the area, not licensed in Derby. \n \nMr Quayman said: \"The legislation only says that a taxi driver has to be a 'fit and proper person' to hold a licence. Those two things can be checked using a DBS (disclosure and barring check) and a medical. \n \n\"Two things will happen if this comes into force. One, taxi fares will go up from around £3.80 a mile to £5 and two, a possible 500 drivers will go elsewhere meaning that licence fees and fares could be even higher because the new system has been costed based on the current 1,300 licensed drivers.\" \n READ MORE: The new points-based system gets Derby City Council go-ahead last November  \nOne of the new posts would be £52,000 to pay for a lawyer because it was anticipated that the number of appeals against licence refusal would increase and have to go before magistrates to be defended. They said this had happened in Leicester, which has a similar system, leading to a 350% increase in appeals, according to council officers. \n \nThe points system was developed following a damning report stating failings in Derby City Council's taxi licensing system . Expert auditors found that the authority's taxi licensing sub-committee had allowed licences for people with criminal records who had committed offences including \"hate crime, harassment, intimidation and making improper comments to young women\". \n \nIn one instance, a taxi driver was granted a licence despite \"publishing material threatening or intending to stir up religious/sexual hatred\". In the new points-based system, criminal convictions for the most severe crimes including rape and murder will trigger an automatic lifetime disqualification. \n \n\n \nOther lesser crimes will accrue points on a sliding scale. Assault of a police officer, for example, would mean instant refusal for an applicant if it happened less than four years ago. But it would mean six points if committed five years ago, then five points for six years ago, four for seven years ago, and so on. \n \nAny applicant or existing driver who gets \"above 12 points\" would be disqualified. An alternative change would have seen council officers operate committees similar to the ones currently run by councillors. \n READ MORE: Tory pledge to reverse new system if they gain power on Derby City Council  \nMr Quayum added: \"We have polled our members and increasingly, it seems they want to take action and protest against the system. Many taxi drivers are very resentful but are suffering in silence.\" \n \nTory councillor Mick Barker said: \"It is now obvious that the extra costs, which will be passed on to the taxi trade, will raise serious concerns to drivers and operators alike and potentially cause them to register in cheaper authority areas - leaving Derby with limited control over taxi services.\" \n \n\"We are in danger of pushing drivers too far in demanding extra exacting standards and extortionate fees which will lead them to seek registration elsewhere. That being the case, it undermines the ability of the city council to administer standards on both vehicles and drivers, which is to the detriment of our public that both we and the taxi trade serves.\" \n OTHER NEWS: See what the late Derbyshire-born actor John Hurt had to say about Derby","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Political unrest news","group":"Society"},{"name":"England news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Taxi drivers in Derby may hold protest against new points system","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","county":"Derbyshire","zipCode":"DE1","state":"England","countryCode":"GB","zipArea":"Derby","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Derby Telegraph","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659128","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Derby Telegraph","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk","publisher":"Local World"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/derby-taxi-fares-could-rise-by-almost-a-third-if-new-licensing-system-adopted/story-30092499-detail/story.html#comments","http://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/taxi-drivers-hit-fine-dropping-fares-bus-stops/story-28862483-detail/story.html","http://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/st-george-s-day-celebrations-and-mad-hatters-tea-room-discussed-at-lively-derby-city-council-meeting/story-30088314-detail/story.html","http://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/shock-138-500-cost-of-new-derby-taxi-licensing-system-could-force-up-fees-and-fares/story-30077270-detail/story.html","http://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/points-based-system-to-clamp-down-on-rogue-taxi-drivers-approved-in-derby/story-29929866-detail/story.html","http://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/half-of-derby-s-taxi-drivers-are-registered-elsewhere/story-29745345-detail/story.html","http://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/councillor-pledges-to-reverse-any-changes-to-taxi-licensing-if-tories-are-voted-into-power-in-derby/story-29829169-detail/story.html","http://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/mickbarker","http://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/sir-john-hurt-the-wonderful-things-the-derbyshire-born-actor-has-said-about-derby/story-30093476-detail/story.html"],"sequenceId":"695194447233","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:15:35Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The problem with CNG is there are no fueling stations. It would take a lot of money to build fueling stations,\u201d said Mike Pickens , executive director of the Office of School Transportation and School Facilities at the West Virginia Department of Education . \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s a very attractive product,\u201d he added. \u201cIt could be the best of all of them, but it\u2019s so expensive. There\u2019s no way to do a pilot (project) because there are no fueling stations.\u201d \n \nPropane companies will agree to build fueling stations at county bus garages in exchange for vehicle purchase contracts with those companies, so that reduces the cost of refueling infrastructure for counties considering the switch from diesel fuel to propane, Pickens said. \n \nLarry Fowler , director of school bus sales at Matheny Motors at Mineral Wells, said there also is the cost difference. A CNG bus can cost $35,000 more than a diesel bus, Fowler said. Matheny Motors offers buses from Thomas Built Buses that use CNG, but there has been no interest in West Virginia, he said. \n \nOne of the three domestic bus manufacturers began selling gasoline-powered buses this school year, and another has announced plans to do so. Schools nationwide moved away from gasoline in the 1980s because diesel engines were more durable and had better fuel economy than gasoline engines. With diesel engines becoming more complicated and requiring the use of an additive to reduce emissions, some school systems in the United States have asked manufacturers to consider building gasoline-powered buses. \n \nPickens said West Virginia accepts bids for diesel, propane and CNG buses, but not for gasoline. \n \n\u201cWe got away from gasoline a few years ago for several reasons,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not even an acceptable fuel right now.\u201d \n \nHowever, the state is not ruling out gasoline in the future, he added.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Education news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Little Interest in W.Va.

There's a very strong nexus between our immigration and visa programs and terrorist plots and extremist networks inside the United States,\" the official continued. \"Look at the recent, high-profile attacks that have occurred inside the country -- an immigration nexus is not at all uncommon. I won't go through the list of them all now. One obvious example would be Tashfeen Malik and the San Bernadino incident with the K1 visa.\" \n\nA K1 visa is a non-immigrant visa issued to the foreign-citizen fiance of a US citizen. Tashfeen Malik was from a family of wealthy landowners in Pakistan and later moved to Saudi Arabia with her immediate family. Her husband, Syed Rizwan Farook, was a US citizen. \n\nPakistan and Saudi Arabia, however, are not on the list of countries subject to the new ban. \n\nThe administration is facing criticism from leaders in the U.S. and around the world for taking steps their critics say are unconstitutional and anti-American. \n\nThe second mention of San Bernardino came when the official was trying to explain why there was no grace period before the executive order went into effect, to help ease implementation. \n\n\"Imagine if this had been an executive order that had been contemplated the day before the San Bernardino shooter entered the United States?\" the official asked. \"Would have delaying its implementation served the best interests of the country? The reality is we don't know who the next individual is who will exploit our immigration programs successfully.

And Small Business Saturday was a busy day, said David Borlaug, president of the Lewis and Clark Fort Mandan Foundation, which runs the gallery. \n\n\"In spite of the bad weather, in terms of original art, sales have been great,\" he said. \"It validates Bismarck was ready for this kind of gallery.\" \n\nBorlaug said Bismarck has been \"blessed\" with a multitude of galleries, each with a different niche. Bismarck Downtown Artist Cooperative, Bismarck Art & Galleries Association and Gallery 522 all feature member artists' works. There's also Art Gallerie on Main, where Lydia Richez-Bowman features her own work and that of several other local artists, as well as teaching classes. \n\nBorlaug said Capital Gallery is focused on featuring two artists on its walls \u2014 one expressive and one traditional \u2014 along with several others who work in various other media, such as glass or bronze. The gallery sets itself apart by limiting the number of artists and featuring them for longer periods. And because it does not cater to member artists, \"the world's our oyster,\" he said. \n\nBorlaug has artists lined up for the foreseeable future, with Deane Collin Fay of Gackle alongside Bismarck native Vern Erickson's western Americana pieces coming up in Februarym The Bismarck Tribune (http://bit.ly/2joTPY3 ) reports. \n\n\"There is a thriving art culture in Bismarck,\" Borlaug said. \"We're just glad to be part of it.\" \n\nHe points to Jessica Wachter as an up-and-coming Bismarck artist who has a \"real following across the country,\" with works featured in galleries in Los Angeles and Scottsdale, Ariz. \n\nStephanie Delmore of Gallery 522 agrees. \n\n\"I think we're just getting to that point of there being enough galleries\" that they could partner on events, like gallery hops, she said. \"We can start to thread ourselves together.\" \n\nAs Bismarck's population has become more diverse, Delmore said there are more people who are used to going to galleries on a regular basis. \n\n\"I think the traffic is picking up,\" she said, with the public understanding what art adds to a community. \n\nSince starting 32 years ago, Gallery 522 has wanted all local artists to be able to show their work daily rather than wait five years for their turn at a larger show. \n\n\"We've always meant to be of service to artists,\" Delmore said, and on a day-to-day basis, the gallery has a multitude of artists covering its walls. \n\nBismarck Downtown Artist Cooperative works much the same way, though with slightly different rules and organization, while BAGA has become more well-known for hosting larger shows for its member artists, Delmore said. \n\n\"I think we've got a lovely base of artists in the area,\" she said, and having more galleries showcasing those artists could result in more art-focused events come spring. \n\nBorlaug said he thinks Bismarck is where Fargo was a couple decades ago in terms of growing from a big town to a small city \u2014 and art \"makes cities.\" \n\n\"I feel Bismarck is more than ready to grow its arts community,\" he said. \n\nIn turn, that community could help grow the city, attracting more residents. Borlaug said one of the first things people want to know about before moving somewhere is the arts scene: Is there a symphony? An orchestra? Visual arts? \n\n\"It could help get people to move here,\" he said, and the art produced here is helping tell this area's story. \n\n--- \n\nInformation from: Bismarck Tribune, http://www.bismarcktribune.com \n\nAP Member Exchange shared by The Bismarck Tribune.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"JESSICA HOLDMANThe Bismarck Tribune"},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"},{"name":"Entertainment: fine arts news","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"Number of art galleries increases for Bismarck","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Manatee","zipCode":"34205","state":"Florida","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Bradenton","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Bradenton Herald","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657775","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"626"},"name":"Bradenton Herald","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Arts","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bradenton.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://bit.ly/2joTPY3","http://www.bismarcktribune.com/"],"sequenceId":"695194450892","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:15:37Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

As of January, about 2,500 people out of a combined population of around 19,460 registered as residents of those areas were living there. \n \nEvacuation orders for four more towns and villages in Fukushima Prefecture are scheduled to be lifted this spring, but it is uncertain how many residents will return to those areas as well. \n \nIn the prefecture, eight municipalities are still subject to evacuation orders around the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant due to high radiation levels. Three nuclear reactors at the plant melted down and the structures housing them were severely damaged by hydrogen gas explosions days after a massive earthquake and ensuing tsunami on March 11, 2011 knocked out electric power needed to run critical reactor cooling equipment.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Japan news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Only 13% of evacuees in 5 Fukushima municipalities have returned home as of Jan.","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Eastern Asia","countryCode":"JP","country":"Japan"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"Mainichi Daily News","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169618705","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Mainichi Daily News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://mainichi.jp","publisher":"Mainichi Newspapers"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194454839","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:15:39Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

He alleged that the Liberals wanted to wrest police from Mr Grant, a senior Nationals MP.\n\n\"The Nationals wanted police, the right wing faction of the Liberals wanted police,\" he said. \"So she split it in two.\"\n\n\"It's the police who keep us safe from terrorism,\" Mr Foley said.\n\n\"The police commissioner now has to report to two people. It's scandalous and another deal that is counter to the public interest.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the troubled relationship between the NSW attorney-general and minister for police has been addressed, with Ms Berejiklian confirming a reshaping of the much maligned \"justice cluster\".\n\nThe arrangement, whereby as justice and police minister Mr Grant held a more senior position than then attorney-general Gabrielle Upton, was heavily criticised by the legal profession.\n\nThe NSW Bar Association said it provided Mr Grant \"with unprecedented power in determining legal policy without the historical checks and balances\".\n\nThe NSW Law Society warned the arrangement meant police were \"ostensibly responsible for criminal law policy, while at the same time, the traditional roles of the attorney-general as first law officer of the state, which includes preserving civil liberties, are being eroded\".\n\nMs Berejiklian has confirmed the cluster has been reworked so that new attorney-general Mark Speakman, SC, is the lead minister. The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Sean Nicholls"},"topics":[{"name":"Terrorism news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"New counter terrorism role slammed as 'against the public interest'","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2576","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Bowral","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Southern Highland News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"351646242","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Southern Highland News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.southernhighlandnews.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194460097","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:29:42Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:15:42Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/ee974bdb-c7e3-4991-93f1-8b638bee948c.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Submitted photos \n\nThe Erie 2 Chautauqua Cattaraugus BOCES School of Practical Nursing at the Cassadaga Job Corps Academy marked the graduation of its most recent class this week. \n \nRecently, 15 students completed the intense, one year long training course to prepare for a career as a Practical Nurse. Those in this class were; Susana Arambula, Bianca Benjamin, Erin Betts of Dunkirk, Jacqueline Cruz, Charles DeCoteau, Claire Faustin, Jasmine Graham, Kathryn Hanlon of Dunkirk, Joshua Hutcheson, Fabiola Jordan-Ramos, Tyler-Nyree McDonald Fisher, Christine Nickerson of Dunkirk, Clifford Nickerson of Dunkirk, Erica Paulsen, and Tamara St. Fort. \n \nThe commencement opened with remarks from Job Corps CDP Director Robert Benjamin, and a welcoming address by Laura Bailey from BOCES. Ms. Bailey thanked Job Corps for the ongoing partnership, which dates back further than 10 years, for their ongoing support to make the program possible. She also remarked to the graduates, \n \n\u201cI am thankful for your progress, stamina, strength and urgency. You entered the class with little to no knowledge of the medical field and today, 11 months later, you leave to be responsible for another person\u2019s life.\u201d \n \nFollowing Bailey\u2019s comments was a special video presentation prepared for the class by LPN student Taila McNeill, highlighting their time at Cassadaga, and their preparation for graduation day. Joshua Hutcheson provided a heartfelt address to his classmates and those in attendance. He commented to his class, \u201cAfter what we have been through and done here, there is nothing that we can\u2019t do if we put our minds to it.\u201d He went on to thank by name many of his classmates for their friendship and support, without which he acknowledged he would not have made it. He also thanked the BOCES faculty, his Job Corps RA\u2019s and Counselor, and his family for helping to carry him through the past year. \n \nEach of the graduates were called up by Laura Bailey to receive their pin, award, and diploma.  The white, traditional nursing uniform clad graduates each posed on the stage for their family and friends as they moved across the stage back to their seats, where a small gift awaited them. Joshua Hutcheson was presented with the class Valedictorian award. \n \nThe class had co-salutatorians awarded to Christine Nickerson and Jasmine Graham. \n \nThe final step in the Nursing graduation was the reciting of the Nurse\u2019s pledge. Graduates rose and repeated the words that were recited by Ms. Bailey to affirm their commitment to their profession and the care of their future patients. Academy Director Ann Anderson closed the ceremony and reminded the class how important they are in their new role. She thanked the students  for the mark they have left on the Center, thanked BOCES for their continued partnership, the families for their support, and wished the graduates luck as they move forward in their new profession. \n \nAnderson went on to remind the class to always be mindful of the team around you, and how important a role everyone plays in caring for the patients they are charged with. \n \nThis successful partnership has helped dozens of men and women secure their career as a Nurse, or launched them into continued education and training to advance their career.  BOCES provides the instruction, skill development and clinical experiences, while Job Corps provides the scholarship to eligible students to attend, as well as supportive services throughout the training period. Upon graduation, Job Corps continues follow up and assistance with placement services. \n \nFor more information about the LPN program at the Cassadaga Job Corps Academy, please contact the admissions office by calling 716-595-4200 or visit http://cassadaga.jobcorps.gov.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Education news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Students Complete Practical Nursing Class","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Chautauqua","zipCode":"14702","state":"New York","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Jamestown","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Jamestown Post-Journal","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"173538063","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"350"},"name":"Jamestown Post-Journal","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.post-journal.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://cassadaga.jobcorps.gov/"],"sequenceId":"695194469426","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:15:40Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Marilyn van Dijk, a veterinary assistant, kept treats in Meyer's hands or in front of the dog at all times. \n\nHe'd forget that he had a bum leg, put his paw down and reach around for the treat. \n\nMeyer, keeping hold on Tigger via a harness, cooed in the dog's ear: \"I've got you. I've got you.\" \n\nAnd then Tigger relaxed. He'd move his front paws forward as if on automatic pilot. Walk, walk, walk. \n\nMeyer moved up the speed on the treadmill, and Tigger walked, walked, walked some more, as if he's been doing it his entire young life. \n\nExcept he hasn't. \n\nTigger has never walked or run on four legs like most canines. \n\nHe has jumped like a kangaroo on his hind two legs or inched forward on his belly. But he has never kept up with his foster parents' other dogs because his front two legs were congenitally deformed by a defect called ectrodactyly, or split hand or lobster claw. \n\nThese days, Meyer has him on the underwater treadmill and doing planks on a large plastic peanut to help develop callouses on the limb and strengthen his core to protect his other limbs. He hopes to introduce the dog to cavalletti exercises (small jumps) soon to help him further strengthen his muscles and improve his balance. \n\n\"He's been compensating his whole life, so we take this slow,\" Meyer said. \n\nTigger weighs slightly more than his optimal weight of 55 pounds, said his surgeon, Dr. Jennifer Warnock. The physical therapy sessions may help with that. \n\nDr. Warnock hopes to perform the second repair surgery on Tigger's other front leg at the end of March. But Good and her partner, Troy Riggs, have some fundraising to do first. When the Statesman Journal first broke Tigger's story last summer and it spread across the country through the USA Today Network and The Huffington Post, more than $17,000 was raised in a few weeks. \n\nMore than $10,000 was spent on Tigger's first surgery, ICU stay, bandaging needs, and his medication. At least $2,000 or $3,000 still needs to be raised to pay for this next round of surgery, which will repair the second front limb and fuse one portion of the other newly fashioned leg. Dr. Warnock expects Tigger's condition to regress a bit as he recovers from the second surgery, but she's cautiously optimistic the dog could be walking on both front legs by summer. \n\nTigger may or may not need prosthetics. His X-rays currently show bone fusion, which is excellent, Warnock said. If his therapy continues to help him develop callouses where he never had them before, she believes the prognosis to be very good. \n\n\"We want to get him functioning without pain,\" Warnock said. \"I want him jumping on the couch, something most dogs take for granted. But Tigger does not.\" \n\nNow about those treats ...","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"CAROL MCALICE CURRIEStatesman Journal"},"topics":[],"title":"Tigger starts water therapy as leg improves","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Saint Clair","zipCode":"62220","state":"Illinois","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Belleville","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Belleville News Democrat","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659187","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1944"},"name":"Belleville News Democrat","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard","Local","Geographic"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bnd.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://stjr.nl/2iLOWc1"],"sequenceId":"695194474969","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:06:04Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:15:43Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

He alleged that the Liberals wanted to wrest police from Mr Grant, a senior Nationals MP. \n \n\"The Nationals wanted police, the right wing faction of the Liberals wanted police,\" he said. \"So she split it in two.\" \n \n\"It's the police who keep us safe from terrorism,\" Mr Foley said. \n \n\"The police commissioner now has to report to two people. It's scandalous and another deal that is counter to the public interest.\" \n \nMeanwhile, the troubled relationship between the NSW attorney-general and minister for police has been addressed, with Ms Berejiklian confirming a reshaping of the much maligned \"justice cluster\". \n \nThe arrangement, whereby as justice and police minister Mr Grant held a more senior position than then attorney-general Gabrielle Upton, was heavily criticised by the legal profession. \n \nThe NSW Bar Association said it provided Mr Grant \"with unprecedented power in determining legal policy without the historical checks and balances\". \n \nThe NSW Law Society warned the arrangement meant police were \"ostensibly responsible for criminal law policy, while at the same time, the traditional roles of the attorney-general as first law officer of the state, which includes preserving civil liberties, are being eroded\". \n \nMs Berejiklian has confirmed the cluster has been reworked so that new attorney-general Mark Speakman, SC, is the lead minister. \n \nThe story New counter terrorism role slammed as 'against the public interest' first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald .","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Terrorism news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"New counter terrorism role slammed as 'against the public interest'","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2800","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Orange","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Central Western Daily","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169694320","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"7"},"name":"Central Western Daily","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.centralwesterndaily.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194476020","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:15:43Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Organisers claim this a record number of the little dogs in the one place at the one time. \n\nMark Ellis, the organiser of Sunday's Werriwa Wiener Dash at the Bungendore Show, believes the turnout of 154 dachshunds for the event constitutes a world record for the number of the sausage dogs in one place at one time.\n\n\"We had miniatures, long hairs, short hairs, standards and wire hairs,\" he said. \"They came from all over; some even travelled from Melbourne.\n\nWhile Mr Ellis wasn't able to engage the attention of the people from Guinness, who ruled the record being sought was too \"specialised\" to interest them, he is happy to claim the record with any other contenders needing to prove him wrong.\n\nAlthough the quirky event, which has captured the imagination of dachshund lovers from across NSW and the ACT, is only in its second year it has already become one of the feature events of the Bungendore Show.\n\nThis year's dash winner was Buddy, owned by Jacqueline Winzenberg of Page in the ACT. Buddy's award was presented by NSW Deputy Premier and local member John Barilaro.\n\nOne hundred and twenty seven dogs turned up for the inaugural event in 2016.\n\nBungendore Show, which was first held in the 1840s, has gone from strength to strength in recent decades, this year's showgirl, Hanna Darmody, 22, said.\n\nMs Darmody, whose family own a Bungendore butchery, said she could recall helping with the catering at the show as a toddler almost 20 years ago.\n\n\"I've seen the event grow as the town has grown,\" she said. \"It is a great bridge between country and city; the showgirl competition is a good way to get young people involved and promotes opportunities in agriculture.\"\n\nShow organisers said this year's event, which enjoyed the best weather conditions in three years, was an unqualified success with more than 2000 people passing through the gates before lunch.\n\nIn addition to the usual attractions in the show ring and the pavilions and the dachshund dash, the 2017 event offered visitors a chance to get a close look at the Anzac Centennial 18 pounder gun.\n\nThe World War I-era weapon, which also saw service during World War II,was restored by the Royal Australian Artillery Company in conjunction with veteran coach builder Jim Frecklington.

He alleged that the Liberals wanted to wrest police from Mr Grant, a senior Nationals MP.\n\n\"The Nationals wanted police, the right wing faction of the Liberals wanted police,\" he said. \"So she split it in two.\"\n\n\"It's the police who keep us safe from terrorism,\" Mr Foley said.\n\n\"The police commissioner now has to report to two people. It's scandalous and another deal that is counter to the public interest.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the troubled relationship between the NSW attorney-general and minister for police has been addressed, with Ms Berejiklian confirming a reshaping of the much maligned \"justice cluster\".\n\nThe arrangement, whereby as justice and police minister Mr Grant held a more senior position than then attorney-general Gabrielle Upton, was heavily criticised by the legal profession.\n\nThe NSW Bar Association said it provided Mr Grant \"with unprecedented power in determining legal policy without the historical checks and balances\".\n\nThe NSW Law Society warned the arrangement meant police were \"ostensibly responsible for criminal law policy, while at the same time, the traditional roles of the attorney-general as first law officer of the state, which includes preserving civil liberties, are being eroded\".\n\nMs Berejiklian has confirmed the cluster has been reworked so that new attorney-general Mark Speakman, SC, is the lead minister.

Buddy's award was presented by NSW Deputy Premier and local member John Barilaro.\n\nOne hundred and twenty seven dogs turned up for the inaugural event in 2016.\n\nBungendore Show, which was first held in the 1840s, has gone from strength to strength in recent decades, this year's showgirl, Hanna Darmody, 22, said.\n\nMs Darmody, whose family own a Bungendore butchery, said she could recall helping with the catering at the show as a toddler almost 20 years ago.\n\n\"I've seen the event grow as the town has grown,\" she said. \"It is a great bridge between country and city; the showgirl competition is a good way to get young people involved and promotes opportunities in agriculture.\"\n\nShow organisers said this year's event, which enjoyed the best weather conditions in three years, was an unqualified success with more than 2000 people passing through the gates before lunch.\n\nIn addition to the usual attractions in the show ring and the pavilions and the dachshund dash, the 2017 event offered visitors a chance to get a close look at the Anzac Centennial 18 pounder gun.\n\nThe World War I-era weapon, which also saw service during World War II,was restored by the Royal Australian Artillery Company in conjunction with veteran coach builder Jim Frecklington.

He alleged that the Liberals wanted to wrest police from Mr Grant, a senior Nationals MP.\n\n\"The Nationals wanted police, the right wing faction of the Liberals wanted police,\" he said. \"So she split it in two.\"\n\n\"It's the police who keep us safe from terrorism,\" Mr Foley said.\n\n\"The police commissioner now has to report to two people. It's scandalous and another deal that is counter to the public interest.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the troubled relationship between the NSW attorney-general and minister for police has been addressed, with Ms Berejiklian confirming a reshaping of the much maligned \"justice cluster\".\n\nThe arrangement, whereby as justice and police minister Mr Grant held a more senior position than then attorney-general Gabrielle Upton, was heavily criticised by the legal profession.\n\nThe NSW Bar Association said it provided Mr Grant \"with unprecedented power in determining legal policy without the historical checks and balances\".\n\nThe NSW Law Society warned the arrangement meant police were \"ostensibly responsible for criminal law policy, while at the same time, the traditional roles of the attorney-general as first law officer of the state, which includes preserving civil liberties, are being eroded\".\n\nMs Berejiklian has confirmed the cluster has been reworked so that new attorney-general Mark Speakman, SC, is the lead minister.

Kennedy Airport, where 12 refugees were detained Saturday, swelled to more than 2,000 people, including some celebrities. The agency that runs the airport tried to restore order by shutting down the train that runs to airport terminals. Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, reversed that decision, saying people had a right to protest. \"The people of New York will have their voices heard,\" he said in a statement. \n \n___ \n \nNEWARK, NEW JERSEY \n \nMore than 120 people clutching signs denouncing the Trump immigration orders gathered at Newark Liberty International Airport. NorthJersey.com reports that they joined lawyers who'd rushed to the airport to defend the rights of refugees and immigrants who were being detained and denied entry. \n \n___ \n \nDENVER \n \nDozens of people converged on Denver International to show their support for refugees. Standing in the main terminal Saturday, they sang \"Refugees are welcome here.\" Some held signs declaring their identity, such as Jew or Christian, and the phrase \"I come in peace.\" Denver has some direct international flights but it wasn't clear whether anyone has been detained under the president's executive order. \n \n___ \n \nCHICAGO \n \nA crowd of demonstrators held a rally at O'Hare International Airport. The Chicago Sun-Times reports protesters blocked vehicle traffic to O'Hare's international terminal for a time. The newspaper says some arriving travellers joined the protest, while others were upset by the demonstrations. \n \nLawyers working with the International Refugee Assistance Project tell the Chicago Tribune 17 people who had been detained at O'Hare all released by late Saturday. \n \nAmong those released before the federal judge's order was Hessan Noorian, a suburban Park Ridge resident returning with his family from Iran, the Tribune reported. \n \nNoorian, who is of British and Iranian citizenship and has a green card, was detained at O'Hare after he and his wife, Zahra Amirisefat, a U.S. citizen, arrived from Tehran, the newspaper said. \n \nThe couple, who told the Tribune that they work at a community college in the Chicago area, said they were questioned for five hours. \n \nAfter Noorian was released, his wife told the Tribune: \"I can't believe something like this can happen to someone with a green card.\" \n \n__ \n \nDALLAS \n \nProtesters who gathered at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport Saturday evening voiced their displeasure with Trump's executive order. The Dallas Morning News reports the crowd of a few dozen ballooned into hundreds of demonstrators who frequently chanted \"Set them free!\" At times, cheers erupted from the crowd as those who were detained got released. \n \nAmong those still held at the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport at midnight Saturday was a 70-year-old Iranian widow, Shahin Hassanpour, whose son said she suffers from high blood pressure and had breast cancer surgery four years ago. She obtained an immigrant visa in November on her son's petition. \n \nBahzad Honarjou, a 43-year-old network engineer, said he spoke twice to his mother by phone after her 9 a.m. arrival, but that they hadn't talked since courts stayed the executive order, meaning she should have been released. \n \nHundreds of protesters stood in the waiting area and chanted \"This is what democracy looks like.\" \n \nImmigration agents were not being very communicative, Honarjou said. \n \n\"They were like a machine when I talked to them today,\" he said. His mother only speaks a few words of English and a fellow passenger was translating for her from her native Farsi as no immigration agents spoke the language, he said. \n \nHassanpour was originally going to be deported on a Sunday flight, she informed her son the first time they spoke. \n \n\"She was about to cry,\" he said. \"She is not able to take (tolerate) a 20-hour flight back to Iran.\" \n \nHonarjou said he is a U.S. citizen, obtained entry in a lottery, and has been in the country for seven years. Why did he come? \n \n\"To have a better life and to make more money,\" he said. \"And, you know, for the freedom.\" \n \n___ \n \nSEATTLE \n \nAbout 1,000 pro-immigration protesters gathered Saturday at Seattle-Tacoma Airport to denounce Trump's executive order. Aayah Khalaf, a Muslim American, was sitting at home watching the protest on television when she and her friend studying from Egypt decided to join the rally. It was her second time joining a protest. The first one was the Women's March. \"It's not just against Muslims. It against environmental rights and human rights overall. I think everybody has to stand up against this,\" said Khalaf, 29. \n \n___ \n \nPORTLAND, OREGON \n \nA protest by several dozen people in and around Portland International Airport briefly disrupted light rail service at the airport. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports that the demonstrators carried signs and chanted \"Say it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here\" and \"No ban no wall America is for us all.\" \n \n___ \n \nLOS ANGELES \n \nAbout 300 people expressed their displeasure with the ban at Los Angeles International Airport Saturday night. Protesters entered the airport's Tom Bradley International Terminal after holding a candlelight vigil. \n \n___ \n \nSAN FRANCISCO \n \nHundreds of protesters blocked the street outside at San Francisco International Airport's international terminal to express their opposition to the barring of some people from Muslim-majority nations. \n \n___ \n \nSAN DIEGO \n \nAs motorists honked their support, demonstrators outside San Diego International Airport chanted \"No hate, no fear, everyone is welcome here.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Airline industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Political unrest news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Protests erupt at airports following Trump travel ban","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","zipCode":"V1X","state":"British Columbia","countryCode":"CA","zipArea":"Kelowna East Central","country":"Canada"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Kelowna Daily Courier","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169664702","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"10"},"name":"Kelowna Daily Courier","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.dailycourier.ca"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://NorthJersey.com/"],"sequenceId":"695194496271","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:48:16Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:15:58Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/kelownadailycourier.ca/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/a/29/a29134fd-6a00-51fa-be27-58d8413fdaed/588d933357106.image.jpg?resize=300%2C200"}],"video":[]}}

Its full significance has now become apparent. \n \nThe find contained a mixture of extremely rare Anglo-Saxon coins and Viking silver, which provides a clearer understanding of the relationship between Alfred the Great, who ruled Wessex and his less well-known contemporary Ceolwulf II of Mercia. \n \nSome of the coins were minted with a 'Two Emperors' design, borrowed from the Romans, which shows that the currency was used in both ancient kingdoms. \n \n\"This is an extraordinary find, one which re-writes Anglo-Saxon history,\" Xa Sturgis, director of the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, which now houses the coins, told Sky News. \n \n\"The keeper of the coin room here came running up the stairs to tell me. The more they were excavated the more it became obvious how significant they are. These coins point to some sort of an alliance in the 870s between Alfred and Ceolwulf.\" \n \nWhile Alfred is often described as the king who founded England, uniting Mercia and Wessex, very little is known of his rival Ceolwulf. \n \n\"These coins prove that there was a very real alliance between the two men at that time,\" added Julian Baker, coin curator at the Ashmolean. \n \n\"That alliance hasn't survived in the historical record until now. Alfred manipulated history to put himself in a better light. To date, history has overemphasised Alfred's record and almost completely neglected Ceolwulf. \n \n\"We can start re-writing that decade now, courtesy of the Watlington hoard.\" \n \nThe Ashmolean has until Monday, 31 January, to raise £1.35m to keep the coins and Viking silver in Oxfordshire and they are extremely close to that figure now. \n \nMore than 500 people in the local area have donated to the fund set up to raise the cash. \n \nMr Sturgis added: \"Alfred is the only king in the history of England described as 'great'. But these coins show that in the 870s he needed Ceolwulf. It's incredible that we know so little about him and Alfred dominates everything. It's like he obliterated Ceolwulf.\" \n \nThe Watlington Hoard, as it is now known, is on public display at the Ashmolean as historians begin the process of re-assessing that period of Anglo-Saxon history. \n  \n© 2017 Sky News, all rights reserved","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Coins discovery 'will re-write' Anglo-Saxon history","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","county":"Northamptonshire","zipCode":"PE1","state":"England","countryCode":"GB","zipArea":"Peterborough","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Radio City Talk","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"570172920","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Radio City Talk","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.radiocitytalk.co.uk"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194496945","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:15:59Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Organisers claim this a record number of the little dogs in the one place at the one time. \n\nMark Ellis, the organiser of Sunday's Werriwa Wiener Dash at the Bungendore Show, believes the turnout of 154 dachshunds for the event constitutes a world record for the number of the sausage dogs in one place at one time.\n\n\"We had miniatures, long hairs, short hairs, standards and wire hairs,\" he said. \"They came from all over; some even travelled from Melbourne.\n\nWhile Mr Ellis wasn't able to engage the attention of the people from Guinness, who ruled the record being sought was too \"specialised\" to interest them, he is happy to claim the record with any other contenders needing to prove him wrong.\n\nAlthough the quirky event, which has captured the imagination of dachshund lovers from across NSW and the ACT, is only in its second year it has already become one of the feature events of the Bungendore Show.\n\nThis year's dash winner was Buddy, owned by Jacqueline Winzenberg of Page in the ACT. Buddy's award was presented by NSW Deputy Premier and local member John Barilaro.\n\nOne hundred and twenty seven dogs turned up for the inaugural event in 2016.\n\nBungendore Show, which was first held in the 1840s, has gone from strength to strength in recent decades, this year's showgirl, Hanna Darmody, 22, said.\n\nMs Darmody, whose family own a Bungendore butchery, said she could recall helping with the catering at the show as a toddler almost 20 years ago.\n\n\"I've seen the event grow as the town has grown,\" she said. \"It is a great bridge between country and city; the showgirl competition is a good way to get young people involved and promotes opportunities in agriculture.\"\n\nShow organisers said this year's event, which enjoyed the best weather conditions in three years, was an unqualified success with more than 2000 people passing through the gates before lunch.\n\nIn addition to the usual attractions in the show ring and the pavilions and the dachshund dash, the 2017 event offered visitors a chance to get a close look at the Anzac Centennial 18 pounder gun.\n\nThe World War I-era weapon, which also saw service during World War II,was restored by the Royal Australian Artillery Company in conjunction with veteran coach builder Jim Frecklington. The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"David Ellery"},"topics":[{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Werriwa Wiener dash claims world dachsund record","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2650","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Wagga Wagga","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Wagga Wagga Daily Advertiser","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169711399","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"54"},"name":"Wagga Wagga Daily Advertiser","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.dailyadvertiser.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194497234","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:10:23Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:15:59Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/01e2e8d0-6ac5-4e81-9bc2-708dc395bfb7.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

There\u2019s not enough drama. It\u2019s not real NFL football. \n \nBut Incognito, a Buffalo Bills guard, is like the vast majority of the 88 players invited to this all-star gathering Sunday night. He sees the Pro Bowl more as a celebration of achievement and as a way to thank the fans. \n \nHe wouldn\u2019t change a thing. \n \n\u201cIn my mind it\u2019s as good as it should be,\u201d Incognito said. \u201cYou really can\u2019t ask guys to come out here and fly around at full speed when we\u2019ve been off for the last two or three weeks. And some guys are just coming down here after conference championship games. Maybe make it more fan interactive, get the fans involved more, do more of the skills competition.\u201d \n \nThe NFL has seemed open to ways to energize its end-of-the-year showcase that is now sandwiched between conference championship and Super Bowl weeks. A few years ago the league broke from the traditional AFC-NFC Pro Bowl matchup and allowed celebrity coaches to draft two teams. \n \nNow, in hopes of giving the game a lift, the NFL has moved the Pro Bowl from Hawaii to Orlando, where it has become more of a weeklong event, complete with a re-imagined Skill Showdown. The AFC-NFC matchup has also returned after three years of nonconference games. \n \nStill, it remains to be seen if the NFL can continue selling a game that bears little resemblance to the product it puts on the field during the season. The players come to the Pro Bowl to have fun, not get hurt and maybe win. \n \n\u201cThis Pro Bowl for me in a sense is special because you are coming here to celebrate what you\u2019ve accomplished,\u201d New York Giants receiver Odell Beckham, Jr. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of fun.\u201d \n \nSeattle Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman says the intensity would rise and more invited players would show up if the NFL gave them their weekly game salaries. Under the collective bargaining agreement, each player from the winning team will make $61,000 this week and the losing players will take home $30,000. \n \n\u201cYou pay them what you are paying them and you get this performance,\u201d Sherman said. \u201cIt\u2019s a different element. ... I guarantee you less guys would miss the Pro Bowl if you told you are going to pay them their normal salary for one more game.\u201d \n \nFormer NFL player and coach Herm Edwards says the game as played now is fine. He says the Pro Bowl is not about the game, it\u2019s about the fans and the players giving back. Thousands of fans have been out at ESPN\u2019s Wide World of Sports complex this week watching both the AFC and NFC practice. \n \n \nAfter the practices were over most of the players signed autographs and took pictures in the laid-back atmosphere. All of the practices are short and glorified walk-throughs, and the players are mostly having fun with each other and the fans. \n \n\u201cWe are all ambassadors to this great game of football and how you conduct yourself once you leave this practice field is more important than how you play the game,\u201d said Edwards, who now works as analyst. \u201cThe fans aren\u2019t going to remember the game. The fans remember if Odell Beckham, Patrick Peterson, or if Drew Brees takes a picture with them, signs an autograph.\u201d \n \nEdwards, however, understands the criticism. He even admits, as a football purist, he doesn\u2019t watch the Pro Bowl. \n \nBut he says if the game does become more fiercely contested it would come at a cost that players, teams and even fans may not want to pay. \n \n\u201cThe only way to make it better is you do this: If you want all of them to show up, make the game worth $500,000,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cThey will all show up and now they play. Here is the problem, when one of them gets hurt you have the same problem.\u201d \n \nOakland Raiders general manager Reggie McKenzie acknowledges being torn when his players are selected for the Pro Bowl. On one hand, he is excited for their recognition. On the other, he\u2019s concerned about injuries. \n \nMcKenzie would be in favor of more of skills challenge than a game where key players can be injured. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s a risk,\u201d said McKenzie, who will have four players representing the AFC on Sunday. \u201cI cringe every time I go to practice, but it\u2019s the nature of the game. It\u2019s what it is. But you do everything you can to set your safety-type precautions. What else can you do? Not play? I don\u2019t think that\u2019 right.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: American football news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: NFL news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"NFL\u2019s Pro Bowl tries to strike balance between fun and competition","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"San Bernardino","zipCode":"91761","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Ontario","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Inland Valley Daily Bulletin","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169660785","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"81"},"name":"Inland Valley Daily Bulletin","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.dailybulletin.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194497741","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:15:59Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The match was a fight from start to finish and was tied up at 1-1, 2-2 and 3-3. \n  \nThe Wolfpack got off to a hot start, taking the doubles point for a 1-0 lead in the match.

Bianca Moldovan and Claudia Wiktorin fired off another 6-3 win to clinch the doubles point. \n  \nArkansas' Arakawa found the first singles win in #5 singles, beating Moldovan 7-5, 6-2 to tie the match, 1-1.

I think both teams played hard and did what they could. The conditions were extremely changeable, we started in relatively good conditions and the end was played in quite cool blustery winds. It's early in the season and our best tennis is still ahead of us. We managed to come through some really tight moments on a couple of courts and that got us through. I'd like to say the doubles point was the difference and that's very important for us but ultimately Martina and Claudia pulled this one out when we had our backs to the wall. It's funny because Martina had 3 matches points in the 2nd set reminiscent of her 1st match this past Fall, however she hung in there, played very tough points on both of Oparenovic's match points. Happy for her as a senior to see her get that match and give Claudia the opportunity to play a deciding point. Claudia's made a ton of progress since last year and I've got a lot of faith in her and what's she capable of. She was close to making a break-through this Fall on a couple of occasions and this was the perfect moment for it to happen. Proud of our effort all round today and looking forward to tomorrows match with Pepperdine. Go Pack!!!\" \n\nUp Next \nThe Wolfpack will take on No. 3 Pepperdine Sunday in the championship match.

Bad signs, all of them. \n \nAnd I\u2019m not even out of bed yet. The school bus won\u2019t roll by for another hour. But in the few minutes that I\u2019ve watched the morning news this is what they\u2019re talking about. And it\u2019s happening here, in this country\u2019s capitol, in a city where I spent this weekend, and all that keeps going through my head is, \u201cWhat have we done?\u201d \n \nI went to Washington, D.C. last weekend with two friends from school. The three of us went to Orange County Community College together back in the late '80s, a time when it seemed women had very little to complain about. I mean, we could go to college, we could vote and drive and play high school sports. There was even a woman, finally, on the Supreme Court. \n \nOf course, we had the benefit of timing. Women like Gloria Steinem and Betty Friedan and Bell Hooks had changed the landscape for us, and we were beneficiaries of their work and the work of generations before them. For me, being a girl was a breeze. \n \nIt gets harder, of course, being a girl. Or, well, just being. The world is bigger than the OCCC campus, and the three of us \u2013 Bridget and Nicole and I \u2013 have collectively experienced many of the complications and conflicts that come with adulthood. And womanhood. \n \nSo within days of Election Day, as soon as word of the Women\u2019s March was circulating on social media, Bridget booked us a room and we put in for days off from work and my Bella, who is 15, alerted her teachers that she\u2019d be absent Friday because we\u2019d be heading to D.C. \n \nThe March has been mocked in some circles, that it was nothing more than a bunch of women who wanted to get out of the house. Or that we\u2019re crybabies, upset that our candidate lost. Or that we\u2019re spoiled, that we\u2019ve forgotten just how good we have it here, that it could be a lot worse. And besides, who can even tell what the March was about, every sign seemed to be about a different cause. \n \nAnd that\u2019s true. I saw them. The signs were all over the place. My body my choice and black lives matter and Trump likes Nickelback and water is life and immigrants we get the job done and repeal misogyny and Resist and women in the sequel and love thy neighbor and build bridges not walls. There were rainbow flags and American flags and a Princess Leia was waving the flag of the Rebel Alliance. \n \nWhy was I there? For all of it. I could carry any one of those. \n \nThere was one sign, though, that I\u2019ll remember above the rest. It was waved by a little girl with dark brown hair and she looked to be about 8. She was with her mom, who was wearing a knitted hat of Rastafarian colors. \n \nThe little girl\u2019s sign quoted Albus Dumbledore, and it said this: Happiness can be found in the darkest of times if one remembers to turn on the light. \n \nSee? There are good signs these days, too. \n \nlmjramirez@hotmail.com","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Lisa Ramirez"},"topics":[],"title":"At Women' March, swarm of signs was a good sign","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Orange","zipCode":"10940","state":"New York","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Middletown","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Record Online","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169727453","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"21"},"name":"Record Online","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.recordonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194500071","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:16:00Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

But never had she had a weekend quite like the last one. \n \nKaren Chen, a 17-year-old, 4-foot-11 sprite from Fremont who trains under Gambill at Riverside Icetown, stunned the figure skating community by swiping the Ladies Senior gold at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships in Kansas City. \n \nThe next night, Vincent Zhou, a 16-year-old from Palo Alto via Icetown who won the national junior title three years ago as a 13-year-old, finished second in the Men\u2019s Senior competition to Nathan Chen, no relation to Karen. \n \nOne more level crossed off. It may have been just a matter of time. \n \n\u201cIt is a building process,\u201d said Gambill. \u201cI guess that just means we\u2019re on the right track. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s fun because now I\u2019ve had every national champion: Juvenile boy and girl, intermediate boy and girl, novice boy and girl, junior boy and girl, and now senior girl. Karen is my first senior champion, so that makes it special, that elusive senior title. And Vincent was very close.\u201d \n \nWhich would make her, um, an overnight success? \n \n\u201cExactly,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cI\u2019m an up-and-coming coach.\u201d \n \nGambill, a Redlands resident who declined to state her age but acknowledged her skaters now give her anniversary cards on her birthday \u2014 anniversaries of turning 39, get it? \u2014 grew up in the Sacramento area and was a good enough skater at 14 to leave home to train, much as her pupils now do. \n \nShe began coaching in Stockton 30 years ago. \n \n\u201cThe Oak Park Ice Arena,\u201d she recalled. \u201cThen I moved down to Southern California, and had two kids and started coaching down here. My son (Matt) is now 27, so it was 27 years ago that I started down here.\u201d \n \nHer first teaching gig in Southern California was in Palm Desert, at a long, skinny rink in the middle of the Town Center Mall \u2014 \u201ccalled a hot dog rink,\u201d she recalled. Her pupils there included Yorba Linda\u2019s Sandy Rucker and Indio\u2019s Dennis Phan; both went on to win age group national championships, Phan in 2003 and Rucker in 2005. \n \nShe later began commuting from Redlands to Anaheim three times a week to teach on a bigger ice surface, and also used the Ice Castle international training center in Lake Arrowhead when it was still open. \n \n \nAnd then Icetown opened, in 1997, an easier commute with no need to navigate mountain roads. \u201cPerfect,\u201d she said. \n \nThe accolades have accumulated over the years. Gambill was named the USOC Developmental Coach of the Year in 2005 \u2014 an honor that encompasses all sports \u2014 and has been similarly honored by U.S. Figure Skating and the Professional Skaters Association in 2005, 2012 and 2013. \n \nBut it\u2019s about her pupils, as it should be. She has coached world or national medalists Richard Dornbush, Shotaro Omori, Tyler Pierce and Caroline Zhang. \n \nFour of her skaters will be competing at either the world championships or world junior championships this year. Chen and Brendan Kerry of Australia will compete in the 2017 World Championships March 29-April 2 in Helsinki, Finland (and both will also compete in the Four Continents competition Feb. 15 in Gangneung, Korea, the site of next year\u2019s Olympic competition). \n \nMeanwhile, Zhou and Yarrick Paniot of the Ukraine will compete in the World Junior Championships beginning March 15 in Tapiei City, Taiwan. Zhou will also be the first alternate for the U.S. at the Worlds should there be an injury. \n \n\u201cI like it when they come in young and I can build them back up again,\u201d Gambill said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s fun to get some of the older ones. Yaro (Paniot) just came in a couple of weeks ago. He\u2019s super talented, so I\u2019m very excited to see what I can do with him as well.\u201d \n \nShe has around 20 skaters total, and her preference is to have everyone on the ice together. She barks orders \u2014 her own description \u2014 and, along with assistant coach Ryan Berning, gives technical guidance. She doesn\u2019t discourage the idea among her skaters that she has eyes in the back of her head, a fiction that works as long as she can see their reflections in the Plexiglas. \n \nAnd she listens as well as instructs. \n \n\u201cI\u2019ve been with her for three years now, and I feel like I really do love her as a coach,\u201d Chen said. \u201cShe can be strict, but she\u2019s definitely very understanding as well. She listens to my opinion. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s always been something I struggled with in my interaction with my coach, but I feel like I\u2019m getting better. Sometimes if I\u2019m having a bad day or my knee\u2019s bothering me or something, it\u2019s hard for me to speak up and tell her, because I feel like I want to give my 100 percent in training and I don\u2019t want to let this affect anything ... (but) she\u2019s let me know this: It\u2019s important that if I\u2019m not feeling 100 percent today I need to let her know, so she can make adjustments to my training and it\u2019ll be beneficial for us both.\u201d \n \nChen is one of many skaters who have relocated from elsewhere specifically to train under Gambill. Her mother, Hsiu-Hui Tseng, is with her and her younger brother Jeffrey, an ice dancer, in Southern California during the week while her husband, Chih-Hsiu Chen, has stayed in the Bay Area. \n \n\u201cI like the way she teaches kids,\u201d Tseng said. \u201cSometimes you need to be strict. (But) she\u2019s a coach you can communicate with. Some coaches won\u2019t communicate with parents, but she\u2019s willing to listen.\u201d \n \nWith more success, inevitably Gambill will field more calls from parents inquiring whether there is space for their prodigies. For the good ones, there will assuredly be room. \n \n\u201cWhen I first started coaching I taught a little girl whose father was a farmer,\u201d Gambill said. \u201cAnd he made a statement to me that \u2018when my crop is great, I\u2019m the smartest farmer in the world. But when I have a bad crop, due to whatever reason, all of a sudden I\u2019m a very stupid farmer.\u2019 \n \n\u201cIt all depends on the crop you have at the time.\u201d \n \nOf course, how well you cultivate it matters, too.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Jim Alexander: Tammy Gambill\u2019s coaching leaves nothing to chance","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"San Bernardino","zipCode":"91761","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Ontario","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Inland Valley Daily Bulletin","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169660785","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"81"},"name":"Inland Valley Daily Bulletin","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.dailybulletin.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194500240","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:16:00Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

He alleged that the Liberals wanted to wrest police from Mr Grant, a senior Nationals MP.\n\n\"The Nationals wanted police, the right wing faction of the Liberals wanted police,\" he said. \"So she split it in two.\"\n\n\"It's the police who keep us safe from terrorism,\" Mr Foley said.\n\n\"The police commissioner now has to report to two people. It's scandalous and another deal that is counter to the public interest.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the troubled relationship between the NSW attorney-general and minister for police has been addressed, with Ms Berejiklian confirming a reshaping of the much maligned \"justice cluster\".\n\nThe arrangement, whereby as justice and police minister Mr Grant held a more senior position than then attorney-general Gabrielle Upton, was heavily criticised by the legal profession.\n\nThe NSW Bar Association said it provided Mr Grant \"with unprecedented power in determining legal policy without the historical checks and balances\".\n\nThe NSW Law Society warned the arrangement meant police were \"ostensibly responsible for criminal law policy, while at the same time, the traditional roles of the attorney-general as first law officer of the state, which includes preserving civil liberties, are being eroded\".\n\nMs Berejiklian has confirmed the cluster has been reworked so that new attorney-general Mark Speakman, SC, is the lead minister.

A half-hour earlier, we had applauded the \"Adding Machine\" cast as they took their bows in the 50-seat Finborough Theatre, just up a winding staircase from where we were standing. \n \nIt was the last night of the show, a wrap of its brief fall run in London. It is a funny and bitter musical version of the 1923 satire by American playwright Elmer Rice, about an accountant who loses his job to automation. The tiny theater had rippled with the fury and despair of the main character's dawning realization that playing by the rules is for suckers. \n \nAnd now, the actors who had sang, emoted and danced were milling around with us, saying goodbye to their castmates and talking about their next assignments. One would devote the next few months to playing a villain in a panto, an exaggerated, live form of a fairy tale that has been popular in Britain since the 1700s. \n \nThe next day, I would fly back to Maryland after a five-day, five-show trip to London with a group organized by the Olney Theatre Center in Montgomery County. The excuse for the transatlantic excursion was \"Adding Machine's\" London debut: The book and lyrics were written by Olney artistic director Jason Loewith and Joshua Schmidt, who composed the music. \n \nNot that we needed an excuse. The trip provided a quick introduction to the incredible diversity of theater in a city with about 150 stages. \n \nMy advice: Venture beyond the shows you can see in the District or New York - \"Wicked\" and \"Mamma Mia!\" and the like. Instead, head to the West End, a district of about 40 theaters that is similar to Broadway, for star-driven revivals of British classics. And check out the off-West End theaters (there are more than 80) for the experiments, the raw emotion, the magic connection between artist and audience. You might luck into a play or an actor that has not yet been discovered by the masses. \n \nGlenday, the freelance critic for a blog called Musical Theatre Review, is all about those off-West End plays. In fact, he liked \"Adding Machine\" so much, he saw it twice. \n \nLoewith, who traveled with us, has attended \"Adding Machine\" performances around the world since the musical's 2007 debut outside Chicago. The London version was probably his favorite, he said. \n \nMaybe it's because London, where the first Juliet sadly murmured to the first Romeo that \"parting is such sweet sorrow,\" is justly proud of its rich theater history. Live performance is baked into the DNA of this city: In 2015, a pie shop hosted a run of \"Sweeney Todd.\" \n \n\"We're spoiled here,\" said Londoner Charlotte Thomas, who goes to a couple of shows a month and loves musicals. I spoke to her in the crowded lobby of the West End's Garrick Theatre during the intermission of \"The Entertainer,\" a revival of the 1957 classic by John Osborne, this time with Kenneth Branagh filling the role originated by Laurence Olivier. \n \n\"I try to see a show whenever I'm in London,\" said Colin Blaydon, a Dartmouth College professor in town with his wife, Linda, to give a speech. \"I look for spectacular actors,\" he said, which explains why they were at Wyndham's Theatre to see \"No Man's Land,\" another West End big-star remake of a British classic, with real-life besties Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart. \n \nThis is a particularly exciting time for London theater, said Michael Billington, theater critic for the Guardian newspaper since 1971 and probably the most qualified to issue that opinion. For one thing, he told our group, the audience is getting younger and more diverse. Young people these days think \"it is quite cool to go to theater,\" he said. \n \nThe changing audience demographics are starting to be reflected on the stage, with \"much more emphasis on gender equality and ethnic diversity,\" he said. So you can see Glenda Jackson as King Lear at the Old Vic or Lucian Msamati, who is black, as the composer Antonio Salieri in \"Amadeus\" at the National Theatre. \n \nThe diversity push isn't limited to actors. \"Eight years ago, there had never been the work of a living female playwright on the Olivier stage,\" Nina Steiger, senior dramaturge at the National Theatre, told us, referring to the largest of the theater's three stages. She's changing that. \n \nThe nonprofit theater, which opened in 1963, devotes considerable resources to workshops and collaborations to nurture new works. It recently launched \"A Pacifist's Guide to the War on Cancer,\" a musical meditation on illness and free will, which writer Bryony Kimmings developed in a National Theatre workshop in a co-production with Complicite Associates. \n \nAnother female playwright who's kind of a big deal right now? Ella Hickson, creator of \"Oil,\" a sprawling yet intimate look at the unlikely mix of family relationships, power and England's energy dependence. \"Oil\" premiered in October at the Almeida Theatre, one of the larger off-West End venues. During a Saturday matinee, the buzz was palpable before the first line was spoken. We knew we were seeing something ambitious and special. \n \nIn fact, all five plays, West End and off-West End, could be described as such. I loved seeing Branagh as a shabby showman in \"The Entertainer\" and adored the thought-provoking \"Oil.\" I guffawed at the meticulously timed slapstick of \"The Play That Goes Wrong,\" marveled at the acting in \"No Man's Land,\" and reeled at the bitterly funny cynicism of \"Adding Machine.\" \n \nWhen \"Adding Machine\" ended, I turned in my seat and asked Olivia Maffett, in the row behind me, what kind of theater she prefers. Maffett, who lives in London and goes to theater about once a month, said she likes it all: \"Here in London, you can find almost anything.\" \n \n--- \n \nNitkin is a freelance writer based in Ellicott City, Md. \n \n--- \n \nIf You Go \n \nPlanning a trip to London?

But, still, in the middle of the locker room, the biggest reasons why the Clippers suffered their worst loss of the season were printed in easy to read letters. \n \nLong after the Golden State Warriors beat the Clippers 144-98, the white board \u2014 where the game plan is scribbled before each game \u2014 four two-word sentences were the only words not erased. \n \n\u201cPlay hard. Play smart. Play together. Have fun.\u201d \n \nThey\u2019re written there every game, and Saturday, they\u2019d never been ignored more. \n \n\u201cI agree,\u201d the Clippers\u2019 DeAndre Jordan said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to figure it out because if not, we\u2019re going home early.\u201d \n \nThat Jordan is reflecting on the team\u2019s fate in April while the calendar still says January perfectly encapsulates the Clippers\u2019 issues against the Golden State Warriors \u2014 issues that couldn\u2019t have been easier to see if the team wore highlighter-green uniforms. \n \nAgainst the Warriors, everything seems bigger and more important because the Warriors \u2013 the NBA\u2019s best team \u2013 are better. \n \nThe Clippers\u2019 wins over San Antonio or Cleveland don\u2019t mean a thing inside Oracle Arena, where Golden State\u2019s beaten the Clippers 10 straight times. Against the Warriors (who have now won the last eight meetings between the two, no matter the venue), the Clippers just freeze. \n \n\u201cYou want it to so bad, you almost psyche yourself out of it,\u201d Blake Griffin said. \n \nIt\u2019s why Austin Rivers unleashed a few four-letter words when asked if the Warriors hold a mental edge over his team. It\u2019s why two early fouls to Griffin feels like a death sentence. It\u2019s why the first pass that sails into the seats seems to lead to another and another. And, it\u2019s why each Golden State basket \u2013 and boy, do these guys make baskets \u2013 feels like it\u2019s worth two or three times the points it puts on the scoreboard. \n \n\u201cThe mistakes kind of build,\u201d J.J. Redick said. \u201cAs they take advantage of it, it becomes like an avalanche. You saw that at the end of the first half.\u201d \n \nThe Warriors scored 17 points in 2 minutes and 38 seconds to close the second quarter, a stretch Redick described as \u201csome (expletive)\u201d that happened. \n \nStephen Curry, who scored 25 of his 43 points in the third quarter, closed the first half by sinking a one-footed jumper from beyond midcourt to beat the buzzer. \n \nWhile it\u2019s hard to simulate stopping Curry, the Clippers had the NBA equivalent to a bye week \u2014 three days off \u2014 to prepare. But once they got on the court, all the work and preparation simply got erased. \n \n \n\u201cA loss like this, it\u2019s made a lot worse with the type of effort we gave in stretches. For the whole game, we didn\u2019t play with the right type of attitude. We kind of went through the motions,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t attack. We had two great days of practice where we were attacking. Guys were playing hard. Defensively we were great. And, then to come out here on the stage that you were practicing for and not to do it, it\u2019s embarrassing.\u201d \n \nThey didn\u2019t play hard enough. They didn\u2019t play smart enough. They weren\u2019t together, and they sure didn\u2019t have fun. \n \n\u201cWe were horrible,\u201d Doc Rivers said. \u201cI thought we gave in way too easy. You should never lose by this much in any game, in any situation. But they\u2019re better right now. \n \n\u201cUntil we improve, they\u2019re going to keep beating us.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: NBA - Golden State Warriors news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: NBA - Los Angeles Clippers news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Golden State Warriors blast L.A.

Throw a chair, a shoe (at him), he\u2019s going to shoot it.\u201d \n \nBut there once was a time where Speights wouldn\u2019t drift beyond the 3-point line, a place once reserved for the league\u2019s guards. \n \nBut when Steve Kerr got hired to coach the Golden State Warriors and Speights, he decided to see if the 6-foot-10 big man had a little Larry Bird in him. \n \n\u201cI went to him and said, \u2018Do you think you could take one more step out and become a 3-point shooter?\u201d Kerr remembered. \u201cI watched a ton of tape of him when I got the job and he was making one 22-footer after another. He was a pick-and-pop guy. He had a big Game 7 against the Clippers the previous year and had 10 or 12 points in limited minutes and hit some huge shots. But, he was never outside of that line. \n \n\u201cI just asked him what he thought.\u201d \n \nIn the first year after they spoke, Speights actually took 13 fewer 3\u2019s than he did the season before. But last year, his second with Kerr, Speights launched 62 3\u2019s \u2013 a new career high. And after making 38.7 percent of them, he signed with Clippers and got the greenest of lights. \n \nPrior to Saturday\u2019s game back in Oakland, Speights had taken 166 3-point shots \u2014 more than he attempted over his entire career. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s been natural for him,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cThree\u2019s aren\u2019t a hard shot for him. You can see it. It\u2019s a natural shot. ... Telling Mo to shoot is not that hard to do.\u201d \n \nThe increased volume hasn\u2019t come with a dip in efficiency, with Speights making over 40 percent from deep this year. \n \n\u201cI think he spent a lot of time in that offseason two summers ago, really working on his 3-point shot. He just seemed to get more comfortable with it last year, and this year, he\u2019s automatic.\u201d \n DJ an \u2018automatic\u2019 All-Star  \nPrior to DeAndre Jordan turning in kind of a stinker Saturday night, the Warriors\u2019 head coach sure made it seem like he voted to include Jordan on the Western Conference All-Star team. \n \n\u201cHe absolutely deserved it,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cHe was, to me, one of the automatics when you consider what he does night in and night out.\u201d \n \nKerr said he loves the way the Clippers\u2019 defensive-minded center plays. \n \n\u201cWe used to always say you know guys of value on the other team, offensively or defensively,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cThere are certain guys who you know bother your team when they\u2019re on the floor. When D.J. is on the floor, he bothers the other team.\u201d \n \n Quick hits  \nDoc Rivers continues to battle an undiagnosed illness. \u201cIt\u2019s hasn\u2019t been fun,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been three weeks now, so it\u2019s not been a fun stretch. I\u2019ll get through it. I just want to find out what the hell it is to be honest.\u201d ...

Comedian Keith Wann owned the stage in the Burlington-Edison High School auditorium \u2014 jumping, dancing and emoting his way to laughs from the audience.\n\nBut most of the time, Wann was silent.\n\nThough Wann can hear and speak, his first language \u2014 and the language in which he performs \u2014 is American Sign Language. \n\n\"I say English is my second language, even though I'm a hearing person,\" said Wann, who is the son of two deaf parents. \"That's my goal is to bring these two worlds together.\"\n\nWann, a California native now living in Brooklyn, was brought to Burlington-Edison by the school's Happy Hands ASL Club.\n\n\"He's like the Kevin Hart of the deaf world,\" said Happy Hands Club member Abbey Maroney, a sophomore. \"He's really famous.\"\n\nSome of Wann's jokes \u2014 like unplugging the vacuum while his mother was using it to see how long it would take her to notice \u2014 resonate more with the deaf community than with the hearing community, he said.\n\nBy drawing from his own experiences, he is able to give the speaking and hearing ASL students a glimpse of life as a deaf or hard-of-hearing person, reported the Skagit Valley Herald (http://bit.ly/2kknpM1).\n\n\"It's a great way to share culture,\" he said.\n\nEarlier in the day, Wann spoke with ASL students, who were thrilled to have him around.\n\n\"(Having Wann is) such a big deal for our school and our club,\" junior Jayla Dunn said.\n\n\"And also our town,\" junior Jenica Medina chimed in.\n\nWhile Burlington-Edison High School has no deaf students, Dunn said she became interested in learning sign language to be able to communicate with more people.\n\n\"I was really excited to be able to make conversation with such a diverse population,\" she said. \"You can always have them lip read, but it's such a deeper connection when you speak the same language.\n\nFor Wann, the students' excitement is a sign of change. He remembers the stigma his parents faced while he was growing up.\n\n\"Now it's cool,\" he said. \"If I was a teenager now, I'd get a lot more dates than I did in the '80s.\"\n\nDuring his 20 years as a performer, Wann's parents have remained an inspiration for his comedy show, he said.\n\n\"I feel like I want to sign in case my parents ever came to a show,\" he said.\n\nWhile his wife has served as his speaking interpreter for his comedy shows, Wann said he also often has local people \u2014 such as Happy Hands adviser Liza Bancroft \u2014 interpret sign language into speech.\n\n\"He's so well-respected and well-known in the deaf community,\" Bancroft said. \"So it's a real unique opportunity.\"\n\nOpportunity awaits the students continuing their ASL education as well, Wann said.\n\n\"You are learning our language,\" Wann signed during his show. \"You have two choices: You can use that language to help deaf people ... or you can use it to hurt them.

They were able to talk him down a bit. \n \nThey will put it in the Evel Knievel thrill show museum in Topeka, Kansas. The Sky Cycle will go with a scale model of the jump. They are using some of the original ramp and they want some of the original dirt. \n \n\"Everything we have is authentic and actual dirt and soil and rocks from the actual launch site to complete the job,\" McKay said. \n \nMcKay and Truax are talking with the Parks and Rec department to get the okay to take a small amount of dirt. The museum is set to open this summer. Along with that exhibit they plan to have a plaque explaining what happened in Twin Falls and that the dirt was from there. \n \nAt the museum they plan to have a portion dedicated to science, technology, engineering and math, or STEM, education for children. They say that should be easy considering that Evel Knievel wasn't the only hero of his stunts. \n \n\"The other hero of the story was the rocket and I\u2019m excited to be able to hopefully excite a new generation of kids to be interested in science technology and rocketry because we need those things,\" Truax said. \n \nThey are also excited to share with the next generation the things that they looked up to about Knievel. \n \n\"I want my children to believe and know that they can do anything they set their minds to and Evel will always be a representation of that,\" Truax said. \n \nThe pair have a documentary about Knievel's son called \"Chasing Evel\" debuting on Feb. 19 in the Big Sky Film Festival. They also will have a theatrical movie coming out about Eddie Braun's jump over the Snake River Canyon in September. They said they have footage of the jump that has not been released yet. \n \nThe two have been involved in multiple movies about Knievel. They love sharing what they can about him and his message. \n \n\"it's just about living your dreams, never giving up and seeing things through. That's it for me,\" McKay said.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: fine arts news","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"Evel Knievel museum curator wants to take small piece of Twin Falls to Kansas","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Twin Falls","zipCode":"83301","state":"Idaho","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Twin Falls","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"KMVT","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169685256","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"45"},"name":"KMVT","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.kmvt.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194520508","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:16:13Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

He joins a group of other dogs who are all waiting for new families to take them to new homes. \n \nChuck only has other dogs to explain to him that he is living at a shelter. There are some nice people there, but none of them have the time for him the way his human Mom and Dad did. \n \nAs Chuck found out, \u201cThere's nothing better than a loving forever home.\u201d \n \nEventually, he makes it to a new home, several states away, with a new family welcoming him with open arms. \n \nThe story was inspired by the author's own adoption of a black Labrador, Charlie, who is now 10 years old. \n \n\u201cIt was important to me to create something that would serve a much greater purpose,\u201d said Soares. \u201cWriting \u2018Chuck\u2019s Journey Home\u2019 gave me the opportunity to honor our own rescued dog and share the plight of shelter dogs all over. The hope is that, over time, more people will consider visiting their local shelters and adopt their pets.\u201d \n \nThe book is written for readers aged six to nine. \n \n\u201cIt is ideal for any family looking to adopt a dog, or any family who loves dogs,\u201d Soares said. \n \n\u201cChuck's Journey Home\u201d can be purchased through SDP Publishing, Amazon, Barnes and Noble, and at most online retailers.

And the process is continuing day by day and minute by minute. History has stopped. Nothing exists except an endless present in which the Party is always right.\u201d \n \nIn Orwell\u2019s dystopia, where language is changed into the Party\u2019s Newspeak \u2014 and a Party slogan is \u201cIgnorance is Strength\u201d \u2014 the first primary means of thought control is Crimestop. He writes: \n \n\u201cCrimestop means the faculty of stopping short, as though by instinct, at the threshold of any dangerous thought. It includes the power of not grasping analogies, of failing to perceive logical errors, of misunderstanding the simplest arguments\u2026 Crimestop, in short, means protective stupidity.\u201d \n \n\u201cPower is in tearing human minds to pieces and putting them together again in new shapes of your own choosing.\u201d \n \n\u201cIt Can\u2019t Happen Here,\u201d a 1935 dystopian novel by Sinclair Lewis, hit No. 7 on Amazon\u2019s Bestseller list as of Wednesday night (the list is updated hourly.) \n \nThe pre-World War II semi-satirical political novel by the Pulitzer Prize winning author is, according to the publisher\u2019s synopsis, a \u201ccautionary tale about the fragility of democracy, it is an alarming, eerily timeless look at how fascism could take hold in America.\u201d \n \nHitting No. 9 that night was a book written 86 years ago: Aldous Huxley\u2019s 1931 novel, \u201cBrave New World.\u201d \n \nIn Huxley\u2019s dystopia, set in London in the year 2540, or 632 A.F., \u201dAfter Ford,\u201d humans are created and conditioned according to the society's strict caste system, life has been almost entirely industrialized to create consumers, and is controlled by a few people at the top of a World State. \n \nRay Bradbury\u2019s dystopian \u201cFahrenheit 451\u201d \u2014 a bleak future where television rules, books are burned and literature is on the brink of extinction \u2014 hit number 17 on that list on Wednesday night. \n \nAt No. 27, Margaret Atwood\u2019s dystopian \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d about a future where women are second class citizens, valued only as reproductive units to create babies, and are barred from reading. \n \nI won\u2019t go into the hows and whys. Hey, maybe a whole lot of English teachers assigned dystopian novels last week. And after all, this is only one site\u2019s list. \n \nI\u2019ll just say that when the winds of change shift, we fall back into art, words, music, poetry. We fall back on writers. Have since the dawn of the written word. Before that, we looked to fire and drumbeat, cave paintings of animal fat and pigment smeared on rock walls. \n \nWe look to ideas, to words, because we need to look to something that feels permanent and real. We look to ink, formed into shapes, stamped onto wood and pulp. We hold them in our hands. Or we see them on a screen, illuminated, glowing, black and white sculptures that fire neurons inside our skulls. \n \nOptic fibers translating some code, something ancient, into cells, into strands of fiber and carbon. Synapses, nerve endings pulsing inside casement of bone. Blood flows, pulses quickens. Breath changes. Something is released. Something is eased. \n \nOrwell died in 1950. This week, droves of people bought his book. So maybe this passage is the truest thing he ever wrote: \n \n\u201cWe are the dead. Our only true life is in the future. We shall take part in it as handfuls of dust and splinters of bone\u2026We can only spread our knowledge outwards from individual to individual, generation after generation\u2026 there is no other way.\u201d \n \nLauren Daley is a book columnist and freelance writer.

Lucy, the dog\u2019s current canine companion, needs just a little tidying and nail trimming. \n \n\u201cI wanted a dog that was easy to groom,\u201d Tavares continues, adding that she enjoys large breeds, such as boxers and Dobermans. \u201cBig dogs get into a lot of mischief but they are a lot of fun.\u201d \n \nAnother local dog fancier who has a lot of fun is Paul Brown of Middletown, Rhode Island, who travels weekly to train at the Wampanoag club. \n \nBrown has owned Australian shepherds for more than 15 years, and enjoys competing in obedience. \n \n\u201cThey have high intelligence and they have a lot of drive,\u201d he says of the breed that was developed to herd livestock, often on large tracts of land. \n \nBrown says he\u2019s particularly enjoyed his long association with the Wampanoag Kennel Club. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s been a lot of fun,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s helped me to learn more about obedience. I\u2019ve always enjoyed having the dogs. They keep me going.\u201d \n \nLongtime obedience trainer and Rottweiler enthusiast Ed Dupont has served as the kennel club\u2019s trainer for more than 16 years and assumed the role following the death of the late Al Kirby of Westport. \n \nKirby, a breeder of Pembroke Welsh corgis and Great Danes, trained dogs for several decades and was considered to be a legend in the local canine community. \n \nDupont has exhibited champion Rottweilers, Chesapeake Bay retrievers, toy fox terriers and many other breeds. He has also exhibited at the prestigious Westminster Kennel Club held annually at Madison Square Garden in New York City. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s different all the time,\u201d Dupont says, adding that each training class presents new challenges and opportunities. \n \nZurawski adds that while some participants enroll is a basic obedience class and stay for just a few weeks, others get hooked and become active participants in the sport. \n \nSome people, like Zurawski, train their canines in obedience to earn degrees, while some owners train their dogs to earn therapy titles and visit nursing homes and health care centers. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s been exciting,\u201d says Dupont. \u201cI enjoy the sport.

He may have been there for as many as five days. \n  Popular Video  This inmate walked out of his cell and started viciously beating a guard.

But then...   \nThe single mother, 30, is Pacific Islander and lives with family in Sydney. The father has been identified, but police have not been able to locate him; he is not under investigation. \n \nThe baby was discovered by cyclists who heard him crying alongside the Quaker Hill motorway in Sydney. \n \n\u201cIt was so intense; you couldn't not tell it was a baby. We couldn't see it but we could hear it. It was distressed,\u201d David Otte, one of the four cyclists that found the baby, said. \n \nUpon rescue, police concluded the baby had been abandoned and dropped just over 8 feet through an opening in the drain. \n \n\n \nThe drain was covered by a concrete slab that weighed over 440 pounds. It took six people to lift the slab in order to rescue the baby. \n \n\"It was already undernourished and dehydration would have taken effect,\" Inspector Lagats said. \n \nPolice believe the child would not have survived the day due to the expected hot temperature had it not been discovered in the early morning, reports  ABC . \n \n\u201cThat baby had no chance if we and the other people hadn't been there.

It's a horrific incident ... but with all the team work from the bystanders too, it was a good result and hopefully the child will survive.\u201d \n \nWhile attempted murder charges are expected against the mother, she has yet to be formally charged. \n \nSources:  ABC ,  The Daily Mail  / Photo Source:  The Daily Mail","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Charles Roberts"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Mom Does Something Awful To Newborn Baby (Photos)","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Opposing Views","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"329146125","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"Opposing Views","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.opposingviews.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2845714/Newborn-baby-boy-dumped-drain-cyclists-heard-crying.html","http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-11-23/abandoned-babys-mother-identified/5912232"],"sequenceId":"695194536278","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:02:02Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:16:20Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://imgur.com/5nbSEwJ.jpg"},{"url":"http://images.opposingviews.com:8080/ovi/catalog/downloads/preview/rndr_670x300//2017/01/rndr670x377-3-1485673310.jpg/rndr_670x300.jpg"},{"url":"http://imgur.com/K1vG97D.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

It\u2019s not up to me.\u201d \n \nA few hours earlier, McGregor (21-3 MMA, 9-1 UFC) issued perhaps his biggest swipe at the UFC, boasting he\u2019d outdrawn the promotion after counter-programming the FOX-televised event with a sit-down interview streamed via online pay-per-view. \n \nOn Instagram, he wrote, \u201cI\u2019m so made! Heading to do a Q and A in front of 5000 fans! You read that right. That\u2019s more than UFC attendance tonight. (Expletive) the UFC. (Expletive) Floyd. (Expletive) boxing. (Expletive) the WWE. (Expletive) Hollywood. And (expletive) you too pay me.\u201d \n   \nAlthough he admitted he hadn\u2019t heard all of McGregor\u2019s words, White\u2019s pointed response was the most serious counter to the lightweight champ\u2019s brash form of self-promotion, which has frequently targeted the UFC as he\u2019s grown into one of its biggest stars. The executive didn\u2019t entirely take the bait, however, linking McGregor\u2019s statement to efforts to push an online product. \n \n\u201cI didn\u2019t hear all that,\u201d White said. \u201cHey, listen, when you\u2019re about to do a pay-per-view that you\u2019re charging people five bucks to listen to you talk, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve got to say some pretty crazy (expletive).\u201d \n \nAs the crazy idea of ever seeing Mayweather and McGregor in a ring, White shot that down, too. \n \n\u201cHere\u2019s what I think the chances are: About the same as me being the backup quarterback for (Tom) Brady on (Super Bowl) Sunday,\u201d he said. \n \nWhite previously made headlines when he offered Mayweather and McGregor $25 million each and a cut of pay-per-view profits to step into the squared circle. Mayweather dismissed the offer outright. \n \nSince that exchange, White said there\u2019d been no talks with the Mayweather camp and added his offer didn\u2019t signal a renewed interest in the bout. \n \n\u201c(I made an offer) because (Mayweather) was full of (expletive),\u201d White said. \u201cHe said he had made an offer, which wasn\u2019t true. So I made a real offer.\u201d \n \nIs there a chance, though, all the talk is just a prelude to a blockbuster? \n \n\u201cI\u2019ll be suiting up Sunday,\u201d White deadpanned. \n \nFor more on UFC on FOX 23 , check out the UFC Events section of MMAjunkie. \n  \nUFC on FOX 23 , Featured , Featured Videos , News , UFC , Videos \n  1.7k  shares","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Steven Marrocco"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Dana White issues warning to Conor McGregor after Instagram outburst","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Tompkins","zipCode":"14850","state":"New York","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Ithaca","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Ithaca Journal","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169738628","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"47"},"name":"Ithaca Journal","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Sports"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.theithacajournal.com","publisher":"Gannett"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://mmajunkie.com/author/mmajunkiesteven","http://mmajunkie.com/author/justin-park","http://mmajunkie.com/2017/01/conor-mcgregor-boasts-5000-attendance-for-live-ppv-interview-and-declares-expletive-the-ufc","http://mmajunkie.com/2017/01/dana-white-offers-conor-mcgregor-and-floyd-mayweather-25-million-each-and-ppv-cut","http://mmajunkie.com/events/ufc-on-fox-23","http://mmajunkie.com/events","http://mmajunkie.com/tag/ufc-on-fox-23","http://mmajunkie.com/category/featured","http://mmajunkie.com/category/featured-videos","http://mmajunkie.com/category/news","http://mmajunkie.com/category/ufc","http://mmajunkie.com/category/videos","http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2017/01/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/636212444297671744-USP-MMA-UFC-196-WEIGH-INS-80234684.JPG","http://rssfeeds.ithacajournal.com/_/28/264420536/ithaca/sports","http://rssfeeds.ithacajournal.com/_/30/264420536/ithaca/sports","http://rssfeeds.ithacajournal.com/_/29/264420536/ithaca/sports,","http://rssfeeds.ithacajournal.com/_/24/264420536/ithaca/sports","http://rssfeeds.ithacajournal.com/_/19/264420536/ithaca/sports","http://rssfeeds.ithacajournal.com/_/20/264420536/ithaca/sports"],"sequenceId":"695194537859","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:08:42Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:16:20Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2017/01/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/636212444297671744-USP-MMA-UFC-196-WEIGH-INS-80234684.JPG"}],"video":[]}}

The unethical and discriminatory treatment of law-abiding, hard-working and well-integrated immigrants fundamentally contravenes the founding principles of the United States,\" the letter reads. \n\nThe academics list three grounds for their opposition, saying the executive order is \"discriminatory,\" is \"detrimental to the national interests of the United States\" and \"imposes undue burden on members of our community.\" \n\nIt goes on to say that the disruption this ban will cause is \"inhumane, ineffective and un-American.\" \n\nAsked about the travel ban at the White House Saturday afternoon, Trump rejected a description of the order as a \"Muslim ban\" and said it was \"working out very nicely.\" \n\nThe petition began late Thursday evening and was spread by word of mouth in the academic community, Mohammad Akbarpour, an assistant professor of economics in graduate school of business at Stanford University. He is from Iran and said the impact this ban will have on students and fellow academics is vast. \n\n\"Iranian students are panicked as they cannot leave the country or come back. We have multiple students who left the country just last week for conferences and visits, and now they can't return,\" Akbarpour said. \"The families of these students want to visit them here and now they cannot.\" \n\n\"Families with valid visas are being denied entry and green card holders are advised not to leave the country. My friends in academia with pending permanent residency applications are being told they may have to leave,\" he added. \n\nHis colleague, Paul Milgrom, a professor of economics at Stanford, as well as a member of the National Academy of Sciences, told CNN the ban may cause issues for the entire economic community. \n\n\"This policy does not seem to be based on facts. We in the academic and scientific community are very concerned with working toward policy based on facts,\" he said.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Thousands of academics sign letter opposing Trump's ban","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Boone","zipCode":"65201","state":"Missouri","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Columbia","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"ABC 17 News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"479331601","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"13"},"name":"ABC 17 News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Lifestyle"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.abc17news.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194540591","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:16:24Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

There's a very strong nexus between our immigration and visa programs and terrorist plots and extremist networks inside the United States,\" the official continued. \"Look at the recent, high-profile attacks that have occurred inside the country -- an immigration nexus is not at all uncommon. I won't go through the list of them all now. One obvious example would be Tashfeen Malik and the San Bernadino incident with the K1 visa.\" \n\nA K1 visa is a non-immigrant visa issued to the foreign-citizen fiance of a US citizen. Tashfeen Malik was from a family of wealthy landowners in Pakistan and later moved to Saudi Arabia with her immediate family. Her husband, Syed Rizwan Farook, was a US citizen. \n\nPakistan and Saudi Arabia, however, are not on the list of countries subject to the new ban. \n\nThe administration is facing criticism from leaders in the U.S. and around the world for taking steps their critics say are unconstitutional and anti-American. \n\nThe second mention of San Bernardino came when the official was trying to explain why there was no grace period before the executive order went into effect, to help ease implementation. \n\n\"Imagine if this had been an executive order that had been contemplated the day before the San Bernardino shooter entered the United States?\" the official asked. \"Would have delaying its implementation served the best interests of the country? The reality is we don't know who the next individual is who will exploit our immigration programs successfully.

They\u2019re nice, unassuming, and efficient. \n \nPerhaps that \u2014 and the fact that they\u2019re everywhere \u2014 explains how we routinely look past them. I mean you don\u2019t hear people saying \u201cMy geraniums are having a banner year.\u201d And you would never think to transpose the wording \u201cA rose by any other name would smell as sweet\u201d with \u201cgeranium.\u201d \n \nBlame it on their unfussy, reliable nature. They are used almost without thinking to fill a void.  \n \nAnd yet, in a different setting \u2014 beyond the window box or graveyard \u2014 during a different season, a geranium suddenly transforms into the It-Girl of the flower kingdom. \n \nWell, that is how it seemed the other day coming in from a routine walk around the neighborhood, feeling a bit down in the mouth, everything saturated in monochromatic shades of grey and brown and bleak as January often is without the snow. \n \nI was hunched over, removing my boots in the front entrance, and I saw them saluting me in their winsome way, against the dreary winter world outdoors. \n \nI nodded appreciatively and reached for my camera, happy for the momentary pick-me-up. \n \nCommon garden geraniums (not to be confused with the hardy, sprawling cranesbill perennial of a different family) properly fall under the genus known as pelargoniums originating from South Africa and comprised of four different groups known in botanical circles as 1) Show or Fancy pelargoniums, 2)  Zonal geraniums 3) Ivy-leaved geraniums 4) Scented geraniums. \n \nUnder discussion here are zonal geraniums that have been bred for size, abundance and color, resulting in ever-increasing variety. Maybe because of this and their rather flashy colors, they have been snubbed as ordinary.  \n \nAlthough they are prevalent, they hold a special place in my heart, stemming from the fact that they were one of the first plants I took note of as a child exploring my limited environments. \n \nMy maternal grandma was a busy woman (an understatement having raised 12 children and helping out with many more grandchildren) and yet her house had those classic bright red flowers decorating the window boxes. I can recall standing on tiptoes to see them. \n \nAt my other grandmother\u2019s house, I remember the plants taking over the spacious windowsills of their small family-run grocery shop above which the family lived. \n \nAnd I loved seeing them year after year as part of the scenery, practically encroaching (a bit like Little Shop of Horrors) on the shelves of comestibles, toiletries such as  Brylcreem, the sacred \u2018altar\u2019 of penny candy and a huge walk in butcher\u2019s freezer.  \n \nAgain and again over time, geraniums have enveloped me in foreign ports and hometown alike! With that kind of history it\u2019s no wonder I continue to propagate them. \n \nThere are three ways you can go with your geraniums once they have seen you through the summer season. You can let them die as annuals (a wasteful proposition if you ask me), bring them indoors as houseplants or take cuttings and make more plants. \n \nThere is another option: dormant storage without soil. In this way their means of survival is through their thick, succulent-like stems. It is done by shaking off the soil from the roots after digging the plants up in fall. Then by hanging them upside-down in open paper bags from the rafters in a cool (45-50 degree), dark location for the winter. \n \nTwo or three times during the winter you need to remove the plants and soak the roots in water for a couple of hours. Discard any with shriveled stems and in late March pot up the survivors. Water and cut back the stem tips, placing them in a sunny window to initiate growth. This phase will take several weeks.  \n \nIf you choose to overwinter them instead, keep them tidy and occasionally pinch them to keep plants in proportion and encourage growth, watering when the soil begins to dry. \n \nIt is advisable to change the soil to a potting soil which is looser than most garden soil and therefore easier for drainage. When May arrives add fertilizer and transplant \u2014 you\u2019re plants will have a head start. \n \nTo grow new plants from cuttings, use cuttings 3 to 5 inches long of young, short jointed shoots in early September. \n \nInsert in a mix of two-parts soil and one-part sand, placing five of these around the edge of a 5-inch pot. Water and stand in shady position outside or in cool greenhouse for two weeks, by which time a callus will have formed. Move to a sunny position in the greenhouse or cold frame. \n \nWhen well-rooted pot singly in 3 inch pots, using potting mix and repotting in February or early March in 5 inch pots where they will stay until being planted in the garden at the end of May. Water sparingly during the winter or stems will rot and die. Temperature should be 45-60 degrees. Remove flower buds until April. \n \nNew plants produced from cuttings should be vigorous and about the same size as most geraniums sold in spring.  \n \nThis type of geranium grows well in ordinary garden soil, if not too rich in nitrogen, which makes the plants develop fleshy stems and leaves but few flowers.

The Department of Homeland Security was left making a legal analysis on the order after Trump signed it. A Border Patrol agent, confronted with arriving refugees, referred questions only to the President himself, according to court filings. \n\nSaturday night, a federal judge granted an emergency stay for citizens of the affected countries who had already arrived in the US and those who are in transit and hold valid visas, ruling they can legally enter the US. \n\nTrump's unilateral moves, which have drawn the ire of human rights groups and prompted protests at US airports, reflect the President's desire to quickly make good on his campaign promises. But they also encapsulate the pitfalls of an administration largely operated by officials with scant federal experience. \n\nIt wasn't until Friday -- the day Trump signed the order banning travel from seven Muslim-majority countries for 90 days and suspending all refugee admission for 120 days -- that career homeland security staff were allowed to see the final details of the order, a person familiar with the matter said. \n\nThe result was widespread confusion across the country on Saturday as airports struggled to adjust to the new directives. In New York, two Iraqi nationals sued the federal government after they were detained at John F. Kennedy International Airport, and 10 others were detained as well. \n\nIn Philadelphia, a Syrian family of six who had a visa through a family connection in the US was placed on a return flight to Doha, Qatar, and Department of Homeland Security officials said others who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. \n\nAsked during a photo opportunity in the Oval Office Saturday afternoon about the rollout, Trump said his government was \"totally prepared.\" \n\n\"It's working out very nicely,\" Trump told reporters. \"You see it at the airports. You see it all over. It's working out very nicely and we're going to have a very, very strict ban, and we're going to have extreme vetting, which we should have had in this country for many years.\" \n\nThe policy team at the White House developed the executive order on refugees and visas, and largely avoided the traditional interagency process that would have allowed the Justice Department and homeland security agencies to provide operational guidance, according to numerous officials who spoke to CNN on Saturday. \n\nHomeland Security Secretary John Kelly and Department of Homeland Security leadership saw the final details shortly before the order was finalized, government officials said. \n\nFriday night, DHS arrived at the legal interpretation that the executive order restrictions applying to seven countries -- Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Sudan and Yemen -- did not apply to people who with lawful permanent residence, generally referred to as green card holders. \n\nThe White House overruled that guidance overnight, according to officials familiar with the rollout. That order came from the President's inner circle, led by Stephen Miller and Steve Bannon. Their decision held that, on a case by case basis, DHS could allow green card holders to enter the US. \n\nThere had been some debate whether green card holders should be even allowed to board international flights. It was decided by the Department of Homeland Security they could fly to the US and would be considered on a case-by-case basis after passing a secondary screening. \n\nBut the guidance sent to airlines on Friday night, obtained by CNN, said clearly, \"lawful permanent residents are not included and may continue to travel to the USA.\" \n\nAs of Saturday afternoon, Customs and Border Protection continued to issue the same guidance to airlines as it did Friday, telling airlines that fly to the US that green card holders can board planes to the US but they may get extra scrutiny on arrival, according to an airline official. \n\nBefore the President issued the order, the White House did not seek the legal guidance of the Office of Legal Counsel, the Justice Department office that interprets the law for the executive branch. A source said the executive order did not follow the standard agency review process that's typically overseen by the National Security Council, though the source couldn't specifically say if that included the decision to not have the order go through the Office of Legal Counsel. \n\nSeparately, a person familiar with the matter said career officials in charge of enforcing the executive order were not fully briefed on the specifics until Friday. The officials were caught off guard by some of the specifics and raised questions about how to handle the new banned passengers on US-bound planes. \n\nRegarding the green card holders and some of the confusion about whether they were impacted, the person familiar with the matter said if career officials had known more about the executive order earlier, some of the confusion could have been avoided and a better plan could be in place. \n\nAdministration officials also defended the process Saturday. They said the people who needed to be briefed ahead of time on the plane were briefed and that people at the State Department and DHS who were involved in the process were able to make decisions about who to talk and inform about this. \n\nBannon and Miller were running point on this order and giving directives regarding green cards, according to a Republican close to the White House. \n\nBut even after the Friday afternoon announcement, administration officials at the White House took several hours to produce text of the action until several hours after it was signed. Adviser Kellyanne Conway even said at one point it was not going to be released before eventually it did get sent out. \n\nAdministration officials also seemed unsure at first who was covered in the action, and a list of impacted countries was only produced later on Friday night, hours after the President signed the document at the Pentagon.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Inside the confusion of Trump's immigration ban","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Boone","zipCode":"65201","state":"Missouri","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Columbia","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"ABC 17 News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"479331601","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"13"},"name":"ABC 17 News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Lifestyle"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.abc17news.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194547130","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:16:25Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Buddy's award was presented by NSW Deputy Premier and local member John Barilaro.\n\nOne hundred and twenty seven dogs turned up for the inaugural event in 2016.\n\nBungendore Show, which was first held in the 1840s, has gone from strength to strength in recent decades, this year's showgirl, Hanna Darmody, 22, said.\n\nMs Darmody, whose family own a Bungendore butchery, said she could recall helping with the catering at the show as a toddler almost 20 years ago.\n\n\"I've seen the event grow as the town has grown,\" she said. \"It is a great bridge between country and city; the showgirl competition is a good way to get young people involved and promotes opportunities in agriculture.\"\n\nShow organisers said this year's event, which enjoyed the best weather conditions in three years, was an unqualified success with more than 2000 people passing through the gates before lunch.\n\nIn addition to the usual attractions in the show ring and the pavilions and the dachshund dash, the 2017 event offered visitors a chance to get a close look at the Anzac Centennial 18 pounder gun.\n\nThe World War I-era weapon, which also saw service during World War II,was restored by the Royal Australian Artillery Company in conjunction with veteran coach builder Jim Frecklington.

Vaidya was answering a query on reservation based on religion, which BJP is also against, he said. \n \nWhen asked why the Ram Temple issue suddenly cropped up in the BJP poll manifesto even when the party has clarified it is fighting the polls on developmental issues, Shah said BJP is \u201cvery clear\u201d about building the Ram temple. \u201cIt can only be done under the Constitutional provisions: either through dialogue or through court order. Yes, we are definitely committed to building a Ram temple, but within the Constitutional provisions,\u201d he said. \n \nThe BJP chief took strong exception to allegations that his party was practicing the politics of polarization. \u201cThere is a lot of anger in UP. If a leader questions the politics of appeasement and casteism being practiced in UP, you can\u2019t call that polarization,\u201d he said. Shah also said his party was of the firm view that Triple Talaq curtails fundamental rights of women guaranteed by the Constitution. \n \nHe made it evident that the BJP campaign in UP will veer around the \u201ccollapse\u201d of law and order under the Akhilesh Yadav government, and stressed on issues like women\u2019s security and increasing migration. \n \nAs for the other elections happening along with UP, Shah said his party will win Uttarakhand easily while in Punjab it was a triangular fight. As for sending defence minister Manohar Parrikar back to Goa as CM if the party comes back to power, Shah had this to say: \u201cThe party has not yet decided to send Manohar Parrikar back to Goa as CM. What we have said is that if people of Goa and the elected MLAs want, both the options are open.\u201d \n \nWatch the video here","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Amit Shah Dares Oppn to Make UP Polls a Referendum on Demonetisation","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"News18.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"590783480","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"31"},"name":"News18.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.news18.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194550488","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:16:23Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Popular sites like Sivvi.com, Souq.com, Namshi.com and Jadopado.com are very optimistic that the growth in this sector is inevitable as Dubai is evolving as a tech-savvy smart city. \n \n\"In general the e-commerce market is a growing market and people's habits are changing. More people are shopping online and the consumer is more educated. If people go to the mall they still check online. We think this behaviour and the rise of the savvy consumer has definitely contributed to online growth,\" said Rashid Alabbar, founder, Sivvi.com. \n \nAlabbar is son of Mohamed Alabbar, founder and chairman of Emaar Properties. \n \nThe Alabbars took a huge leap in e-commerce recently when Mohamed Alabbar announced the launch of his venture Noon, the Middle East's largest online shopping platform, that will use the high-street fashion segment as a central plank in its strategy to dominate the region's fast-growing e-commerce sector. \n \nOne of the emirate's richest families, the Alabbars are making a very aggressive foray in online retail. \"Our business has grown double digit month on month in 2016, and we expect to continue the trend for 2017. We go inline with market trends and demands and currently have over 200 brands. Our brands range from sports giants like adidas, Nike and Reebok to fashion favourites like Mango, Riva and Forever 21. We also recently introduced beauty to our list which has been performing very well, with a large demand for these products in the region. Clothing performed the best out of all the categories as well as shoes, accessories and beauty. We have noticed there is a strong demand for sportswear as well as trend focused pieces,\" said Alabbar. \n \nThe e-commerce sector hugely benefited from the Dubai Shopping Festival 2017, which concludes today. Saeed Mohammad Measam Al Falasi, executive director, retail and strategic alliances, Dubai Festivals and Retail Establishment (DFRE) an agency of the Department of Tourism and Commerce Marketing (Dubai Tourism), said: Shopping patterns and trends constantly change, and in Dubai and the UAE it is no different, as the online shopping phenomenon is catching on fast. As the leading shopping hub in the region, Dubai offers a unique and diverse experience for shoppers whether it is at neighbourhood community malls or mega malls, the traditional souqs or even high-street shopping. Now, with the growing popularity of online shopping, our retailers are adapting their marketing and promotional strategies to offer shoppers an additional and convenient way to shop using the digital platform. \n \n\"The DFRE is keeping abreast of all social media tools to connect to its diverse audiences in Dubai. With thousands of social media fans and followers descending on Dubai for Dubai Shopping Festival, The agency aggressively promoted the festival online and across all digital platforms including our website (www.mydsf.ae) Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Instagram. \"The various research done on Internet shopping including our own studies on the subject highlight the importance of recognising and catering to an online marketplace, especially the fact that for the new generation of smartphone-savvy youth, online shopping is fast becoming their favourite way to buy products,\" said Al Falasi. \n \nAnother popular site the jadopado.com boasts over 9K sellers and from 2015 through to 2016, their registered seller count grew 84.60 per cent, demonstrating the strong interest in e-commerce across the region. The portal ranks electronics, beauty and fashion as top performers. \n \nOmar Kassim, CEO, Jadopado.com, said: \"We saw significant growth in 2016 versus the year prior. We expect the same trend to continue through 2017. As a marketplace platform, our sellers determine how they price and in many a case our sellers will price well below in-store prices. There are a tonnes of good deals to be hand online. Consumer preference is moving towards preferring to shop online versus in store and while I don't think DSF 2017 directly contributes to more online activity, it definitely helps to raise general awareness of retail and therefore indirectly contributes to more e-commerce activity.\" \n \nE-commerce portals like Souq.com throughout DSF, had some incredible offers across all categories, and consumers could enjoy an additional 15 per cent discount. Souq.com features over 2 million products and 300 brands across categories. Mahendra Asar, general manager, Souq.com,said: \"As the largest e-commerce platform in the region, we at Souq.com are growing significantly year-on-year and as we are evolving, we are taking our partners with us. As we begin 2017, confidence in the Souq.com brand is at an all-time high. We have been significantly investing to realise our future plans, adopting new technology, further scaling up our marketplace operations, launching new product categories and recruiting the best talent to drive job creation in the region. Looking ahead in 2017 and beyond, where e-commerce is set to dominate the way we make our daily purchases, we remain even more committed to our vision of connecting people with innovative products, amazing deals and ground-breaking technology. \n \nNamshi's portal showcases close to 500 brands and currently is in the process of bringing in around 70 new brands this year alone. Hosam Arab, co-founder and managing director, Namshi, said: \"Consumers are always looking to satisfy their shopping needs in a convenient manner that suits their lifestyle. Our online shopping model provides customers with a strong assortment of products while shopping at their convenience. The site is easy to navigate, we offer fast shipping, easy returns etc, which we have seen are key factors that are convert people towards shopping online. Namshi runs its own end of season Winter sale at the end of each year, which happens to coincide with DSF. Our offers are highly competitive and in line with discounts available at the various outlets taking part in DSF.\" \n \nkhaleejtimes","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Finance latest","group":"Finance"},{"name":"E-commerce news","group":"Internet"},{"name":"United Arab Emirates news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Dubai news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"E-commerce to soar in 2017; DSF gives additional boost","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Western Asia","countryCode":"AE","country":"United Arab Emirates"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"UAE Business Review","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"232326907","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"UAE Business Review","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Financials"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.uaereview.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194550819","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:16:23Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Marilyn van Dijk, a veterinary assistant, kept treats in Meyer's hands or in front of the dog at all times. \n\nHe'd forget that he had a bum leg, put his paw down and reach around for the treat. \n\nMeyer, keeping hold on Tigger via a harness, cooed in the dog's ear: \"I've got you. I've got you.\" \n\nAnd then Tigger relaxed. He'd move his front paws forward as if on automatic pilot. Walk, walk, walk. \n\nMeyer moved up the speed on the treadmill, and Tigger walked, walked, walked some more, as if he's been doing it his entire young life. \n\nExcept he hasn't. \n\nTigger has never walked or run on four legs like most canines. \n\nHe has jumped like a kangaroo on his hind two legs or inched forward on his belly. But he has never kept up with his foster parents' other dogs because his front two legs were congenitally deformed by a defect called ectrodactyly, or split hand or lobster claw. \n\nThese days, Meyer has him on the underwater treadmill and doing planks on a large plastic peanut to help develop callouses on the limb and strengthen his core to protect his other limbs. He hopes to introduce the dog to cavalletti exercises (small jumps) soon to help him further strengthen his muscles and improve his balance. \n\n\"He's been compensating his whole life, so we take this slow,\" Meyer said. \n\nTigger weighs slightly more than his optimal weight of 55 pounds, said his surgeon, Dr. Jennifer Warnock. The physical therapy sessions may help with that. \n\nDr. Warnock hopes to perform the second repair surgery on Tigger's other front leg at the end of March. But Good and her partner, Troy Riggs, have some fundraising to do first. When the Statesman Journal first broke Tigger's story last summer and it spread across the country through the USA Today Network and The Huffington Post, more than $17,000 was raised in a few weeks. \n\nMore than $10,000 was spent on Tigger's first surgery, ICU stay, bandaging needs, and his medication. At least $2,000 or $3,000 still needs to be raised to pay for this next round of surgery, which will repair the second front limb and fuse one portion of the other newly fashioned leg. Dr. Warnock expects Tigger's condition to regress a bit as he recovers from the second surgery, but she's cautiously optimistic the dog could be walking on both front legs by summer. \n\nTigger may or may not need prosthetics. His X-rays currently show bone fusion, which is excellent, Warnock said. If his therapy continues to help him develop callouses where he never had them before, she believes the prognosis to be very good. \n\n\"We want to get him functioning without pain,\" Warnock said. \"I want him jumping on the couch, something most dogs take for granted. But Tigger does not.\" \n\nNow about those treats ...","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"CAROL MCALICE CURRIEStatesman Journal"},"topics":[],"title":"Tigger starts water therapy as leg improves","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Beaufort","zipCode":"29910","state":"South Carolina","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Bluffton","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Island Packet","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659155","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1303"},"name":"Island Packet","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Health","Lifestyle","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.islandpacket.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://stjr.nl/2iLOWc1"],"sequenceId":"695194551381","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:06:04Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:16:23Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

He alleged that the Liberals wanted to wrest police from Mr Grant, a senior Nationals MP.\n\n\"The Nationals wanted police, the right wing faction of the Liberals wanted police,\" he said. \"So she split it in two.\"\n\n\"It's the police who keep us safe from terrorism,\" Mr Foley said.\n\n\"The police commissioner now has to report to two people. It's scandalous and another deal that is counter to the public interest.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the troubled relationship between the NSW attorney-general and minister for police has been addressed, with Ms Berejiklian confirming a reshaping of the much maligned \"justice cluster\".\n\nThe arrangement, whereby as justice and police minister Mr Grant held a more senior position than then attorney-general Gabrielle Upton, was heavily criticised by the legal profession.\n\nThe NSW Bar Association said it provided Mr Grant \"with unprecedented power in determining legal policy without the historical checks and balances\".\n\nThe NSW Law Society warned the arrangement meant police were \"ostensibly responsible for criminal law policy, while at the same time, the traditional roles of the attorney-general as first law officer of the state, which includes preserving civil liberties, are being eroded\".\n\nMs Berejiklian has confirmed the cluster has been reworked so that new attorney-general Mark Speakman, SC, is the lead minister. The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Sean Nicholls"},"topics":[{"name":"Terrorism news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"New counter terrorism role slammed as 'against the public interest'","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2850","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Mudgee","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Mudgee Guardian","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169740483","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3"},"name":"Mudgee Guardian","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.mudgeeguardian.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194569631","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:29:42Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:16:31Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/ee974bdb-c7e3-4991-93f1-8b638bee948c.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Here are some things you need to know: \n\nHow do I know if it affects me? \n\nFor now, President Trump's executive order affects citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries. \n\nThey are: \n\n-- Iraq \n\n-- Iran \n\n-- Libya \n\n-- Somalia \n\n-- Sudan \n\n-- Syria \n\n-- Yemen \n\nBut the executive order also makes clear those seven countries are just a starting point for a likely broader ban that might include more countries. \n\nWhat can I do to protect myself? \n\nIf you're a citizen of any of the countries listed above, do not travel outside the US at least for the next 90 days. This applies even if you have a green card, which means you're a lawful permanent resident of the US. \n\nWhat if I have an emergency and I have to travel? \n\nIf you absolutely HAVE to travel, please consult an immigration lawyer first. \n\nWhat if I am already abroad and need to travel back to the US? \n\nIf you're a citizen of any of the countries listed above, you may have difficulty getting back into the US. \n\nIf you're a lawful permanent resident of the US from any of the countries above, get in touch with an immigration lawyer before flying back. \n\nWhat if I'm a naturalized US citizen? \n\nIf you're an American citizen, you should be fine -- even if you are from one of the targeted countries. \n\nCan my relatives fly back with me if I'm a citizen? \n\nNot if you're from one of the countries listed above. In that case, your relatives may face difficulties at immigration upon entering the US. \n\nWhat if I have family or friends who were waiting to resettle to the US as refugees? \n\nThe executive order also halted the refugee program, at least for the next 120 days. This applies to all refugees, not just those from the seven countries above. \n\nIn the case of Syria, the resettlement process has been halted indefinitely. \n\nWhat else do I need to know? \n\nKnow your rights. The Immigration Defense Project has prepared a flyer that outlines how to lawfully interact with Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents if they come to your house. \n\nYou can find the flyer here.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"What immigrants need to know about Trump's ban","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Boone","zipCode":"65201","state":"Missouri","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Columbia","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"ABC 17 News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"479331601","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"13"},"name":"ABC 17 News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Politics","Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.abc17news.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194570952","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:16:30Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

I\u2019ve had friends watching the same scene and one was laughing hysterically and the other one was crying because he thought it was really sad. And both are ok and both are right, and I think this is very rare to find.\u201d \n \nThat\u2019s producer Janine Jackowski, who happened to be in Sydney during a globe-trotting holiday with her family when Maren Ade\u2019s Toni Erdmann was nominated for a Best Foreign Language Film Oscar. \u201cI\u2019ve been in Sydney before with Maren\u2019s last film Everyone Else , which played at the Sydney Film Festival, and fell in love with the city so I\u2019m really happy to be back. \n \n\u201cBut it was always clear that I would continue working,\u201d she tells us when we wonder how she can be on the other side of the world during such an important time for the film. \u201cI\u2019m half working and half enjoying Sydney. In a few days I\u2019m off to the US so it\u2019ll be completely the Oscar thing.\u201d \n \nJackowski is one third of Komplizen Film [translated as \u2018Accomplice Film\u2019), a company she co-founded with Maren Ade, a third partner, Jonas Dornbach joining more recently. \n \nJanine Jackowski flanked by Jonas Dornbach and Maren Ade \n  \n\u201cAfter school I had no idea what to do,\u201d answers Jackowski when asked how she got into this fickle career. \u201cAt one point my father got involved. He was renting offices to a film company so thought I should try it. They gave me a four-week scholarship to work there and I ended up at that company for 2 years because I loved it so much. After that working experience I realised that\u2019s what I wanted to do and decided to go to film school to learn the basics. And this is where I met Maron. At first it was not our plan to set up this production company but it was really the short films and then her graduation film [ The Forest for the Trees ] became so successful that we did get some money. So we went for it. The first years were tough but now it\u2019s getting a little easier. \n \n\u201cI would call myself a creative producer,\u201d she adds. \u201cWe are a very director driven company. We really love to give our directors the maximum creative freedom. Everyone is very different. There are directors who want to work closely with you, and others who want to work in a closet. Both ways are ok.\u201d \n \nThe best known filmmaker they work with is Miguel Gomes ( Tabu, Arabian Nights ), until now, with Maren Ade\u2019s third feature film, Toni Erdmann , embraced by critics ( here is our contribution ) and festivals worldwide. \n \n\u201cWith Maron, at first she had three ideas and we started to discuss them,\u201d says Jackowski. \u201cWe thought that the father daughter story would be the best. She developed the treatment on her own, and then she comes to a certain point she asks for our opinion. And then we really discuss very intensely the psychology of the characters, of the script, the dramaturgy, the balance and the length of course. This also happens in the editing room. She\u2019s always working until she has a version that is strong enough to go out.\u201d \n \nAha, the length! For a modern character driven comedic drama, Toni Erdmann \u2019s 160+ minute running time must have been a contentious issue, especially for a producer? \u201cThe length was a big issue,\u201d admits Jackowski after a very long pause. \u201cThe script was something like 120 pages, so we were surprised during the shooting and then the editing room to find that this is going to be a very long film. And it\u2019s not so easy to cut out anything because it all builds up on each other. We had some test screenings\u2026 And the editing took a very long time. Of course we knew that with that length we would have difficulties, and our German distributor was very unhappy with that length. We tried a lot to cut things out but we realised that it would be very easy for things to become banal. In the end we were very sure that this would be the very best version of the film. So it was easy to defend it but of course at the beginning it was not so easy to convince our partners\u2026\u201d \n \n\n \nAs Jackowski described, Toni Erdmann is a father daughter story, with the former verging on retirement and the latter too busy to spend any quality time with him. She works in Romania as a corporate high flying consultant, and when he turns up unannounced to remind her of the important things in life, the conflict this creates is both hilarious and touching in turns. \n \nUnpredictably, the corporate suits in the story turn out to be more endearing than initially thought. \u201cMaron did a lot of research,\u201d answers Jackowski. \u201cShe really went to Bucharest and met all these business guys in order to understand their work. And as the saying goes, the closer you get to the enemy you start to understand it, or even like them, or even find it thrilling. This is also part of our complex world, it\u2019s not so easy to point your finger at somebody and just say that you\u2019re bad, because it\u2019s never so easy.\u201d \n \nAnd what does this simple but complex story say about Germany? \u201cIt has something to do with our generation,\u201d the producer answers. \u201cFor our parents\u2019 generation it was easier to define themselves. There was the conservative party and the very left green liberal movement, rebelling against their Nazi parents, and really fighting for Germany to confront its past. Our generation is lost a little bit. There are no easy answers anymore and there are no easy values. The world has gotten complicated. And in that way, of course, it reflects modern Germany. Germany is economically really strong and that comes with certain responsibilities, which we\u2019re not always aware of. This is the political layer of Toni Erdmann , and is super important to us.\u201d \n \nFor a female producer who started her company with a female director/producer, there is one obvious question. \u201cWe are confronted with the gender issue a lot of times,\u201d she answers. \u201cI am very grateful that neither I nor Maron have felt such a big difference in the end. Of course, it\u2019s true\u2026 in film schools there were 50% male and 50% female directors and producers, and if we now look at who is still working and can make a living at it, it\u2019s mostly the male ex-students who we hear of. There are reasons, of course. We must start changing the conditions more, so that it\u2019s combinable with private life and family life. I like to work with women, and I mostly find that they take a closer look at the psychology of the characters, and I am more into character and plot driven stories, so this is what I enjoy.\u201d \n \nToni Erdmann is in cinemas February 9, 2","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"},{"name":"Entertainment: movie news","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"Janine Jackowski: Producing Toni Erdmann","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"AU","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Filmink","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169773855","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3"},"name":"Filmink","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Arts","Consumer","Film"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.filmink.com.au"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194571527","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:16:31Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

( Cliff Grassmick / Staff Photographer ) \n  \nOn Thursday, when the Colorado Buffaloes finally picked up their first Pac-12 Conference victory against Oregon State, junior George King noted publicly afterward that he and his fellow starters needed to start games with the same infectious enthusiasm that was displayed by the reserves-turned-starters that night. \n \nOn Saturday King and the rest of CU's starters did just that, setting an early tone by knocking down the Buffs' first four 3-point attempts while attacking No. 10-ranked Oregon with a defensive energy they maintained throughout a 74-65 victory. \n \nThe result ended a school-record 17-game winning streak for Oregon. \n \n\"They handled the lineup shift the other night like men,\" CU head coach Tad Boyle said. \"I was really proud of them for that, both the starters and the reserves. Then tonight we flipped it back and everybody responded to that as well.\" \n \nKing started alongside Derrick White, Xavier Johnson, and Wesley Gordon \u2014 all three of whom had started every game this season before Thursday \u2014 in addition to junior guard Dom Collier. \n \nWhile Thursday's dramatic shift in the lineup was conceived in part to send a message to a veteran group of starters that had carried the load through the first seven-game losing streak of Boyle's seven-season tenure, Saturday's return to form occurred with not only the regular starters playing with fresh inspiration, but with the reserves hitting the floor with renewed confidence. \n  \n  \nFreshman guards Deleon Brown and Bryce Peters combined for just two points off the bench, but they once again provided solid defense while protecting the ball (no turnovers in 19 combined minutes). And senior Josh Fortune, a starter for the first 16 games of the season, put together one of his more efficient performances of the season despite scoring only two points, as he contributed four rebounds, two assists, and a blocked shot in just 13 minutes. \n \n\"For a guy who has gone what he has gone through, starting the first 16 games and now he's come off the bench, he's handled it well,\" Boyle said. \"He's not pouted and sulked and felt sorry for himself. He just tries to play as well as he can when he's in there, and I thought he gave us good minutes tonight.\" \n \nSiewert surging \n \nFor much of the past two months, freshman Lucas Siewert has looked as if he might have been better served taking a redshirt season this year. \n \nYet starting with his first starting nod on Thursday against Oregon State and continuing in Saturday's upset victory against Oregon, Siewert has made his most meaningful contributions of the year. \n \nAfter going 3-for-3 on 3-pointers in his CU debut in the season opener, Siewert went 2-for-16 over the next 19 games before knocking down his lone 3-point attempt against Oregon State. Siewert also added five rebounds against the Beavers in his first career start, grabbing four of them at the offensive end. \n \nSiewert again provided a spark against Oregon, scoring five points in the first half and adding two rebounds, one assist, and no turnovers in 12 minutes. Once again Siewert connected on his only 3-point attempt, and he also tallied the first two made free throws of his career after entering the game with an 0-for-2 mark. \n \n\"Lucas has been practicing really well the last three weeks,\" Boyle said. \"I would say since we got back from Christmas. He's really practiced well and started competing. He was terrific tonight. \n \n\"Lucas is just getting better and better and better. He's going to be a terrific player. I said that about both he and Bryce (Peters) and Deleon (Brown).

Marilyn van Dijk, a veterinary assistant, kept treats in Meyer's hands or in front of the dog at all times. \n\nHe'd forget that he had a bum leg, put his paw down and reach around for the treat. \n\nMeyer, keeping hold on Tigger via a harness, cooed in the dog's ear: \"I've got you. I've got you.\" \n\nAnd then Tigger relaxed. He'd move his front paws forward as if on automatic pilot. Walk, walk, walk. \n\nMeyer moved up the speed on the treadmill, and Tigger walked, walked, walked some more, as if he's been doing it his entire young life. \n\nExcept he hasn't. \n\nTigger has never walked or run on four legs like most canines. \n\nHe has jumped like a kangaroo on his hind two legs or inched forward on his belly. But he has never kept up with his foster parents' other dogs because his front two legs were congenitally deformed by a defect called ectrodactyly, or split hand or lobster claw. \n\nThese days, Meyer has him on the underwater treadmill and doing planks on a large plastic peanut to help develop callouses on the limb and strengthen his core to protect his other limbs. He hopes to introduce the dog to cavalletti exercises (small jumps) soon to help him further strengthen his muscles and improve his balance. \n\n\"He's been compensating his whole life, so we take this slow,\" Meyer said. \n\nTigger weighs slightly more than his optimal weight of 55 pounds, said his surgeon, Dr. Jennifer Warnock. The physical therapy sessions may help with that. \n\nDr. Warnock hopes to perform the second repair surgery on Tigger's other front leg at the end of March. But Good and her partner, Troy Riggs, have some fundraising to do first. When the Statesman Journal first broke Tigger's story last summer and it spread across the country through the USA Today Network and The Huffington Post, more than $17,000 was raised in a few weeks. \n\nMore than $10,000 was spent on Tigger's first surgery, ICU stay, bandaging needs, and his medication. At least $2,000 or $3,000 still needs to be raised to pay for this next round of surgery, which will repair the second front limb and fuse one portion of the other newly fashioned leg. Dr. Warnock expects Tigger's condition to regress a bit as he recovers from the second surgery, but she's cautiously optimistic the dog could be walking on both front legs by summer. \n\nTigger may or may not need prosthetics. His X-rays currently show bone fusion, which is excellent, Warnock said. If his therapy continues to help him develop callouses where he never had them before, she believes the prognosis to be very good. \n\n\"We want to get him functioning without pain,\" Warnock said. \"I want him jumping on the couch, something most dogs take for granted. But Tigger does not.\" \n\nNow about those treats ...","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"CAROL MCALICE CURRIEStatesman Journal"},"topics":[{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Tigger starts water therapy as leg improves","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Benton","zipCode":"99336","state":"Washington","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Kennewick","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Tri-City Herald Online","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169688591","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2795"},"name":"Tri-City Herald Online","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Health","Lifestyle","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.tri-cityherald.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://stjr.nl/2iLOWc1"],"sequenceId":"695194589385","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:06:04Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:16:34Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

He spends it reading and charming the people who filter in for chitchat or new soles. A crooked mishmash of framed pictures of Abraham Lincoln, Bill Clinton and our own Rep. Rick Larsen stare across the room at a wall festooned with shoelaces and polishes. \n\nThe tools of the trade stood at the ready behind the counter. \n\nPapadimitriou showed me around. He put a finger on a switch of an ancient contraption that trims, burnishes, polishes, sands and grinds. \n\n\"Stand back,\" he instructed. \n\nThe man and the machine came to life with a burst of noise and dust. It was like being at ground zero of a rocket launch. \n\nHigh heels. Holsters. Handbags. Belts. It's all done the old-fashioned way. \n\nNot all shoes rate his time and affection. \n\nIn the first 30 minutes I was at his shop, a man stepped in hoping to find redemption for his beloved work boots that were splitting at the seams. Papadimitriou said it would be cheaper for him to buy a new pair and sent him on his way. \n\nA woman called from Kenmore asking his hours. \"Monday through Friday, 10 to 5:30,\" he said, holding a phone tethered by a long coiled cord. \n\nShe wasn't sure she could make it by closing. He told her he would come to the store on a Saturday morning to meet her. \n\nHe's that kind of guy. \n\nThe next two times I went to his shop he turned away more work than he accepted, often expressing disapproval even before reading the label where the shoe was made. The massive import of cheap shoes gets his goat. \n\n\"No good. These are plastic. Nothing you can do about it,\" he told several customers. He has resurrected many pairs from near-death, but he knows when a shoe is DOA. \n\nSome owners refuse to give up. \n\nWhen he told Colleen Stillabower it would be $45 to replace the broken plastic zipper on one boot, she unflinchingly told him to do it. \n\n\"Forty-five dollars,\" he repeated. \n\n\"That would be fine,\" she said. \n\n\"Oh, boy,\" he said. \n\nShe asked him to replace the zippers on both boots. He said he'd give her a discount. \n\nIt was the Lake Stevens woman's first time to the shop. \"I found him on the internet,\" she said. \"I asked for the best shoemaker in Everett and his shop was the first one to pop up. Said he'd been here forever.\" \n\nPeople's has been in business in Everett since 1934. It was started by Papadimitriou's uncle, who sponsored his move here in 1967 from Greece, where he'd repaired and crafted shoes. \n\n\"I worked in 1967-68 in Seattle, before you were born,\" Papadimitriou told me, winking. Told you he was a flirt. \"At that time I made $2.45 an hour. I had a skill.\" \n\nHe bought People's from his uncle in 1968. He later moved the shop from Rockefeller Avenue to 2827 Wetmore Ave. \n\nPapadimitriou used to do more than mend rips and save soles. He also made orthopedic adjustments. \"If you have a pigeon toe, we put this wedge in here and make it straight,\" he said in his Greek-English syntax. \n\nHis wife, Dona, died in 2013. She didn't work in the shop with him. Not a good idea for husbands and wives to work together, he said. \n\nHis daughter, Nikki, and grandkids recently moved from Everett to North Carolina. Papadimitriou is all alone now in the town that has been his home for 50 years and the house where he's lived almost as long. \n\nLoneliness isn't what bothers him. These three words make him cringe: \"Made in China.\" \n\nSure enough, that's what it said inside my shoes, and a number of the dozens of pairs of shoes scattered, stacked and strewn about. \n\nDon't believe the sign that says \"Not responsible for shoes left more than 30 days.\" \n\nHe's had some for two years. Every pair of shoes gets a handwritten ticket. That's Exhibit A. \n\nHe took me on a tour of The Shoes Left Behind. \n\n\"What size do you wear?\" he asked, holding up a large pair of red leather kick-ass cowboy boots. \n\nI figured he could have sized up my feet in one glance, and I told him so. Really, can't he spot a size 6.5 from across the room? \n\nHe shrugged and went back to offering me more shoes that people didn't pick up. \n\nI changed the subject to purses. \"I bring out for you,\" he said, then disappeared in a back room only to appear with a bevy of handbags. \n\nWhy don't people pick up their things? \n\n\"Long stories,\" he said. \n\nHe donates many unwanted items to the thrift shop run by Domestic Violence Services of Snohomish County. \"I give it to them so they can sell and make money for women,\" he said. \n\nI admired the flashy leopard shoes with 6-inch platform heels that were on a shelf above the can of salmon that someone gave him for Christmas. \n\nThe average person has about 20 pairs of shoes. Papadimitriou owns six pairs, including the ones on his feet and a twin pair he keeps under his desk. That's it. \n\n\"I hear many women say, 'Oh, I love my shoes,'\" he said. \"I love people. I don't love shoes.\" \n\nWhat he cares about is making his work shine and fit like a glove. \n\n\"He stretched loafers for me that were too tight,\" said Gerry Provencher, who lives nearby and likes to stop by to shoot the breeze. \"He's an artist in his approach because he wants to take something that somebody cares about and is not of any use to them and bring it back to life. He takes the time and effort that an artist would take.\" \n\nPapadimitriou keeps things simple. Cash and checks only. \"I don't ask for ID,\" he said.

Marilyn van Dijk, a veterinary assistant, kept treats in Meyer's hands or in front of the dog at all times. \n\nHe'd forget that he had a bum leg, put his paw down and reach around for the treat. \n\nMeyer, keeping hold on Tigger via a harness, cooed in the dog's ear: \"I've got you. I've got you.\" \n\nAnd then Tigger relaxed. He'd move his front paws forward as if on automatic pilot. Walk, walk, walk. \n\nMeyer moved up the speed on the treadmill, and Tigger walked, walked, walked some more, as if he's been doing it his entire young life. \n\nExcept he hasn't. \n\nTigger has never walked or run on four legs like most canines. \n\nHe has jumped like a kangaroo on his hind two legs or inched forward on his belly. But he has never kept up with his foster parents' other dogs because his front two legs were congenitally deformed by a defect called ectrodactyly, or split hand or lobster claw. \n\nThese days, Meyer has him on the underwater treadmill and doing planks on a large plastic peanut to help develop callouses on the limb and strengthen his core to protect his other limbs. He hopes to introduce the dog to cavalletti exercises (small jumps) soon to help him further strengthen his muscles and improve his balance. \n\n\"He's been compensating his whole life, so we take this slow,\" Meyer said. \n\nTigger weighs slightly more than his optimal weight of 55 pounds, said his surgeon, Dr. Jennifer Warnock. The physical therapy sessions may help with that. \n\nDr. Warnock hopes to perform the second repair surgery on Tigger's other front leg at the end of March. But Good and her partner, Troy Riggs, have some fundraising to do first. When the Statesman Journal first broke Tigger's story last summer and it spread across the country through the USA Today Network and The Huffington Post, more than $17,000 was raised in a few weeks. \n\nMore than $10,000 was spent on Tigger's first surgery, ICU stay, bandaging needs, and his medication. At least $2,000 or $3,000 still needs to be raised to pay for this next round of surgery, which will repair the second front limb and fuse one portion of the other newly fashioned leg. Dr. Warnock expects Tigger's condition to regress a bit as he recovers from the second surgery, but she's cautiously optimistic the dog could be walking on both front legs by summer. \n\nTigger may or may not need prosthetics. His X-rays currently show bone fusion, which is excellent, Warnock said. If his therapy continues to help him develop callouses where he never had them before, she believes the prognosis to be very good. \n\n\"We want to get him functioning without pain,\" Warnock said. \"I want him jumping on the couch, something most dogs take for granted. But Tigger does not.\" \n\nNow about those treats ...","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"CAROL MCALICE CURRIEStatesman Journal"},"topics":[],"title":"Tigger starts water therapy as leg improves","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Horry","zipCode":"29578","state":"South Carolina","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Myrtle Beach","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Myrtle Beach Sun News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657695","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1140"},"name":"Myrtle Beach Sun News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.myrtlebeachonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://stjr.nl/2iLOWc1"],"sequenceId":"695194595252","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:06:04Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:16:41Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The win pushes the Reign's point streak to five games (4-0-1-0) heading into the AHL All-Star break. \n \nGame Summary \n \nBoth teams utilized turnovers to generate goals in the opening period and skated into the first intermission tied, 2-2. Rampage forward A.J. Geer opened the scoring with a spin-o-rama goal on top of the crease of Reign netminder Jack Campbell (W, 32 saves on 35 shots) at 5:38. Less than a minute later, Reign defenseman Paul LaDue floated in his sixth goal of the season unassisted at 6:37. Moments after, forward Daniel Ciampini found the puck waiting behind the net of Rampage goalie Spencer Martin (L, 9 saves on 13 shots) after the defense failed to clear the zone and tucked in his first goal of the season for a 2-1 Ontario lead. Nearly two minutes later, the Rampage knocked the puck away from the Reign defense and forward J.T. Compher reset the contest at 14:50. \n \nIn the second period, the Reign chased Martin from the net as forward Teddy Purcell and defenseman Kurtis MacDermid found the twine for a 4-2 advantage. Purcell jammed in his seventh goal of the season off a goal-mouth scramble at 9:27 and MacDermid lifted in a wrist shot from the left point that clipped off the glove of Martin and across the goal line. Martin was replaced by Jeremy Smith (12 saves on 12 shots). \n \nLooking to make a third-period push, the Rampage peppered Campbell with 12 shots and defenseman Sergei Boikov slipped in his second goal of the season with 25 seconds remaining, but the veteran netminder held on for this AHL-leading 20th victory. The Reign finished the contest 0-for-2 on the power play while the Rampage went 0-for-3. \n \nThe Reign return to Citizens Business Bank Arena on Friday, February 3 for the Second Annual Pink in the Rink, $2 Bud Light Friday and Pink Ontario Reign Blanket Giveaway presented by San Antonio Regional Hospital against the San Diego Gulls at 7:00 p.m. Join the Reign in the fight against breast cancer with an exclusive Pink Pack!

As France prepares to elect a new president, it is wrangling with bigger issues than simple election manifestos. \n \nThe catalyst for the soul-searching has been a proposal from leading Socialist party candidate Benoit Hamon to adopt a universal basic income -- a state handout of around 750 euros ($805) a month, made to everyone. \n \n\"I expect that the digital revolution is going to make work increasingly rare... and we need to prepare for that,\" Hamon says, underlining how advances in the welfare system have been criticised in the past. \n \nThat the idea has taken hold in France, which has a minimum working week of 35 hours and a strong attachment to enjoying the pleasures of life, will likely not surprise cynics. \n \nFrench satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo devoted its front page to the issue, writing \"The work-shy have their candidate\" alongside a cartoon depicting a man begging for money to vote for Hamon. \n \nYet basic income is gaining traction in other Western democracies too. Finland this month began a two-year experiment paying 2,000 unemployed workers a monthly stipend. \n \nHamon's embrace, if he becomes the Socialist nominee this weekend, would provide another boost for a radical idea that has some high-profile business and economist supporters, as well as many critics. \n \nIt also points to what could develop into a fracture between politicians in the rich world. \n \nThe overwhelming majority continue to see a government's main role as helping to create and provide employment, viewing it not just as economically vital but of obvious social benefits. \n \nWork and the workplace has served for centuries as a space for personal fulfilment and learning, socialising and the integration of outsiders such as immigrants. \n \nDonald Trump's successful campaign for the US presidency had one constant message: a pledge to blue-collar workers to bring back factory jobs to their communities. \n \n\"I'm for a society of work,\" ex-French prime minister Manuel Valls said in a debate Wednesday with Hamon, whom he hopes to defeat to clinch the Socialist nomination this weekend. \n \nThe message of universal income is one of \"discouragement, of abdication,\" he said, adding that some jobs would be destroyed, but others would emerge. \n \n- A life of leisure? - \n \nBut Hamon and others are convinced that robotisation and automation will make human toil seem old-fashioned, offering us greater leisure time. \n \nThe 49-year-old also wants to encourage people to work fewer hours, below the 35-hour minimum week introduced by a Socialist government in 1998 with the logic of sharing around increasingly scarce jobs. \n \nThe short work week -- in reality most French workers work more than 35 hours -- is still contested by French employers for making France uncompetitive in the global workplace. \n \n\"The project that I propose is a long-term project,\" explains Hamon, who is tipped by polls to triumph against Valls. \n \nHamon's prospects in the presidential election in April and May are viewed as dim by pollsters, however, but many analysts caution against making forecasts in a highly unpredictable race. \n \nIn his long-term vision, Hamon can count on the support of American business luminary Elon Musk, the head of electric vehicle group Tesla, and renowned left-leaning French economist Thomas Piketty. \n \nMusk admitted last November that \"there's a pretty good chance we end up with a universal basic income due to automation. I'm not sure what else we can do\". \n \n- Fertile ground - \n \nProminent French sociologist Dominique Meda also backs the discussion about the role of work in comments that hint at why France could be fertile ground for the idea. \n \n\"What's interesting in Hamon is that he's finally posing the difficult questions: what do we do if economic growth doesn't come back? Can we have jobs and good jobs with less growth?\" she said. \n \nThe country is widely pessimistic about its economic prospects and has long grown accustomed to stubborn unemployment of around 10 percent, with youth unemployment more than double that. \n \nGermany -- a global centre of highly automated manufacturing -- has an unemployment level of around 6.0 percent. In Britain, it is around 5.0 percent. \n \nEconomists point to other difficult questions: what is the impact on people's work ethic if they can count on basic income? Aren't vibrant economies made up of economic strivers? \n \nAnd how do you create the wealth in the first place before distributing it to everyone? \n \nThe French Economic Observatory, an independent research unit at Sciences Po university in Paris, estimated that universal basic income would cost 480 billion euros annually. \n \nA poll published Monday showed that Hamon has work to do to sell the idea to a sceptical public. \n \nOf 1,000 French workers aged over 18 surveyed, only 38 percent were in favour of the proposal, according to the survey by the Harris group and published by the LCP channel.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"France news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"The French ponder 'joie de vivre' in a work-free future","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"AU","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Robo Daily","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"537671941","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4"},"name":"Robo Daily","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Business"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.robodaily.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194600434","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T01:34:18Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:16:44Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Christian Horn poked the puck into the slot and Evan Dixon fired it past Brian Billet at 8:44. \n \nThe FireAntz broke the game open in the second with three goals in a span of 3:10. Tayler Thompson scored thanks to another turnover in the Knoxville end. Max Cook slid the puck past Billet to finish off a 2-on-1. \n \nCook's goal ended with a Fayetteville skater crashing into the Knoxville goaltender. Billet stayed down for a few moments before being helped off the ice and did not return. Dylan Wells entered the game for Billet and gave up a goal to Thompson, who skated through the slot untouched, 17 seconds later to make the score 4-0. \n \nKnoxville got on the board when Danny Cesarz sent the puck in from the left point with Kyle McNeil screening in the crease. McNeil jammed the puck past Sean Bonar to cut the deficit to three at 17:00 of the period. McNeil received a game misconduct at the end of the second for abuse of an official. \n \nAndrew Bonazza's goal at 13:38 of the third made things interesting, but Knoxville was unable to generate many quality scoring chances despite outshooting Fayetteville 16-3 in the final period. Bobby Chaumont added a short-handed empty-netter for the FireAntz. \n \nThe Ice Bears have dropped four of their last five.

Organisers claim this a record number of the little dogs in the one place at the one time. \n\nMark Ellis, the organiser of Sunday's Werriwa Wiener Dash at the Bungendore Show, believes the turnout of 154 dachshunds for the event constitutes a world record for the number of the sausage dogs in one place at one time.\n\n\"We had miniatures, long hairs, short hairs, standards and wire hairs,\" he said. \"They came from all over; some even travelled from Melbourne.\n\nWhile Mr Ellis wasn't able to engage the attention of the people from Guinness, who ruled the record being sought was too \"specialised\" to interest them, he is happy to claim the record with any other contenders needing to prove him wrong.\n\nAlthough the quirky event, which has captured the imagination of dachshund lovers from across NSW and the ACT, is only in its second year it has already become one of the feature events of the Bungendore Show.\n\nThis year's dash winner was Buddy, owned by Jacqueline Winzenberg of Page in the ACT. Buddy's award was presented by NSW Deputy Premier and local member John Barilaro.\n\nOne hundred and twenty seven dogs turned up for the inaugural event in 2016.\n\nBungendore Show, which was first held in the 1840s, has gone from strength to strength in recent decades, this year's showgirl, Hanna Darmody, 22, said.\n\nMs Darmody, whose family own a Bungendore butchery, said she could recall helping with the catering at the show as a toddler almost 20 years ago.\n\n\"I've seen the event grow as the town has grown,\" she said. \"It is a great bridge between country and city; the showgirl competition is a good way to get young people involved and promotes opportunities in agriculture.\"\n\nShow organisers said this year's event, which enjoyed the best weather conditions in three years, was an unqualified success with more than 2000 people passing through the gates before lunch.\n\nIn addition to the usual attractions in the show ring and the pavilions and the dachshund dash, the 2017 event offered visitors a chance to get a close look at the Anzac Centennial 18 pounder gun.\n\nThe World War I-era weapon, which also saw service during World War II,was restored by the Royal Australian Artillery Company in conjunction with veteran coach builder Jim Frecklington.

He alleged that the Liberals wanted to wrest police from Mr Grant, a senior Nationals MP.\n\n\"The Nationals wanted police, the right wing faction of the Liberals wanted police,\" he said. \"So she split it in two.\"\n\n\"It's the police who keep us safe from terrorism,\" Mr Foley said.\n\n\"The police commissioner now has to report to two people. It's scandalous and another deal that is counter to the public interest.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the troubled relationship between the NSW attorney-general and minister for police has been addressed, with Ms Berejiklian confirming a reshaping of the much maligned \"justice cluster\".\n\nThe arrangement, whereby as justice and police minister Mr Grant held a more senior position than then attorney-general Gabrielle Upton, was heavily criticised by the legal profession.\n\nThe NSW Bar Association said it provided Mr Grant \"with unprecedented power in determining legal policy without the historical checks and balances\".\n\nThe NSW Law Society warned the arrangement meant police were \"ostensibly responsible for criminal law policy, while at the same time, the traditional roles of the attorney-general as first law officer of the state, which includes preserving civil liberties, are being eroded\".\n\nMs Berejiklian has confirmed the cluster has been reworked so that new attorney-general Mark Speakman, SC, is the lead minister.

transparency, privacy, and interoperability; collaboration between people and AI systems; and the trustworthiness, reliability, and robustness of the technology,\" according to a statement. \n \nInternet giants have been investing heavily in creating software to help machines think more like people, ideally acting as virtual assistants who get to know users and perhaps even anticipate needs. \n \nSpaceX founder and Tesla chief executive Elon Musk in 2015 took part in creating nonprofit research company OpenAI devoted to developing artificial intelligence that will help people and not hurt them. \n \nMusk found himself in the middle of a technology world controversy by holding firm that AI could turn on humanity and be its ruin instead of a salvation. \n \nA concern expressed by Musk was that highly advanced artificial intelligence would be left to its own devices, or in the hands of a few people, to the detriment of civilization as a whole. \n \nPeople joining tech company executives on the Partnership board included Dario Amodei of Open AI along with members of the American Civil Liberties Union;

A major generator of Victoria's coal-fired electricity is set to be expanded, sparking protests from environment groups over the effect on carbon emissions.\n\nThe planned upgrade of the Loy Yang B power station in the Latrobe Valley comes as its majority owner, Engie, prepares to shut down the Hazelwood plant and coal mine in March.\n\nThe Environment Protection Authority (EPA) has granted \"works approval\" to upgrade turbines at the plant, which will result in the burning of an extra 400,000 tonnes of coal each year.\n\nLoy Yang B provides about 17 per cent of Victoria's energy needs.\n\nThe EPA insists it has imposed strict conditions on the power generator, so there will be no additional detrimental impact on the environment.\n\nEPA development assessments manager Tim Faragher said the decision allowed higher-efficiency turbine blades to be fitted to the power-generating units.\n\nHe said the new turbines would improve power generation capacity 8.6 per cent but decrease the intensity of emissions by 5 per cent.\n\n\"The upgrade will make Loy Yang B the least greenhouse-intensive brown coal-fired power generator in Victoria,\" Mr Faragher said.\n\nHe said at least 114 megawatts of coal-fired electricity generation capacity had to be retired before the upgrade could proceed. However, the closure of Hazelwood would satisfy that reduction.\n\nHazelwood produced about 13 per cent of Victoria's emissions and up to a quarter of its electricity.\n\nEnvironment Victoria chief executive Mark Wakeham said the EPA's decision was \"extremely disappointing\".\n\nThe plant's expansion would make it harder for the state government to reach its target of zero emissions by 2050, he said.\n\n\"If Victoria is to keep its commitments to contribute to global efforts to stay below two degrees of warming, brown coal-power stations need to be phased out urgently,\" Mr Wakeham said.\n\nThe EPA confirmed that burning the additional coal would result in a 4 per cent increase in carbon emissions at Loy Yang B.\n\nBut Environment Minister Lily D'Ambrosio said the decision meant lower emissions for Victoria.\n\nLatrobe Valley community group Voices of the Valley has also raised concerns about the expansion. The group's president, Wendy Farmer, said the power station's pollution allowance was too high.\n\nEngie welcomed the move, saying the upgrade would improve the station's efficiency and \"increase operating flexibility\".\n\nThe upgrade will occur in 2019 and 2020 during \"planned major outages\". In a community update issued before the approval, Engie described Loy Yang B as one of the most efficient power stations in the Latrobe Valley.\n\n\"The new turbine design for the retrofit of the existing turbines will result in further improvement,\" it said.\n\nLoy Yang B employs about 150 full-time staff. It is supplied with coal by a neighbouring mine.\n\nFriends of the Earth criticised the expansion, saying it would prolong coal generation when urgent action was required to tackle climate change.\n\n\"It's time to bring the EPA into the 21st century so it can play a key role in tackling climate change,\" the group said.\n\nIt has previously been reported that Engie hopes to sell Loy Yang B.

(Located in Melbourne)\".\n\nA person, who used the pseudonym Strawberry Blonde, wrote that this was a fake review that must have been written by Dr Moss' staff.\n\nComments in other threads were critical of Dr Moss' reputation as a plastic surgeon.\n\nDr Moss' lawyers hired a forensic computer scientist to track the internet protocol addresses of the negative comments. The search found that seven forum members, including Strawberry Blonde, shared the same address, which was linked to a Doncaster East man.\n\nThe Supreme Court issued a search order in March to allow Dr Moss' lawyers to search the man's home for emails related to Dr Moss and the forum, including private, sent and deleted messages.\n\nIt is understood the case was settled before trial.

Branden Parkhouse beat Dupuis 24 seconds into the period before Josh Colten's shot from the point trickled in. \n \nMahfouz then buried a powerplay goal with 8:56 to play in the contest. Lou Dickenson, in his return to Cornwall, rounded out the scoring with 3:43 to play. \n \nPort Huron outshot Cornwall 33-28. Mahfouz (first), Parkhouse, who also had a five-point night (second) and Bzdyl, were the announced stars. \n \nThe Nationals are back in action Sunday afternoon, as the Berlin River Drivers visit the Civic Complex. FHL action begins at 2 p.m. Tickets are only $13 for adults, $10 for seniors/students and $5 for children ages 12 and under. \n \nWolves Snap Berlin's Streak with Win \n \nBy Jay Harris \n \nHead Coach Phil Esposito and the Watertown Wolves looked to extend their winning streak as they faced the Berlin River Drivers at the Watertown Municipal Arena. Berlin came in on a 5-game winning streak, including wins against the Danville Dashers who are leading the Federal Hockey League Standings. \n \nThe Wolves established a 2-0 lead by the end of the first period. New Wolf Joe Cangelosi would make the first goal on a pass from Colin McIntosh. The second goal was Jason Dolgy's first goal as a Wolf. Dolgy's was assisted by Justin Apcar-Blaszak and Mark Petaccio on a power play from Nick Wright's delay of game penalty. \n \nThe action picked up in the second period. Scott Roy would walk to the locker room after receiving a puck to face and drawing blood. The River Drivers first goal of the night was a power play goal from David Brancik. The physicality would continue to pick up in the period. Edgar Ozolins took Mark Petaccio's legs out from under him, prompting Zach Dymock to let Ozolins know it wasn't appreciated with some sparring. The resulting penalties and a call on Mark Petaccio for cross checking set the teams on a 4-on-4 even strength where Berlin scored goal number two. The Wolves did not let Jiri Pestuka's goal take the wind out of their sails. With just ten seconds left in the period Kyle Powell gave the Wolves a 3-2 lead with assists from Jason Dolgy and Marley Keca. \n \nThe Wolves held on to their lead in the third period to a 3-2 victory by killing all three of Berlin's power plays. The first star of the game was earned by Jason Dolgy. Goalie Danila Allistratov earned the second, and Kyle Powell was honored the third star. \n \nIn a post-game discussion with Head Coach Phil Esposito, he mentioned how he felt the team got off to a slow start and that the magic wasn't as strong as the previous night's game. He was proud of the players for preventing the River Drivers from tying the game in the third period and credited a good part of that on Danilla Allistratov's net minding. He expects tonight's hard-fought win to motivate his players into Sunday's contest against the Danbury Titans, who they defeated the previous night. \n \nThe Wolves will be back at the Watertown Municipal Arena on Friday, February 3rd for 70's night. Fans can purchase a Tie-Dye shirt from Victory Promotions for the event and get free admission. The puck will drop at 7:30. \n \nDashers Put Up Nine Goals in Win \n \nBy Easton Hoskins \n \nThe Danville Dashers put up nine goals in their 7-2 win over the St. Clair Shores Fighting Saints. A.J. Tesoriero led Danville with two goals, and two assist in the win. Jonathon Hall added two goals of his own, and one assist. Brad Denny, Anton Lennartson, Justin Levac, Michael Harris, and Darius Cole all added one goal apiece. Denny added three assist as well. \n \nLouie George back stopped Danville to the win once again, stopping 26 of the 28 shots that he saw. Frankie McClendon took the beating for St. Clair Shores, allowing nine goals, on an outstanding 58 shots that the Dashers peppered him with. \n \nDanville will travel to St. Clair Shores tomorrow, for one more game with the Fighting Saints this weekend. Expect Bobby Bowden to get the start for Danville in that game. \n \nDanville is still in first place in the Federal Hockey League, leading the league by 24 points over the Berlin River Drivers. \n \nFederal Hockey League | FederalHockey.com | @THEFHL \n \n\u2022 Discuss this story on the Federal Hockey League message board ... \n\u2022 Digg this story \n\u2022 Add to Del.icio.us \nTweet \n\n \nThe opinions expressed in this release are those of the organization issuing it, and do not necessarily reflect the thoughts or opinions of OurSports Central or its staff.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"FHL Connected: Game Recaps January 28, 2017","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"OurSports Central","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169661782","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"OurSports Central","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer","IceHockey"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.oursportscentral.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.oursportscentral.com%2Fservices%2Freleases%2Ffhl-connected-game-recaps-january-28-2017%2Fn-5231490&title=FHL+Connected%3A+Game+Recaps+January+28%2C+2017","http://del.icio.us/post?v=4;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.oursportscentral.com%2Fservices%2Freleases%2Ffhl-connected-game-recaps-january-28-2017%2Fn-5231490;title=FHL+Connected%3A+Game+Recaps+January+28%2C+2017","http://twitter.com/share"],"sequenceId":"695194618214","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T03:11:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:16:42Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}
