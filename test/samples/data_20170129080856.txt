That's something you've got to get through, the first 10-15 overs are crucial. With the line-up that we play, if we can have wickets in the shed at the back end then we will score a lot of runs at the end of the (innings).\" \n \nThe keeper found out the perils of taking on Eden Park's small boundaries when he played at the ground for the first time last February, caught at cow corner trying to heave Corey Anderson over the ropes. \n \nThe Australians were all out for 148 on that occasion, with the Black Caps' seamers running riot on the way to a 2-1 series win. It was a similar story a year earlier, with the Aussies skittled for 151 in a World Cup clash that the Kiwis only won by a wicket. \n \nAt the same time, Eden Park's unusual dimensions have resulted in big scores before. Although the tourists failed to pass 150 last time around, New Zealand posted a score of 8-307 in the same game. \n \nIndeed, before Australia's innings that day, seven of the last eight innings at the ground had gone past 280 runs. \n \n\"(The Eden Park pitch) just has a bit in it,\" New Zealand veteran Ross Taylor said. \"I don't think there is a par score, some wickets here are 300, some are 200. \n \n\"You just have to analyse it as quickly as possible, whether you're batting or bowling.\" \n \nThe Kiwis were trounced 3-0 in Australia when the sides met in December, but Wade is expecting a tougher time on New Zealand's turf. \n \n\"We played them in Australia (on) big grounds (with) long boundaries. It's a completely different ball game,\" he said. \n \n\"(On) the smaller grounds (in New Zealand) they'll still play aggressive; they're still going to be able to hit plenty of fours and sixes at grounds that they play at. \n \n\"They play well here (in NZ) and they play this venue very well. \n \n\"We like to think we're hard to beat in Australia and it's the same when we come here - we expect a hard challenge over the next three games but we've got a young squad and we're excited to go out and really have a crack at it.\" \n \nCaptaining the side for the first time, Wade maintains his job is simply to continue the fine work of the leadership duo of Steve Smith and vice-captain David Warner. \n \n\"I don't think for me personally it's about putting a stamp on the team,\" he said. \"It's about driving the values and the game plan that we have in one-day cricket moving forward. \n \n\"Steven and David have put their stamp on the team, it's just about me keeping on driving those key messages through to the players. \n \n\"We've performed really well in one-day cricket over a long period of time so it's not about trying to change too much - it's about keeping the ball rolling.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"New Zealand news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Aussies wary of Black Caps on home turf","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"4350","state":"Queensland","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Toowoomba","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Toowoomba Chronicle","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169660840","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"14"},"name":"Toowoomba Chronicle","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.thechronicle.com.au","publisher":"APN Holdings NZ Limited"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199043113","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T14:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:48:41Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://media.apnarm.net.au/img/media/images/2017/01/29/b88557687z1_20170129162619_000g9dg4eu82-0-5o7dbx25uooe6wninn2_t325x200.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

BP forecasts this trend to be offset by sharp gains in energy efficiency. \n \n\u201cThe increasing penetration of electric cars and the broader mobility revolution will have an important bearing on future oil demand,\u201d BP said. \n \nOil demand from cars will rise from around 19 million bpd in 2015 to 23 million bpd in 2035, BP said. That will come amid rapid growth in the car fleet and despite improvements in engine efficiencies and an expected 100-fold expansion in the number of electric vehicles to 100 million over the period. \n \nRenewables, with nuclear and hydroelectric power, will provide half of the additional energy required out to 2035, while gas will grow more quickly than oil and coal, led by US shale gas, it said. \n \nElectricity, biofuels, coal and natural gas together account for 13 per cent of transport fuel demand in 2035, up from 7 per cent in 2015. \n \nSUPPLIES \n \nBrent crude plummeted to $27.88 per barrel in Jan. 2016 from its peak of $118.9 Feb 2013, triggering many oil firms to shut down projects that were no longer economically viable. With a recent OPEC and non-OPEC deal to cut production during the first six months of 2017, Brent has stabalised over $53 per barrel. While sentiment in the oil and gas sector has buoyed, investments have not yet returned to their pre-slump momentum. \n \n \u201cOil inventories are at record-high levels and the impact on supply of the significant cutbacks in investment spending on new energy projects over the past two years has not yet been fully felt,\u201d Dudley said. \n \nBP said global oil supplies will shift towards holders of large-scale, low-cost resources - the share of global liquids supply accounted for by Middle East OPEC, Russia and the US increases from 56 per cent in 2015 to 63 per cent by 2035, it said in its report on Wednesday. \n \nMiddle East OPEC production is set to increase by over 9 Mb/d, accounting for all the growth in OPEC production. Other OPEC production, which typically has a higher cost base, will fall slightly over the next 20 years, causing its share to edge lower. \n \nUS output is expected to grow by 4 Mb/d reaching 19 Mb/d by 2035, with growth concentrated in the first half of the outlook period, driven by tight oil and NGL production. Russia\u2019s production is assumed to increase by 1 Mb/d to 12 Mb/d by 2035, the report said. \n \nMeanwhile, BP said if the practice of non-OECD countries to expand refining capacity beyond demand continues, this could lead to substantial refinery spare capacity and ultimately closures in mature markets such as Europe, OECD Asia and parts of North America.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Energy industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Oil and gas news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"BP news","group":"Companies"},{"name":"Environment news","group":"Science"},{"name":"Climate change news","group":"Science"},{"name":"UK business news","group":"Business"},{"name":"European business news","group":"Business"}],"title":"BP forecasts slower growth in oil demand and CO2 emissions","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Western Asia","countryCode":"AE","country":"United Arab Emirates"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Pipeline Magazine","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169761631","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Pipeline Magazine","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Energy","OilGas"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://pipelineme.com/"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199052772","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:48:47Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The authorities also increased the total number of people under investigation and portrayed a far more extensive conspiracy than before. Winterkorn and Hans Dieter Poetsch, the Volkswagen supervisory board chairman, were already under investigation for violations of securities laws. But the new fraud allegations suggest that prosecutors suspect Winterkorn had a more active role than he or the company have acknowledged.\n\nThe new allegations also point to a larger number of conspirators, and they further undermine Volkswagen's attempts to portray the fraud, in which its diesel vehicles emitted lower levels of pollutants in lab testing than in the real world, as the work of executives and engineers below the level of its board. The assertions leave the automaker even more vulnerable to lawsuits by shareholders in the US and Europe.\n\nProsecutors said in a statement that the number of people officially under investigation had risen to 37 from 21, after police searches of dozens of homes and offices in and around Wolfsburg, Germany, where Volkswagen has its headquarters.\n\nThis month, Volkswagen pleaded guilty to violations of the Clean Air Act in a settlement with the US government that also includes a $US4.3 billion ($5.7 billion) fine.\n\nJust last week, Winterkorn told a committee of the German Parliament that he had heard of the illegal software only days before the scandal came to light, and in a statement Friday he stood by that testimony.\n\nUS federal authorities have indicted six former and current Volkswagen employees on charges of conspiring to defraud the government by programming pollution controls in diesel motors to function properly only when software detected that a test was underway.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"JACK EWING"},"topics":[{"name":"Automotive industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Volkswagen news","group":"Companies"},{"name":"Environment news","group":"Science"},{"name":"Germany news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"},{"name":"European business news","group":"Business"}],"title":"Germany investigates ex-Volkswagen chief in emissions-cheating scandal","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"4000","state":"Queensland","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Brisbane Adelaide Street","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Brisbane Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169658354","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"191"},"name":"Brisbane Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Business","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.brisbanetimes.com.au%2Fbusiness%2Fconsumer-affairs%2Fexvolkswagen-chief-investigated-by-germany-in-emissionscheating-scandal-20170129-gu0xcs.html&title=Germany+investigates+ex-Volkswagen+chief+","https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.brisbanetimes.com.au%2Fbusiness%2Fconsumer-affairs%2Fexvolkswagen-chief-investigated-by-germany-in-emissionscheating-scandal-20170129-gu0xcs.html&text=Germany+investigates+ex-Volkswagen+chief+in+emissions-che","https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.brisbanetimes.com.au%2Fbusiness%2Fconsumer-affairs%2Fexvolkswagen-chief-investigated-by-germany-in-emissionscheating-scandal-20170129-gu0xcs.html&title=Germany+investigates+ex-Volkswagen+chief+in+emission","http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.brisbanetimes.com.au%2Fbusiness%2Fconsumer-affairs%2Fexvolkswagen-chief-investigated-by-germany-in-emissionscheating-scandal-20170129-gu0xcs.html&title=Germany+investigates+ex-Volkswagen+","http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.brisbanetimes.com.au%2Fbusiness%2Fconsumer-affairs%2Fexvolkswagen-chief-investigated-by-germany-in-emissionscheating-scandal-20170129-gu0xcs.html&title=Germany+investigates+ex-Volkswagen+chief+in+emissions","https://www.facebook.com/SavvyConsumer/","http://www.facebook.com/brisbanetimes","https://twitter.com/brisbanetimes"],"sequenceId":"695199052956","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T18:24:17Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:48:47Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/content/dam/images/g/k/8/g/o/6/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.gu0xcs.png/1485671057627.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

That's something you've got to get through, the first 10-15 overs are crucial. With the line-up that we play, if we can have wickets in the shed at the back end then we will score a lot of runs at the end of the (innings).\" \n\nThe keeper found out the perils of taking on Eden Park's small boundaries when he played at the ground for the first time last February, caught at cow corner trying to heave Corey Anderson over the ropes. \n\nThe Australians were all out for 148 on that occasion, with the Black Caps' seamers running riot on the way to a 2-1 series win. It was a similar story a year earlier, with the Aussies skittled for 151 in a World Cup clash that the Kiwis only won by a wicket. \n\nAt the same time, Eden Park's unusual dimensions have resulted in big scores before. Although the tourists failed to pass 150 last time around, New Zealand posted a score of 8-307 in the same game. \n\nIndeed, before Australia's innings that day, seven of the last eight innings at the ground had gone past 280 runs. \n\n\"(The Eden Park pitch) just has a bit in it,\" New Zealand veteran Ross Taylor said. \"I don't think there is a par score, some wickets here are 300, some are 200. \n\n\"You just have to analyse it as quickly as possible, whether you're batting or bowling.\" \n\nThe Kiwis were trounced 3-0 in Australia when the sides met in December, but Wade is expecting a tougher time on New Zealand's turf. \n\n\"We played them in Australia (on) big grounds (with) long boundaries. It's a completely different ball game,\" he said. \n\n\"(On) the smaller grounds (in New Zealand) they'll still play aggressive; they're still going to be able to hit plenty of fours and sixes at grounds that they play at. \n\n\"They play well here (in NZ) and they play this venue very well. \n\n\"We like to think we're hard to beat in Australia and it's the same when we come here - we expect a hard challenge over the next three games but we've got a young squad and we're excited to go out and really have a crack at it.\" \n\nCaptaining the side for the first time, Wade maintains his job is simply to continue the fine work of the leadership duo of Steve Smith and vice-captain David Warner. \n\n\"I don't think for me personally it's about putting a stamp on the team,\" he said. \"It's about driving the values and the game plan that we have in one-day cricket moving forward. \n\n\"Steven and David have put their stamp on the team, it's just about me keeping on driving those key messages through to the players. \n\n\"We've performed really well in one-day cricket over a long period of time so it's not about trying to change too much - it's about keeping the ball rolling.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"New Zealand news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Aussies wary of Black Caps on home turf","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"4741","state":"Queensland","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Mackay MC","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Daily Mercury News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169662045","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"12"},"name":"Daily Mercury News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.dailymercury.com.au","publisher":"APN Holdings NZ Limited"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199055770","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T00:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:48:47Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://media.apnarm.net.au/img/media/images/2017/01/29/b88557687z1_20170129162619_000g9dg4eu82-0-5o7dbx25uooe6wninn2_ct300x300.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Purported investors suddenly morph into traders, and traders ditch their carefully curated trading plans in favor of 'playing' the event. More often than not, best laid plans to trade the news don't work out as expected. A damp squib is the most likely result, but in quite a few instances, serious portfolio losses have been incurred from this habit as well. \n\nBroking houses, ably supported by some media channels, go on to release a plethora of short term 'budget' trading calls or bets, cashing in on the hype to shore up their trading volumes and revenues. A very large segment of investors and traders burn their fingers by succumbing to the lure of short term profits. \n\nHow markets function - the short and long of it \nOne of the most famous quotes attributed to the venerable Ben Graham is that \"in the short term, markets function like a voting machine, and in the long term, they function like a weighing machine\". In other words, short term price movements are largely driven by opinion, while long term price movements by facts. \n\nThe stock market comprises of lakhs of different players, each with their own distinct character. Some are long term investors, some speculators, some hedgers, and some arbitrageurs. \n\nIn the short run, price action drives markets. Contrary to what technical analysis skeptics will tell you, key support and resistance levels do exist; and momentum indicators, read properly, can actually tell a compelling story about the near-term direction of where markets are headed. These 'price actions' are independent of any upcoming news or event, as they already factor in consensus opinion (\"votes\") about the event itself. \n\nAlso, worth noting is the fact that it's not the news itself, but rather, the expectation of the news that influences short term market movement. Sometimes, these expectations get factored into the current market price well in advance (weeks, even months), and these speculators square off their positions after the actual event takes place. This leads to those oft observed confounding \"market falls, despite good outcomes\" - or vice versa, for that matter. \n\nEven seasoned traders sometimes fall into the trap of abandoning their well-drafted trading plans by attempting to 'predict' the outcome of an event. Trading, already fraught with risk and imbued with low probabilities of success, thereby takes on an even more perilous shape during these times. Experienced traders would do well to rather continue trading based on their tried and tested price action based strategies, irrespective of the upcoming event. \n\nAlongside traders, investors who buy stocks just ahead of, or immediately following an event such as the budget also suffer their share of pain - especially when they do so with the wrong mindset, and a short-term horizon of 3 to 18 months. Global factors, unforeseen risks, or simply delayed earnings growth could push down stock prices across the board in shorter time frames - even fundamentally good stocks take a beating when selling is rampant. Therefore, \"investors\" who are playing the budget by taking short term calls are likely to wind up a disillusioned lot. \n\nSo, what should a stock market investor do now? \n\nSit tight, and wait for the budget to be announced. True, you may miss a little bit of the ride in some stocks, but it'll be well worth it when you factor in the risk you'll be circumventing. Rather than speculate on budget outcomes, why not wait for the actual outcomes to come to the fore? \n\nFreed from the burden of guesswork, you can now focus your analysis on the impact that the budget might have on core fundamentals of sectors and companies. For instance: has there been a thrust into low cost housing? Has defense capex been lent a fillip? Will the budget proposals boost fertilisers and agrochemicals? Is there anything in it for banks? \n\nIn a top down manner, you can work on on picking fundamentally sound companies within each impacted sector, that will likely benefit from the budget proposals - perhaps not immediately, but eventually. \n\nStock prices are servile to earnings in the long run. If any of the budget proposals are poised to generate serious medium to long term EPS growth for a company, it becomes a worthwhile pick from a three to five-year horizon. \n\nWait until the budget is announced, and then make rational investment decisions. If you miss a bit of the ride, don't fret - the journey to stock marketing investing success involves many more stops.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Finance latest","group":"Finance"},{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Hey You!

A man wins a costume contest for his outfit resembling the villain from \"Aladdin,\" Jafar. Women on stilts, wearing wardrobes encompassing nearly the entire color spectrum, jaunt around the crowd as bands play familiar music both outside and in tents. \n \nBut the main draw is the quick dash into the bay, all to raise money and awareness for the cause. \n \nWith Jim Schmutz, CEO of Special Olympics Maryland, declaring that the water temperature \"is a balmy 41 degrees\" Fahrenheit at 3 p.m., it's not as bad as years past when the bay froze, requiring officials to chip away at the ice for the event to move forward, according to Kent Island native Taz Whitley. \n  \n\"People's legs were bleeding when they were coming out of the bay because they were getting cut up by the ice,\" Whitley said of the last time he participated. \n \nNow living in Arlington, Virginia, the 38-year-old said that while 41 degrees is certainly better than the previous two times he participated, the frantic run through the water still isn't easy. \n \n\"I don't think you do prepare for it. You kind of just have to do it,\" Whitley said. \n \n\"The first time, it just numbs you for the first 60 seconds,\" Pasadena resident Sam Schnieder said. \"But then it's just cold.\" \n  \nThe 46-year-old is also participating in the plunge for his third time along with his son Daniel, who had a biting description of what it's like to first step onto the beach. \n \n\"The sand feels like needles when you're getting out,\" he said. \n \nZak Thomas, from Deep Creek, said he tried to take the brunt of the cold as quickly as he could. \n \n\"I sprinted in and just dove in. They said no diving, but I kind of skimmed it,\" Thomas said. \n \nIt being his first time, he said the afternoon sun beaming down on the beach helped to ease some of the cool winter air. \n \nFor all the bravado exhumed prior to the plunge and the inevitable expletive-laden descriptions of pain that follow, the end goal is one everyone in attendance can support. \n \nOrganizers said that as of the last plunge at 3 p.m., the plunge raised $2.4 million to go toward the Special Olympics, coming up just shy of the goal of $2.5 million but surpassing 2016's $2.25 million. \n \n\"The really cool thing about this is \u2026 some people raise money in the summer and over six months raise money,\" Schmutz said. \n \nHe said that of the three plunges on Saturday \u2014 one in the morning for families and two in the afternoon for anyone and everyone \u2014 upward of 6,000 people tested their will against the bay. \n \n\"Again, it just shows the spirit of Marylanders. As cold as it was, and it really warmed up this afternoon with the sun coming out, wind was blowing earlier, but the energy of this event is really demonstrative of the passion that people have for committing themselves to a bigger cause than themselves,\" Schmutz said. \n \nThe money raised will go toward supporting 7,211 athletes who participate in 27 different sports, Schmutz said. \n \nSusie Brashler, a 22-year-old case manager from Baltimore who works with adults with intellectual disabilities, said she wanted to participate in the plunge for the first time this year. \n \nShe said it's important to create an environment that supports those with developmental disabilities. Special Olympics athletes walk among the crowd at the event and become a part of the plunge's DNA in both spirit and participation. \n \nFor Brashler, her participating in the plunge itself \"wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be.\" \n \nBut when asked about the importance of having thousands of people pledge a weekend down at a frigid beach to raise money for the community she supports, she said it's crucial to get more people to participate and contribute. \n \n\"We can't really put on the programs we do without the funds that come from events like this,\" she said.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Hampton Roads news","group":"US regional"},{"name":"Baltimore news","group":"US regional"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"}],"title":"A frigid dash into the Chesapeake Bay: You kind of just have to do it","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Anne Arundel","zipCode":"21401","state":"Maryland","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Annapolis","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Maryland Gazette","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"278938750","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"427"},"name":"Maryland Gazette","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.capitalgazette.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199064481","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:48:50Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The team was part of Friday's Police, Fire & EMS, and Military Plunge. \n \n\"No matter the temperature of the water, the warm feeling you feel inside supersedes that,\" explained Bruce Bouch, senior deputy state fire marshal and member of the Gamber & Community Fire Department. \n \nThe Polar Bear Plunge holds multiple plunges over Friday and Saturday, in addition to the 24-hour Super Plunge. Friday was dedicated to plunges for police officers, firefighters and emergency personnel. There are two public plunges Saturday. \n \nEach participant must pledge at least $75, with Super Plungers aiming to raise $10,000. The money raised goes on to help Special Olympians by funding different competitions and activities, according to the Maryland Special Olympics . \n \nBouch, who dons an embroidered fire safety cape for the event, said the plunge is \"just another way to give back.\" This year is the sixth time he has participated. \n \n\"Before you go in, you stand outside and acclimate to the air temperature,\" Bouch said. \"When you enter the water it doesn't seem as bad. When you get out of the water, that's when you feel the coldest but you're at the finish point and all you need to do is change into dry clothes.\" \n  \nWhen participants enter the heated tent after the plunge and start high-fiving, Bouch said \"you think about doing it again but then go 'nah.'\" \n \n\"I do applaud those that reach the 24-hour plunger level because they are doing so much good for this group of great individuals,\" Bouch said. \"If you don't have the time or are that fearful of colder temperatures, you can always donate to the team and bolster our efforts.\" \n \nGamber & Community Fire Company member Shawn Chenoweth, of Gamber, is also a member of the MSFA team. He has participated for five years. \n  \n\"Special Olympics is a great cause and the money goes to support the athletes,\" Chenoweth said. \"It's fun being with a group of friends and raising money for a good cause.\" \n \nChenoweth said the plunge is \"something that everybody should do at least once.\" \n \nPast president of the MSFA Johnie Roth, of Brookeville, also took the plunge. He has participated with his family for seven years and his son, Eric, is a Special Olympian. \n \n\"We've always been supportive of Special Olympics,\" Roth said. \"When you have someone in your family, you put in an extra effort. Last year we plunged twice.\" \n \nRoth said being on the beach with hundreds of people helps \"psych yourself into it.\" \n \n\"To see these kids and young adults giving everything they've got is inspiring. I get a kick out of cheering the kids on,\" Roth said. \"It's all for the Special Olympians.\" \n \nmichel.elben@carrollcountytimes.com \n \n410-857-7873 \n \ntwitter.com/MichelElben","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Freezin' for a reason: 2017 Polar Bear Plunge at Sandy Point","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Anne Arundel","zipCode":"21401","state":"Maryland","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Annapolis","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Maryland Gazette","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"278938750","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"427"},"name":"Maryland Gazette","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.capitalgazette.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199068190","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:48:50Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

They're co-ordinating with private attorneys and firms that have volunteered to help. They're reviewing statutes, setting priorities and seeking donations. \n \n\"It's going to be all-out war,\" said Vermont Law School Professor Patrick Parenteau. \"If you're an environmentalist or conservationist, this is indeed a scary time.\" \n \nTrump's first week in office only heightened their anxieties. He moved to resume construction of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines that the Obama administration had halted, while signalling intentions to abandon his predecessor's fight against global warming, vastly expand oil and gas drilling on public lands and slash the Environmental Protection Agency's budget. \n \nGOP lawmakers, meanwhile, introduced measures to overturn a new Interior Department rule barring coal mining companies from damaging streams and to remove some wolves from the endangered species list. \n \n\"They've wasted no time in doing bad things,\" said Pat Gallagher, director of the Sierra Club's 50-member legal team, which he said is likely to grow as environmentalists increasingly regard the courts as their best option, even though success there is far from certain. \n \nThe Department of Justice, which represents the federal government in environmental lawsuits, declined to comment, while the White House did not respond to emails seeking comment. Doug Ericksen, communications director for Trump's transition team at EPA, said of the environmentalists that he's \"not sure what they think they're preparing for\" but suspects they are stoking fear of Trump as a fundraising tool. \n \n\"They're more concerned about raising money than protecting the environment,\" Ericksen said. \n \nJim Burling, litigation director for the Pacific Legal Foundation, a non-profit property rights group that sues regulators on behalf of businesses and landowners, also contended environmental groups were exaggerating the Trump administration's threat for political and financial gain. \n \nThe government bureaucracy is entrenched, Burling said, and, \"who happens to occupy the White House hasn't made that much difference.\" \n \nEnvironmentalists say their fears are justified by the new administration's antagonism toward government's role in keeping air and water clean and the planet from overheating. \n \nDonations began increasing after Trump's election, \"even before the fundraising letters were sent\" asking for support to fight the administration's actions, said David Goldston, government affairs director at the Natural Resources Defence Council. \n \nEarthjustice, which has represented the Standing Rock Sioux tribe in its fight against the Dakota Access Pipeline, has about 100 staff attorneys and plans to bring more aboard, said Tim Preso, who manages the group's Northern Rockies office. \n \nThe Chicago-based Environmental Law & Policy Center is adding four attorneys to its pre-election staff of 18 and is co-ordinating with more than a dozen outside attorneys who would file citizen suits against polluters for free if agencies fail to enforce existing rules, said Executive Director Howard Learner. \n \n\"We cannot fully substitute and replace the EPA doing its job,\" Learner said. \"But on the other hand, we're not going to default to zero if the EPA steps backward when it comes to clean air and clean water enforcement.\" \n \nOn inauguration eve, five law professors filed a brief in support of a 2015 regulation giving EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers discretion to regulate tributaries and wetlands far upstream from navigable lakes and rivers to protect water quality. \n \nDozens of states have sued to block the rule \u2014 including Oklahoma, led by state Attorney General Scott Pruitt, now Trump's choice for EPA administrator \u2014 saying it gives government too much power over private property. \n \nShortly after Trump took office, his White House webpage listed the rule among \"harmful and unnecessary policies\" he would target. \n \n\"If the Trump administration won't defend the rule, I want to stand alongside environmental groups and do what I can to defend (it),\" said David Uhlmann, a University of Michigan law professor and former Justice Department prosecutor, who helped file the brief. \n \nGoing to court is just one tactic environmental lawyers will use, said Erik Schlenker-Goodrich of the Oregon-based Western Environmental Law Center, which also plans new hires. They will monitor agencies for failure to enforce pollution law or cutting corners when writing permits for activities such as oil and gas drilling, he said. \n \nThe Sierra Club's Gallagher, who sued over oil drilling beneath national parks during the George W. Bush administration, said another tactic would be making liberal use of open-records laws to obtain scientific data and other materials that might otherwise be purged. The group already has requested records on climate change from the EPA. \n \n\"We're not surprised at what they're doing, but maybe a little surprised at how fast and furious it's all happening,\" Gallagher said. \"But we were bracing for it and we're ready.\" \n \n___ \n \nFlesher reported from Traverse City, Michigan. \n \n___ \n \nFollow Webber and Flesher on Twitter: https://twitter.com/twebber02, https://twitter.com/JohnFlesher","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Environment news","group":"Science"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"US politics news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Environmentalists preparing to battle Trump, GOP in court","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","zipCode":"V0N","state":"British Columbia","countryCode":"CA","zipArea":"North Island, Sunshine Coast, and Southern Gulf Islands","country":"Canada"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Whistler Question","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169662252","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Whistler Question","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.whistlerquestion.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://twitter.com/twebber02","https://twitter.com/JohnFlesher"],"sequenceId":"695199080381","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:48:53Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The Japanese company is expected to announce a flagship smartphone at Mobile World Congress (MWC), but also a few mid-range devices that will go alongside the high-end device. \n \nOne of the mid-range handsets that could be announced next month is the Sony G3121. The phone is said to be the Xperia XA's successor , but other than that we didn't know too many things about it. \n \nLuckily, someone made of video of a Sony G3121prototype and published it on YouTube, so we now know what the phone will look like. Unfortunately, the person who uploaded the video did not offer any details about the phone's specs aside from the fact that it does not come with fingerprint sensor. \n \nA fingerprint sensor on a a mid-range smartphone would have been highly unlikely anyway. One other piece of information that we've learned about watching the video is that the G3121 will definitely ship with Android 7.0 Nougat operating system right out of the box, which isn't surprising considering we're in 2017. \n \nDesign-wise, the G3121 retains the same design specific to Sony smartphones, which implies large bezels and rather thick form factor. The phone features on-screen buttons as well, and we can see there's a microSD card slot on the left side for memory expansion. \n \nThe rear camera has been positioned on the upper left corner, not in the middle as most smartphones do. It's got a single, small LED flash, which should be enough for a mid-range device. Sony G3121 does look to be made of plastic, while the front side is covered with glass. \n \nThe mid-range smartphone comes with a dedicated camera button and a volume rocker on the right side. The power key is positioned near the volume button, on the right side. \n \nThe size of the display is unknown for the moment, but we believe this is a 5-inch display that supports HD (720p) resolution. We expect more info about the Xperia XA successor's specs to emerge in the coming days, so stay tuned.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Consumer electronics news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Asia-Pacific latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Japan news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Sony Xperia XA Successor Shown in Video Before MWC 2017 Reveal","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Eastern Europe","countryCode":"RO","country":"Romania"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Softpedia","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169658046","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"424"},"name":"Softpedia","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["InformationTechnology","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.softpedia.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199103494","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:45:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:48:56Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://i1-news.softpedia-static.com/images/fitted/340x180/sony-xperia-xa-successor-shown-in-video-before-mwc-2017-reveal.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

I was in Miami for work on election night, with colleagues from several other countries. It was a defining moment to be on American soil, especially to be so geographically close to a country the incoming president had promised to punish, and indeed, who would commence to do just that immediately. \n \nI've always had conservative friends, though more who tack left. I was raised as a conservative and until so many reached this fever pitch, polarizing hatred of each other in recent years, I could always find common ground with most people. But an electorate driven by fear and lies will never be a sound one, nor will it capitalize on the best that all individuals, and communities, have to offer regardless of political stripe. \n \nI also have many American friends, and as I sat watching the swells for a peaceful march on Washington, D.C., take shape, I knew I had to do something. I had to support friends who wanted no part of an administration that would trample women's rights, civil rights, and the environment, promote bigotry, racism, xenophobia and homophobia. \n \nI called a friend in New Hampshire and told her I was coming down to get her, and we were going to Boston to march. She asked if I had room for two more. Within an hour of saying on Twitter that I was going, a reader contacted me and said she'd knit me one of the famous pink hats. She did it the next day and I picked it up on my way. \n \nHere's the thing: I'm a rules kind of person. I made sure the press car I was driving had the requisite permission forms to take it over the border. I calculated how much money I would need and changed it up here. I had to read websites on how to go to a march because I'd never gone to one. And I got down there and was surrounded by 175,000 other people who were pretty much saying the same thing. \n \nI had some fear at the back of my brain. After the Boston Marathon bombing four years ago in this same place, I'd have to be a fool not to. There was trepidation underneath the sea of pink hats and handwritten signs, and there was concern surrounding all those strollers and children. But more importantly, there was an overwhelming sense of hope. \n \nYou've probably read reports that the marchers were a bunch of bored white housewives, but that is wrong, and unfair. Nearly 30 per cent of Boston's population is made up of immigrants; in the GTA that number is 52 per cent. When an incoming administration starts taking a bead on women and immigrants and those in the LGBT community, it is possible for citizens to feel the weight of many targets on their back. \n \nI'm not changing the world, but the world is changing me. The new U.S. administration is now also going after scientists, eliminating funding and silencing those who produce facts that get in the way of the made up nonsense that even their spokespeople can't name. \"Alternative facts\" are lies. Threatening to destroy the work done by NASA and dozens of other government agencies who deal in nonpartisan science is chilling. \n \nOur scientific community was similarly attacked by our former prime minister. To pretend we can ignore what's happening is foolish, because every decision being made down there affects us too. \n \nNot sure what I'll be wearing to the Science March, but I'll be there.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Lorraine Sommerfeld: I\u2019m not changing the world, the world is changing me","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","zipCode":"N2G","state":"Ontario","countryCode":"CA","zipArea":"Kitchener Central","country":"Canada"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Waterloo Region Record","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"372791995","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Waterloo Region Record","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Geographic","Local","Sports"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.therecord.com/"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199105773","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:48:57Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

They have always had a loving relationship. Mom has dementia and dad is her caregiver. He is refusing to put her into a home and his health is taking a turn. He has been able to take care of her to this point, but now it just is too much. How do I get him to let go? \n \nA: You are probably speaking of a long-standing marriage, likely of more than 50 years and your father is being a good husband to his wife. The thought of losing her or seeing deterioration in her care is so far a greater burden than being her caregiver. \n \nAt the same time, you are trying to be a supportive daughter with due concern for the well being of your father. These are challenging times and altogether too common. \n \nFrom your father's perspective, his care for your mother may be well worth the sacrifice of his own well being, even if unbearable for yourself. While you can't necessarily get him to do anything, you may be able to influence him with regard to his decisions. \n \nInfluencing starts with empathy. However, rather than empathizing about the difficulties in caring for his wife, you can empathize with him in losing her to this dreaded disease. You can also marvel at and appreciate his devotion to your mother. \n \nIn establishing an empathetic relationship, then you can discuss care options that could be consistent with his love for your mother and consistent with his expectations of her care. You can research and introduce your father to the various care options so he is well informed.

It was a display that ought to stand them in good stead too, with their next three away matches at Chelsea, Bayern Munich and Liverpool. \n \nWenger was serving the first game of his four-match ban and communicated through an earpiece to his assistant, Steve Bould, and first-team coaches but stood to applaud Welbeck\u2019s opener. It was his first Arsenal goal since last April and his first double since England beat Slovenia at Wembley in 2014 . \n \nIt has been a long road back for Welbeck, who was making his first start for the club since he sustained knee cartilage damage on the penultimate day of last season at Manchester City, and Wenger admitted he wondered whether the striker would return to his best after his injury troubles. \u201cYou wonder, I wondered first of all whether he would be solid enough mentally and secondly you hope that will all go well after the second surgery,\u201d he said. \n \n\u201cYou have always two fears, the first that it takes too long to get decision-making and secondly that the player is scared to go into contact so when he made the runs and was fighting with defenders, that was a very important moment for him. \n \n\u201cHe worked very hard, he went through some moments of very deep disappointment because he had a setback and then he had to go in again [for more surgery] on the knee. After the first disappointment he became even more resilient and worked even harder. He\u2019s highly respected at the club because he\u2019s shown so much dedication and has never moaned.\u201d \n \nIt was a harsh lesson for Claude Puel\u2019s young Saints and character building if nothing else, in the first FA Cup meeting between the sides since Robert Pirès\u2019s winner in the 2003 final. \n \nBoth teams were unrecognisable from their last matches \u2013 with both managers making 10 changes \u2013 but Arsenal played with their trademark attacking verve and curiosity. Only Shkodran Mustafi survived from the team who defeated Burnley last Sunday , with the former Southampton pair Walcott and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain named in Wenger\u2019s very attack-minded starting lineup. \n \nRelated: Southampton 0-5 Arsenal: FA Cup fourth round \u2013 as it happened \n \nNeither Aaron Ramsey nor Francis Coquelin travelled to St Mary\u2019s, but Oxlade-Chamberlain and Ainsley Maitland-Niles impressed as unorthodox central midfielders. There was room, though, for Alexis Sánchez to squeeze on to the substitutes\u2019 bench. \n \nThis was Southampton\u2019s eighth match this month and Puel\u2019s side were second best throughout. Shane Long was captain of a lineup with only 38 starts in the Premier League between them. \n \nArsenal were immediately on top, with Jeff Reine-Adélaïde having a shot deflected wide after three minutes. The 19-year-old had his chance after Walcott put on the afterburners in front of the Kingsland Stand, just as he used to as a teenager before joining Arsenal from Southampton in 2006. \n \nIt was only a matter of time before Arsenal opened the scoring, with Saints camped out inside their own half for much of this tie. Welbeck, making his first start for 265 days, obliged after 15 minutes, after Lucas Pérez sought him out with a neat no-look through ball and Welbeck dinked the ball over the teenage goalkeeper Harry Lewis and in off the crossbar. \n \nWenger stood up to clap Welbeck\u2019s opener from the director\u2019s box and the Arsenal manager was back on his feet seven minutes later. Welbeck doubled his and Arsenal\u2019s tally after converting Oxlade-Chamberlain\u2019s magnificent lofted ball that cut out the entire Southampton backline. Welbeck controlled the ball with a majestic first touch before poking beyond Lewis with his second. Welbeck wheeled off towards the corner flag to celebrate while the defender Jack Stephens could only crash into the post as he attempted to hook the ball clear. Arsenal were in cruise control. \n \nLong had a half a chance for Saints, forcing David Ospina into a stop from a tight angle after a clever through ball by Cuco Martina but Arsenal were unrelenting. \n \nWalcott then tapped home Welbeck\u2019s low cross from the left, as Southampton\u2019s hopes of dumping Arsenal out of both domestic cups vanished before their eyes inside 35 minutes. \n \nDespite their comfortable lead, Wenger introduced Sánchez shortly after the hour, as Welbeck left the field to a standing ovation. \n \nSánchez had been on the field for only four minutes but made an impact, laying the ball on a plate for Walcott to add his second goal of the match and deliver Arsenal a fourth. Walcott then completed the rout, sealing his hat-trick after Sánchez rolled a low ball across the box for the forward, who put the gloss on a sublime team performance. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s a disappointment for our fans and for our young players it was a good lesson,\u201d Puel said. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard now but the players will learn a lot for the future.\u201d \n \nThis article was written by Ben Fisher at St Mary's Stadium, for The Observer on Saturday 28th January 2017 19.34 Europe/London \n \nguardian.co.uk © Guardian News and Media Limited 2","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: EPL - Arsenal news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: soccer news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Arsenal\u2019s Danny Welbeck and Theo Walcott run riot against Southampton","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"GB","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Here Is The City","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169708994","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Here Is The City","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.hereisthecity.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.hitc.com/en-gb/topic/arsenal-fc/","http://www.hitc.com/en-gb/topic/fa-cup/","http://www.hitc.com/en-gb/topic/southampton/","http://www.hitc.com/en-gb/topic/danny-welbeck/","https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/27/arsene-wenger-hit-with-immediate-four-game-touchline-ban-by-fa-arsenal","https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/nov/15/england-slovenia-euro-2016-qualifier-match-report","https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/dec/23/danny-welbeck-arsenal-return-wenger-weapon","https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/22/arsenal-burnley-premier-league-match-report","https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2017/jan/28/southampton-v-arsenal-fa-cup-fourth-round-live","https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/30/arsenal-southampton-efl-cup-match-report","https://gu.com/p/5zb9h"],"sequenceId":"695199120059","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:44:09Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:48:59Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://cdn3-i.hitc-s.com/565/arsenal_manager_arsene_wenger_in_the_stands_431626.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Garry Birtles told me recently how he woke on the morning of the final with the skin rubbed off his knees from where, at some unspeakable hour, he had been dragged up the stairs to his room. Archie Gemmill, a 10pm\u2011to\u2011bed man, was practically kidnapped and nobody should have been too surprised when the game kicked off that Southampton ran rings round their groggy opponents in the first half. \n \nRelated: Nottingham Forest ask Burton Albion for permission to speak to Nigel Clough \n \nWhat is not so well known is that when David Peach gave Southampton the lead Alan Ball punched John McGovern, Forest \u2019s captain, in the kidneys on the way back to the centre circle. \u201cThis is Wembley, son,\u201d Ball shouted. \u201cTry to enjoy it while you\u2019re here.\u201d McGovern is not the aggressive type and resisted the temptation to do the same when Forest scored three times in the second half. He did, however, pinch Ball\u2019s bottom. \u201cThis is Wembley, Alan, why don\u2019t you start enjoying yourself?\u201d \n \nForest, under Clough, had a habit of getting the last word and, in happier circumstances, there would be an obvious attraction about the idea of his son, Nigel, getting his turn at a club that could desperately do with just a hint of the old man\u2019s peculiar, precious magic. \n \nEqually, who could really blame Clough junior, contemplating an invitation to leave the comparative sanity of Burton Albion , if he was filled with misgivings about working for a man his father might have threatened to chuck in the River Trent? Or if he concluded that Paul Heckingbottom, the manager of Barnsley, might be on to something when he described Forest as a no-go zone for any sensible member of the profession and asked a question that summed up how far a once-proud club had fallen: \u201cWhat\u2019s the point going there with it is as it is?\u201d \n \nThe same question applies for Clough, facing possibly the hardest decision of his professional life, if he takes into account that Forest are looking for their eighth permanent manager in four and a half years, that one of the people on that list lasted 40 days, another was so suspicious about the place he had the training ground swept for bugs (none was found) and that the club\u2019s decline has emboldened Alan Hardy, the new owner of Notts County, to talk about matching their neighbours in terms of size. Notts, to put it into context, are three places off the bottom of the Football League and have finished ahead of Forest twice in the past 60 years. \u201cMost people who can remember when County were a great club are dead,\u201d Jack Dunnett, their former chairman, once said. And that was 1983. \n \nThis, however, is the story of the modern-day Forest and though it might be unorthodox to see Stan Collymore, one of the players voted into the team\u2019s all-time XI, making it his business to extract some answers from Fawaz al\u2011Hasawi\u2019s inner circle it is a pity more people in the media, or even the Football League, had not shown the same determination to shine a light through all the neglect and mismanagement. \n \nWhen Brian Clough landed his coat on the peg for the first time, in January 1975, one previous manager, Dave Mackay, had warned him Forest were a lost cause and one committee member, Brian Appleby, described them as \u201cthe least progressive club in the country\u201d. Now, 42 years on, it is effectively a one-man committee and the person in question has just appeared in one newspaper cartoon wearing a jester\u2019s costume, sitting on a gold throne and carrying a bag marked \u2018Promises\u2019. Forest, as Clough put it all those years ago, are \u201cin the shit\u201d. \n \nThere is certainly a lot for Nigel to ponder bearing in mind the club where he wore the No9 shirt with such distinction have had a chief executive for only five months out of the 54 in Hasawi\u2019s ownership and the Nottingham Evening Post recently described Forest as having a \u201cstanding appointment at the high court,\u201d referring to all their unpaid tax bills and winding-up orders. \n \nOther than the owner, Forest do not have any directors and there is only a sprinkling of senior staff. A club who have won more European Cups than all the teams from London, Paris, Berlin, Moscow and Rome put together do not even think it necessary to employ a chief scout. Hasawi has not been to a game since 20 September and the club\u2019s press officer, Ben White, has been handling some of the responsibilities that would usually be expected of a chief executive. Otherwise the last man who held the title officially walked out in February 2015. Paul Faulkner has never been replaced and does not sound even remotely surprised when it comes to the collapsed takeover bid involving John Moores, the former owner of the San Diego Padres. On the contrary, Faulkner says he \u201csuspected it would be hard for anyone to get a genuinely fair deal over the line with the current regime\u201d. \n \nThe key word there is \u201canyone\u201d. Red Bull was attracted to the idea last year. A consortium from Canada was interested whereas Evangelos Marinakis, the notorious owner of Olympiakos, was so far down the line he was responsible for transfers and Philippe Montanier\u2019s appointment as manager, according to Hasawi \u2013 and it was not out of the question for members of staff to take booming phone calls straight from his office in Athens. \u201cMy hands were tied,\u201d Hasawi says. But have you ever heard of another club where the prospective owner, rather than the actual one, called the shots for months on end? \n \nOther buyers will no doubt emerge but they will not find it easy when, amid all the high sensitivity and confidentiality clauses, Moores felt compelled at one stage to explain the complications of trying to conduct due diligence at the City Ground, noting how his legal team \u201cfound the record\u2011keeping to be rather modest, at best, and we had to do a lot of painful work to understand their financial situation\u201d. So much pain, indeed, that Lalou Tifrit, who went by the title of Forest\u2019s head of finance and liked to boast that Arsène Wenger wanted to appoint him at Arsenal, is no longer at the club. \n \nHasawi now says he is willing to put a proper structure in place and wants supporters to give him the benefit of the doubt, again. Yet he has also conceded that Forest, under new ownership, would have been \u201cmore professional\u201d. Trevor Birch, a vastly experienced chief executive, had been lined up. Trevor Watkins, a sports lawyer and former Bournemouth chairman, had been identified as the conduit between San Diego and Nottingham. Paul Mitchell, who is on gardening leave after resigning as Tottenham Hotspur\u2019s head of recruitment, was on his way as sporting director and an approach had been made to Gary Rowett to become the new manager. \n \nSounds reasonable, doesn\u2019t it? And here\u2019s the other thing: Moore and his business partner, Charles Noell, also wanted to go ahead with plans to replace the oldest stand with a two-tier structure that would have swept round to the Trent End, increasing capacity to 35,000, as well as creating a mini Wembley Way featuring restaurants, bars and a fans\u2019 plaza up to the old Rushcliffe Borough Council offices \u2013 which would have been turned into a five-star hotel. \n \nThose plans, shown to this correspondent last summer, are contained in a 90-page document that has been held in storage in the club\u2019s offices for some time. Instead, visit the City Ground these days and that shiny, photogenic stadium is starting to look grubby and old. Players and staff are routinely paid late, transfer embargoes have been enforced, protests are being arranged and managers not only have to deal with a tricky owner but also Hassan Saef, the man he employs as his eyes and ears. Apart from the obvious emotional pull \u2013 and it might come as a jolt to realise the original \u201cnice young man\u201d is actually now 50 \u2013 can anyone really blame Clough for wondering whether this might be the best, or worst, decision he ever makes? \n \nOne of the reasons why the takeover collapsed \u2013 and the Americans are certainly not blameless \u2013 is because Moore and Noell wanted the current owner to foot the bill for preparatory work on the part of the ground that was earmarked for development. That stand, incidentally, was renamed in 2015 in honour of Peter Taylor, Clough\u2019s assistant during the glory years \u2013 the following week it was realised the new sign was the wrong shade of red. More recently, the club have been encouraged to create the \u201cMiracle Gates\u201d at the front of the ground. Nigel might need one himself. \n Foxes\u2019 fading fortunes put Ranieri on edge  \nThat was a nice line from Alan Smith in his letter to Private Eye responding to the suggestion he may no longer be writing for the Daily Telegraph because Leicester City , one of his former clubs, had lost their way since winning the Premier League. \n \n\u201cYou claim in edition 1435 (Street of Shame, p8) that I was ditched by the Telegraph because I had outlived my usefulness now my old club Leicester City is struggling again after winning the league,\u201d Smith noted. \u201cI have to point out, however, that of the 20 years I wrote for the paper Leicester had been pretty crap for the first 19, barring a successful spell in the late \u201990s. How I survived all those fallow years must therefore be classed a mystery.\u201d \n \nUnfortunately for Leicester, reverting to type might still have its casualties and, however unappealing you or I may find the idea, it is tempting to suspect that if nothing improves the club\u2019s Thai owners might start giving serious thought to Claudio Ranieri\u2019s position. Let\u2019s hope not, though. Even by the standards of modern football it would be disheartening, in the extreme, to find out the sport really is that ungrateful. \n \nThis article was written by Daniel Taylor, for The Observer on Saturday 28th January 2017 21.59 Europe/London \n \nguardian.co.uk © Guardian News and Media Limited 2","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: soccer news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Chaotic Nottingham Forest hand Clough a head versus heart dilemma","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"GB","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Here Is The City","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169708994","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Here Is The City","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.hereisthecity.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.hitc.com/en-gb/topic/nottingham-forest-fc/","https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/26/nottingham-forest-burton-nigel-clough","http://www.hitc.com/en-gb/topic/burton-albion/","http://www.hitc.com/en-gb/topic/leicester-city/","https://gu.com/p/5za62"],"sequenceId":"695199122018","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:43:17Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:49:01Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://cdn3-i.hitc-s.com/565/burton_albion_manager_nigel_clough_431617.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Kokomo forced Cass into a rash of turnovers, leading to a 17-2 run over the final 4:00 of the second quarter for a 26-19 halftime lead and the Kats went on for a 58-43 win Saturday night at Memorial Gym. \n \nCass coach Jon Kitchel pointed to Kokomo's deep bench as the key to the swing in momentum. \n \n\"The combination of their depth and their athleticism ... that's the result you get,\" Kitchel said. \"We had a team like that a few years ago that we could bring waves of guys in and pressure.

Kokomo had five turnovers and Cass had a 6-0 edge in points off turnovers. \n \n\"It's frustrating when you turn the ball over against a team that's not really trying to trap you. That's something all year long, we've stubbed our toe with,\" Moore said. \"But just to have six the next three quarters was much better for us.\" \n \nKokomo's defense completely turned the game in the second quarter. Kokomo had a 12-0 edge in points off turnovers in the quarter. Ten of those points came in the Kats' 17-2 run over the final 4:00 of the quarter. Keenen Wheeler's dunk off a turnover midway through the run put the Kats in the lead for good. \n \nCass' cause in the quarter was hurt by senior guard Evan Ohman heading to the bench with foul trouble and knee pain. \n \nThe Kats put the Kings away with another big run in the third quarter. Up 36-27 with 3:00 remaining in the quarter, the Kats reeled off a 12-2 run that Ty Sparling and Anthony Barnard capped with back-to-back 3-pointers. Barnard's triple, which beat the buzzer, came off a turnover and made it 48-29. \n \nThe Kats kept a comfortable lead throughout the final quarter. \n \nSparling scored 14 points to lead a balanced Kokomo attack. Brevin Beard scored 13 points on perfect shooting, Jeremy Baker had 13 points off the bench and Barnard had 12. \n \nBaker, a freshman forward, recently moved into a fulltime varsity role. \n \n\"He has a natural [offensive] ability that a lot of our guys don't have,\" Moore said. \"He found gaps [Saturday], he can pass the ball, he just has to continue to understand what to do off the ball and defensively how to play at an uncomfortable level and rebound. Once he gets to that point, and he will, it will take his game to a whole other level.\" \n \nBarnard had nine rebounds, five blocked shots and two steals. Beard and Wheeler had three steals apiece and Trajan Deckard had two steals. \n \nMoore liked how the Kats held the Kings to less than 40 percent shooting. Cass shot 34.1 percent (14 of 41). \n \nAlec Eurit and Kace Kitchel carried the Kings' offensive load. Eurit had 13 points and Kitchel had 11. Eurit had six rebounds and Cohen Nies had six rebounds and three blocks. \n \n\"We competed. We played hard,\" Jon Kitchel said. \"I thought Alec Eurit had a big game. He attacked them. I thought Kace's defense on [Barnard] was good and offensively he was aggressive. \n \n\"They're just a bad matchup for us. I don't know that we'll see anybody like this in the tournament. Hopefully we won't.\" \n \nJon Kitchel said Ohman's knee trouble is a concern going forward. He said the team may ease Ohman's workload in advance of the state tournament.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"BRYAN GASKINS Kokomo Tribune"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"BOYS BB: Kats turn up pressure to take down Kings","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Howard","zipCode":"46901","state":"Indiana","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Kokomo","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Kokomo Tribune","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169706228","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"826"},"name":"Kokomo Tribune","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.kokomotribune.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199136145","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:15:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:49:05Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/kokomotribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/2c/32c948f6-e5dd-11e6-9e8f-9fa820caf85e/588d72a51e1dd.image.jpg?resize=300%2C443"}],"video":[]}}

As many as 1,000 Mohalla Clinics are to be set up by March 31.\n\n\"Once we build that number, wherever you may be in Delhi, you will have access to a Mohalla Clinic within 10 minutes (distance).\"\n\nAt least 107 Mohalla Clinics have already come up across the capital, in both middle class and urban poor neighbourhoods, where doctors and medicines are available and people enjoy facilities for tests -- all for free.\n\nAround two million people have so far availed themselves of the benefits of Mohalla Clinics, the minister said, adding that a sharp increase in the number of clinics will significantly reduce the burden on major hospitals in Delhi.\n\nSisodia also said the Delhi government was committed to dramatically improving the quality of education. He said the number of schoolrooms built so far amounted to constructing some 200 new schools.\n\nIn addition, 100 new schools would come up in Delhi in the coming years, he said. \"It will be a good infrastructure for the next 20 years.\"\n\nSisodia said some 100 principals of government schools in Delhi which, he said, were undergoing major transformation, had gone to Cambridge for exposure to high-quality education.\n\n\"Another 100 will be sent to Harvard... And teachers will also go to Singapore, Finland and Germany.\"\n\n--IANS\n\nam-mr/sar/sac/tb","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"IANS India Private Limited"},"topics":[{"name":"Health care industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Healthcare management news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Education news","group":"Society"},{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Indian subcontinent news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Delhi to be model state for healthcare, education: Deputy CM Sisodia","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Yahoo!

Oak Hill finished with 231 points, followed by Western at 226.5 and Eastern at 212. Kokomo was fifth with 162.5 points and Taylor ninth with 16. \n \nIt was the closest race for the title since Marion edged Oak Hill 193-192.5 in 2008. \n \n\u201cWe had the lead, then we lost the lead, then we got the lead back, then we lost it again, got it back, we couldn\u2019t hang on to it,\u201d Western coach Chad Shepherd said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve seen this tournament this competitive.\u201d \n \nThe final round got progressively more tense as the team lead changed hands and big matches drew loud responses from the Oak Hill and Western contingents. \n \n\u201cIf people didn\u2019t enjoy [Saturday\u2019s] wrestling, they just don\u2019t enjoy wrestling,\u201d Eastern coach Bob Jarrett said. \u201cIt was a good day of wrestling for everybody.\u201d \n \nWestern entered 13 individuals and is advancing a dozen to next Saturday\u2019s Peru Regional. The top four wrestlers in each weight class advance. \n \nThe Panthers scored two champions, freshman Hunter Cottingham and sophomore Carter Ciscell. Cottingham scored a 4-1 decision over Marion\u2019s Jaylon Gibson in the 126-pound final. Wrestling as a No. 4 seed, Ciscell wrecked the 145 bracket, beating the top seed and then topping No. 2 seed, Oak Hill\u2019s Cole Ridgeway, by pin with 26 seconds left in the title match. \n \n\u201cWe wrestled great,\u201d Shepherd said. \u201cComing into this, people probably had us third, I would guess. We lost a couple close matches, I think we lost two one-point matches. We had a four seed win the tournament. That\u2019s pretty cool. We had a third seed get second [Dylan Goudy], we had a six seed come in third [Braxton Erb], we did really well. We\u2019ve been talking about this for two weeks, getting ready for this tournament and I thought they did a great job.\u201d \n \nAlso advancing for Western are Payton Lechner (second at 106 pounds), Chandler Ciscell (third, 113), Goudy (second, 132), Donavan Shepherd (third, 152), Kevin Lenahan (second, 160), Jacob Allen (third, 170), Matt Scott (third, 182), Erb (third, 195), Luke Lushin (fourth, 220), and Lane Eubank (third, 285). \n \n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a chance to get some guys out [to the semistate] next week, I\u2019m really happy with them,\u201d Chad Shepherd said. \n \n\u201cI just think it\u2019s great how much they\u2019ve grown. We wrestled Oak Hill in an eight-way earlier in the year and ... I think they beat us by 40, 50, 60 points, something like that. [To lose by] 4-and-a-half is a big improvement. And we don\u2019t have a 120-pounder.\u201d \n \nEastern advanced nine wrestlers to the regional and three Comets were crowned champs. Freshman Gerald Pearson beat Oak Hill\u2019s Bhupesh Chauhan 9-2 in the 113-pound final, freshman Tytus Morrisett beat Goudy 4-1 in the 132-pound final, and unbeaten senior Evan Ellis pushed his record to 35-0 with a 6-0 decision over Oak Hill\u2019s Owen Perkins \u2014 a returning state qualifier \u2014 in the heavyweight final. \n \nAlso advancing for the Comets are Macaiah White (third, 120), Aren Turner (second, 138), Eli Elkins (third, 145), Corbin Hetzner (second, 152), Ben Cole (third, 160), and Garrett Hetzner (second, 170). \n \n\u201cWe wrestled well, it was a good day, it just wasn\u2019t a great day,\u201d Jarrett said. For us to be up there with [Oak Hill and Western] everything had to go just right and obviously it didn\u2019t, but not truly disappointed, nine [advancing] is not bad.\u201d \n \nHighlights for Jarrett were: White beating the same higher-seeded Oak Hill wrestler twice in the same day, first in the quarterfinals, then in the third-place match; the two freshmen title-winners; Ellis\u2019 continued dominance; and Garret Hetzner\u2019s good start including an upset of the No. 2 seed. \n \nKokomo scored three champions and advances seven to the regional. Senior Jabin Wright won the 120-pound championship, getting up big in the title match before pinning Mississinewa\u2019s Courtland Smith with :50 left in the third period. Gavin Herrera, the No. 2 seed at 195, beat top-seeded Tony Fuller of Oak Hill 4-2 in the championship. And Nick Fox won the 220-pound final in an all-action performance, beating Eastbrook\u2019s Jackson Bush 18-3. \n \nAlso advancing for Kokomo are Nigel Lenoir (third, 106), Seth Johnson (fourth, 126), Rafael Lopez (fourth, 138), and DaShaun Barbary (second, 182). Barbary was leading 1-0 in his title match before Oak Hill\u2019s Blaney Harrison scored in the final seconds to score a 2-1 win. Lopez and Johnson were seeded outside the top four spots, but managed to get into the top four to advance to Peru. \n \n\u201cWe only had five guys seeded so those guys are expected to get out [to the regional],\u201d Kokomo coach Ryan Wells said. \u201cTo get seven out \u2014 everybody wrestled at or above their seeds and that\u2019s a great thing. For [Lopez and Johnson] that\u2019s absolutely great for them. Their records aren\u2019t as stellar as some of those other guys, to punch their ticket to the regional is pretty special for them. \n \n\u201cWe had four guys in the final, we had three champs. Gavin being a 2 seed and winning, he avenged a loss to Fuller from Oak Hill, he wrestled real well. Jabin is just lights out right now, he\u2019s up by 15 points and pins the kid. He\u2019s just really, really looking good. Fox looked great in the finals, tech falls his kid, a tough kid from Eastbrook. DaShaun, he\u2019s winning the entire [final] match, he won 5:45 of that match and gave up [points] at the end. He\u2019s good enough to beat anybody in the state. We firmly believe that and next week he\u2019ll get another shot at him.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"PEDRO VELAZCO Kokomo Tribune"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: wrestling news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"WRESTLING: Oak Hill edges Western, Eastern in tense sectional","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Howard","zipCode":"46901","state":"Indiana","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Kokomo","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Kokomo Tribune","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169706228","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"826"},"name":"Kokomo Tribune","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.kokomotribune.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199153375","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:45:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:49:11Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/kokomotribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/f/d3/fd3f4712-e5be-11e6-b11e-7bafe555385f/588d3fc9a5493.image.jpg?resize=300%2C193"}],"video":[]}}

Our America is big, it is free and it is open to dreamers of all races, all countries, all religions,\" said Legend, 38, who has an Oscar and a collection of Grammys for his songwriting. \n \n\"Our vision of America is directly antithetical to that of President Trump and I want specifically tonight to reject his vision and affirm that America has to be better than that.\" \n \nLegend's condemnation came after Trump signed a sweeping executive order to suspend the arrival of refugees for at least 120 days and impose tough new controls on travelers from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen. \n \nHollywood heavyweights including Robert De Niro, Martin Scorsese, Dustin Hoffman, Casey Affleck, Amy Adams, Justin Timberlake, and Jeff Bridges were at the gala in Beverly Hills. \n \n\"Zootopia\" won best animated picture, while ESPN's \"O.J. Simpson: Made in America\" won best documentary. \n \n- Consolation - \n \nIn the TV section, Nicole Kidman gave the first trophy of the night to widely acclaimed \"The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story\" for best long-form show. \n \nFX's series, a fictionalized account of the O.J. Simpson 1994 murder case, builds on the nine Emmys it picked up in September. \n \nNetflix sensation \"Stranger Things\" won best episodic drama, a consolation after being shut out at the Golden Globes. \n \n\"Making a Murderer,\" the 10-part story of a man serving a life sentence for murdering a 25-year-old woman, was named best non-fiction show. \n \nIt became a word-of-mouth sensation for Netflix at the end of 2015, earning the network six Emmy nominations. \n \n\"Atlanta\" followed its two Golden Globe wins with a PGA for best comedy, while \"The Voice\" took home the award for best competition series. \n \n\"Last Week Tonight with John Oliver\" bagged best talk or live entertainment show for the second year in a row. \n \nThe PGA has a solid record of giving top honors to movies that go on to earn best picture honors at the Oscars -- although last year's winner, \"The Big Short,\" was beaten out by \"Spotlight.\" \n \n\"I was asked to define what a producer does recently at a college and I said, 'a producer is impervious to rejection,'\" \"Hacksaw Ridge\" producer David Permut, a veteran of some 40 movies, told AFP. \n \n\"You get 'no's all the time, a million 'no's, a sea of 'no's.

She was the daughter of the late Jerome and Nancy (Kocher) Anderson. \n \nIn addition to her parents, Grace was preceded in death by her husband, Reverend William James Smith Sr.; brothers, Jerome, John, Lawrence, James, Lester, Carl, and Wesley Anderson; and sisters, Thelma Barnhart and June Anderson. \n \nGrace was a charter member of Archer Heights Church of the Nazarene, now known as Ferry Glenn Church of the Nazarene. Her husband, who served as pastor for over 40 years, was often heard declaring \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d was more than song, it was his wife. A faithful servant of the Lord, she taught adult Sunday school class, led the missionary ministry, hosted missionaries on leave in their home, and served on the church board. Her dedication to educating and broadening the perspective of others helped to equip the next generation of leaders and cultivate a safe environment in her community. \n \nGrace was a trailblazer, setting a path for others to follow. In the 1950s she was the first woman in her community to learn how to drive car and soon other women followed. She was the voice during PTA meetings calling for the protection and civil rights for children of color from her community integrating the schools in Follansbee, WV, during segregation. A dedicated wife and mother, she had a strong business sense which included a wallpaper hanging business serving the Tri-State Area during the 1970s. In the 1980s, Grace and her husband William went to the statehouse in Charleston, WV, to stand for environmental protection and protest the proposed chemical dumping on their mountainside. \n \nGrace\u2019s creative spirit captured beauty through all her work which inspired generations of women and men watching her. Beauty was clearly seen when she prepared a meal, set a table, planted a garden, or baked a pie. Grace had flair for design evident not only but especially through her collection of hats. She celebrated the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ through a flurry of festive and elegant decorations spreading Christmas cheer. Grace took time and gave thought to how she assembled and presented an offering to ensure it would be pleasing to the receiver. She served with grace and refinement. \n \nGrace laden her cooking and gardening with love, which she always had enough to share. Her fried chicken and pies will forever be remembered as a gift from God delivered by a beautiful soul. She nurtured and cultivated environments to help the living thrive. Her passion for gardening extended from oriental poppies to evergreens and green beans to fruit trees. Like the plants that grew strong and robust in her care, she poured her life into her family and friends who gained ability and strength from her. Children growing up around her will forever remember the treks she led through the mountain in search of wild blackberry patches \u2014 good for the body, mind and soul. \n \nGrace is survived by her seven loving children, William James Smith Jr., of Detroit, MI, David Keith Smith, Lila Elaine Wolfram and her husband, John, Deborah -Lee, all of Columbus, OH, Daniel Christopher Smith and his wife, Janice of Shafter, CA, Michelle Marie Jackson of Blacklick, OH, and Melissa Williams and her husband, Jaye of Bakersfield, CA; 12 grandchildren, a host of great grandchildren, and several great-great-grandchildren; a brother, Ernest Anderson of Colliers, WV; and extended family of nieces and nephews, friends and church family. \n \nFamily and friends will be received on Friday, February 3, 2017, from 5-7 p.m. and again on Saturday, February 4, 2017, from 10 a.m. until time of Homegoing Service at 11 a.m. at the James Funeral Home, Follansbee, WV, 304-527-1717, with Pastor Richard Clark, officiating. \n \nInterment will follow next to her dear husband, Reverend William J.

Within seconds, the entourage has disappeared, she\u2019s wiped every last scrap of foundation from her face and she\u2019s rummaging around underneath her dress, a kind of earth mother hippy smock, regretting her decision to wear tights on this sub-freezing day. \u201cWhy does anyone wear pantyhose?\u201d she exclaims, barefaced, faux-exasperated, shifting in her armchair, trying to get comfortable. \u201cThey\u2019re so fucking sadistic! They\u2019re not even control pants,\u201d she says, conspiratorially, \u201cbut I\u2019m forcing them to be.\u201d I was so much more brassy when I was younger. I\u2019m like: \u2018Where did you get those balls, kid?\u2019 For a lot of women, especially women who grew up between 1982 and the early 2000s, Barrymore is a particular kind of icon. She\u2019s the accessible rebel we all wanted to be, or be friends with. She\u2019s the child star of ET who hit the skids early and hard, and not only survived, but went on to be one of the most popular (and bankable) female stars of the past three decades. She appeared in, and often produced, the kinds of movies that are vital viewing for teenagers, from the trashy taboo-busting rebellion of Poison Ivy, to the triumphant high school romcom Never Been Kissed, to the moody angst of Donnie Darko. Plus, in her 20s, she seemed to hang out with the best bands, go to all the best parties and always looked like she was having the time of her life. She was the manic pixie dream girl before it became a tacky indie film stereotype. The memoir she wrote in 2015 is, appropriately, called Wildflower. She looks genuinely pleased that she holds such a place in people\u2019s minds, and decides that if people do like her, \u201cIf anyone has any goodwill towards me,\u201d careful not to sound arrogant, it\u2019s because she extends goodwill to other people. \u201cNot in an annoying way, but just, like, being in people\u2019s fucking corners.\u201d It\u2019s this combination of soft and sharp, all wrapped up in that valley girl lilt, that has carried her through life. \u201cI want people to be happy, but I know happiness has to be fought for.

Our America is big, it is free and it is open to dreamers of all races, all countries, all religions,\" said Legend, 38, who has an Oscar and a collection of Grammys for his songwriting. \n\n\"Our vision of America is directly antithetical to that of President Trump and I want specifically tonight to reject his vision and affirm that America has to be better than that.\" \n\nLegend's condemnation came after Trump signed a sweeping executive order to suspend the arrival of refugees for at least 120 days and impose tough new controls on travelers from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen. \n\nHollywood heavyweights including Robert De Niro, Martin Scorsese, Dustin Hoffman, Casey Affleck, Amy Adams, Justin Timberlake, and Jeff Bridges were at the gala in Beverly Hills. \n\n\"Zootopia\" won best animated picture, while ESPN's \"O.J. Simpson: Made in America\" won best documentary. \n\n- Consolation - \n\nIn the TV section, Nicole Kidman gave the first trophy of the night to widely acclaimed \"The People v. O.J.

Saturday night's ruling came in response to a challenge filed on behalf of two Iraqi men detained Friday night at JFK International Airport and impacted up to 200 others held across the country. \n \nAn unknown number of others intending to come back to the United States are trapped in other countries, unable to board planes. \n\n \nJudge Ann Donnelly's emergency stay, issued after an emergency hearing in Brooklyn, does not allow those detained at airports and those  in transit Saturday to enter or re-enter the United States. Her ruling, however, prevents the government from returning them to their home countries. Dozens of airport arrivals remain in limbo, unable to enter the country. \n \nThe judge also ordered the federal government to turn over a list of everyone currently being detained. \n \nShe did not rule on the constitutionality of Trump's order. And the order did nothing to quell the uncertainty and chaos at U.S. entry points caused by the order, issued without notice and little or no guidance to immigration agents on how to handle those arriving. \n\n \nTrump made no exception for people already vetted and admitted into the country legally but who were out of the country when he signed the executive order. \n \nOne of the Iraqi men, who was handcuffed at JFK Airport, worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Army in Iraq for 10 years. He had been granted a special immigrant visa. He was among dozens of people stopped at airports around the United States on Saturday. At Chicago's O'Hare International Airport , as many as 18 people were reportedly detained, including children and a man with a green card returning from a family wedding in Saudi Arabia . The detentions at the nation's major airports moved thousands of people to arrive at airports in New York, Chicago, Boston, San Francisco and other cities to protest, chanting \"let them in\" and \"this is what democracy looks like.\" \n \n\"We won,\" said the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Voting Rights Project, Dale Ho, reacting to the ruling. \n \nJack Vimo, policy analyst for the National Immigration Law Center, said the lawyers for the two JFK detainees met four crucial factors: \n the executive order causes irreparable harm; they have a likelihood of success on merits; there is no harm to the government; there is a likelihood of receiving class certification. \nVimo tweeted that the ACLU informed the judge the government was putting someone on a plane back to Syria. The judge saw that as putting someone at risk of irreparable harm. \n \nThe ACLU said it will continue to file suits on behalf of anyone who is stopped. \n \nIt was not clear if the government would appeal the judge's ruling. If it does, both sides will file briefs and a hearing will likely be held within days. \n\n \nShortly after the ruling, another judge, hearing a similar case in the federal court in Virginia, struck another blow against Trump's order. \n \nJudge Leonie Brinkema ordered that the government refrain from deporting any green-card holders being detained at Dulles International Airport and allow lawyers to meet with the detainees. \n\nA third federal judge - this one in Washington - also ordered a stay. \n\nJudge Thomas Zilly granted an emergency stay forbidding the government from removing two individuals from the United States until a hearing next week. \n\nThere are also cases pending in Chicago, New York, and other cities. \n \nTrump's executive order \u2014 which exempts certain diplomats traveling to the United States but does not mention those legally residing in the country as lawful permanent residents or with student or employment visas who might be returning to the U.S. \u2014 has created a new class of detainees in the United States. \n\n \nLawyers involved in the case heard in Brooklyn put the number of those held at 100 to 200. \n \nWhile many of Trump's executive orders have been met with criticism for their message, the immigrant ban has already had real impact on real people. \n \nThe seven countries in the order are not named but officials say they include Iraq, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Iran, Yemen and Sudan. Trump's order also bans the resettlement of refugees for four months and indefinitely suspends the entry of Syrian refugees. \n\n \nPeople who had been given visas to enter the United States after putting their families at risk by helping American troops were stopped as they exited airplanes arriving in airports in New York, Philadelphia, Boston, Dallas, and other cities. \n \nThe lawyers for two Iraqis who had been granted visas to enter the United States and were detained at John F. Kennedy airport, also are seeking class certification so that they can similarly represent all individuals covered by the executive order. That includes people with approved refugee applications, holders of valid immigrant and non-immigrant visas and other individuals from the seven countries banned by the executive order but who would have otherwise been granted legal admission to the U.S. \n \nWhen signing the order, Trump said it was aimed at keeping out \"radical Islamic terrorists.\" \n \nLawyers consulted by ProPublica said the ban could apply to hundreds of thousands of people from these countries who already live in the U.S. under green cards or on temporary student or employee visas. Reuters reported that green card holders from the seven countries who are now out of the U.S. will have to be cleared on a case-by-case basis to re-enter. \n \nA State Department statement reviewed by the Wall Street Journal but not been officially released says the ban would also apply to citizens of those seven countries who hold dual nationality. A federal law enforcement official told The Associated Press that those already in the U.S. with a visa or a green card would be allowed to stay. \n \nA senior administration official pushed back on the idea that the order was a Muslim ban, listing several predominantly Muslim countries that were not affected by the ban. \n \n\"We\u2019re dealing with a relatively small universe of people,\" the official said. \"It\u2019s important to keep in mind that no person living or residing overseas has a right to entry to the U.S.\" \n \nAsked about the immigration executive order on Saturday, Trump said it was not a Muslim ban. \n \n\"It\u2019s working out very nicely,\" he said. \"You see it at the airports, you see it all over.\u201d \n \nThe administration is still working to define \"in transit\" for the purposes of the hardship exemption for refugees who have been approved to enter the United States but are currently in a third country, according to the official. \n \nThe ACLU has lawyers stationed at airports across the country. \"If you know someone entering country, tell them not to sign anything before talking to lawyer,\" the ACLU tweeted . \n \nEven after the stay was issued Saturday night, it wasn't immediately clear what would happen to refugees and immigrants detained at airports across the country. \n \nAt JFK International Airport in New York City, dozens of attorneys huddled in the Terminal 1 arrivals hall attempted to explain to anxious family members what would happen to their relatives, who were still in federal custody. \n \nJennifer Johnson, another attorney volunteering Saturday at JFK, said she and others were still being denied access to the detainees. She said that tried to deliver a printed copy of the stay to the airport's CBP headquarters, but officers wouldn't accept it \u2014 so she slipped it under the door. \n \n\"Where are our clients? Where are our friends? Where are our family members?\" she said. \"Let's talk about the people still detained.\" \n\n \nSoon after, one Syrian woman in a wheelchair was released from Terminal 8 at JFK. \n \nIn Chicago, where the international terminal was packed with protesters, both inside and out, tearful reunions took place amid cheers as some detainees were released. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, responding to the O'Hare detentions, blasted the president's actions. \n \nTrump's actions \"have tarnished America's standing as a beacon of hope for the free world,\" Emanuel saidin a statement. \"Following the stay that was granted this evening, I am calling on the federal government to immediately produce a list of the names of anyone currently being detained at O'Hare or Midway airports, and calling on those unjustly affected to immediately be released and allowed access to legal counsel.\" \n\n\nAfter the judge's ruling in Brooklyn, those detained in Chicago were released. \n \nNBC Philadelphia reported two Syrian families detained at Philadelphia Airport were sent home on a return flight. The New York Times reported that the trip of a Syrian family of six headed for a new life to Ohio had been called off. According to the Times, a young Iranian woman and her family were ordered to leave a flight that had stopped in Istanbul. \n\n \nSEE ALSO: \n \nHameed Khalid Darweesh, one of the Iraqis detained at JFK, had worked on behalf of the U.S. in Iraq for 10 years and the other, Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, was coming to join his wife and young son who live in Houston. \n\n \nDarweesh and his family were granted special immigrant visas, according to the lawsuit. Between 2003 and 2013, he worked for the U.S. military and two U.S. government projects. Because of his association with the U.S. Armed Forces, the lawsuit states he was directly targeted twice. To obtain the special immigrant visa, Darweesh had to obtain a Chief of Mission approval from the embassy, a lengthy process that determines whether the applicant provided a \"faithful and valuable service to the United States.\" \n \nAfter receiving COM approval in January 2015, he and his family were granted the visas on Jan. 25, 2017. The suit states that they immediately boarded a flight to the U.S. because of the sensitive and dangerous nature of Darweesh's situation. \n \nDarweesh was later released from detention. Photos posted to Twitter by New York representatives Jerry Nadler and Lydia Velazquez showed Darweesh standing with the two representatives past the passport control and customs section of the airport. \n \nAt a press conference outside the airport, Darweesh thanked those who supported him. \n \n\"This is the humanity, this is the soul of America,\" he said. \n \n\"I'm very happy, really I forget what all I faced, whatever happened to me.\" \n \nAsked by a reporter what he thought of America, Darweesh replied that \"America is the greatest nation, the greatest people in the world.\" \n \nDarweesh worked as an interpreter for Brandon Friedman, who posted a photo of the two from 2003. \n \nThe second man, Alshawi, had been given a Follow to Join Visa to be with his wife and young son. His wife worked as an accountant for a U.S. contractor in 2006, as did her brother, which made them a target for insurgents, according to the lawsuit. She applied for refugee status for her and her son in 2011 and the two currently live in the country as lawful permanent residents. \n \nAlshawi's wife, who identified herself as D to the New York Times , said their 7-year-old son did not know that his father was coming home. \n \n\u201cIt was a surprise for him,\u201d she told the Times. \n \nNew York representatives Nydia Velazquez and Jerry Nadler, went to the airport to help those being detained. Velazquez says she was told by CBP agents that they are waiting for direction from the Department of Homeland Security to act. A protest at JFK  Saturday targeted the detention. \n \nChants of  \"hey hey JFK, no more fascist USA,\" and \"no hate, no hear, Muslims are welcome here,\" could be heard coming from the crowd. Around 300 people were gathered across the street from Terminal 4 at JFK near the arrivals area and the number was swelling. \n \nSpeaking at the protest, Becca Heller, director of the International Refugee Assistance Project, said in addition to Alshawi there were 10 others being detained at JFK but the organization was unable to take legal action on their behalf because their names had not been released. She called on CBP to release the names. \n \nThe lawsuit filed Saturday was the first of what is expected to be several legal challenges to Trump's executive order. The Council of Islamic Relations said on Friday that it would hold a news conference on Monday announcing the filing of a federal lawsuit on behalf of more than 20 individuals challenging the order. \n\n \nJohn Santore, Marc Torrence, Simone Wilson, Alison Bauter, Jonah Meadows, and Colin Miner contributed reporting. \n \nMain Image via Nydia Velazquez \n \nPhoto Credit: Terminal 4 at JFK by lemoncat1 via Flickr/Creative Commons","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Feroze Dhanoa"},"topics":[{"name":"Airline industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US Federal Government news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Lawsuits news","group":"Business"}],"title":"U.S. Judges Halt Trump's Deportations Of Dozens Held At Airports","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Suffolk","zipCode":"11777","state":"New York","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Port Jefferson","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Port Jefferson Patch","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"172088320","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Port Jefferson Patch","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.portjefferson.patch.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-executive-order-could-block-legal-residents-from-returning-to-america","http://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-visa-ban-also-applies-to-citizens-with-dual-nationality-state-department-says-1485628654?mod=e2fb","https://twitter.com/ACLU/status/825443851808669696","http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/Two-Syrian-Families-Detained-at-Philadelphia-International-Airport-Told-to-Fly-Back-Family-Member-Says-412047173.html?_osource=SocialFlowTwt_PHBrand","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/28/us/refugees-detained-at-us-airports-prompting-legal-challenges-to-trumps-immigration-order.html?emc=edit_na_20170128&nl=breaking-news&nlid=72675407&ref=cta","https://www.facebook.com/events/623562661169807/","https://www.cair.com/press-center/press-releases/14062-cair-to-announce-constitutional-challenge-to-trump-s-muslim-ban-executive-order.html","https://www.flickr.com/photos/lemoncat1/"],"sequenceId":"695199160868","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T16:53:20Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:49:12Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://cdn20.patch.com/users/22877259/20170128/091105/styles/T600x450/public/article_images/image_uploaded_from_ios_1024-1485654598-9499.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Trudeau oversaw the arrival of more than 39,000 Syrian refugees soon after he was elected. \n\n \nA spokeswoman for Trudeau said he has a message for Trump. \n \n\"The Prime Minister is looking forward to discussing the successes of Canada's immigration and refugee policy with the President when they next speak,\" spokeswoman Kate Purchase told The Associated Press. \n \nTrudeau is expected to the visit the White House soon. \n \nThe prime minister has refrained from criticizing Trump to avoid offending the new president. Canada wants to avoid becoming a target like Mexico has. More than 75 percent of Canada's exports go to the U.S. \n \nBrad Wall, the conservative premier of the Canadian province of Saskatchewan, offered his support to Trudeau. \n \n\"Sask has welcomed approx 2000 refugees this past year,\" Wall posted on Twitter. \"We stand ready to assist fed gov't re: anyone stranded by the US ban.\" \n \nToronto Mayor John Tory also weighed in, noting that the city is the most diverse in the world. \n \n\"We understand that as Canadians we are almost all immigrants, and that no one should be excluded on the basis of their ethnicity or nationality,\" Tory said in a statement. \n \nTrump signed a sweeping executive order Friday that he billed as a necessary step to stop \"radical Islamic terrorists\" from coming to the U.S. Included is a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen and a 120-day suspension of the U.S. refugee program. \n \nTrump's order singled out Syrians for the most aggressive ban, ordering that anyone from that country, including those fleeing civil war, are indefinitely blocked from coming to the United States. \n \nWhite House National Security adviser Michael Flynn told Canada's national security adviser that holders of Canadian passports, including dual citizens, will not be affected by the ban, Purchase said. \n \n\"We have been assured that Canadian citizens traveling on Canadian passports will be dealt with in the usual process,\" Purchase said. \n \nTrudeau later posted the statement on Twitter with the hashtag \"ACanadianIsACanadian.\" \n \nEarlier the U.S. State Department said that Canadians with dual citizenship from Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Syria, Yemen and Libya would be denied entry for the next three months. \n \nThe Syrian refugee crisis became a major issue in Canada's election in late 2015 because of the haunting image of a drowned 3-year-old Syrian boy washed up on a Turkish beach. The boy had relatives in Canada. Tima Kurdi, the aunt of the boy who became a symbol of the Syrian refugee crisis, called the U.S. ban on Syrian refugees inhumane and said she was proud of Canada. \n \nTrudeau's tweet quickly received hundreds of thousands of likes. \"Welcome to Canada\" trended on social media in the country.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Canada news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"PM Trudeau says Canada welcomes refugees","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Lancaster","zipCode":"17603","state":"Pennsylvania","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Lancaster","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WGAL Channel","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169674001","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"166"},"name":"WGAL Channel","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wgal.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://twitter.com/hashtag/WelcomeToCanada?src=hash","https://twitter.com/JustinTrudeau/status/825438460265762816"],"sequenceId":"695199166846","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:49:17Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 23 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Lancaster","zipCode":"17603","state":"Pennsylvania","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Lancaster","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WGAL Channel","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169674001","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"166"},"name":"WGAL Channel","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wgal.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199168813","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:49:19Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The \"sanitised\" report was declassified recently by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). \n \nThe report, whose complete title is not available as it is part deleted, was prepared on the basis of inputs available to the CIA till January 1986. \n \nThe very first sentence of the report's available (undeleted) page reads, \"Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi faces at least an even chance of assassination before his tenure in office ends in 1989.\" It, however, later clearly said that \"assassination is the major near-term threat\" to him. \n \nOver five years later, Gandhi was assassinated at Sriperumbudur in Tamil Nadu on May 21, 1991. \n \nThe first section titled \"Key Judgments\" analyses and deliberates upon what likely scenario would emerge in the domestic and international political situation if there is a sudden change in leadership minus Rajiv Gandhi and the likely impact on India's relations with the US, the then USSR and the region. \n \nIt also dealt with the threats posed to Gandhi's life by various extremist groups at that time and the likely consequences of his murder. \n \n\"If Gandhi fell to a Sikh or Kashmiri Muslim assassin, widespread communal violence probably would erupt even if strong preventive security measures - including deployment of Army and paramilitary troops across northern India \u2013 were taken by the Indian President ......(deleted),\" it said. \n \nInterestingly, it also named P V Narasimha Rao and V P Singh, as the \"interim successor\" and \"likely candidates\" in case of a sudden exit by Gandhi. Rao took over as the Prime Minister in 1991. \n \nIn a section, titled The Threat of Assassination: Stability in Jeopardy , the report says \"In our view, there is at least an even chance in the next several years of an assassination, most likely by extremist Sikhs or disgruntled Kashmiri Muslims who have targeted Rajiv,\" besides \"a fanatical Hindu\". \n \nSince a significant portion of this section is deleted, it is not clear whether Sri Lankan Tamil extremists were also included in the analysis. However, another section deals in-depth with Gandhi's mediation efforts to resolve \"the conflict between militant Sri Lankan Tamils and the Sinhalese-dominated government in Colombo...\" \n \nBesides Gandhi's possible assassination, the report also analysed various scenarios of his \"abrupt departure\" from the political scene before 1989. \n \n\"Although we believe assassination is the major near-term threat to Rajiv's tenure, any of several other events could cause his abrupt departure from the political scene before 1989,\" it said while listing out several other possibilities including \"his death from natural causes or by accident\". \n \nIt ruled out the possibility of a decision by him \"to resign out of frustration\", saying \"we see no signs of this and believe it would be out of character\". \n \nThe CIA report also noted, \"We suspect, however, that Rajiv would calculate -- as we do -- that he and his kin would be targets for extremist violence even if he left public office.\" \n \nIn a section called \"Implications for the United States\", the report says \"We believe (Rajiv) Gandhi's death would represent a significant blow to US interests, regardless of the circumstances of the succession.\" \n \nIt also added, \"...We believe Indo-US relations could also suffer as a result of domestic political changes following Rajiv's assassination.\" \n \nThe report assessed Gandhi's policies ranging from dealing with extremists, foreign relations (including Sri Lankan Tamil issue) to promoting acquisition of selected foreign technology\" among others, and their outcome. \n \n\"Although some of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's policies will continue to encounter serious resistance over the next several years, we believe his dominance of the Indian political scene is secure until at least the end of his present term of office in December 1989, barring his incapacitation or death,\" it said. \n \nThe report also dealt with the possibility of a \"national government\" taking over in case of a sudden exit by Gandhi, while discounting the possibility of a military coup in such a scenario. \n \nSeveral portions of the 23-page report were deleted before the CIA decided to release it under the Freedom of Information Act.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Sri Lanka news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"}],"title":"CIA assessed Rajiv Gandhiâs assassination 5 yrs before his death","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Deccan Chronicle","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169673440","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"137"},"name":"Deccan Chronicle","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.deccanchronicle.com/"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199169351","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:49:20Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Ms Pillalamarri, has lived in Bel Air for more than 30 years and is a US citizen. \n \nAravinda Pillalamarri, 47 was walking in her Bel Air neighbourhood in Maryland on the morning of December 21, a routine with her, when she said she was stopped by a Bel Air Police Department officer, The Baltimore Sun reported. \n \nMs Pillalamarri, who was born in India but moved with her parents to the US when she was young, was asked by the police officer about what she was doing and she replied that she was walking. \n \nThe officer continued to ask several questions. When she asked why the officer was asking her so many questions, he replied because someone had called police. \"Walking while brown?\" Ms Pillalamarri then asked the officer. \n \nThe report said a police supervisor arrived at the scene and began to question Pillalamarri more aggressively. The supervisor told her she wasn't free to leave because she \"was under criminal investigation.\" \n \nHe asked why she didn't have a proof of identification with her. \"Why don't you have ID?\" she said the supervisor asked her. \"Are you here illegally?\" \n \nOnce the officers had run her name through their computer system, Ms Pillalamarri said, she was allowed to leave and walked to her home, just a few doors away. \n \nMs Pillalamarri's parents came to the US from India when she was a baby. She went to Bel Air High School. \n \n\"Only when the supervisor asked 'are you here illegally' did my sense of colour, and of being unequal, come forth and my interest in my civil rights take a back seat to get out of the situation safely,\" she was quoted as saying. \n \n\"Public safety does not need to come at the cost of civil rights,\" she added. \"I am sharing this incident here not to ask anyone here to find fault or take sides. We are all on the same side and can use this as an opportunity to learn and improve. The responsibility to uphold civil rights is one that all of us share, and we need to do our part and also expect the police to do their part.\" \n \nMs Pillalamarri said she walks in her neighbourhood nearly every day. She related her story to members of the Bel Air Board of Town commissioners at their town meeting on January 17, not to get anyone in trouble but to bring to their attention the need to uphold everyone's civil rights. \n \nColour was not on her mind when she was first stopped, Ms Pillalamarri told the commissioners. \n \nBel Air Police Department Chief Charles Moore, who's led the agency since September 2015, said he is not sure if his department has a policy specifically dealing with questioning a person's immigration status, but added, \"If there isn't one, there will be.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US immigration news","group":"Society"},{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Indian subcontinent news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Indian-American who inspired Swades questioned on immigration status","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Deccan Chronicle","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169673440","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"137"},"name":"Deccan Chronicle","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.deccanchronicle.com/"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199169555","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:49:19Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Far from being constant, this field is continuously changing. Indeed, our planet's history includes at least several hundred global magnetic reversals, where north and south magnetic poles swap places. So when's the next one happening and how will it affect life on Earth? \nDuring a reversal the magnetic field won't be zero, but will assume a weaker and more complex form. It may fall to 10 percent of the present-day strength and have magnetic poles at the equator or even the simultaneous existence of multiple \"north\" and \"south\" magnetic poles. \n\nhe alteration in the magnetic field during a reversal will weaken its shielding effect, allowing heightened levels of radiation on and above the Earth's surface. Were this to happen today, the increase in charged particles reaching the Earth would result in increased risks for satellites, aviation, and ground-based electrical infrastructure. Geomagnetic storms, driven by the interaction of anomalously large eruptions of solar energy with our magnetic field, give us a foretaste of what we can expect with a weakened magnetic shield. \n\nIn 2003, the so-called Halloween storm caused local electricity-grid blackouts in Sweden, required the rerouting of flights to avoid communication blackout and radiation risk, and disrupted satellites and communication systems. But this storm was minor in comparison with other storms of the recent past, such as the 1859 Carrington event, which caused aurorae as far south as the Caribbean. \n\nThe impact of a major storm on today's electronic infrastructure is not fully known.

RELATED:  Pre-Season Excitement For The Orioles At FanFest 2017   \u201cOh goodness, we\u2019ve been to FanFest for 15 years at least,\u201d says Orioles fan Frank lhotsky.   \u201cIn our family, we say there are only two seasons: baseball and winter,\u201d he says.   Generations of excited fans came with a line the lead up to the Baltimore Convention Center for Orioles FanFest, where a fan could get a chance to see a little of everything \u2014 and lots of it in orange and black.   Including, a suit worn by diehard O\u2019s fan Ryan King.    \u201cA lot of orange, I love to see that,\u201d says King.   He\u2019s wearing a bright orange suit, complete with orange top hat.   \u201cOnly a few occasions I bring it out, it\u2019s for formal wear: FanFest, opening day, and god willing, post-season,\u201d he says.   While as eye-catching as it is, the day was not about decked-out fans, but the Orioles players too. And everywhere you looked you saw fans getting a chance to meet the players they to root for all season.   Those same fans also got to see some of the faces they see every day on WJZ .  As part of our continuing community commitment, many of WJZ\u2019s on-air staff, like Rick Ritter, Bob Turk, Devin Bartolotta and Tim Williams took pictures with O\u2019s fans.   FanFest is a day that many wait for all year.   \u201cAnd get a lot of free stuff too, which is good.\u201d says Ihotsky.   Orioles FanFest has been around since 1988. Since 2011, there has been an autograph policy, where the money collected goes towards OriolesREACH , which has raised $700,000 dollars for the foundation\u2019s charities.

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 22 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Hillsborough","zipCode":"03101","state":"New Hampshire","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Manchester","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WMUR New Hampshire","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169730058","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3030"},"name":"WMUR New Hampshire","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wmur.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199197368","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:49:35Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

That's something you've got to get through, the first 10-15 overs are crucial. With the line-up that we play, if we can have wickets in the shed at the back end then we will score a lot of runs at the end of the (innings).\" \n \nThe keeper found out the perils of taking on Eden Park's small boundaries when he played at the ground for the first time last February, caught at cow corner trying to heave Corey Anderson over the ropes. \n \nThe Australians were all out for 148 on that occasion, with the Black Caps' seamers running riot on the way to a 2-1 series win. It was a similar story a year earlier, with the Aussies skittled for 151 in a World Cup clash that the Kiwis only won by a wicket. \n \nAt the same time, Eden Park's unusual dimensions have resulted in big scores before. Although the tourists failed to pass 150 last time around, New Zealand posted a score of 8-307 in the same game. \n \nIndeed, before Australia's innings that day, seven of the last eight innings at the ground had gone past 280 runs. \n \n\"(The Eden Park pitch) just has a bit in it,\" New Zealand veteran Ross Taylor said. \"I don't think there is a par score, some wickets here are 300, some are 200. \n \n\"You just have to analyse it as quickly as possible, whether you're batting or bowling.\" \n \nThe Kiwis were trounced 3-0 in Australia when the sides met in December, but Wade is expecting a tougher time on New Zealand's turf. \n \n\"We played them in Australia (on) big grounds (with) long boundaries. It's a completely different ball game,\" he said. \n \n\"(On) the smaller grounds (in New Zealand) they'll still play aggressive; they're still going to be able to hit plenty of fours and sixes at grounds that they play at. \n \n\"They play well here (in NZ) and they play this venue very well. \n \n\"We like to think we're hard to beat in Australia and it's the same when we come here - we expect a hard challenge over the next three games but we've got a young squad and we're excited to go out and really have a crack at it.\" \n \nCaptaining the side for the first time, Wade maintains his job is simply to continue the fine work of the leadership duo of Steve Smith and vice-captain David Warner. \n \n\"I don't think for me personally it's about putting a stamp on the team,\" he said. \"It's about driving the values and the game plan that we have in one-day cricket moving forward. \n \n\"Steven and David have put their stamp on the team, it's just about me keeping on driving those key messages through to the players. \n \n\"We've performed really well in one-day cricket over a long period of time so it's not about trying to change too much - it's about keeping the ball rolling.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"New Zealand news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Aussies wary of Black Caps on home turf","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"AU","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Dalby Herald","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"606907339","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Dalby Herald","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Industrials","AutomobilesComponents"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.dalbyherald.com.au"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199197567","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:49:31Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

While Absa has denied wrongdoing and said it is working with the Public Protector\u2019s office\u201a recommendations in the report suggest the bank could have to pay back some R2.24-billion.\n\nFirst the ANC Youth League demanded the bank pay back the money on Thursday\u201a and on Saturday the Black First Land First movement followed suit.\n\nNational leader Andile Mngxitama said on Saturday that the pickets \u2014 which were deliberately kept at less than 15 people because that meant organisers did not need police permission for their protests \u2014 took place at 50 branches.\n\n\u201cWe managed to shut down five branches \u2014 two in Polokwane\u201a one in Tshwane\u201a and two in Johannesburg.

There were one or two areas where police had to intervene\u201a but there was nothing serious\u201a\u201d said Zibi.\n\nYouth League members said they were also going to inundate the bank\u2019s call centre asking when the money would be paid back. But Zibi said these calls were equally non-disruptive.\n\n\u201cOn Thursday we got about 107 calls out of about 2 600 that day. On Friday\u201a we had 11. For today [Saturday] we haven\u2019t had a single report. Maybe they\u2019ll do it later\u201a\u201d he said.\n\nMngxitama said the movement would not stop calling on Absa to repay the cash.\n\n\u201cThe best course of action from our point of view is that Absa pays back the money without further delay.

Mabbott. Ginny grew up in various locations scattered from Spokane, Washington to Middleton, Idaho just west of Boise. Those years included living in a rural two room school house located southeast of Jordan Valley, Oregon in the middle of the Idaho portion of Jordan Valley. Virginia\u2019s mom, Loree Mabbott, was the school teacher. Ginny, her two brothers,and the handful of ranch children in the valley tallied just enough children for the State of Idaho to keep the school open in the middle of nowhere.\n\nVirginia, who completed her life\u2019s work on earth Dec. 29, 2016, was preceded in death by her parents, her husband of nearly 60 years, of Corvallis, and a son Bernard (Bernie) J. Smyth. She is survived by her brothers Edward (Ike) (Joy) Mabbott of Boise, Idaho and Dave (Mae) Mabbott of Victor; daughter Connie (Eric) Gunnarson of Ellensburg, Washington; son E. Robin (Janet) Smyth of Gladstone, Oregon, and Deborah aka Debbie (Dave) Kenny, Palmer, Alaska. Grandma Ginny created a lifetime of memories with her grandchildren and they each have their own special memories of grandma. She will be missed dearly by grandchildren Heather (Kevin ) Jones, Covington, Washington; Nathan E (Christina) Smyth, Molalla, Oregon; Heather J (Charlie) Irving, Redmond, Oregon; Ian (Wendy) Kenny, Fairbanks, Alaska; Tristan Kenny, Palmer, Alaska; Tait (Laura) Kenny, Palmer, Alaska; and Heather Kronebusch, Placentia, California. Great Grandma Ginny (GG or GiGi) felt so blessed being able to enjoy her great grandchildren - Ashley (Scott) McFadden and Hailey Jones; Kelsey, Jacob (Andrea), and Emmett Smyth; Garret and Liam Irving; Caleb and Amanda Kenny; Darius and Asher Kenny. To top off her legacy Ginny was fortunate to be a great great grandmother to Hadley Smyth and Madilynn McFadden. Virginia was able to invest many values, lots of love and hundreds of hours of prayer for those previously mentioned children, grandchildren, nieces, nephews, and \u2018adopted\u2019 young people whose lives she helped mold.\n\nVirginia became a registered nurse after taking her training in Sheridan, Wyoming and Billings, completing her rotations at St Patrick\u2019s hospital in Missoula. She worked at Marcus Daily Memorial Hospital in Hamilton periodically during her younger adult years. Robert (Bob) Smyth met Ginny when he and other Montana State College students visited Billings for short weekend. Bob always had a twinkle in his eyes when he would tell other how quickly he decided Virginia was the girl for him. They were married May 20, 1949 and resided in either the dairy farm house 3-1/2 miles north of Corvallis or in the house they built on a rock bar in the middle of the farm ground just south of town. Virginia\u2019s roles included being a loving wife and mother, a full time farm wife, extended family member and an active member of the Corvallis community. She provided bookkeeping services for Smyth Farms, the Corvallis Garage, Farmers Exchange of Stevensville, Corvallis Community Church and the Corvallis Sewer District. Ginny was an engaged mother who supported her children in school and church activities. She lead Pioneer Clubs, taught Sunday School, directed the children\u2019s choir for many years at Corvallis Community Church, helped with 4-H and many other activities too numerous to mention. In the later years she and Bob were very active in the local and state Gideons Ministry to help provide Bibles to students, military personnel and hotels around the world. Virginia\u2019s family knows there were many events others will remember her by and are desirous of your sharing those memories as we remember Mom\u2019s life transformed by the indwelling Spirit of her Lord.\n\nVirginia\u2019s greatest joy was knowing she had obtained peace with God through the saving power of Jesus Christ. Through her support of missionaries, her joy was expanded being assured many others would hear this life changing message of restoration to fellowship with her Lord.\n\nA memorial service will held at 2 p.m., Feb. 1, at the Corvallis Community Church, 310Second St., Corvallis, MT 59828. Refreshments will follow the service.\n\nMemorial gifts may be directed to the Missions Program at Corvallis Community Church, P.O.

But at least on paper he figured to be in deeper waters against Zlaticanin, who, like Garcia, came in undefeated. \n \nBut this was a blowout. After dominating the first two rounds but not hurting Zlaticanin, Garcia knocked Zlaticanin cold in the third round. The final punch in the flurry was a vicious right hand that sent Zlaticanin crashing to the canvas. It followed a brutal right uppercut that really hurt Zlaticanin. Time was 2:21. \n \nGarcia (36-0, 30), who grew up in Oxnard and trains in Riverside, has now won world titles in three weight classes. He previously won championships at featherweight and super featherweight. \n \n\u201cI think it was a great performance,\u201d said Garcia, 29. \u201cI fought smart, I controlled the distance.\u201d \n \nGarcia described what took place after he landed the uppercut that wobbled Zlaticanin. \n \n\u201cWhen he turned back to look at me, I knew he was hurt and I came with the overhand right,\u201d Garcia said. \n \nZlaticanin (18-1) came in as Montenegro\u2019s only world champion in history. He was on the canvas for several minutes before being helped to his feet. \n \nThe bout was contested underneath the featherweight title fight between Leo Santa Cruz and champion Carl Frampton at MGM Grand. \n \nGarcia\u2019s brother and trainer, Robert Garcia, believes his brother will fight for another five years. He said it will take that kind of time for him to realize all of his goals. \n \n\u201cHe wants to get 135, 140 and 147,\u201d Robert Garcia said in the days leading to Saturday\u2019s fight. He was referring to titles in the lightweight, junior welterweight and welterweight divisions. If it comes to fruition, that would be championships in five weight classes. \n \nAlso, Jerry Perez of Harbor City made his pro debut a successful one when he stopped Javier Cepeda (0-4) of Roswell, N.M., at 2:54 of the first round of their featherweight bout that was scheduled for four rounds. \n \nLedaun Barthelemy Cuba is now 12-0 after he won a six-round unanimous decision over Jesus Aguinaga (5-5-1) of Phoenix in the junior lightweight division. Barthelemy won by scores of 58-56, 59-55 and 59-55. \n \nAntonio Santa Cruz (5-2), a cousin to Leo Santa Cruz, won a four-round unanimous decision over Victor Torres of Modesto (2-5-1) in the bantamweight division.

There\u2019s not enough drama. It\u2019s not real NFL football. \n \nBut Incognito, a Buffalo Bills guard, is like the vast majority of the 88 players invited to this all-star gathering Sunday night. He sees the Pro Bowl more as a celebration of achievement and as a way to thank the fans. \n \nHe wouldn\u2019t change a thing. \n \n\u201cIn my mind it\u2019s as good as it should be,\u201d Incognito said. \u201cYou really can\u2019t ask guys to come out here and fly around at full speed when we\u2019ve been off for the last two or three weeks. And some guys are just coming down here after conference championship games. Maybe make it more fan interactive, get the fans involved more, do more of the skills competition.\u201d \n \nThe NFL has seemed open to ways to energize its end-of-the-year showcase that is now sandwiched between conference championship and Super Bowl weeks. A few years ago the league broke from the traditional AFC-NFC Pro Bowl matchup and allowed celebrity coaches to draft two teams. \n \nNow, in hopes of giving the game a lift, the NFL has moved the Pro Bowl from Hawaii to Orlando, where it has become more of a weeklong event, complete with a re-imagined Skill Showdown. The AFC-NFC matchup has also returned after three years of nonconference games. \n \nStill, it remains to be seen if the NFL can continue selling a game that bears little resemblance to the product it puts on the field during the season. The players come to the Pro Bowl to have fun, not get hurt and maybe win. \n \n\u201cThis Pro Bowl for me in a sense is special because you are coming here to celebrate what you\u2019ve accomplished,\u201d New York Giants receiver Odell Beckham, Jr. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of fun.\u201d \n \nSeattle Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman says the intensity would rise and more invited players would show up if the NFL gave them their weekly game salaries. Under the collective bargaining agreement, each player from the winning team will make $61,000 this week and the losing players will take home $30,000. \n \n\u201cYou pay them what you are paying them and you get this performance,\u201d Sherman said. \u201cIt\u2019s a different element. ... I guarantee you less guys would miss the Pro Bowl if you told you are going to pay them their normal salary for one more game.\u201d \n \nFormer NFL player and coach Herm Edwards says the game as played now is fine. He says the Pro Bowl is not about the game, it\u2019s about the fans and the players giving back. Thousands of fans have been out at ESPN\u2019s Wide World of Sports complex this week watching both the AFC and NFC practice. \n \n \nAfter the practices were over most of the players signed autographs and took pictures in the laid-back atmosphere. All of the practices are short and glorified walk-throughs, and the players are mostly having fun with each other and the fans. \n \n\u201cWe are all ambassadors to this great game of football and how you conduct yourself once you leave this practice field is more important than how you play the game,\u201d said Edwards, who now works as analyst. \u201cThe fans aren\u2019t going to remember the game. The fans remember if Odell Beckham, Patrick Peterson, or if Drew Brees takes a picture with them, signs an autograph.\u201d \n \nEdwards, however, understands the criticism. He even admits, as a football purist, he doesn\u2019t watch the Pro Bowl. \n \nBut he says if the game does become more fiercely contested it would come at a cost that players, teams and even fans may not want to pay. \n \n\u201cThe only way to make it better is you do this: If you want all of them to show up, make the game worth $500,000,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cThey will all show up and now they play. Here is the problem, when one of them gets hurt you have the same problem.\u201d \n \nOakland Raiders general manager Reggie McKenzie acknowledges being torn when his players are selected for the Pro Bowl. On one hand, he is excited for their recognition. On the other, he\u2019s concerned about injuries. \n \nMcKenzie would be in favor of more of skills challenge than a game where key players can be injured. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s a risk,\u201d said McKenzie, who will have four players representing the AFC on Sunday. \u201cI cringe every time I go to practice, but it\u2019s the nature of the game. It\u2019s what it is. But you do everything you can to set your safety-type precautions. What else can you do? Not play? I don\u2019t think that\u2019 right.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: American football news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: NFL news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"NFL\u2019s Pro Bowl tries to strike balance between fun and competition","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Los Angeles","zipCode":"90601","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Whittier","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Whittier Daily News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169692538","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3"},"name":"Whittier Daily News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.whittierdailynews.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199209565","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:49:41Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It was the fourth annual Sunshine Millions Cal Cup, and for the most part it was a chalky day. The first seven winners were post-time favorites. \n \nAnn Arbor Eddie, owned by two-time Derby winner J. Paul Reddam and trained by Doug O\u2019Neill, returned $7.20 as the 5-2 third choice, scoring his third victory in four starts under jockey Mario Gutierrez to improve his lifetime earnings to $238,700. He ran the 1 1/16 miles in 1:44.65. \n \nAshleyluvssugar, trained by Peter Eurton and ridden by Flavien Prat, went postward as the even-money favorite on the strength of four Grade II victories on his resume. He won for the ninth time in 20 races, raising his bankroll to $1,145,004. \n \nFor Ann Arbor Eddie, he\u2019s now won two of the races California Chrome won early in his career \u2014 the King Glorious Stakes and the Cal Cup Derby. He\u2019s no Chrome, but that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s not eligible to go on and have a fine career. \n \n\u201cHe hasn\u2019t done anything wrong,\u201d said O\u2019Neill\u2019s assistant, Leandro Mora. O\u2019Neill was in Florida to saddle Semper Fortis in the Pegasus World Cup. \n \n\u201cHe\u2019s given us three wins and a third, so we\u2019re very, very pleased.\u201d \n \nGutierrez said he was concerned at the three-eighths pole when Ann Arbor Eddie, a Square Eddie gelding, didn\u2019t seem interested in finishing. \n \n\u201cI started asking him a little bit. He didn\u2019t want to pick up the bit,\u201d he said. \u201cI was worried a little bit turning for home because I really had to ask him. He has so much more ability than that. He\u2019s still a little green.\u201d \n \nMora said he wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Reddam shoots for bigger things next time. \n \n\u201cDon\u2019t be surprised if we go against the big guys,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve done well so far, so why not keep following that philosophy?\u201d \n \nAshleyluvssugar, who received a rail-skimming ride until the stretch, when Prat swung the 6-year-old gelded son of Game Plan to the outside of pacesetting What a View, came in off a fifth-place finish in the Grade I Breeders\u2019 Cup Turf at Santa Anita and a second-place showing in the Grade II Hollywood Turf Cup at Del Mar. \n \n \nPrat said he encountered no problems during his 1 1/8-mile journey on the grass that resulted in a final clocking of 1:46.43. \n \n\u201cI had a good trip,\u201d he said. \u201cIt came really easy. Once he gets the lead, he doesn\u2019t want to open up, but he knows he has to keep at least a head in front.\u201d \n \nSaid Eurton: \u201cThat was a nice, easy lead that What a View got. I didn\u2019t think we\u2019d get by him for a minute there, but Ashley\u2019s got a lot of class.\u201d \n \nEurton said the $200,000 Grade II San Luis Rey Stakes at Santa Anita on March 25 might be the next stop for Ashleyluvssugar. \n \nIn the three other Sunshine Millions Cal Cup races: \n \n\u2022 Sircat Sally transferred her terrific dirt form to the grass in the $200,000 California Cup Oaks for 3-year-old fillies, following a 12-length victory in the Soviet Problem Stakes at Los Alamitos on Dec. 17 with a 2 1/4-length win as the 4-5 favorite with Tyler Baze aboard. Winning time was 1:35.08 for the one mile on turf. \n \n\u2022 Richard\u2019s Boy, the 2-1 favorite, took the lead at the top of the stretch and then held on to beat Well Measured by a nose under Prat in the $150,000 California Cup Sprint. The 5-year-old gelded son of Idiot Proof ran the six furlongs in 1:08.71. \n \n\u2022 Enola Gray won for the fifth time in eight starts, running away to win the $150,000 Sunshine Millions Filly and Mare Turf Sprint by 3 1/4 lengths as the 3-5 choice with Baze aboard. The 4-year-old daughter of Grazen\u2019s winning time for the 6 1/2 furlongs down the hillside turf course was 1:12.1","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Ann Arbor Eddie, Ashleyluvssugar are big winners at Santa Anita","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Los Angeles","zipCode":"90601","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Whittier","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Whittier Daily News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169692538","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3"},"name":"Whittier Daily News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.whittierdailynews.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199209740","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:49:41Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

US President Donald Trump on Friday signed an executive order hardening his stance on immigrants and refugees coming into the country. The order issued a ban on the entry of immigrants from seven Muslim-majority nations and put restrictions on the entry of Syrian refugees into the US. The Republican President said that the move is issued for \u201cnational security\u201d and to \u201ckeep radical Islamic terrorists out of the US.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America. We don\u2019t want them here,\u201d Trump said after he signed the executive order.\n\nWhat does the order say?\n\nThe order puts a ban on nationals from seven Muslim-majority nations \u2013 Iraq, Iran, Syria, Somalia, Sudan, Libya and Yemen for 90 days. The ban is not on every Muslim nation and people from countries such as Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Pakistan, can still enter US. The order also affects individuals who are green-card holders and were travelling overseas. According to the officials, the applications of green-card holders will be judged on case-to-case basis. It also disallows refugee from different nations to enter the country for at least 120 days. The move also bars entry of refugees from Syria for an indefinite period of time. The order does not affect anyone with US citizenship, irrespective of whether the person is a natural-born US citizen or a naturalised citizen. President Trump, at a White House Press conference, described the order as a \u201ctravel ban\u201d and said that it is working \u201cvery nicely\u201d. He also insisted that in spite of claims, the order is not \u201canti-Muslim.\u201d\n\nTrump defends order, says it\u2019s not a Muslim ban\n\nDonald Trump defended his executive order banning citizens from seven Muslim majority countries from US and said that the it is not ban on Muslims. \u201cIt\u2019s not a Muslim ban,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s working out very nicely. You see it at the airports, you see it all over.\u201d The US President stressed that there is going to be an extreme vetting of the citizens that will be allowed to entere the country. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a very, very strict ban and we\u2019re going to have extreme vetting, which we should have had in this country for many years,\u201d Trump said.\n\nHow world leaders reacted to Trump\u2019s executive order Trump\u2019s executive order was heavily criticised by several world leaders. In a bid to give tough response to Trump\u2019s ban on Iranian citizens, the Iranian government said that it was blocking entry to US citizens in the country. The Iranian officials described the move as \u201cinsulting\u201d and said that they will retaliate against it till the restrictions in place are lifted. Iranian Foreign Ministry said the order will promote more violence and extremism in the United States.\n\nBritish PM Theresa May, who met with Trump on Friday, admitted that she does not agree with the immigration curbs implemented by the US President. May received flak from all corners, including lawmakers from her own party, after she refused to speak on the topic during her visit to Turkey and maintained that Washington was responsible for its own immigration policies. But after returning to London, May\u2019s spokesperson said, \u201cWe do not agree with this kind of approach and it is not one we will be taking. We are studying this new executive order to see what it means and what the legal effects are, and in particular what the consequences are for UK nationals.\u201d Canada Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also came out in support of refugees and said that he will allow those fleeing persecution to stay in Canada. In a series of tweets, Trudeau said \u201cTo those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada.\u201d\n\nIndonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi said on Sunday the Muslim-majority nation deeply regrets President Trump\u2019s immigration orders. French President Francois Hollande who had a telephonic conversation last week advised Trump against the isolationist policies. \u201cIn an unstable and uncertain world, turning inward would be a dead end,\u201d he said. After Trump\u2019s executive orer, France Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said, \u201cThe reception of refugees fleeing the war, fleeing oppression, is part of our duties. Trump\u2019s Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, also expressed her opinion against the order. In a tweet, Clinton wrote, \u201cI stand with the people gathered across the country tonight defending our values & our Constitution. This is not who we are.\u201d\n\nProtests outside New York airport\n\nThousands of protesters gathered outside New York City\u2019s JFK airport to protest against Trump. Several families were left anguished after their family members were detained after reaching US from nations subject to the travel ban. For hours, the crowds stood outside the airport, raising slogans against Trump\u2019s order. Hundreds of demonstrators chanted \u201cNo ban, no wall, sanctuary for all!\u201d and \u201cno hate, no fear, immigrants are welcome here!\u201d\n\nSeveral lawyers reached the country\u2019s airports and offered legal assistance to individuals and families who were detained at the airports. Similar scenes of chaos and protests were seen at other key airports in the country including Boston, Los Angeles and in Houston.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s next? What\u2019s going to happen next?\u201d asked Mohammed al Rawi, an Iraqi-born American citizen in the Los Angeles area, after his 69-year-old father, coming to visit his grandchildren in California, was abruptly detained and sent back to Iraq after 12 hours in custody. \u201cAre they going to create camps for Muslims and put us in it?\u201d Several dozen demonstrated at the airport in Portland, Oregon, briefly disrupting light rail service while hoisting signs that read \u201cPortland Coffee Is From Yemen\u201d and chanting anti-Trump slogans. Among the dozens showing support for refugees at Denver\u2019s airport were those who sang \u201crefugees are welcome here.\u201d\n\nAirlines turn away passengers\n\nConfusion, worry and outrage grew Saturday as President Donald Trump\u2019s crackdown on refugees and citizens from seven majority-Muslim countries took effect. Airlines blocked people traveling to the United States, legal challenges were underway and doubts abounded about whether the order would make America safer. The immediate fallout from Trump\u2019s order meant that an untold number of foreign-born US residents now traveling outside the US could be stuck overseas for at least 90 days, despite holding permanent residency \u201cgreen cards\u201d or other visas. And some foreign nationals who were allowed to board flights before the order was signed Friday were being detained at US airports, told they were no longer welcome.\n\nUS judge \u2018overturns\u2019 Trump\u2019s order A federal judge, Ann Donnelly, issued an emergency stay on Saturday temporarily blocking the US government from sending people with valid visas out of the country after landing at any US airport. Thousands of people cheered the ruling at Boston\u2019s Logan International Airport, one of several major US airports where protesters angry with Trump\u2019s order had gathered in protest.\n\nIndian-American woman questioned on street\n\nAravinda Pillalamarri, the inspiration for movie starring Shah Rukh Khan \u201cSwades\u201d, said that she was stopped by police during her morning stroll in her hometown and questioned about her immigration status making her feel unequal because of her colour, according to media reports. Pillalamari was stopped near her home in Bel Air in Maryland by a police officer after a neighbour had reported her as suspicious, she told local reporters. \u201cOnly when the supervisor asked \u2018are you here illegally\u2019 did my sense of colour, and of being unequal, come forth and interest in my civil rights take a back seat to get out of the situation safely,\u201d she said.\n\nHomeland Security says it will comply with judicial orders The US Department of Homeland Security said on Saturday that it would \u201ccomply with judicial orders\u201d but Trump\u2019s executive action restricting entry into the country from seven Muslim-majority nations remains in place. \u201cThese individuals went through enhanced security screenings and are being processed for entry to the United States, consistent with our immigration laws and judicial orders,\u201d the Homeland Security statement said.\n\n(With inputs from AP, Reuters and PTI)","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Donald Trump\u2019s executive order on immigration and its consequences so far, explained","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"Indian Express","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169660698","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"351"},"name":"Indian Express","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.indianexpress.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199215733","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:46:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:49:51Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://images.indianexpress.com/2017/01/trump-48020.jpg?w=480"},{"url":"http://images.indianexpress.com/2017/01/trump-48020.jpg?w=450"}],"video":[]}}

Without funds for an attorney, I accepted deferred probation. It has followed me my entire life. \n \nI graduated from college, law, and graduate school, yet I had to endure a hearing to ascertain my fitness to practice. It also caused employment rejection. \n \nLater, as assistant county attorney in El Paso, and elected district attorney in Willacy County, I routinely dismissed pot cases. Prosecutor\u2019s offices have limited budgets, yet mountains of cases. Dismissing marijuana offenses, allowed me to send more dangerous criminals to prison. \n \nEven probation for pot was wasteful. Curfews and reporting requirements should be for prowlers and burglars, not pot smokers. \n \nThis problem persists, as 620,000 Americans were arrested for pot last year. Yes, illegal marijuana creates jobs for probation officers, prosecutors, bailiffs, chemists, clerical staff and many more; however taxpayers get soaked. \n \nCalifornia and three other states legalized marijuana on Nov. 8. Voters were persuaded by the Colorado experience, where $2.4 billion in revenues and 17,000 jobs were created in legalization\u2019s first year. Some of this boom comes from visiting Texans. \n \nThe Denver Post polled, \u201cWould you repeal legalization?\u201d The answer; \u201cNo\u201d, by a 51 percent to 36 percent margin. Gallup\u2019s 2016 poll showed support for legalization has grown to 60 percent nationally, and recent studies demonstrate no increased use among youngsters since legalization. Colorado is booming, and other states want what they\u2019re smoking. \n \nThe old \u201cReefer Madness\u201d arguments against marijuana have been dispelled. Today\u2019s legalization opponents such as Insys Therapeutics, which develops synthetic painkillers, poured $500,000 into the \u201cNo\u201d vote in Arizona. It\u2019s these legal painkillers which cause so much addiction and harm. \n \nPrescription drugs increase our health costs and Big Pharma doesn\u2019t want competition. The Catholic Church was also a huge contributor, with the Boston Archdiocese donating $850,000 to oppose Massachusetts\u2019 marijuana initiative. \n \nOne lingering anti-pot argument is that people will ingest and drive. This happens anyway and it will be illegal everywhere. \n \nNot satisfied, opponents wonder how they will test for marijuana. Field tests still work, but how about we just arm each officer with a chocolate bar, and they could cuff the stoned drivers as they grab for it. \n \nLegalization will come eventually, as it\u2019s only the oldest age groups who are opposed. \n \nAn estimated 15 million Americans use marijuana regularly, and about half our population has admitted trying marijuana. \n \nMarijuana decriminalization bills for the 2017 Texas Legislature, have been filed, including one by El Paso\u2019s own Joe Moody. \n \nRepublicans are increasingly in favor, because of the fiscal benefits and individual freedom arguments. Democrats are already there, and almost everyone wants to decrease the power of the violent drug cartels who smuggle pot across our border. \n \nLet\u2019s legalize it, and have Mexico put up the wall to keep Texans from trafficking marijuana into their country. \n \nEl Paso attorney Steve Fischer has been a professor of criminology and a Texas State Bar director.

A look at what is happening: \u2014 NEW YORK Cries of \u201cLet them in!\u201d rose up from a crowd of more than 2,000 people protesting at John F. Kennedy Airport, where 12 refugees were detained Saturday. Celebrities including \u201cSex and the City\u201d actress Cynthia Nixon joined the demonstration. \u201cWhat Donald Trump did in the last 24 hours is disgusting, disgraceful and completely un-American and I\u2019m here in protest,\u201d said protester Pamela French. The agency that runs the airport tried to restore order by shutting down the train that runs to airport terminals. Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, reversed that decision, saying people had a right to protest. \u201cThe people of New York will have their voices heard,\u201d he said in a statement. \u2014 NEWARK, NEW JERSEY More than 120 people clutching signs denouncing the Trump immigration orders gathered at Newark Liberty International Airport. NorthJersey.com reports that they joined lawyers who\u2019d rushed to the airport to defend the rights of refugees and immigrants who were being detained and denied entry. \u2014 FAIRFAX, VIRGINIA Dozens of protesters inside Washington Dulles International Airport chanted \u201cLove, Not Hate, Makes America Great\u201d and \u201cSay It Loud, Say it Clear, Muslims Are Welcome Here,\u201d as travelers walked through a terminal to a baggage claim area to collect luggage and greet their loved ones. There was a heavy police presence during the peaceful protest. Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe said during a press conference at Dulles that he has asked Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring to look into \u201call legal remedies\u201d available to help individuals who may be detained in Virginia. \u2014 DENVER Dozens of people converged on Denver International to show their support for refugees. Standing in the main terminal Saturday, they sang \u201cRefugees are welcome here.\u201d Some held signs declaring their identity, such as Jew or Christian, and the phrase \u201cI come in peace.\u201d Denver has some direct international flights but it wasn\u2019t clear whether anyone has been detained under the president\u2019s executive order. \u2014 CHICAGO A crowd of demonstrators held a rally at O\u2019Hare International Airport. The Chicago Sun-Times reports protesters blocked vehicle traffic to O\u2019Hare\u2019s international terminal for a time. The newspaper says some arriving travelers joined the protest, while others were upset by the demonstrations. Lawyers working with the International Refugee Assistance Project tell the Chicago Tribune that 17 people who had been detained at O\u2019Hare all released by late Saturday. Among those released before the federal judge\u2019s order was Hessan Noorian, a suburban Park Ridge resident returning with his family from Iran, the Tribune reported. Noorian, who is of British and Iranian citizenship and has a green card, was detained at O\u2019Hare after he and his wife, Zahra Amirisefat, a U.S. citizen, arrived from Tehran, the newspaper said. The couple, who told the Tribune that they work at a community college in the Chicago area, said they were questioned for five hours. After Noorian was released, his wife told the Tribune: \u201cI can\u2019t believe something like this can happen to someone with a green card.\u201d \u2014 DALLAS Protesters who gathered at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport Saturday evening voiced their displeasure with Trump\u2019s executive order. The crowd of a few dozen ballooned into hundreds of demonstrators who frequently chanted \u201cSet them free!\u201d At times, cheers erupted from the crowd as those who were detained got released. Among those still held at the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport at midnight Saturday was a 70-year-old Iranian widow, Shahin Hassanpour, whose son said she suffers from high blood pressure and had breast cancer surgery four years ago. She obtained an immigrant visa in November on her son\u2019s petition. Bahzad Honarjou, a 43-year-old network engineer, said he spoke twice to his mother by phone after her 9 a.m. arrival, but that they hadn\u2019t talked since courts stayed the executive order, meaning she should have been released. Hundreds of protesters stood in the waiting area and chanted \u201cThis is what democracy looks like.\u201d Immigration agents were not being very communicative, Honarjou said. \u201cThey were like a machine when I talked to them today,\u201d he said. His mother only speaks a few words of English and a fellow passenger was translating for her from her native Farsi as no immigration agents spoke the language, he said. Hassanpour was originally going to be deported on a Sunday flight, she informed her son the first time they spoke. \u201cShe was about to cry,\u201d he said. \u201cShe is not able to take (tolerate) a 20-hour flight back to Iran.\u201d Honarjou said he is a U.S. citizen, obtained entry in a lottery, and has been in the country for seven years. Why did he come? \u201cTo have a better life and to make more money,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, you know, for the freedom.\u201d \u2014 SEATTLE About 1,000 protesters gathered at Seattle-Tacoma Airport, sitting down in the concourse with a large American flag reading \u201cWe are America.\u201d Aayah Khalaf, a Muslim American, was sitting at home watching the protest on television when she and her friend studying from Egypt decided to join the rally. It was her second time joining a protest. The first one was the Women\u2019s March. \u201cIt\u2019s not just against Muslims. It against environmental rights and human rights overall. I think everybody has to stand up against this,\u201d said Khalaf, 29. \u2014 PORTLAND, OREGON A protest by several dozen people in and around Portland International Airport briefly disrupted light rail service at the airport. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports that the demonstrators carried signs and chanted \u201cSay it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here\u201d and \u201cNo ban no wall America is for us all.\u201d \u2014 LOS ANGELES About 300 people expressed their displeasure with the ban at Los Angeles International Airport Saturday night. Protesters entered the airport\u2019s Tom Bradley International Terminal after holding a candlelight vigil. Avriel Epps held a candle and a large photo a drowned 3-year-old Syrian boy who washed up on a Turkish beach in 2015 and became a haunting symbol of the Syrian refugee crisis. \u2014 SAN FRANCISCO Hundreds of protesters blocked the street outside at San Francisco International Airport\u2019s international terminal to express their opposition to the barring of some people from Muslim-majority nations. \u2014 SAN DIEGO As motorists honked their support, demonstrators outside San Diego International Airport chanted \u201cNo hate, no fear, everyone is welcome here.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Airline industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Political unrest news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Protests erupt at airports following Trump travel ban","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Seneca","zipCode":"44830","state":"Ohio","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Fostoria","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Fostoria Review Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169683893","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"19"},"name":"Fostoria Review Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.reviewtimes.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199219579","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:42:17Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:49:50Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 21 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Norfolk","zipCode":"02494","state":"Massachusetts","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Needham Heights","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WCVB.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"352601084","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"415"},"name":"WCVB.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Lifestyle"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wcvb.com","publisher":"Hearst Television, Inc."},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199220712","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:49:53Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Kennedy Airport, where 12 refugees were detained Saturday. Celebrities including \"Sex and the City\" actress Cynthia Nixon joined the demonstration. \"What Donald Trump did in the last 24 hours is disgusting, disgraceful and completely un-American and I'm here in protest,\" said protester Pamela French. The agency that runs the airport tried to restore order by shutting down the train that runs to airport terminals. Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, reversed that decision, saying people had a right to protest. \"The people of New York will have their voices heard,\" he said in a statement. \n \n___ \n \nNEWARK, NEW JERSEY \n \nMore than 120 people clutching signs denouncing the Trump immigration orders gathered at Newark Liberty International Airport. NorthJersey.com reports that they joined lawyers who'd rushed to the airport to defend the rights of refugees and immigrants who were being detained and denied entry. \n \n___ \n \nFAIRFAX, VIRGINIA \n \nDozens of protesters inside Washington Dulles International Airport chanted \"Love, Not Hate, Makes America Great\" and \"Say It Loud, Say it Clear, Muslims Are Welcome Here,\" as travelers walked through a terminal to a baggage claim area to collect luggage and greet their loved ones. There was a heavy police presence during the peaceful protest. Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe said during a press conference at Dulles that he has asked Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring to look into \"all legal remedies\" available to help individuals who may be detained in Virginia. \n \n___ \n \nDENVER \n \nDozens of people converged on Denver International to show their support for refugees. Standing in the main terminal Saturday, they sang \"Refugees are welcome here.\" Some held signs declaring their identity, such as Jew or Christian, and the phrase \"I come in peace.\" Denver has some direct international flights but it wasn't clear whether anyone has been detained under the president's executive order. \n \n___ \n \nCHICAGO \n \nA crowd of demonstrators held a rally at O'Hare International Airport. The Chicago Sun-Times reports protesters blocked vehicle traffic to O'Hare's international terminal for a time. The newspaper says some arriving travelers joined the protest, while others were upset by the demonstrations. \n \nLawyers working with the International Refugee Assistance Project tell the Chicago Tribune that 17 people who had been detained at O'Hare all released by late Saturday. \n \nAmong those released before the federal judge's order was Hessan Noorian, a suburban Park Ridge resident returning with his family from Iran, the Tribune reported. \n \nNoorian, who is of British and Iranian citizenship and has a green card, was detained at O'Hare after he and his wife, Zahra Amirisefat, a U.S. citizen, arrived from Tehran, the newspaper said. \n \nThe couple, who told the Tribune that they work at a community college in the Chicago area, said they were questioned for five hours. \n \nAfter Noorian was released, his wife told the Tribune: \"I can't believe something like this can happen to someone with a green card.\" \n \n__ \n \nDALLAS \n \nProtesters who gathered at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport Saturday evening voiced their displeasure with Trump's executive order. The crowd of a few dozen ballooned into hundreds of demonstrators who frequently chanted \"Set them free!\" At times, cheers erupted from the crowd as those who were detained got released. \n \nAmong those still held at the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport at midnight Saturday was a 70-year-old Iranian widow, Shahin Hassanpour, whose son said she suffers from high blood pressure and had breast cancer surgery four years ago. She obtained an immigrant visa in November on her son's petition. \n \nBahzad Honarjou, a 43-year-old network engineer, said he spoke twice to his mother by phone after her 9 a.m. arrival, but that they hadn't talked since courts stayed the executive order, meaning she should have been released. \n \nHundreds of protesters stood in the waiting area and chanted \"This is what democracy looks like.\" \n \nImmigration agents were not being very communicative, Honarjou said. \n \n\"They were like a machine when I talked to them today,\" he said. His mother only speaks a few words of English and a fellow passenger was translating for her from her native Farsi as no immigration agents spoke the language, he said. \n \nHassanpour was originally going to be deported on a Sunday flight, she informed her son the first time they spoke. \n \n\"She was about to cry,\" he said. \"She is not able to take (tolerate) a 20-hour flight back to Iran.\" \n \nHonarjou said he is a U.S. citizen, obtained entry in a lottery, and has been in the country for seven years. Why did he come? \n \n\"To have a better life and to make more money,\" he said. \"And, you know, for the freedom.\" \n \n___ \n \nSEATTLE \n \nAbout 1,000 protesters gathered at Seattle-Tacoma Airport, sitting down in the concourse with a large American flag reading \"We are America.\" Aayah Khalaf, a Muslim American, was sitting at home watching the protest on television when she and her friend studying from Egypt decided to join the rally. It was her second time joining a protest. The first one was the Women's March. \"It's not just against Muslims. It against environmental rights and human rights overall. I think everybody has to stand up against this,\" said Khalaf, 29. \n \n___ \n \nPORTLAND, OREGON \n \nA protest by several dozen people in and around Portland International Airport briefly disrupted light rail service at the airport.

It just made me feel great,\u201d Phillips said.  \n \n\u201cI\u2019ve always been involved with a lot of political people. Being around so many local activists at once has really inspired me to become my own person and help people out in my own unique way.\u201d \n \nPhillips wasn\u2019t the only person drawing inspiration from the passionate crowd.   \n \nEmma Frye, member of the Tennessee Transgender Political Coalition, said Phillips\u2019 fervor to organize the event was uplifting in the midst of an anxiety-laden country \n \n\u201cIt was a wonderful group of people (and) a very progressive group. It\u2019s nice to see these people from Johnson City get together, and it\u2019s exciting to see the future reflected in their ideas and desire,\u201d Frye said.  \n \nPhillips\u2019 event followed last week\u2019s  Tri-Cities Women\u2019s March in Jonesborough on the stairs of the old courthouse, which drew approximately 1,000 people.  \n \n\u201cIt was great to have two events, the one in Jonesborough last weekend and the one this weekend, because they brought out completely different crowds. They reached that much of a greater number of people,\u201d said Zoe Wells, member of the Northeast Tennessee People\u2019s Movement. \n \n\u201cSo it was really fantastic to have both. There is room for all sorts of people to get together and work in whatever ways they fit with.\u201d  \n \nWhile she did admit that organizing a hundred-plus person protest was a big undertaking for a teenager, Phillips received assistance from Wells and other grassroots organizers.  \n \n\u201cThis was brand new to them. The Northeast Tennessee People\u2019s Movement provided mostly moral support and answered questions, but we really wanted them to have their event,\u201d Wells added. \n \nBeth Sluder, spokesperson for LGBTQ support group PiFlag, was one of a handful of speakers invited to address the crowd via a megaphone before the march around Founders Park and downtown Johnson City.  \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s fantastic to see the younger generation (out here). They\u2019re our hope and who is going to be carrying the torch forward. I\u2019m glad they\u2019re here and picking up the mantle already,\u201d Sluder said.  \n \nAlthough demonstrators and speakers advocated varying topics, the one constant was opposition to President Donald Trump\u2019s newly minted administration. \n \nDozens of signs were directly responding to Trump and the controversy surrounding his first week in office. \n \nSeveral directly opposed Trump\u2019s recent executive order temporarily barring citizens and refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries so his administration could reform its vetting procedures.  \n \nLauren Annarino held a sign stating \u201cEnough is enough. Love trumps hate. #Resistance.\u201d  \n \n\u201cNow, we\u2019re fighting for our brothers and sisters that have a darker skin color (and) different religions,\u201d Annarino said. \u201cWe came to this country in the first place to have freedom of religion.\u201d \n \nPhillips said she received criticism from people at her school and around the community in response to her coordinating the rally.  \n \n\u201cI got a lot of backlash online from a lot of people in the community, but I pushed through it and here I am,\u201d Phillips said.  \n \n\u201cI felt really empowered and it was really great to see all the people I got out here just from one event page on Facebook. I hope people continue making events like this, continue following what I\u2019m doing and continue fighting for what they believe in.\u201d  \n \nSluder added, \u201cThis is not the last march you\u2019ll see, not even close, and we\u2019ll get louder and louder.\u201d  \n \nEmail Zach Vance at zvance@johnsoncitypress.com.

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 22 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Jefferson","zipCode":"40202","state":"Kentucky","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Louisville","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Louisville Channel","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169708435","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"540"},"name":"Louisville Channel","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Sports"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wlky.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199228820","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:49:57Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The Ohrid region is one of them. \n \nOn the lake's Macedonian shores, the city of Ohrid is one of Europe's oldest human settlements with a wealth of Byzantine-style icons, frescoes and churches, which together with the lake's natural beauty drew more than 200,000 tourists last year. \n \n\"It's amazing. The beautiful thing is it's so close to nature,\" said visiting Polish student Aleksandra Walerych by the 13th-century Church of St John at Kaneo, which overlooks the lake and is thought to be the most photographed spot in the country. \n \nThe lake covers an area of 358 square kilometres (143 square miles), two-thirds of which lie in Macedonia and are covered by the World Heritage status and work is under way to try to extend this to the third lying in Albanian territory too. \n \nBut at its annual meeting in Istanbul in July last year, the UNESCO World Heritage Committee said it \"notes with concern that a number of large-scale infrastructure projects have been proposed\" on the Macedonian side. \n \nIt warned that Ohrid could find itself on the \"List of World Heritage in Danger\" if threats to the site were confirmed, suggesting alternative routes and locations should be identified for major projects. \n \nSites can lose their heritage status if they are deemed to be improperly protected. \n \nAlexandra Fiebig, project officer for Europe and North America at UNESCO's World Heritage Centre, told AFP there had been \"a lot of close contact with the (Macedonian) authorities\" and a UNESCO \"reactive monitoring mission\" was due to start work in Ohrid soon. \n \n- 'Political agendas' - \n \nOf the raft of controversial proposals, expected to involve both private and public investment, some fall under the remit of central government ministries while others are part of municipal plans. \n \nThe European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, a potential investor in the expressway, says it is \"assessing the feasibility\" of the project. \n \nMacedonia's conservative VMRO-DPMNE party, in power nationally since 2006, has been accused by critics of authoritarianism and corruption but narrowly won a general election in December. \n \nOhrid's mayor Nikola Bakraceski, from VMRO-DPMNE, insists environmental regulations have been followed and the public sufficiently consulted in city planning. He accuses activists of having \"political agendas\" and lacking expertise. \n  \nHe told AFP that one of his priorities is finding resources for a 54-million-euro ($57.6-million) upgrade of the Ohrid area's antiquated and damaged waste collection system, in order to protect the lake. \n \nOn a national level, the government has prepared an \"action plan\" to implement the requests of the Istanbul meeting, said Lidija Topuzovska, the top Macedonian official for UNESCO matters, without giving specific details. \n \n\"The general intentions are that all standards for preserving the cultural and natural values of the Ohrid region are respected,\" she said. \n \nBut campaigners are not reassured. \n \nAnother citizens' group, Ohrid SOS, is campaigning to protect Studenchishte Marsh, the last remaining wetland by the lake. \n \nOne of its members, Macedonian scientist Nadezda Apostolova, has written in depth about the importance of the marsh -- both for its own biodiversity and its role in cleaning pollution flowing into the lake. \n \nA professor at Spain's University of Valencia, she says the wetland is already under \"severe attack\" from construction as trees are gradually replaced by concrete. \n \nActivists say they are not against all types of development, but want to see transparent plans that protect the \"jewel\" of the landlocked nation and keep it attractive to visitors. \n \n\"Everything is at risk with these developments,\" Apostolova said.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Macedonia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Balkans news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Europe news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Macedonians send out SOS from Europe's oldest lake","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Yahoo!

The South won 16-15. Mandatory Credit: Glenn Andrews-USA TODAY Sports \n   \nThe Washington Redskins need to add some help in the 2017 NFL Draft. Here is a look at five offensive players from the Senior Bowl that could end up on their team come draft day. \n \nThe Senior Bowl is always a time where players are able to come out and shine. In what is essentially a college football All-Star game, graduating players from all over the country get together to play one big game. The best prospects play the best prospects in a game that is unparalleled by other professional sports leagues. \n  \nWant your voice heard? Join the Riggo\u2019s Rag team! \n  \nEvery year, there are standout players at the Senior Bowl. These guys often become risers who make a big impact in the NFL or turn into solid role players. There is never a shortage of talent in this game, and NFL teams watch closely as a result. \n \nThe Washington Redskins are most definitely one of the teams that was watching in this past week. They have showed some interest in some of the prospects, and here is a look at five offensive difference makers that they could target in the 2017 NFL Draft. \n Next:  5. OL Forrest Lamp    \nDec 3, 2016; Bowling Green, KY, USA; Western Kentucky Hilltoppers offensive lineman Forrest Lamp (76) celebrates his teams victory following the CUSA championship game against the Louisiana Tech Bulldogs at Houchens Industries-L.T. Smith Stadium. Western Kentucky won 58-44. Mandatory Credit: Jim Brown-USA TODAY Sports \n   \n5. OL Forrest Lamp \n \nThough Forrest Lamp was unable to play during the actual Senior Bowl, the Western Kentucky product proved that he belongs in the NFL. Throughout practice, Lamp was arguably the best offensive lineman on the field. Lamp showed the ability to play both the tackle and guard positions, though he may be best suited for the latter position for the pros. \n \nThe Redskins would not complain if they could add a talent like Lamp. They have a need at the left guard position, as Shawn Lauvao has been a mediocre starter at best for the team. The Redskins could draft Lamp in the second round with hopes of starting him at that position and also using him as depth at the tackle position. He could offer insurance in case restricted free agent Ty Nsekhe leaves during the offseason. \n \nHad Lamp been able to play during the Senior Bowl, he may have been able to vault into the first round. This is a weak class for offensive tackles, so Lamp would have stood a chance to climb up the board. If he had not suffered a high ankle sprain, he could have been a huge riser. As it stands, he will go early in the draft and the Redskins have to have some interest in him. \n Next:  4. QB Nathan Peterman    \nDec 28, 2016; Bronx, NY, USA; Pittsburgh Panthers quarterback Nathan Peterman (4) throws the ball during 2nd half of The Pinstripe Bowl at Yankee Stadium. Northwestern defeats Pittsburgh 31-24. Mandatory Credit: William Hauser-USA TODAY Sports \n   \n4. QB Nathan Peterman \n \nKirk Cousins is technically a free agent this offseason. Though it seems unlikely he will leave the Redskins, the team still has to prepare for the fact that they may lose him in the offseason. If they look to draft a prospect to replace him, Nathan Peterman could be the guy that the like best. \n  More from Riggo's Rag   \nPeterman was one of the better quarterback at the Senior Bowl. That is not saying much, given the dearth of talent on display at the event, but Peterman still proved that he could be a solid option for a team. After spending the first couple of seasons of his career at Tennessee, Peterman played two season for Pittsburgh. He had a 47-to-15 TD-INT rate over those two years and kept his completion percentage in the low 60s during that time. \n \nPeterman has a lot of growing to do at the NFL level, and in particular he needs to improve his accuracy. He has a decent arm and should be able to be a solid weapon with the right coaching. Peterman has actually been compared to Cousins on multiple occasions. He could take some time to develop, and that would be a good fit for the Redskins. \n \nOverall, I would not expect Peterman to be in play unless Cousins departs. Still, the team should scout him heavily in case they need to take a quarterback. Peterman really fits with the team and he deserves to be thoroughly evaluated. \n Next:  3. WR Josh Reynolds    \nDec 28, 2016; Houston, TX, USA; Texas A&M Aggies wide receiver Josh Reynolds (11) reacts after scoring a touchdown during the third quarter against the Kansas State Wildcats at NRG Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Troy Taormina-USA TODAY Sports \n   \n3. WR Josh Reynolds \n \nOne of the most impactful performances during the Senior Bowl came from Josh Reynolds. The Texas A&M product was able to put forth an excellent performance. Reynolds was able to emerge as one of the top target for the game\u2019s quarterbacks, and he showed that he can offer a solid amount as a depth receiver. \n \nReynolds has a huge frame at 6-foot-4 and projects to be a great red zone weapon in the NFL. The Redskins had some major issues scoring in the red zone this past year, and Reynolds could help solve that problem. Because he does not have elite speed or route running abilities, he could be a guy that is available in round three or four. That could allow the Redskins a chance to pull the trigger on him. \n \nEssentially, Reynolds looks like a potential low end No. 2 receiver but should at least be a big time red zone weapon. The Redskins should look into him as an option and consider him strongly if the value is right. \n Next:  2. G Dan Feeney    \nDec 28, 2016; Santa Clara, CA, USA; Indiana Hoosiers wide receiver Mitchell Paige (87) is lifted up by offensive lineman Dan Feeney (67) after scoring a touchdown against the Utah Utes during the first quarter at Levi\u2019s Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Kelley L Cox-USA TODAY Sports \n   \n2. G Dan Feeney \n \nOver the weekend, I expressed a desire for Washington to move on from their starting left guard Shawn Lauvao. In a piece about his issues , I said the following of the veteran. \n  \nLauvao has played in 32 games over the course of his three years with the Redskins and has been at best a decent lineman. He has done okay in the run game at times, but he lacks the ability to pass protect. During the 2016 season, it was clear that Lauvao was the weak link on the Redskins offensive line. He was holding them back from potentially being one of the best units in the NFL. \n \nBecause of this, it seems like the Redskins may want to move on from Lauvao in the offseason. At the very least, they are definitely going to bring in some competition for the embattled guard. Solid guards are often easy to find in the middle rounds of the NFL draft, as their positional value is lesser than some other positions. \n  \nEnter Dan Feeney. Feeney was one of the best offensive linemen at the Senior Bowl, and he has the most experience as an interior guy. He will likely be a round two pick, but he could get some consideration from the Redskins if they like him enough. He would be an immediate difference maker and should offer some solid blocking ability. \n Next:  1. WR Zay Jones    \nJan 25, 2017; Mobile, AL, USA; North squad wide receiver Zay Jones of East Carolina (left) runs the ball past safety Lorenzo Jerome of Saint Francis (PA) (22) during Senior Bowl practice at Ladd-Peebles Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Glenn Andrews-USA TODAY Sports \n   \n1. WR Zay Jones \n \nNo player did more to help their stock on Saturday than Zay Jones. The under the radar East Carolina wide receiver was able to put together a terrific performance and should be considered a Day 2 option for the NFL draft. \n \nDuring the game, Jones was essentially a one man offense. He caught nearly every pass that went his way, and had some poor luck on a couple of potential touchdown catches. On the first, he barely missed getting his second foot down before his knee hit going out of bounds. The second touchdown was wiped out by a holding penalty. Jones eventually reached the end zone, but he really had a lot more impact on the game than his stats say. \n \nIn the NFL, Jones does not necessarily have the speed to be a No. 1 receiver, but he could develop into a solid possession guy. He has a good frame at 6-foot-1, 197 pounds and could really be a strong option for a good passing attack. Also, Jones has an excellent track record of production, and he caught a whopping 158 passes during the 2016 college season. He may have the best hands of anyone in the draft and that will be a huge plus for him. \n \nEssentially, if the Redskins want to replace a departing wide receiver, Jones could be the guy to do it. He simply has the talent necessary to be a productive pass catcher and could end up being an option with the team\u2019s second round pick. \n Next:  Redskins \u2013 Top Defensive Tackles On Free Agent Market  \nThis article originally appeared on","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Jacob Camenker/FanSided via Riggo's Rag Fansided"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: NFL - Washington Redskins news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: American football news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: NFL news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"5 Offensive Senior Bowl Players The Washington Redskins Should Target","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"FOXSports.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659359","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"FOXSports.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["AmericanFootball","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.foxsports.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://cdn.fansided.com/wp-content/uploads/usat-images/2016/04/9844028-ncaa-football-senior-bowl.jpeg","http://www.foxsports.com/nfl/story/5-offensive-senior-bowl-players-the-washington-redskins-should-target-012917#","http://cdn.fansided.com/wp-content/uploads/usat-images/2016/04/9720341-ncaa-football-c-usa-championship-louisiana-tech-at-western-kentucky.jpeg","http://cdn.fansided.com/wp-content/uploads/usat-images/2016/04/9772318-ncaa-football-pinstripe-bowl-northwestern-vs-pittsburgh-1.jpeg","http://cdn.fansided.com/wp-content/uploads/usat-images/2016/04/9773589-ncaa-football-texas-bowl-kansas-state-vs-texas-aampampm.jpeg","http://cdn.fansided.com/wp-content/uploads/usat-images/2016/04/9772742-ncaa-football-foster-farms-bowl-indiana-vs-utah-1.jpeg","http://riggosrag.com/2017/01/28/shawn-lauvao-must-be-released/","http://cdn.fansided.com/wp-content/uploads/usat-images/2016/04/9837203-ncaa-football-senior-bowl-north-practice.jpeg","http://riggosrag.com/2017/01/28/washington-redskins-top-free-agent-run-stopping-defensive-tackles/"],"sequenceId":"695199235830","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:49:59Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The Ronald Reagan administration of 1981-1989 which lead into the tail end of the Cold War saw a number of raunchy escapist comedies like  Porky\u2019s  and National Lampoon\u2019s  Vacation,  as well as the rise of the American action hero in Arnold Schwarzenegger\u2019s canon and, of course,  Rambo.  The Barack Obama years of 2009-2017 saw a number of tentpoles with multicultural casts, i.e. The Hunger Games, Furious 7, Star Wars: The Force Awakens  and  Star Wars: Rogue One.  \n \nSo in these divided political times of President Donald Trump where there are a number of inflammatory policies and rhetoric, what type of movies will Hollywood make? \n \nShutterstock \n \nSaid Deadpool   producer Simon Kinberg who is nominated in the theatrical motion picture feature category for his R-rated iconoclastic superhero movie, \u201cMy gut would say that there will be more escapist entertainment because they\u2019ll be enough rise up drama on CNN.\u201d \n \nThe writer/producer pointed to hopeful political dramas, referencing NBC\u2019s  The West Wing  which ran during the bulk of George W. Bush\u2019s presidency. \n \n\u201cIt was like the president you wish you had as opposed to the president you have. They\u2019ll be some of that whether it\u2019s an escapist comedy, adventure, action, or superhero movie. In some way, the movies will have to be more outrageous because the reality we\u2019re living in is the craziest it\u2019s ever been in my lifetime,\u201d said Kinberg. \n \nProducer Aaron Ryder believes that one of the reasons why his feature PGA and Oscar nominated sci-fi pic  Arrival   resonated so much with the masses (it\u2019s bound to cross $100M by Oscar night) is because it emotionally connected with people at just the right moment when society seemed to be falling apart. \n \nParamount Pictures \n \n\u201cYou have to look when Arrival  was first released. It was the week of the election. It was a moment when people wanted go out, and this provided an incredibly timely message about communication and miscommunication, and people working well together. Timing helped us in some ways. It felt like Arrival  hit the zeitgeist.\u201d \n \nLionsgate \n \nBill Mechanic who produced this year\u2019s Oscar and PGA nominee  Hacksaw Ridge   and ran Fox Filmed Entertainment from 1994-2000 as chairman and CEO had a more pragmatic take on the types of cinematic genres that get greenlit against a political climate: \u201cI never made pictures for a presidency. It\u2019s nothing I ever paid attention to. If you\u2019re playing in the currency, that currency can always change. For Me, I just don\u2019t make movies for that moment in time; you want them to last. Things can change too quickly. The job isn\u2019t to make the culture of the moment. The job is to make culture come to you.\u201d \n \nMechanic\u2019s fellow Hacksaw Ridge  producer David Permut finds hope in the words of Harry Warner during calamitous times. \n \n\u201cHarry Warner, Jack Warner\u2019s older brother said the power of the movies had to do three things: educate, enlighten and entertain. If you can do all that, that\u2019s the power of the movies, and a lot of tonight\u2019s nominated films speak to that,\u201d said Permut. \n \n\u201cI think escapism is always good, comedies are always king; you want to get away from harsh realities of our world. Somebody said to me the other day, \u2018It\u2019s a tragedy what\u2019s happened to this country politically.\u2019 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a tragedy; a tragedy is when you stop breathing. The fact that we\u2019re still here in the entertainment community because we\u2019re still breathing, so you become proactive,\u201d adds the  Hacksaw Ridge  producer. \n \nShutterstock \n \nProviding a specific example of a movie that\u2019s in the works at his studio which couldn\u2019t be more ripe during the Trump presidency, Sony Pictures Entertainment Motion Group Chairman Tom Rothman , who is also receiving the PGA Milestone award tonight, beamed, \u201cWe\u2019re making a film that\u2019s a co-production with Warner Bros. called  The Phantom Tollboth  baed on the Norton Juster book. In that book, rhyme and reason disappear and chaos takes over. All I will say is that suddenly that script feels more relevant today than it did in September.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Anthony D'Alessandro"},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: movie news","group":"Entertainment"},{"name":"Media latest","group":"Media"},{"name":"Movie business news","group":"Media"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: golf news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"What Types Of Movies Will Hollywood Make During The Trump Era?

Writing in Huffington Post in January, a disheartened Holbrook lamented, \"Kids' futures and the evaluations of their teachers will be based on their ability to guess the so-called correct answer to (poorly) made-up questions.\" \n  \n Compelling Explanations  \n  \n-- In December, James Leslie Kelly, 52, and with a 37-conviction rap sheet dating to 1985, filed a federal lawsuit in Florida claiming that his latest brush with the law was Verizon's fault and not his. Kelly was convicted of stealing the identity of another James Kelly and taking more than $300 in Verizon services. He bases his case on the Verizon sales representative's having spent \"an hour and a half\" with him -- surely enough time, he says, to have figured out that he was not the James Kelly he was pretending to be. He seeks $72 million. \n   \n-- In Hong Kong in December, Mr. Lam Chung-kan, 37, pleaded guilty to stealing a bottle of a co-worker's breast milk at work and drinking it -- but only to help with \"stress\" in his job as a computer technician. Undermining the health-improvement explanation was a photo Lam sent the woman, showing himself in an aroused state. \n  \n Ironies  \n  \nLondon's The Guardian reported in January that \"dozens\" of people have been charged or jailed recently for \"defaming\" the new Myanmar government, which has been headed (in a prime-minister-like role) since April by Aung San Suu Kyi, who was elected after her release from house detention following two decades of persecution for criticizing the longtime military regime. For her struggle for free speech, Suu Kyi was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991. Said the wife of the latest arrestee, Myo Yan Naung Thein, on trial for \"criminal defamation\" of Suu Kyi's regime, \"This is not insulting -- this is just criticizing, with facts. This is freedom of speech.\" \n  \n The Litigious Society  \n  \nHigh Finance : Sometime in 2006, a photographer on assignment roamed a Chipotle restaurant in Denver, snapping photos of customers. Leah Caldwell was one person photographed, but says she refused to sign the photographer's \"release\" -- and was surprised, nevertheless, to see a photo of herself in a Chipotle promotion in 2014 and again in 2015 (and on her table in the photo were \"alcoholic beverages\" she denied ever ordering). In January, Caldwell said the misuse of her image is Chipotle's fault for ignoring her non-\"release,\" and thus that she is entitled to all of the profits Chipotle earned between 2006 and 2015: $2.237 billion. \n  \n Precocious  \n  \nIn December, Ashlynd Howell, age 6, of Little Rock, Ark., deftly mashed her sleeping mother's thumbprint onto her phone to unlock the Amazon app and order $250 worth of Pokemon toys. Mom later noticed 13 email confirmations and asked Ashlynd if something was amiss. According to the Wall Street Journal report, Ashlynd said, \"No, Mommy, I was shopping.\" \n  \n Leading Economic Indicators  \n  \n-- The British think tank High Pay Centre reported in January that the average CEO among the U.K.'s top 100 companies (in the Financial Times Stock Exchange index) earns the equivalent of around $1,600 an hour -- meaning that a 12-hour-a-day boss will earn, by mid-day Jan. 4, as much money as the typical worker at his firm will earn the entire year. (Around the same time, the anti-poverty organization Oxfam reported, to an astonished press, that eight men -- six Americans, headed by Bill Gates -- have the same total \"net worth\" as the 3.6 billion people who comprise the poorest half of the planet.) \n   \n-- An organization that tracks \"high net worth\" investors (Spectrem Group of Lake Forest, Ill.) reported recently that, of Americans worth $25 million or more, only about two-thirds donate $10,000 or more yearly to charity. And then there is Charles Feeney, 85, of New York City, who in December made his final gift to charity ($7 million to Cornell University), completing his pledge to give away almost everything he had -- $8 billion. (He left his wife and himself $2 million to live on, in their rental apartment in San Francisco.) A January New York Times profile noted that nothing is \"named\" for Feeney, that the gifts were mostly anonymous, and that Feeney assiduously cultivated his low profile. \n   \n-- A \"disturbingly large\" (according to one report) number of smartphone apps are available devoted to calculating how much the user has \"earned\" per day and per year during restroom breaks answering nature's calls while at work. Australia's News Limited's rough calculation estimated $1,227 for someone making $55,000 a year, but results might vary since there are so many apps: Poop Salary, ToiletPay, Log-Log, Paid 2 Poo, Pricy Poop, Poop Break and perhaps others. \n  \n People Different From Us  \n  \n\"Every major event in my life has been about insects,\" Aaron Rodriques, 26, told The New York Times in December, home in New York City during a winter break from his doctoral research at Purdue University on the \"sweet tergal secretions\" of German cockroaches, and on his way to buy a supply of crickets and hornworms. (\"Hornworms,\" he said, have an \"amazing defense\" where they \"eat tobacco for the nicotine, which they exhale as a gas to scare away predators.\") \"When I'm feeling stressed out,\" Rodriques said, he might take one out to \"calm me down.\" He met his first girlfriend when she was attracted to his pet giant African millipede (as long as a human forearm), but admits that \"for the vast majority\" of time in school, \"I was alone.\" \n  \n Updates  \n  \nTwo years ago, News of the Weird updated previous entries by noting that China's Ministry of Culture had cracked down on the centuries-old tradition of festively over-the-top funerals (ceremonies to assure the family that the deceased did not die \"faceless\") -- by arresting the song-and-dance people (including strippers and pole-dancers) peddling their services to mourners. Even though that ban has been working, nostalgic Chinese can still see great funeral pole-dancing -- in Taiwan -- according to a January report on the death of Chiayi county official Tung Hsiang, featuring 50 \"scantily clad\" entertainers. (Pole-dancing, itself, is still big in China, where the national pole-dancing team recently performed its annual outdoor show, wearing shorts and halter tops, in the country's northernmost village, Beiji -- where the temperature was minus 33 Celsius.) \n  \n The Passing Parade  \n  \n(1) Woodstock, Ver., police arrested a 28-year-old man for bank robbery in January, with a key piece of evidence coming to their attention when a disapproving Vermonter noted a paper coffee cup not in its proper recycling bin. The cup held the robber's holdup note and DNA.

The union is known as a toothless lapdog, always seeking cheap publicity. \n \nBut I told myself I should give them the benefit of the doubt on Friday after reading their latest press release. \n \nWhat caught my attention was the serious allegations in the release. \n \nThe name Clifton Miheso won\u2019t ring a bell with most South Africans. \n \nMiheso is a Kenyan defender who joined Golden Arrows in July last year. But he has since left the club, albeit under mysterious circumstances. \n \nAccording to Safpu, it is alleged that he was forced to sign his termination letter with a gun held to his head. \n \n\u201cIt is with great sadness and an extreme disgrace to learn about the alleged incident that took place at the Golden Arrows offices, where it is understood that Clifton Miheso, who was employed by Golden Arrows at the time, was forced to sign a termination letter at gun point,\u201d stated the press release. \n \nThis clearly means he signed the termination letter under duress. \n \nAccording to the PSL\u2019s rules, clubs don\u2019t have to register five foreign players all season \u2013 from August to May \u2013 like before, they can now register and deregister non-South Africans during the January transfer window. \n \nMy conclusion is that Arrows wanted to free up space for a foreign player, so they had to terminate Miheso\u2019s contract. \n \nBut he obviously did not consent to this. \n \nReports in Kenya claimed that guns were used to threaten the defender and force him to sign a document he had no time to read. \n \nAccording to reports, Miheso sought refuge at a police station after two men pointed a gun at him and forced him to sign a letter. \n \nThe online free dictionary states that \u201cat gun point\u201d refers to under or as if under the threat of being shot. This means Miheso\u2019s life was in danger and he had to follow instructions or else. \n \nThreatening someone\u2019s life is a serious allegation which needs proper investigation. The authorities should have investigated this matter the minute it surfaced. \n \nThe league and Safa, who are the custodians of football in the country, should have acted a long time ago. But, as is always the case, they have been quiet. \n \nThe country already has a bad image in terms of violence and incidents like these \u2013 right or wrong \u2013 add to our bad reputation. \n \nThis alleged act of cowardice and barbarism cannot go unchallenged. \n \nIt gives credence to those who believe football is for thugs and run by thugs. How else should we interpret this incident? \n \nAlthough Arrows have denied the allegations, it is not enough, the matter should be investigated thoroughly. It is about time we rid our game of corrupt activities. \n \nWhere are the PSL and Safa when they are needed most? So many things take place under their noses and they turn a blind eye. \n \nAnd you wonder why players are scared to come out in the open when they have issues - they have nowhere to run when victimised. \n \nI must commend Miheso for standing up and exposing what he was subjected to. After all, the truth shall set you free. \n \nThere are lots of players who are dying in silence, scared to lose their only source of income. But silence is not always golden. \n \nStories of player abuse are quite common, but are never acted on. \n \nJust last night the PSL celebrated its relationship with SuperSport and how well-run the league is. But it is a blight on the league\u2019s name if it turns a blind eye to issues like this. \n \nFollow me on Twitter @TimspiritMolobi","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Timothy Molobi"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: soccer news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Tim Spirit: Clifton Miheso\u2019s allegations need investigation","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Southern Africa","countryCode":"ZA","country":"South Africa"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Sport24.co.za","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169663818","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"112"},"name":"Sport24.co.za","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Soccer","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.sport24.co.za"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199243052","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:50:05Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Believe me, that\u2019s not the California Chrome I know.\u201d \n \nThe two main contenders had been separated by just half a length in the Breeders\u2019 Cup Classic at Santa Anita in November, when the strength of Arrogate\u2019s finish carried him inexorably past his rival. This time, Arrogate cruised home almost five lengths ahead of his field to a first prize of $7m, with Smith allowing him to ease down in the final furlong. \n  \n\n California Chrome \u2013 worst run ever  \nCalifornia Chrome had seemed up against it as soon as he was drawn widest of all in stall 12, a notable disadvantage over this nine-furlong distance, which allows for a short run before the first turn. Victor Espinoza got him smartly out of the stalls and forward in time to take a reasonably handy position, though the effort must have taken a significant toll on his mount. Meanwhile, Arrogate was also rushed through the early stages to avoid being boxed in from his inside draw in stall one. \n \nAs the field raced down the back, connections of Arrogate fretted that their rival might be in a position to move alongside their colt and deny him a chance to ease off the rail and around the tiring leaders. But it soon became clear that California Chrome was struggling to hold his position, despite two hefty smacks from Espinoza\u2019s whip. \n \nSmith said: \u201cI looked, halfway down the backside, I saw Victor having to nudge on Chrome a little. I said, \u2018Maybe he ain\u2019t there today\u2019. I could catch him out of the corner of my eye and, going into the turn, I seen him nudge on him, trying to get him up there and get him going, because he had me right where he wanted me. \n \n\u201cI was blessed that I was able to tip out and he was gone after that. As a matter of fact, I say this with all respect to the other horses, but he got to gear down the last 100 yards. \n \n\u201cGetting out was the anxious part \u2026 Being able to get out, let him strech his legs, because that\u2019s what he\u2019s good at. He\u2019s got some turn of foot, he\u2019s got some stride.\u201d \n  \n\n Bob Baffert \u2013 trained the winner  \nArrogate\u2019s trainer, Bob Baffert, also paid tribute to his beaten rival, saying: \u201cI feel bad about California Chrome. He just didn\u2019t bring his race today, so that match-up never came about. But it\u2019s great to be here. I never thought I\u2019d be here in a $12m race, I won my first Grade One race here \u2026 I\u2019m a little emotional.\u201d \n \nThere was no immediate explanation for why California Chrome had fared so poorly, having been first or second in his previous 11 races, a run that began in the autumn of 2014. \u201cHe didn\u2019t look real comfortable,\u201d said his trainer, Art Sherman. \u201cHe didn\u2019t break as sharp as he usually does and then he got hung out so wide. \n \n\u201cBut then down the backside he had no excuse. He settled in but he didn\u2019t have that oomph today that he usually kicks it in at the three-eighths pole. He looked like he was listless, so I don\u2019t know why. This is the first bad race he\u2019s ever run. He\u2019s going to the breeding shed, I\u2019m just hoping his babies come back to me, three years from now. \n \n\u201cWe had a great run. I congratulate Bob Baffert. That horse is really a super-nice horse, I can\u2019t say enough about him.\u201d \n \nThe eventual runner-up was Shaman Ghost, whose owner, Frank Stronach, devised the Pegasus World Cup, with it\u2019s unique entry system, costing $1m per runner.

It\u2019s not about a difference in class because there isn\u2019t really one. The main difference is pay.\u201d \n\nThe pay-gap debate is an argument which is prominent across all sports and exists in darts where the winner of the men\u2019s championship gets £300,000 compared to the ladies' prize pool of £29,000. \n\nBolton\u2019s BDO champion, aged 46, has ambitions to dominate the ladies' game after storming to her third world title and has her sights on chasing down the 10 titles her rival Trina Gulliver has won. \n\nShe said: \u201cI\u2019m hoping to get as many as I can. The aim for me it to get as close to her as possible.\u201d \n\nAs well as being a professional darts player, Ashton is now a grandmother to one-year-old Amelia, whom she helps take care of during the week. \n\nThis new role means darts practice has to be fit in wherever possible, usually at home in the evening. \n\nLuckily for Ashton, those practice sessions have her coming up against her daughter, Danielle, who is making a name for herself in the sport. \n\nAnd they can be quite competitive. \n\nDanielle, aged 18, is following in her mother\u2019s footsteps, and the two have already played each other a number of times on the ladies' circuit. \n\nThe youngster has never beaten her mother, but Lisa feels it is only a matter of time before she does; a thought that sits comfortably with the three times champion. \n\n\u201cRight now she\u2019s 38th in the world so if she keeps going at this rate she will be beat me. \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to lose but it\u2019ll be nice to see she\u2019s progressing.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Lisa Ashton says women should be allowed to play men in the top darts competitions","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","county":"Lancashire","zipCode":"LA1","state":"England","countryCode":"GB","zipArea":"Lancaster","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Lancaster & Morecambe Citizen","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169670272","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Lancaster & Morecambe Citizen","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.thelancasterandmorecambecitizen.co.uk","publisher":"Newsquest Media Group"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199253722","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:50:11Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.thelancasterandmorecambecitizen.co.uk/resources/images/5939690/"}],"video":[]}}

Out of the nearly 50-title lineup Kotaku's Brian Ashcraft detailed in his seasonal guide , I found only four anime I can recommend. And not all of them are even available in Australia. \n \nLittle Witch Academia \n \nIt's disappointing. There's a special pleasure in breathlessly telling your friends, \"There's this new anime and it will blow your fucking mind.\" Over the last few years, I could do that with Mob Psycho , Madoka Magica , Space Dandy and a handful of others. I can't recommend this season's Hand Shakers , in which a young girl will die if she lets go of the protagonist's hand. Yes, he has to wash her. I found the \"novelty\" of Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid , where a huge dragon transforms into a big-bosomed maid, hard to watch, despite its moments of good humour (to Dragon Maid 's credit, my housemate loves it). \n \nWith lowered standards, I tried out less niche titles like Interviews with Monster Girls . It's about a biology professor whose passion is studying demi-humans. Just moments after he says he's never met any demi-humans, several happen to crop up in his school, and so on. It's watchable, but not anything to write home about, just like Saga of Tanya the Evil , about a very small girl who is also a military powerhouse. \n \nWith all that out of the way, below are the four titles I can recommend from the summer 2017 anime season. It's a deviation from our \"Five Must-Watch\" series, but those are the times we're in! \n Scum's Wish  \n[embedded content] \n \nStudio : Lerche \n \nGenre: Drama, Coming-of-Age \n \nWhere to Watch: Not yet available in Australia \n \nPlot Summary: Two high school students, boyfriend and girlfriend, explore their physical intimacy and emotional boundaries. The kicker is that they're each in love other other people. Hanabi Yasuraoka and Mugi Awaya are open about how each is a replacement for their true love, and how they project their desires onto each other for comfort and sanity. \n \nWhy You Should Watch It: It's thoughtful, but difficult. The show tackles coming-of-age themes with surprising wisdom and tenderness. At times, long kisses are hard to watch when you know Hanabi and Mugi are each imagining different lovers. \n Little Witch Academia  \n[embedded content] \n \nStudio: Trigger \n \nGenre: Magical Girl, Comedy \n \nWhere to Watch: Netflix (Not yet available in Australia) \n \nPlot Summary: A rag-tag collection of girls at the prestigious Luna Nova Magical Academy learn to fly on brooms and cast spells while using each other as comedic foils and confidants. The protagonist, Atsuko Kagari (\"Akko\") went there after being inspired by Shiny Chariot, a magical witch whom some consider to be a fraud. Akko is not herself a competent witch, but after a lot of trial-and-error, learns a few tricks that get her out of sticky situations. \n \nWhy You Should Watch It: After the franchise's wildly successful 30 and hour-long films, Trigger released this TV series on Netflix. It's a light-hearted series with some hilarious characters and top-notch animation. \n Chaos;Child  \n[embedded content] \n \nStudio: Silver Link \n \nGenre: Thriller, Sci-fi \n \nWhere to Watch : Crunchyroll \n \nPlot Summary: Takuru Miyashiro investigates a string of horrible, bloody deaths on internet chat rooms and around Tokyo, which was rebuilt after an earthquake. He's also a high schooler who runs his school newspaper club. Over time, he and his staff learn of supernatural occurrences tied to the murders and struggle to wrap their minds around the case. \n \nWhy You Should Watch: It's a well-paced, absolutely terrifying series with just the right amount of gore. \n ACCA: 13-Territory Inspection Dept.  \n[embedded content] \n \nStudio: Madhouse \n \nGenre: Political Drama \n \nWhere to Watch:  Crunchyroll \n \nPlot Summary: Jean Otus, a stoic, cigarette-smoking inspector, is the deputy commander of the ACCA Inspection Agency, which roots out corruption in other government agencies. \n \nWhy You Should Watch It: First, I love the soundtrack. Second, I appreciate that it's understated. Jean is pretty damn aloof, but it's definitely fitting for a guy who works in an inspection department. Sure, it's a little boring sometimes. And I wouldn't argue it's a \"must-watch\", per say. But ACCA is a coherent, respectable workplace drama that accomplishes what it sets out to do. \n \nThere you have it.

Saturday night's ruling came in response to a challenge filed on behalf of two Iraqi men detained Friday night at JFK International Airport and impacted up to 200 others held across the country. \n \nAn unknown number of others intending to come back to the United States are trapped in other countries, unable to board planes. \n\n \nJudge Ann Donnelly's emergency stay, issued after an emergency hearing in Brooklyn, does not allow those detained at airports and those  in transit Saturday to enter or re-enter the United States. Her ruling, however, prevents the government from returning them to their home countries. Dozens of airport arrivals remain in limbo, unable to enter the country. \n \nThe judge also ordered the federal government to turn over a list of everyone currently being detained. \n \nShe did not rule on the constitutionality of Trump's order. And the order did nothing to quell the uncertainty and chaos at U.S. entry points caused by the order, issued without notice and little or no guidance to immigration agents on how to handle those arriving. \n\n \nTrump made no exception for people already vetted and admitted into the country legally but who were out of the country when he signed the executive order. \n \nOne of the Iraqi men, who was handcuffed at JFK Airport, worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Army in Iraq for 10 years. He had been granted a special immigrant visa. He was among dozens of people stopped at airports around the United States on Saturday. At Chicago's O'Hare International Airport , as many as 18 people were reportedly detained, including children and a man with a green card returning from a family wedding in Saudi Arabia . The detentions at the nation's major airports moved thousands of people to arrive at airports in New York, Chicago, Boston, San Francisco and other cities to protest, chanting \"let them in\" and \"this is what democracy looks like.\" \n \n\"We won,\" said the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Voting Rights Project, Dale Ho, reacting to the ruling. \n \nJack Vimo, policy analyst for the National Immigration Law Center, said the lawyers for the two JFK detainees met four crucial factors: \n the executive order causes irreparable harm; they have a likelihood of success on merits; there is no harm to the government; there is a likelihood of receiving class certification. \nVimo tweeted that the ACLU informed the judge the government was putting someone on a plane back to Syria. The judge saw that as putting someone at risk of irreparable harm. \n \nThe ACLU said it will continue to file suits on behalf of anyone who is stopped. \n \nIt was not clear if the government would appeal the judge's ruling. If it does, both sides will file briefs and a hearing will likely be held within days. \n\n \nShortly after the ruling, another judge, hearing a similar case in the federal court in Virginia, struck another blow against Trump's order. \n \nJudge Leonie Brinkema ordered that the government refrain from deporting any green-card holders being detained at Dulles International Airport and allow lawyers to meet with the detainees. \n\nA third federal judge - this one in Washington - also ordered a stay. \n\nJudge Thomas Zilly granted an emergency stay forbidding the government from removing two individuals from the United States until a hearing next week. \n\nThere are also cases pending in Chicago, New York, and other cities. \n \nTrump's executive order \u2014 which exempts certain diplomats traveling to the United States but does not mention those legally residing in the country as lawful permanent residents or with student or employment visas who might be returning to the U.S. \u2014 has created a new class of detainees in the United States. \n\n \nLawyers involved in the case heard in Brooklyn put the number of those held at 100 to 200. \n \nWhile many of Trump's executive orders have been met with criticism for their message, the immigrant ban has already had real impact on real people. \n \nThe seven countries in the order are not named but officials say they include Iraq, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Iran, Yemen and Sudan. Trump's order also bans the resettlement of refugees for four months and indefinitely suspends the entry of Syrian refugees. \n\n \nPeople who had been given visas to enter the United States after putting their families at risk by helping American troops were stopped as they exited airplanes arriving in airports in New York, Philadelphia, Boston, Dallas, and other cities. \n \nThe lawyers for two Iraqis who had been granted visas to enter the United States and were detained at John F. Kennedy airport, also are seeking class certification so that they can similarly represent all individuals covered by the executive order. That includes people with approved refugee applications, holders of valid immigrant and non-immigrant visas and other individuals from the seven countries banned by the executive order but who would have otherwise been granted legal admission to the U.S. \n \nWhen signing the order, Trump said it was aimed at keeping out \"radical Islamic terrorists.\" \n \nLawyers consulted by ProPublica said the ban could apply to hundreds of thousands of people from these countries who already live in the U.S. under green cards or on temporary student or employee visas. Reuters reported that green card holders from the seven countries who are now out of the U.S. will have to be cleared on a case-by-case basis to re-enter. \n \nA State Department statement reviewed by the Wall Street Journal but not been officially released says the ban would also apply to citizens of those seven countries who hold dual nationality. A federal law enforcement official told The Associated Press that those already in the U.S. with a visa or a green card would be allowed to stay. \n \nA senior administration official pushed back on the idea that the order was a Muslim ban, listing several predominantly Muslim countries that were not affected by the ban. \n \n\"We\u2019re dealing with a relatively small universe of people,\" the official said. \"It\u2019s important to keep in mind that no person living or residing overseas has a right to entry to the U.S.\" \n \nAsked about the immigration executive order on Saturday, Trump said it was not a Muslim ban. \n \n\"It\u2019s working out very nicely,\" he said. \"You see it at the airports, you see it all over.\u201d \n \nThe administration is still working to define \"in transit\" for the purposes of the hardship exemption for refugees who have been approved to enter the United States but are currently in a third country, according to the official. \n \nThe ACLU has lawyers stationed at airports across the country. \"If you know someone entering country, tell them not to sign anything before talking to lawyer,\" the ACLU tweeted . \n \nEven after the stay was issued Saturday night, it wasn't immediately clear what would happen to refugees and immigrants detained at airports across the country. \n \nAt JFK International Airport in New York City, dozens of attorneys huddled in the Terminal 1 arrivals hall attempted to explain to anxious family members what would happen to their relatives, who were still in federal custody. \n \nJennifer Johnson, another attorney volunteering Saturday at JFK, said she and others were still being denied access to the detainees. She said that tried to deliver a printed copy of the stay to the airport's CBP headquarters, but officers wouldn't accept it \u2014 so she slipped it under the door. \n \n\"Where are our clients? Where are our friends? Where are our family members?\" she said. \"Let's talk about the people still detained.\" \n\n \nSoon after, one Syrian woman in a wheelchair was released from Terminal 8 at JFK. \n \nIn Chicago, where the international terminal was packed with protesters, both inside and out, tearful reunions took place amid cheers as some detainees were released. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, responding to the O'Hare detentions, blasted the president's actions. \n \nTrump's actions \"have tarnished America's standing as a beacon of hope for the free world,\" Emanuel saidin a statement. \"Following the stay that was granted this evening, I am calling on the federal government to immediately produce a list of the names of anyone currently being detained at O'Hare or Midway airports, and calling on those unjustly affected to immediately be released and allowed access to legal counsel.\" \n\n\nAfter the judge's ruling in Brooklyn, those detained in Chicago were released. \n \nNBC Philadelphia reported two Syrian families detained at Philadelphia Airport were sent home on a return flight. The New York Times reported that the trip of a Syrian family of six headed for a new life to Ohio had been called off. According to the Times, a young Iranian woman and her family were ordered to leave a flight that had stopped in Istanbul. \n\n \nSEE ALSO: \n \nHameed Khalid Darweesh, one of the Iraqis detained at JFK, had worked on behalf of the U.S. in Iraq for 10 years and the other, Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, was coming to join his wife and young son who live in Houston. \n\n \nDarweesh and his family were granted special immigrant visas, according to the lawsuit. Between 2003 and 2013, he worked for the U.S. military and two U.S. government projects. Because of his association with the U.S. Armed Forces, the lawsuit states he was directly targeted twice. To obtain the special immigrant visa, Darweesh had to obtain a Chief of Mission approval from the embassy, a lengthy process that determines whether the applicant provided a \"faithful and valuable service to the United States.\" \n \nAfter receiving COM approval in January 2015, he and his family were granted the visas on Jan. 25, 2017. The suit states that they immediately boarded a flight to the U.S. because of the sensitive and dangerous nature of Darweesh's situation. \n \nDarweesh was later released from detention. Photos posted to Twitter by New York representatives Jerry Nadler and Lydia Velazquez showed Darweesh standing with the two representatives past the passport control and customs section of the airport. \n \nAt a press conference outside the airport, Darweesh thanked those who supported him. \n \n\"This is the humanity, this is the soul of America,\" he said. \n \n\"I'm very happy, really I forget what all I faced, whatever happened to me.\" \n \nAsked by a reporter what he thought of America, Darweesh replied that \"America is the greatest nation, the greatest people in the world.\" \n \nDarweesh worked as an interpreter for Brandon Friedman, who posted a photo of the two from 2003. \n \nThe second man, Alshawi, had been given a Follow to Join Visa to be with his wife and young son. His wife worked as an accountant for a U.S. contractor in 2006, as did her brother, which made them a target for insurgents, according to the lawsuit. She applied for refugee status for her and her son in 2011 and the two currently live in the country as lawful permanent residents. \n \nAlshawi's wife, who identified herself as D to the New York Times , said their 7-year-old son did not know that his father was coming home. \n \n\u201cIt was a surprise for him,\u201d she told the Times. \n \nNew York representatives Nydia Velazquez and Jerry Nadler, went to the airport to help those being detained. Velazquez says she was told by CBP agents that they are waiting for direction from the Department of Homeland Security to act. A protest at JFK  Saturday targeted the detention. \n \nChants of  \"hey hey JFK, no more fascist USA,\" and \"no hate, no hear, Muslims are welcome here,\" could be heard coming from the crowd. Around 300 people were gathered across the street from Terminal 4 at JFK near the arrivals area and the number was swelling. \n \nSpeaking at the protest, Becca Heller, director of the International Refugee Assistance Project, said in addition to Alshawi there were 10 others being detained at JFK but the organization was unable to take legal action on their behalf because their names had not been released. She called on CBP to release the names. \n \nThe lawsuit filed Saturday was the first of what is expected to be several legal challenges to Trump's executive order. The Council of Islamic Relations said on Friday that it would hold a news conference on Monday announcing the filing of a federal lawsuit on behalf of more than 20 individuals challenging the order. \n\n \nJohn Santore, Marc Torrence, Simone Wilson, Alison Bauter, Jonah Meadows, and Colin Miner contributed reporting. \n \nMain Image via Nydia Velazquez \n \nPhoto Credit: Terminal 4 at JFK by lemoncat1 via Flickr/Creative Commons","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Feroze Dhanoa"},"topics":[{"name":"Airline industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US Federal Government news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"},{"name":"Lawsuits news","group":"Business"}],"title":"U.S. Judges Halt Trump's Deportations Of Dozens Held At Airports","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Hillsborough","zipCode":"33602","state":"Florida","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Tampa","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Brandon Patch","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"172158168","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Brandon Patch","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Business"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.brandon.patch.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-executive-order-could-block-legal-residents-from-returning-to-america","http://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-visa-ban-also-applies-to-citizens-with-dual-nationality-state-department-says-1485628654?mod=e2fb","https://twitter.com/ACLU/status/825443851808669696","http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/Two-Syrian-Families-Detained-at-Philadelphia-International-Airport-Told-to-Fly-Back-Family-Member-Says-412047173.html?_osource=SocialFlowTwt_PHBrand","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/28/us/refugees-detained-at-us-airports-prompting-legal-challenges-to-trumps-immigration-order.html?emc=edit_na_20170128&nl=breaking-news&nlid=72675407&ref=cta","https://www.facebook.com/events/623562661169807/","https://www.cair.com/press-center/press-releases/14062-cair-to-announce-constitutional-challenge-to-trump-s-muslim-ban-executive-order.html","https://www.flickr.com/photos/lemoncat1/"],"sequenceId":"695199262027","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:50:16Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

CLAIRSVILLE \u2014 For the last decade plus, softball has been year-round labor of love for Ron Hummel. \n \nThis spring, his focus will be squarely on St. Clairsville High School. \n \nHummel, who boasts an extensive career of working at the travel, rec and prep levels, has been named the Red Devils\u2019 head softball coach, replacing Rachel Ochsenbine, who served most of last season in an interim role. \n \n\u201dI\u2019m excited about it,\u201d Hummel, a 1979 Bishop Donahue graduate said. \n \nWhile a Bishop, baseball was Hummel\u2019s sport of choice. But with three daughters, he quickly developed a love for softball. \n \nLatashia, Brianna and Antonia Hummel all played for the Red Devils. \n \nAnd, along the way, their dad, became more and more involved in their development. That involvement took place at various levels and blossomed as the years moved along. \n \nHummel has been involved with the Roadrunners \u2014 a popular travel organization for about a decade. There, Hummel said he was able to hone his skills under the tutelage of Rick Sherman and Jim DiCarlo. \n \n\u201dThat really gave me a different outlook on the game,\u201d Hummel said. \u201d(Softball) is such a fast-paced game. \n \n\u201d(being a head coach) is something I thought I\u2019d be interested in doing if I ever had the opportunity.\u201d \n \nWhen one arose at St. Clairsville, Hummel kicked around the experience he had and came to the conclusion that the time was right to give it a go. \n \n\u201dI want to take my knowledge and give it to these girls,\u201d he said. \u201dI feel like if I don\u2019t do it I\u2019d be cheating them out of something.\u201d \n \nHummel is a firm believer many opportunities exist at the college level, and he\u2019s eager to help set his players on the path to reach that level. \n \n\u201dThe biggest thing right now is to get the girls accustomed to me; learning my technique and coaching philosophies,\u201d he said. \n \n\u201dI\u2019m looking forward to the challenge.\u201d \n \nSt. Clairsville has enjoyed much success in recent seasons and Hummel hopes to build on that. \n \nHe\u2019s started to work with the players already and is focusing his attention on the younger players. \n \n\u201dMy goal is to take the younger players and get them to where the juniors and seniors are,\u201d he said. \n \nThe Red Devils lost three starters, but return six, Hummel said, including pitchers Amaya Smith and Ari Reager. \n \n\u201dI don\u2019t think we\u2019re gonna miss a beat,\u201d he said.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"St. C. tabs Hummel as its new softball coach","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Luzerne","zipCode":"18711","state":"Pennsylvania","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Wilkes Barre","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Belmont County Times Leader","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169709392","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"13"},"name":"Belmont County Times Leader","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.timesleaderonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199262947","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:50:16Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Saturday night's ruling came in response to a challenge filed on behalf of two Iraqi men detained Friday night at JFK International Airport and impacted up to 200 others held across the country. \n \nAn unknown number of others intending to come back to the United States are trapped in other countries, unable to board planes. \n\n \nJudge Ann Donnelly's emergency stay, issued after an emergency hearing in Brooklyn, does not allow those detained at airports and those  in transit Saturday to enter or re-enter the United States. Her ruling, however, prevents the government from returning them to their home countries. Dozens of airport arrivals remain in limbo, unable to enter the country. \n \nThe judge also ordered the federal government to turn over a list of everyone currently being detained. \n \nShe did not rule on the constitutionality of Trump's order. And the order did nothing to quell the uncertainty and chaos at U.S. entry points caused by the order, issued without notice and little or no guidance to immigration agents on how to handle those arriving. \n\n \nTrump made no exception for people already vetted and admitted into the country legally but who were out of the country when he signed the executive order. \n \nOne of the Iraqi men, who was handcuffed at JFK Airport, worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Army in Iraq for 10 years. He had been granted a special immigrant visa. He was among dozens of people stopped at airports around the United States on Saturday. At Chicago's O'Hare International Airport , as many as 18 people were reportedly detained, including children and a man with a green card returning from a family wedding in Saudi Arabia . The detentions at the nation's major airports moved thousands of people to arrive at airports in New York, Chicago, Boston, San Francisco and other cities to protest, chanting \"let them in\" and \"this is what democracy looks like.\" \n \n\"We won,\" said the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Voting Rights Project, Dale Ho, reacting to the ruling. \n \nJack Vimo, policy analyst for the National Immigration Law Center, said the lawyers for the two JFK detainees met four crucial factors: \n the executive order causes irreparable harm; they have a likelihood of success on merits; there is no harm to the government; there is a likelihood of receiving class certification. \nVimo tweeted that the ACLU informed the judge the government was putting someone on a plane back to Syria. The judge saw that as putting someone at risk of irreparable harm. \n \nThe ACLU said it will continue to file suits on behalf of anyone who is stopped. \n \nIt was not clear if the government would appeal the judge's ruling. If it does, both sides will file briefs and a hearing will likely be held within days. \n\n \nShortly after the ruling, another judge, hearing a similar case in the federal court in Virginia, struck another blow against Trump's order. \n \nJudge Leonie Brinkema ordered that the government refrain from deporting any green-card holders being detained at Dulles International Airport and allow lawyers to meet with the detainees. \n\nA third federal judge - this one in Washington - also ordered a stay. \n\nJudge Thomas Zilly granted an emergency stay forbidding the government from removing two individuals from the United States until a hearing next week. \n\nThere are also cases pending in Chicago, New York, and other cities. \n \nTrump's executive order \u2014 which exempts certain diplomats traveling to the United States but does not mention those legally residing in the country as lawful permanent residents or with student or employment visas who might be returning to the U.S. \u2014 has created a new class of detainees in the United States. \n\n \nLawyers involved in the case heard in Brooklyn put the number of those held at 100 to 200. \n \nWhile many of Trump's executive orders have been met with criticism for their message, the immigrant ban has already had real impact on real people. \n \nThe seven countries in the order are not named but officials say they include Iraq, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Iran, Yemen and Sudan. Trump's order also bans the resettlement of refugees for four months and indefinitely suspends the entry of Syrian refugees. \n\n \nPeople who had been given visas to enter the United States after putting their families at risk by helping American troops were stopped as they exited airplanes arriving in airports in New York, Philadelphia, Boston, Dallas, and other cities. \n \nThe lawyers for two Iraqis who had been granted visas to enter the United States and were detained at John F. Kennedy airport, also are seeking class certification so that they can similarly represent all individuals covered by the executive order. That includes people with approved refugee applications, holders of valid immigrant and non-immigrant visas and other individuals from the seven countries banned by the executive order but who would have otherwise been granted legal admission to the U.S. \n \nWhen signing the order, Trump said it was aimed at keeping out \"radical Islamic terrorists.\" \n \nLawyers consulted by ProPublica said the ban could apply to hundreds of thousands of people from these countries who already live in the U.S. under green cards or on temporary student or employee visas. Reuters reported that green card holders from the seven countries who are now out of the U.S. will have to be cleared on a case-by-case basis to re-enter. \n \nA State Department statement reviewed by the Wall Street Journal but not been officially released says the ban would also apply to citizens of those seven countries who hold dual nationality. A federal law enforcement official told The Associated Press that those already in the U.S. with a visa or a green card would be allowed to stay. \n \nA senior administration official pushed back on the idea that the order was a Muslim ban, listing several predominantly Muslim countries that were not affected by the ban. \n \n\"We\u2019re dealing with a relatively small universe of people,\" the official said. \"It\u2019s important to keep in mind that no person living or residing overseas has a right to entry to the U.S.\" \n \nAsked about the immigration executive order on Saturday, Trump said it was not a Muslim ban. \n \n\"It\u2019s working out very nicely,\" he said. \"You see it at the airports, you see it all over.\u201d \n \nThe administration is still working to define \"in transit\" for the purposes of the hardship exemption for refugees who have been approved to enter the United States but are currently in a third country, according to the official. \n \nThe ACLU has lawyers stationed at airports across the country. \"If you know someone entering country, tell them not to sign anything before talking to lawyer,\" the ACLU tweeted . \n \nEven after the stay was issued Saturday night, it wasn't immediately clear what would happen to refugees and immigrants detained at airports across the country. \n \nAt JFK International Airport in New York City, dozens of attorneys huddled in the Terminal 1 arrivals hall attempted to explain to anxious family members what would happen to their relatives, who were still in federal custody. \n \nJennifer Johnson, another attorney volunteering Saturday at JFK, said she and others were still being denied access to the detainees. She said that tried to deliver a printed copy of the stay to the airport's CBP headquarters, but officers wouldn't accept it \u2014 so she slipped it under the door. \n \n\"Where are our clients? Where are our friends? Where are our family members?\" she said. \"Let's talk about the people still detained.\" \n\n \nSoon after, one Syrian woman in a wheelchair was released from Terminal 8 at JFK. \n \nIn Chicago, where the international terminal was packed with protesters, both inside and out, tearful reunions took place amid cheers as some detainees were released. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, responding to the O'Hare detentions, blasted the president's actions. \n \nTrump's actions \"have tarnished America's standing as a beacon of hope for the free world,\" Emanuel saidin a statement. \"Following the stay that was granted this evening, I am calling on the federal government to immediately produce a list of the names of anyone currently being detained at O'Hare or Midway airports, and calling on those unjustly affected to immediately be released and allowed access to legal counsel.\" \n\n\nAfter the judge's ruling in Brooklyn, those detained in Chicago were released. \n \nNBC Philadelphia reported two Syrian families detained at Philadelphia Airport were sent home on a return flight. The New York Times reported that the trip of a Syrian family of six headed for a new life to Ohio had been called off. According to the Times, a young Iranian woman and her family were ordered to leave a flight that had stopped in Istanbul. \n\n \nSEE ALSO: \n \nHameed Khalid Darweesh, one of the Iraqis detained at JFK, had worked on behalf of the U.S. in Iraq for 10 years and the other, Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, was coming to join his wife and young son who live in Houston. \n\n \nDarweesh and his family were granted special immigrant visas, according to the lawsuit. Between 2003 and 2013, he worked for the U.S. military and two U.S. government projects. Because of his association with the U.S. Armed Forces, the lawsuit states he was directly targeted twice. To obtain the special immigrant visa, Darweesh had to obtain a Chief of Mission approval from the embassy, a lengthy process that determines whether the applicant provided a \"faithful and valuable service to the United States.\" \n \nAfter receiving COM approval in January 2015, he and his family were granted the visas on Jan. 25, 2017. The suit states that they immediately boarded a flight to the U.S. because of the sensitive and dangerous nature of Darweesh's situation. \n \nDarweesh was later released from detention. Photos posted to Twitter by New York representatives Jerry Nadler and Lydia Velazquez showed Darweesh standing with the two representatives past the passport control and customs section of the airport. \n \nAt a press conference outside the airport, Darweesh thanked those who supported him. \n \n\"This is the humanity, this is the soul of America,\" he said. \n \n\"I'm very happy, really I forget what all I faced, whatever happened to me.\" \n \nAsked by a reporter what he thought of America, Darweesh replied that \"America is the greatest nation, the greatest people in the world.\" \n \nDarweesh worked as an interpreter for Brandon Friedman, who posted a photo of the two from 2003. \n \nThe second man, Alshawi, had been given a Follow to Join Visa to be with his wife and young son. His wife worked as an accountant for a U.S. contractor in 2006, as did her brother, which made them a target for insurgents, according to the lawsuit. She applied for refugee status for her and her son in 2011 and the two currently live in the country as lawful permanent residents. \n \nAlshawi's wife, who identified herself as D to the New York Times , said their 7-year-old son did not know that his father was coming home. \n \n\u201cIt was a surprise for him,\u201d she told the Times. \n \nNew York representatives Nydia Velazquez and Jerry Nadler, went to the airport to help those being detained. Velazquez says she was told by CBP agents that they are waiting for direction from the Department of Homeland Security to act. A protest at JFK  Saturday targeted the detention. \n \nChants of  \"hey hey JFK, no more fascist USA,\" and \"no hate, no hear, Muslims are welcome here,\" could be heard coming from the crowd. Around 300 people were gathered across the street from Terminal 4 at JFK near the arrivals area and the number was swelling. \n \nSpeaking at the protest, Becca Heller, director of the International Refugee Assistance Project, said in addition to Alshawi there were 10 others being detained at JFK but the organization was unable to take legal action on their behalf because their names had not been released. She called on CBP to release the names. \n \nThe lawsuit filed Saturday was the first of what is expected to be several legal challenges to Trump's executive order. The Council of Islamic Relations said on Friday that it would hold a news conference on Monday announcing the filing of a federal lawsuit on behalf of more than 20 individuals challenging the order. \n\n \nJohn Santore, Marc Torrence, Simone Wilson, Alison Bauter, Jonah Meadows, and Colin Miner contributed reporting. \n \nMain Image via Nydia Velazquez \n \nPhoto Credit: Terminal 4 at JFK by lemoncat1 via Flickr/Creative Commons","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Feroze Dhanoa"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"U.S. Judges Halt Trump's Deportations Of Dozens Held At Airports","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Rockingham","zipCode":"03833","state":"New Hampshire","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Exeter","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Exeter Patch","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"203038362","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Exeter Patch","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Consumer","Sports"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.exeter.patch.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-executive-order-could-block-legal-residents-from-returning-to-america","http://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-visa-ban-also-applies-to-citizens-with-dual-nationality-state-department-says-1485628654?mod=e2fb","https://twitter.com/ACLU/status/825443851808669696","http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/Two-Syrian-Families-Detained-at-Philadelphia-International-Airport-Told-to-Fly-Back-Family-Member-Says-412047173.html?_osource=SocialFlowTwt_PHBrand","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/28/us/refugees-detained-at-us-airports-prompting-legal-challenges-to-trumps-immigration-order.html?emc=edit_na_20170128&nl=breaking-news&nlid=72675407&ref=cta","https://www.facebook.com/events/623562661169807/","https://www.cair.com/press-center/press-releases/14062-cair-to-announce-constitutional-challenge-to-trump-s-muslim-ban-executive-order.html","https://www.flickr.com/photos/lemoncat1/"],"sequenceId":"695199263539","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:50:14Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Stephenson Center at Harrison Central High School. \n \n\u201cWe had girls step up and make big shots and big plays,\u201d Farrier said. \u201cWe all made mistakes, but we made plays when we needed them and came out with a victory.\u201d \n \nThe game was physical from the outset. No fewer than 62 personal fouls were called and 85 free throws were attempted. The game also featured 58 turnovers. \n \n\u201cThis was kind of like playing a mirror image of ourselves,\u201d Farrier said. \u201cWe have to learn to play without fouling.\u201d \n \nThe Big Reds, who are now 18-1 and will close out the pre-OVAC portion of the regular season Monday at Shadyside, fell behind immediately, but then led by as many as 13 early in the second half before Beaver Local got going. \n \n\u201cI never didn\u2019t believe,\u201d Farrier said. \u201cI am confident in these girls and we try to be a confident team. I believe in them and some of the girls were struggling, but we told them to just keep going and going.\u201d \n \nBeaver Local got the game to overtime by outscoring Bellaire, 27-19 in the fourth. From there, however, it was all Big Reds. And that happened despite three Big Reds\u2019 starters \u2014 Katrina Davis, Cierra Davis and De\u2019Asia Burney having been disqualified due to fouls. \n \n\u201cWe only usually play seven girls and having three on the bench, I was concerned, but I didn\u2019t quit believing,\u201d Farrier said. \n \nSophomore Maci Crozier got the Big Reds going in the extra session, connecting on two foul shots. She then stretched it to a four-point game with a short jumper. Beaver responded with a bucket, but athletic sophomore Michaela Flaherty tallied going down the lane to begin to ice the game away. \n \nCrozier led the Big Reds with 18 points, while Flaherty came off the bench to tally 17. Sophomore Natalie Stoner added 17, including a trio of big 3-pointers during regulation. \n \nThe Sisters Davis \u2014 Katrina and Cierra \u2014 finished with 12 and 11, respectively. \n \nCrozier had a big game on the glass, snagging 17 rebounds, which was a game high. Katrina Davis also had a double-double with 10 boards, while Flaherty came up a rebound shy of a double-double. \n \nKierra Taylor led the Beavers with 17. \n \nOther Buckeye 8 games contested Saturday included: \n \nBuckeye Local 40, Martins Ferry 36 \n \nIn a rematch of the 2016 Buckeye 8 girls championship game, Buckeye Local exacted some revenge and salvaged third place in the league by virtue of a 40-36 victory against Martins Ferry. \n \nThe Panthers used a furious rally in the fourth quarter in which they outscored the Riders, 17-8 in the period to post the victory. \n \nA big part of the fourth-quarter rally was talented sophomore Emily Holzapfel, who scored 21 points for the contest. \n \nMartins Ferry was led by senior Sydney Bridges, who had 10 points. Leah Coleman finished with nine. \n \nThe game doesn\u2019t count in the OVAC standings for either team because it was the third meeting between the clubs. \n \nUnion Local 50, Edison 34 \n \nUnion Local secured fifth place in the league thanks to an impressive, 50-34, victory against Edison. \n \nThe Jets used a 13-2 second-quarter and a 13-7 third quarter to blow the game open en route to the win. \n \nUnion Loc l was once again led by the Sisters Porter \u2014 Haley and Hannah. Each had 15 points. \n \nEdison was paced by Kayla Huff\u2019s 15 points. Skylar Fankhauser had 12 for the Wildcats. \n \nHarrison Central 59, Indian Creek 46 \n \nThe host Huskies picked up their ninth win and inched closer to securing an OVAC Class 4A Tournament spot by defeating Indian Creek, 59-46, in the seventh and eighth place game. \n \nHarrison Central used a 22-8 upperhand in the second quarter to blow up a lead and cruised to victory from there. \n \nSenior Morgan Carter had 19 points to lead the way, while Maddy Doty and Sydney Starr each had 13. Alex Wiley finished with 10. \n \nIndian Creek was paced by Kaitlyn Whitaker\u2019s 13 points. Kacie Vandeborne had 12. \n \nSt. Clairsville 60, East Liverpool 20 \n \nThe Red Devils raced out to an 18-4 lead after one and never looked back en route to a convincing 60-20 victory in the ninth and 10th place game. \n \nThe Red Devils produced three double-figure scorers.

Previously, a pitcher could pitch up to 10 innings in a three-day span. \n \n\u201dI do agree with the new rules \u2026 arm injuries are becoming more prevalent at every level,\u201d Martins Ferry head coach Anthony Reasbeck said. \n \nIn addition to limiting the number of pitches that can be thrown daily, the new rule contains other details such as the number of days required between pitching appearances based on the number of pitches thrown. \n \nThose stipulations are as follows: 1-30 pitches, 0 days; 31-50 pitches, 1 day; 51-75 pitches, 2 days; 76 or more pitches, 3 days. \n \n\u201dOur initial goal was to meet the requirement of the NFHS rule that now requires individual states to create their own pitch count limitations,\u201d OHSAA Assistant Commissioner Jerry Snodgrass said via a news release. \n \n\u201dAfter assembling a group representing the necessary stakeholders, including a member of our Sports Medicine Advisory Committee, we have met that goal. We continue to look for further ways in which these limitations will affect teams as well as providing adequate education for our coaches and those in non-school baseball.\u201d \n \nAs far as doubleheaders go, if a pitcher throws at least 31 pitches in a game, he may not pitch in another game that day, or the next day, as referenced to the aforementioned numbers. Also, if the daily pitch count is reached during an at-bat, a pitcher may exceed the pitch count only to finish pitching to the current batter. \n \nPitches thrown in scrimmages and previews also count. \n \n\u201dI don\u2019t have any problem with it, and I kind of like it,\u201d veteran River head coach Mark Romick said. \n \n\u201dI don\u2019t think there\u2019s too many around that abuse arms. The inherent problem, I think, is, who\u2019s going to monitor it.\u201d \n \nAccording to the OHSAA, at the end of each game, coaches must submit pitcher data to a designated data collection system. Schools are required to keep pitch count data on all pitchers and make the data available to the OHSAA upon request. \n \nA team shall forfeit any win in which a player violates the regulation, the OHSAA said. \n \n\u201dI think a kid\u2019s arm is worth more than a win,\u201d Romick said. \u201dNow, you\u2019ll see kids with Tommy John surgery coming out of high school. And that\u2019s sad.\u201d \n \nRomick said some youngsters have specialized in the sport and play it year round. He feels regulations should be placed at other levels, too. \n \nReasbeck and Romick both believe the way they coach won\u2019t change much. \n \n\u201dHonestly, I really don\u2019t see much change in my thinking,\u201d Reasbeck said. \u201dWe basically have adhered to plenty of days rest in the past. \n \n\u201dThe biggest change I see is when a team has a true ace. Tournament time will be very interesting. Usually, your best could throw seven innings then close the next game.

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 25 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Cumberland","zipCode":"04101","state":"Maine","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Portland","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WMTW","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659817","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"89"},"name":"WMTW","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wmtw.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199268360","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:50:17Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Sports Promotions, said Wednesday night via telephone from his office in Clarksburg. \u201cWe have been on-and-off and real close a couple of times, but something always happened to prevent it. \n \n\u201cHowever, this time it is official. Actually, this time it came together quite quickly,\u201d he added. \u201cThe contracts have already been signed. Everything is ready to go.\u201d \n \nThe fight is scheduled for eight, 3-minute rounds and will be for Clark\u2019s W.Va. State Heavyweight championship belt. It will be his third title defense. \n \n\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of talk and a lot of anticipation,\u201d the 37-year-old Clark (11-0) said of the fight. \u201cIt\u2019s finally going to happen, and it\u2019s a good thing.\u201d \n \nThe 43-year-old Hinkle (7-2) had the same thoughts. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s finally happening. It\u2019s been a long time coming. I\u2019m excited for the fight and I\u2019m excited for the fans,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably the most anticipated fight ever in the Ohio Valley. I think it\u2019s going to be a great fight.\u201d \n \nBoth competitors are former successful wrestlers \u2014 Clark in high school and Hinkle in college \u2014 and both have participated in Mixed Martial Arts, with Hinkle competing in the UFC (17-11) and Clark in Bellator and NAAFS (7-3). \n \nHinkle, who was a two-time NCAA Div. II wrestling champion at West Liberty and a U.S. National Freestyle Wrestling All-American, has been fighting for 20 years. After going 12-6-1, he signed with the UFC. \n \n\u201cI started out fighting bare knuckles in Brazil in 1998,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThis will be my third time fighting in Wheeling. I won an MMA title here in 2001 and I boxed here two years ago. It\u2019s (my career) has kind of come full circle.\u201d \n \nClark, meanwhile, was an Ohio Division III 160-pound state mat champ in 1998 while representing Union Local High School. He has held several MMA and boxing titles during his career. He is a former Ohio Valley Toughman champion, which jump-started his ring career. \n \n\u201cI respect Hinkle,\u201d Clark admitted. \u201cI grew up watching what he does. It\u2019s an honor to finally get to fight someone that I respect and looked up to, but with that being said, I\u2019m still going to keep my belt by knockout. \n \n\u201cI don\u2019t doubt that he\u2019s going to come hard because he\u2019s an absolute beast. Anybody that says different doesn\u2019t know anything about it,\u201d Clark stressed. \u201cThe guy is a great person for the community. A great person for the wrestling community, and an absolute good fighter and good guy.\u201d \n \nHinkle, who said he would tip the scales around 230 pounds, echoed those sentiments. \n \n\u201cI respect him. He\u2019s a tough fighter. He\u2019s a good wrestler and a helps the kids and all, but I\u2019m coming to win. I coming at him with bad intentions.\u201d \n \nClark, who most likely check in at 225-230, last fought on Oct. 19 when he posted a unanimous decision over Thad Berkhousen, of Michigan, in a non-title fight at the Wheeling Island Racetrack, Casino and Hotel Ballroom. \n \n\u201cMy last time out was one of my better fights,\u201d Clark allowed. \u201cI just want to keep building from one fight to the next. I\u2019m ready to take care of business. I\u2019ve been training harder than ever. I actually turned down a couple of fights because of this one. If if (the fight) was today, I\u2019d be ready.\u201d \n \nHinkle has lost his last two bouts. He was TKO\u2019d in 1:26 of the first round on Oct. 20, 2016, at the Mayflowers Inaugural Ballroom in Washington, D.C., by \u201cprospect\u201d Mike Balogun (9-0). Prior to that, he was knocked out in 2:15 of the fourth round by Kevin Franklin (7-11) at the Serbian American Cultural Center in Weirton on July 27, 2015. \n \nThomas said a press conference will be scheduled sometime this week to \u201cofficially\u201d announce the fight.

The class representing the decade of the 1970s will be published on Feb. 12. \n \nHere\u2019s a capsule look at the honorees: \n \nSCOT MAFFE, Bellaire (Class of 1985) \u2014 Be it football, basketball or baseball, Maffe delivered in quality fashion for the Big Reds. \n \nAlthough equally productive in all three sports, baseball was his linchpin. After his stellar Big Reds\u2019 diamond career, he matriculated to Ohio University. He played baseball three years for the Athens-based Bobcats, lettering two of those seasons. \n \nMaffe was a four-year letterwinner in baseball at Bellaire, earning a myriad of honors after establishing a host of school records. When he completed his Big Reds\u2019 career he owned the following baseball records: season at-bats (105), career singles (85), doubles in a game (3), triples in a game (2), RBI in a game (6), career runs (95), stolen bases in a game (4), season (33) and career (55); innings pitched season (76), career (202) and pitching wins season (12), career (26). \n \nHe was all was a first-team all-OVAC, all-District and all-Valley honoree in all three sports as a senior. He was also selected to play in all three OVAC All-Star games. \n \nMaffe was a two-year starter at quarterback for John Magistro in football. Magistro had high praise for his former signal-caller. \n \n\u201cScot was one of the finest all-around athletes to play at Bellaire. I had the privilege to coach him in both football and baseball, and the first thing that comes to mind in describing him, \u201c a clutch performer. \u201d If you wanted someone to have the ball in their hands when it was crunch time\u2026 Scot was your guy. You name the sport and Scot excelled in it,\u201d Magistro said. \n \nHe was special mention all-Ohio as a senior. He was also the Big Reds\u2019 grid captain that season. \n \nMaffe was a slick and savvy point guard for Coach Gene Ammirante on the hardwood. \n \nThe three-year hoop letterwinner was a second-team all-Valley honoree as a junior. He enjoyed a banner senior campaign for Coach A, earning first-team all-OVAC, all-District and all-Valley honors while also being a special mention all-Ohio honoree. \n \nScot\u2019s wife \u2014 Kim \u2014 died in 2009 after a courageous battle with leukemia. Scot has three children \u2014 Chase, Michelle and Chance. \n \nMaffe teaches at Beallsville. \n \nCHRIS JONES, John Marshall (Class of 1982) \u2014 Bob Montgomery has authored a legendary career as the longtime head baseball coach at John Marshall. In his four-plus decades at the Monarch helm, he has garnered nearly 900 wins. \n \nSo when he says Chris Jones is the \u201cbest high school player I\u2019ve coached,\u201d it has impact. The talented righthander, who also yielded a potent bat, has the stats to back up that statement. \n \nIn his three years on the Monarch mound, Jones recorded an amazing 30-3 pitching mark. Two of his setbacks were shutout defeats. He helped JM capture three successive OVAC 4A titles (1980-82) while compiling a brilliant 84-15-1 record. \n \nJones started his JM career on a high note, compiling a 9-0 pitching mark as a sophomore as Montgomery\u2019s charges won an amazing 31 of 33 starts. Jones was accorded second-team all-Valley\u2019s honors that spring. \n \nHe raised his level of play even more as a junior, dazzling both as a hurler and a hitter as JM compiled a stellar 25-4 mark. \n \nAt the plate, Jones led the valley with a smoking .500 batting average, going 46-of-92 with eight doubles, six triples, three homers, 31 RBI while scoring 26 runs. As a pitcher, he won 10 of 11 decisions, striking out 122 in 78 innings of work. He had a miniscule 1.62 ERA while walking just 31 batters. He earned first-team, all-state, all-Valley and all-OVAC plaudits that spring. \n \nJones was just as dominating as a senior, helping JM garner a 28-9-1 record. He struck out 171 batters in 97 innings of work. He was 11-2 on the mound with a 1.61 ERA. \n \nHe batted .393 with 44 hits and an Ohio Valley-leading eight home runs. He knocked in 37 runs and scored 32 more.

When the Left couldn\u2019t force an environmentalist agenda on a Republican Congress, these groups focused instead on Obama\u2019s executive branch and essentially created \u201cactivist agencies\u201d in the same way they fostered activist judges. Climate science has been the most obvious battleground, but agriculture has been just as directly affected. The American farm industry has been feeling the EPA breathing down its neck for the past eight years. It isn\u2019t just the \u201c Waters of the United States \u201d rule, a federal power grab disguised as a technical document that defines which waterways fall under the jurisdiction of the EPA. Farmers have also been left hanging for months over of the agency\u2019s recent atrazine and glyphosate reviews, which have been criticized for delays and for allowing interference by activists. \n \nThe glyphosate review is a textbook example of why an executive agency shouldn\u2019t be in the legislative business. Last September, the EPA finally announced preliminary findings on the widely-used pesticide following a years-long evaluation process. In what came as no surprise, the agency concurred with almost every other scientific body (both the U.S. and Europe) in finding that glyphosate does not pose a realistic cancer risk to humans -- a relief for thousands of farmers who had been awaiting the review panel\u2019s consensus. So why did this review take so long? Because left-wing activists, using an outlier result from the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) in France, tried to derail the review process. \n \nThe process became so chaotic that Jason Chaffetz had to launch an investigation calling for answers on why U.S. taxpayer dollars are going to IARC and whether EPA employees might have been colluding with scientists in France to undermine the review being carried out here in America. There are also demands for reforming how IARC\u2019s review process works, since this is just one of several controversies the agency has touched off over the past few years. The Obama administration didn\u2019t seem too bothered by this agency capture on the part of militant environmentalists, but there is no way subterfuge like this will be allowed to continue now that Trump is in office. Instead, the agency will take a markedly more streamlined approach to regulation; Pruitt is set to preside over a shift in power to the states. As Oklahoma attorney general, he had a firm record of support for federalism, pushing back against federal regulations that encroach on state authorities. \n \nThis is, of course, anathema to Democrats, who look down their noses at the states and insist that all rules and regulations emanate from Washington. All of this begs an important question, though: instead of endlessly complaining about Pruitt and limiting the powers of the federal government, why don\u2019t they try to learn from him? Federal agencies respecting constitutional boundaries doesn\u2019t preclude the blue states from enacting whatever onerous environmental regulations they want. In fact, Pruitt\u2019s approach offers a silver lining: without dictates from the feds, left-wing lawmakers in New York and California can implement as many regulations as they please. \n \nEven before Trump\u2019s election, many states and cities were going wild enacting far stricter laws than those required by federal thresholds. In California, people like Jerry Brown now say they plan to bypass Washington and work directly with other nations and states to protect and fortify their laws. States\u2019 attorneys are also tearing a leaf out of Pruitt\u2019s playbook, attacking what they see as federal crimes in the courtroom. California\u2019s Xavier Becerra has already promised to fight the Trump administration on issues ranging from immigration to climate change. \n \nMore power to them. Instead of undercutting popular sovereignty by working through unelected agencies, Becerra and the rest of his party can see whether their arguments and the impositions they want to put on American business can stand up to constitutional scrutiny. Elected lawmakers, and not a semi-autonomous government agency, should be making the rules. \n  \nOut of all of President Trump\u2019s cabinet nominees, Scott Pruitt  has probably received more heat from the Left and the environmentalist movement than anybody else. From the moment the former Oklahoma attorney general\u2019s name was floated, liberal doomsayers have been putting out warnings of an impending end to environmental protection laws. \n \nBased on the current tone of the mainstream media and the \u201cresistance\u201d movement, you would think the government was about to start mandating coal plants in national parks.

Farmers have also been left hanging for months over of the agency\u2019s recent atrazine and glyphosate reviews, which have been criticized for delays and for allowing interference by activists. \n \nThe glyphosate review is a textbook example of why an executive agency shouldn\u2019t be in the legislative business. Last September, the EPA finally announced preliminary findings on the widely-used pesticide following a years-long evaluation process. In what came as no surprise, the agency concurred with almost every other scientific body (both the U.S. and Europe) in finding that glyphosate does not pose a realistic cancer risk to humans -- a relief for thousands of farmers who had been awaiting the review panel\u2019s consensus. So why did this review take so long? Because left-wing activists, using an outlier result from the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) in France, tried to derail the review process. \n \nThe process became so chaotic that Jason Chaffetz had to launch an investigation calling for answers on why U.S. taxpayer dollars are going to IARC and whether EPA employees might have been colluding with scientists in France to undermine the review being carried out here in America. There are also demands for reforming how IARC\u2019s review process works, since this is just one of several controversies the agency has touched off over the past few years. The Obama administration didn\u2019t seem too bothered by this agency capture on the part of militant environmentalists, but there is no way subterfuge like this will be allowed to continue now that Trump is in office. Instead, the agency will take a markedly more streamlined approach to regulation; Pruitt is set to preside over a shift in power to the states. As Oklahoma attorney general, he had a firm record of support for federalism, pushing back against federal regulations that encroach on state authorities. \n \nThis is, of course, anathema to Democrats, who look down their noses at the states and insist that all rules and regulations emanate from Washington. All of this begs an important question, though: instead of endlessly complaining about Pruitt and limiting the powers of the federal government, why don\u2019t they try to learn from him? Federal agencies respecting constitutional boundaries doesn\u2019t preclude the blue states from enacting whatever onerous environmental regulations they want. In fact, Pruitt\u2019s approach offers a silver lining: without dictates from the feds, left-wing lawmakers in New York and California can implement as many regulations as they please. \n \nEven before Trump\u2019s election, many states and cities were going wild enacting far stricter laws than those required by federal thresholds. In California, people like Jerry Brown now say they plan to bypass Washington and work directly with other nations and states to protect and fortify their laws. States\u2019 attorneys are also tearing a leaf out of Pruitt\u2019s playbook, attacking what they see as federal crimes in the courtroom. California\u2019s Xavier Becerra has already promised to fight the Trump administration on issues ranging from immigration to climate change. \n \nMore power to them. Instead of undercutting popular sovereignty by working through unelected agencies, Becerra and the rest of his party can see whether their arguments and the impositions they want to put on American business can stand up to constitutional scrutiny. Elected lawmakers, and not a semi-autonomous government agency, should be making the rules.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"France news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Regulatory news","group":"Business"}],"title":"The Left\u2019s Misplaced Panic over the EPA","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"American Thinker","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169801596","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1400"},"name":"American Thinker","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.americanthinker.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/jan/10/donald-trump-epa-pick-scott-pruit-decried-by-envir/","http://www.wsj.com/articles/scott-pruitt-is-chief-target-of-opposition-to-trumps-environmental-policy-plan-1484604960","http://motherboard.vice.com/en_uk/read/scott-pruitt-is-an-enemy-of-environmental-protection","http://www.wsj.com/articles/scott-pruitt-donald-trumps-pick-for-epa-chief-plans-to-emphasize-disagreements-with-obama-1484735405","https://www.whitehouse.gov/america-first-energy","https://www.axios.com/axios-am-2207230091.html","http://www.politico.com/story/2015/05/epa-waterways-wetlands-rule-118319","http://www.agweb.com/article/pruitts-epa-confirmation-hearing-set-for-jan-18-naa-ben-potter/","http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-epa-glyphosate-idUSKCN11M28X","https://morningconsult.com/alert/american-chemistry-council-says-chaffetz-right-question-study-glyphosate/","http://campaignforaccuracyinpublichealthresearch.com/","https://www.bna.com/scott-pruitt-tip-n73014449932/","https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/30/opinion/cities-and-states-lead-on-climate-change.html","http://www.politico.com/states/california/story/2017/01/jerry-"],"sequenceId":"695199272769","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:50:20Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Passage of this resolution was only possible because of the deliberate refusal of the U.S. to exercise the veto power it wields as one of the five permanent members of the Security Council.  Secretary of State John Kerry insisted that in refusing to veto the resolution, the Obama administration was simply conforming to long-standing U.S. policy in favor of the \u201ctwo-state solution\u201d of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, a policy that has also included U.S. condemnation of Israeli settlement building in the West Bank. [1] In fact, however, UNSC Resolution 2334 is a departure from past precedent, both for the Security Council and for the U.S., and one that creates big problems for Israel. Moreover, the Trump administration will probably not be able to reverse this new state of affairs, since the other permanent members of the Security Council would presumably use their veto power to protect Resolution 2334. It is therefore important to understand the impact of this resolution. \n \n For the past half-century, a key point of reference in all discussion surrounding Israeli-Palestinian peace talks has been UN Security Council Resolution 242 , passed on November 22, 1967 in the wake of the June 1967 Arab-Israeli war. This resolution famously called for the \u201cwithdrawal of Israel armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict,\u201d but only in the context of a peace agreement that would guarantee the sovereignty and territorial integrity of every state in the area, including Israel. While Resolution 242 emphasizes \u201cthe inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war,\u201d the key diplomatic players at the time also stressed that Israel had no clearly defined borders that would exclude territories in the West Bank as unambiguously lying outside of its boundaries. On December 9, 1969, U.S. Secretary of State William Rogers made the point as follows: \n  \n\u201cThe boundaries from which the 1967 war began were established by the 1949 armistice agreements, and have defined the areas of national jurisdiction in the Middle East for twenty years. Those boundaries were armistice lines, not final political borders. The Security Council Resolution [242] neither endorses nor precludes the armistice lines as the definitive political boundaries.\u201d [2] \n \nU.S. Ambassador to the UN Arthur Goldberg made the same point in debate at the UN on November 15, 1967, pointing out that there had never been agreement on permanent borders between Israel and her neighbors after the 1948 war and that the 1949 armistice lines were just that \u2013 provisional lines based on purely military considerations. \u201cThese lines, he said, stood to be revised as a part of the transition to peace.\u201d [3] \n \n                 Moreover, Resolution 242 deliberately refrained from demanding Israeli withdrawal from \u201c the territories\u201d occupied in the Six-Day War, instead calling for withdrawal from \u201cterritories\u201d occupied in that war, without defining the extent of the withdrawal. Abba Eban, the Israeli Foreign Minister at the time, notes that the British government sponsored Resolution 242 and so its interpretation of the text deserves special weight. Key British diplomats went on the record as stating that the withdrawal envisaged by the resolution was not to be from \u201call the territories,\u201d but only from some. [4] More recently, Northwestern University Law School professor Eugene Kontorovich, one of the leading scholars on this topic, has demonstrated that Resolution 242 \u201ccontemplates only a partial Israeli withdrawal.\u201d [5] Kontorovich points out, for example, that over several months of deliberations in the Security Council, British and U.S. diplomats repeatedly rebuffed efforts by Arab-aligned nations to require withdrawal from \u201call\u201d or \u201cthe territories.\u201d [6] \n \n         In short, one cannot reasonably interpret UN Resolution 242 as denying Israel a right to retain and settle any of the territories it occupied in 1967. Yet this is exactly what the Obama administration and Resolution 2334 have now done. Resolution 242, as Abba Eban points out, does not even mention the \u201carmistice lines of 1949\u201d or the \u201clines of June 4, 1967,\u201d let alone describe them as sacrosanct and inviolable international boundaries. [7] In contrast, Resolution 2334 \n Presupposes \u201ca two-State solution based on the 1967 lines.\u201d  \u201c Reaffirms that the establishment by Israel of settlements in the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967, including East Jerusalem , has no legal validity and constitutes a flagrant violation under international law\u2026\u201d [emphasis added]  Demands \u201cthat Israel immediately and completely cease all settlement activities in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem \u2026\u201d [emphasis added]  Presupposes, as the two preceding bullet points show, that all the territory occupied by Israel in 1967 is (or already was) \u201cPalestinian territory.\u201d  Urges \u201can end to the Israeli occupation that began in 1967.\u201d  \nIt is highly significant that resolution 2334 begins with an explicit re-affirmation of resolution 242. In doing so, it imposes a (historically false) reinterpretation on the text of resolution 242. According to this anachronistic re-interpretation, resolution 242 is now seen as calling for Israeli withdrawal from all the territories occupied in 1967 and presupposes the sacrosanctity of the 1949 armistice lines as if they were the agree-upon international frontier between Israel and her neighbors. \n \nThe upshot is that Israel now finds itself in a dramatically weaker bargaining position in any future peace talks with the Palestinians. Consider just one point of contention, the status of the Western Wall plaza and the Jewish Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem, of inestimable cultural and religious significance to Jews everywhere and both falling to the east of the 1949 armistice line. The UN Security Council is now on record as stating that Israeli occupation of these sites \u201chas no legal validity and constitutes a flagrant violation under international law.\u201d Palestinian negotiators can now use this small patch of earth to extract much bigger concessions from Israel. Imagine a Palestinian negotiating team saying to their Israeli counterparts, \u201cOh, so you want us to give you the Western Wall. Well, how much is it worth to you?\u201d Consider also the fact that Palestinians have consistently stressed that any future land swap in a peace deal must be equal in size and quality.

Two unlikely bedfellows join forces to combat a mighty villain. But the Congress party and the Samajwadi Party have two villains\u2013the BJP and the BSP. The opponents are divided but still strong. The SP-Congress alliance may not be the strongest contenders in the upcoming Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections, but they are stronger than what they were as individual units. In Bollywood potboilers, the strange bedfellows win in the end and the villains lose. But in politics, there are no villains\u2013just winners and losers. \n \nWho would have thought a few months ago that Samajwadi Party will force its founder president Mulayam Singh Yadav, a shrewd politician, into an early retirement? But the fate had it in store for him. A family feud that he claimed to be resolving dug his political grave and sent him packing into Samajwadi Party\u2019s \u2018margadarshak mandal\u2019. His son Akhilesh Yadav, who unceremoniously dethroned the veteran politician, scampered into an alliance with the Congress party that had no presence in the state and was electorally doomed. There were growling and whimpering in the Samajwadi party ranks but Akhilesh anyway went ahead with the move\u2013his first enormous political gamble that he played without interference by his small council that he exiled as he assumed power in the party. Akhilesh Yadav finally agreed to a 298-105 seat-sharing formula with the Congress after its matriarch Sonia Gandhi\u2019s timely intervention. And here they are campaigning together in Lucknow\u2013a new king and a reluctant prince. \n \nAkhilesh Yadav and Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi hit the campaign trail together for the first time in their political careers. They addressed a press conference together and then showed their solidarity and strength with a road show in the state capital. Posters with the slogan \u2018UP ko yeh saath pasand hai\u2019 having the pictures of both Rahul Gandhi and Akhilesh Yadav with their party symbols have been also released. The \u2018tri-colour\u2019 and \u2018red and green\u2019 colours of both the parties will form the border of the posters. Only that no one knows for sure will UP likes this marriage or not. \n \nAs of now, things look hunky-dory for the new alliance. The two leaders are campaigning together. Talks are that they would soon be addressing rallies together in the state. The two parties were still haggling over some seats in Amethi and Rae Bareli, the parliamentary turf of Congress president Sonia Gandhi and her son Rahul. But that little glitch will be solved in all likelihood. Akhilesh had recently joined a Congress leader in a rally in Lakhimpur Kheri. His sister-in-law Aparna Yadav told a news channel that Priyanka Gandhi Vadra may campaign for her in Lucknow Cantt. It may be possible that Akhilesh\u2019s wife Dimple Yadav\u2014who played a big role in stitching the alliance together\u2014may campaign with Priyanka Gandhi Vadra. The Uttar Pradesh chief minister is confident of at least getting more than 300 seats out of 403. \n \nWhy are they together? \n \n\u201cFor the unity of the country and committed to the idea of secularism, SP and Congress will contest the 2017 polls together. We appeal to the supporters to vote for the candidates of the two parties to take forward the agenda of development started by chief minister Akhilesh Yadav,\u201d Samajwadi Party state president Naresh Uttam had said at a joint press conference with Raj Babbar. \n \nHowever, the real reason is the minority votes. The minorities especially Muslims traditionally vote for both the parties. During negotiations for the alliance, both the parties were squabbling for seats with more minority presence. \n \nThe route of the road show was decided so that it also covered the Muslim-dominated areas besides those which have the concentration of the youth population. Pretty much sums their intention. \n \nTraditionally, Muslim voters have been a big deciding factor in the state. The Muslim voters do not vote for the BJP, so they support either Congress or SP. The Congress-SP alliance intends to keep the vote bank consolidated. \n \nAlso, there are calculations in Akhilesh Yadav\u2019s mind. The party leader is eyeing more than 35 %voteshare to get around 300 seats to retain power. In 2012, SP had got 29.13% votes. The Congress had got 11.65% votes. Together, both the parties can reach the magical figure. \n \n\n \nWhy is this alliance significant even after UP polls? \n \nUttar Pradesh is the biggest state in the country in terms of the Lok Sabha seats. The enormous state has 80 constituencies. In 2014 General Elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party dismantled all the other parties in the state. They had got 71 seats and a whopping vote share 42.30 percent. The party got a landslide victory and went on to form a popular government in Delhi under Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The vote percentage of the BJP in the state compared to 2009 was increased by 24%. It was understood later that a Modi wave had come swept away with votes in the states. The Samajwadi Party and the BSP that were the two largest parties in 2009, were destroyed. \n \nSP had 23 seats in 2009, they were reduced to 5 seats in 2014. BSP had 20 seats in 2009, they couldn\u2019t even open their accounts. The Congress party had 26 seats in 2009, they were reduced to a mere 2 seats in the state. \n \n\n \nThe vote shares of the parties didn\u2019t dip much individually. There was 1.06 points dip in SP\u2019s vote share, whereas BSP got 7.82 points lesser votes than in 2009. The Congress party took the biggest hit with a dip pf 10.75 points. \n \nThe main reason for such a performance by BJP was Narendra Modi alone. The charismatic leader mesmerised the voters with his promise of \u2018ache din\u2019. However, things have changed now. Under his leadership, the party lost two major elections\u2013Delhi and Bihar. The two results clearly showed that he was not invincible. The Modi wave has cooled down and even Prime Minister Narendra Modi is facing flak for his demonetisation move and heavy tax regime. The government is also going to undertake a tectonic shift in India\u2019s taxation\u2013the GST. Economists say that it will be a welcome economic reform, but no one is sure about the political implications of the move as most of the services will get more expensive after its implementation. It has the real potential of backfiring to the Modi government electorally. Without the Modi wave, the Congress and the Samajwadi Party together have a big chance of bouncing back in the 2019 general elections. \n \nThere are 80 seats in Uttar Pradesh. In 2009 general elections, the SP had got 23.26% votes and was the single-largest party in the state with 23 seats in their kitty. The Congress had got 21 seats with a vote share of 18.25%. The BJP could only get 10 seats with a vote share 17.50%. If Akhilesh Yadav and Rahul Gandhi remain together till 2009, they can make a real dent in BJP\u2019s voters base. BJP\u2019s policies at the Centre may have a direct impact in the state. Whereas, people can show their confidence on the refurbished Samajwadi Party under the leadership Akhilesh Yadav, who enjoys a clean and pro-development image. If they contest the 2019 elections together and even repeat their performance in 2009 in the absence of a political wave, they can get a vote share of 35% plus and that is enough to destroy the BJP in the state. A vote share of 40% or more can get them around 50 seats and it can make a major difference nationally. \n \n ","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Vaibhav Tiwari"},"topics":[{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Indian subcontinent news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"If Akhilesh Yadav-Rahul Gandhi get success in UP Assembly polls 2017, it can prove detrimental to Narendra Modi\u2019s plans for 2019","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"India.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"597540856","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"India.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.india.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199275384","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:45:13Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:50:22Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://s3.india.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Akhilesh-Rahul.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Are they still planning to kill Dhlakama?\u201d asked the 64-year-old rebel, who often speaks about himself in the third person. \n\n\u201cAre they trying to find the river where Dhlakama is drinking from to poison it, or the roads we use to plant anti-personnel landmines?\u201d \n\nDhlakama, whose Renamo party is the main opposition in Mozambique, retreated in October 2012 to his hideout in Gorongosa with 800 former guerrillas demanding a greater share of power. \n\nIn 2013 tensions resurfaced with Renamo fighters again taking up arms against Frelimo, accusing the ruling party of enriching itself at the expense of the southern African country. \n\nOn the eve of the October 2014 general elections Renamo and the government signed a ceasefire. \n\nBut Renamo refused to accept the results of the 2014 elections when it was beaten once more at the polls by Frelimo, which has been in power since the former Portuguese colony\u2019s independence 40 years ago \n\n\u2013 \u2018Won\u2019t give up on truce\u2019 \u2013 \n\nDhlakama has accused the army of not only targeting Renamo members but civilians too. \n\n\u201cThe armed forces go to the villages, open fire to disperse the population, and then ransack the houses making off with chickens and goats, which is typical of Frelimo,\u201d he claimed, adding that women had been beaten and houses torched. \n\n\u201cEither Frelimo does not know how to control its troops or there is a clear lack of will,\u201d he said. \n\nAbuses have also been reported to international organisations by Mozambicans who have sought refuge in neighbouring countries. \n\nAuthorities in December said more than 3,000 people fleeing the conflict now live in government camps, while the UN refugee agency says another 8,600 have been forced to cross the border to Malawi and Zimbabwe. \n\nIn spite of the allegations, Dhlakama has no intention of calling off the ceasefire, which he admits he unilaterally proclaimed in a bid to reopen peace negotiations. \n\nThe peace talks with international mediators resumed in May last year but failed to prevent the escalation of tensions and by mid-December the mediators quit the country. \n\n\u201cI must speak to President Nyusi in the coming days because we are still waiting for him to give the signal for the return of mediators,\u201d said Dhlakama. \n\nThe rebel leader said he will leave his mountain base only to sign a peace agreement. \n\n\u201cWe are not going to give up on the truce. But every day someone calls me up to ask me to extend it beyond March 4. And I always tell them that it will depend on the progress of the negotiations.\u201d \n\n© 2017 AFP","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Adrien BARBIER"},"topics":[{"name":"Mozambique news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Africa news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Mozambique rebel leader accuses soldiers of violating ceasefire","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Southern Africa","countryCode":"ZA","country":"South Africa"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Roodepoort Record","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"535027901","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"368"},"name":"Roodepoort Record","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Global","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://roodepoortrecord.co.za"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199277132","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:50:23Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Seven days later, norms and doctrine that have guided the United States for decades are being re-examined. \n\nTrump\u2019s down-to-the-studs gut job began with a feisty inaugural address: a call to arms that tested old distinctions between left and right. \n\n\u201cToday, we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another or from one party to another,\u201d he said. \n\n\u201cWe are transferring power from Washington, DC, and giving it back to you, the people.\u201d \n\nThe establishment \u201celites\u201d in big cities, in politics and the media were no longer the technocrats in charge of the world\u2019s only superpower, they were the enemy. \n\nThe new president also put the rest of the world on notice. \n\nFor the last 75 years, America had been what Barack Obama described as the \u201cindispensable nation\u201d \u2014 the glue that bound the global order. \n\nThe era of Trump would be the era of \u201cAmerica first,\u201d he said, of naked self-interest and zero-sum diplomacy. Old alliances would be reassessed, new alliances would be explored. \n\nBefore his inauguration, many asked if the presidency would change Donald Trump, or whether Donald Trump would change the presidency. \n\nBarely 20 minutes into his four-year term, anyone who was listening had their answer. \n\n\u2013 Rolling thunder \u2013 \n\nBefore arriving at the Oval Office, Trump\u2019s strategists had decided to use the first few weeks to unleash a daily wave of executive orders. \n\nThe aim was to unbalance opponents, define Trump as a man of action and slake his supporters\u2019 thirst for change. \n\nFor much of middle America, globalization, automation and the Great Recession had been apocalyptic. \n\nPolitics had passed them over and worse, they felt steamrollered by \u201ccoastal elites\u201d in America\u2019s \u201cculture wars\u201d over abortion, gay rights, immigration, global warming and religion. \n\nTrump had won the election by promising to be their champion, and he was going to \u2014 as Ronald Reagan said \u2014 \u201cdance with the one that brung ya.\u201d \n\nFor the most part, the CEO-in-chief put forward actions that could have come from any Republican in the country: defunding abortion, preening the military and approving oil pipelines. \n\nBut it was coated with a thick veneer of nationalist and populist rhetoric, and accompanying policies championed by top aide Steve Bannon. \n\nTrump ripped up a trans-Pacific trade deal designed to counterbalance China\u2019s regional economic power, imposed a ban on refugees from Syria and migrants from seven other Muslim countries. \n\nHe ordered planning to begin to build a wall on Mexico\u2019s southern border and picked a very public fight with Mexico\u2019s president Enrique Pena Nieto, who cancelled a trip to Washington. \n\nThe United States, a nation founded by migrants, was now willing to shut its doors. \n\nNot since Obama\u2019s election or perhaps the Iraq War has America\u2019s image around the world changed so dramatically and so quickly. \n\nBut Trump supporters saw an outsider sticking up for them and sticking it to the elites. \n\n\u201cGet used to it,\u201d said Trump aide Kellyanne Conway, boasting that Trump had delivered a \u201cshock to the system.\u201d \n\n\u201cAnd he\u2019s just getting started,\u201d she said. \n\n\u2013 Rocky start \u2013 \n\nBut it was not all positive for Trump. The White House is far from purring. Key positions have yet to be filled and the decision making process is haphazard. \n\nTrump aides were forced to publicly row back suggestions of a 20 percent border tax on Mexican goods and defend a chaotic rollout of the refugee and migrant ban. \n\nThroughout the week, Trump engaged in intemperate outbursts about the size of his inaugural crowd, alleged election fraud and perceived media persecution. \n\nPrivately, in call after call, he complained to top aides about press coverage. The impression was of a man focused on his image more than running the country. \n\nTrump also seemed like a a man for whom becoming US president was not adulation enough. \n\nSpokesman Sean Spicer \u2014 between tirades and missteps \u2014 offered a window onto the soul of the White House. \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this constant theme to undercut the enormous support he has,\u201d Spicer said. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievably frustrating when you\u2019re continually told it\u2019s not big enough; it\u2019s not good enough. You can\u2019t win.\u201d \n\nBut critics saw a more sinister motive for the outbursts, particularly Trump\u2019s unsubstantiated claim that three million people voted illegally in the election. \n\nBrian Klaas, an expert on global democracy at the London School of Economics, sees Trump \u201ccasting aspersions (without evidence) on electoral integrity is a key way to restrict voting rights and erode confidence in elections.\u201d \n\n\u201cAttacking the media and blurring the lines of truth with state narratives not grounded in fact is important to sowing public doubt,\u201d he said. \n\nMindy Finn, who ran as a independent vice presidential candidate, summed up Trump\u2019s strategy as \u201csow chaos, deepen division and consolidate power.\u201d \n\nFor his harshest critics, the question is now whether Donald Trump breaks the presidency, or whether the presidency breaks Donald Trump. \n\n© 2017 AFP","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Andrew BEATTY"},"topics":[],"title":"In one week, Trump shakes up Washington and the world","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Southern Africa","countryCode":"ZA","country":"South Africa"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Roodepoort Record","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"535027901","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"368"},"name":"Roodepoort Record","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Global","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://roodepoortrecord.co.za"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199277539","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:50:23Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Development of Nigerian art, through its culture and traditions must be a priority for every government. \n \nWhile the Director-General of the National Gallery of Art (NGA), Adbullahi Muku, has said art development is on the front burner of government\u2019s agenda and interest, particularly now that government is trying to diversify the economy, artists at the Oshogbo Arts Movement disagree, noting that no development has occurred since government\u2019s announcement of the diversification agenda. \n \nMuku, in agreement that art should be sellable and commercially profitable, quoted the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, saying art would also step in against the country\u2019s dependence on oil, which he said, is what government intends to encourage. \n \nThe DG, who was at the opening of Celebration of 50 years of Oshogbo School of Art, held at the Thought Pyramid Art Centre in Abuja, on Tuesday, said government is working on the review of enabling law supporting the arts, which currently focuses more on social service than commercial profitability. He said the embellishment of public spaces is also on the front burner of issues to be tackled by government. \n \nHe explained that where Nigerian art, which is well appreciated internationally and much more locally now than before, would have spaces where creative works can be appreciated and reviewed in a competitive environment, artists would be better encouraged to produce qualitative and appreciative works of art. \n \n\u201cApart from the wealth generation factor of the arts for the artist, it can create employment opportunities. We are also working on the embellishment of public spaces where a percentage would be set aside for the embellishing of sites to encourage art appreciation and development. \n \n\u201cPeople have come to realise that art can be an alternative to the oil we have over time relied on. Through art, employment is being created. Most of the time, artists are not looking for government work but are looking for an environment to thrive in most of the time,\u201d Muku said. \n \nChiefs Muraina Oyelami (left) and Jimoh Buraimoh \u2026 at the Abuja show on Tuesday. \n  \nThe Oshogbo Arts Movement, however, said that as far as it is concerned, government has done nothing for the arts. The Movement also said government has done nothing on the diversification of the economy in respects to tourism and arts, especially in the area of job creation. \n \nThe Oshogbo Art at 50 celebration, which played host to rare art pieces and works from pioneering members of the Movement such as Twins Seven Seven, Jacob Afolabi, Muraina Oyelami, Adebisi Fabunmi, Jimoh Buraimoh and Rufus Ogundele, made its bold statement of reverence, honour, perseverance and integrity as the representing works bespoke with the fierceness of the influencing spirit commanding its fair candour of respect. \n \nEarlier at the celebration, former governor of Osun State and Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the collaborating organisers of the event and exhibition, the Centre for Black Culture and International Understanding (CBCIU), Olagunsoye Oyinlola, believes that culture is at the basis of international tourism and has facilitated growth and allowed various sections of societies to participate in development processes. \n \nThough he was absent at the event, in his statement read by a representative, he praised the high confidence reposed in the celebrated artists, describing them as great cultural assets and remarkable reference points in Yoruba folkore and the Nigerian story . \n \nHe further referred to them as true heroes who have inspired generations with their selfless commitment to community development, their creativity, and entrepreneurship and recommended the values they portray as solutions for some of the challenges concerning poverty eradication and wealth creation in the country. \n \nThe journey began in 1964 when \u2018The Ordained Six\u2019, namely: Adebisi Fabunmi, who was a baker; Muraina Oyelami, a drummer cum petrol station attendant; Jimoh Buraimoh, an electrician; Taiwo Olaniyi also known as Twin Seven-Seven, who was a commercial dancer; Rufus Ogundele, a drummer and Jacob Afolabi, a bartender, cleared the path for a sustainable artistic venture for others to follow. \n \nThe relevance of the Mbari-Mbayo Artists and Writer\u2019s Club 1964 Summer Art School, to the jubilee celebration of the Oshogbo Art School, which produced a league of pioneering artists who would come to be popularly known as the \u2018Ordained Six\u2019 can never be over-emphasised, probably because of their pace-setting qualities that would inspire creative works of many artists across generations after the workshop initiative. \n \nThe most interesting detail about the Ordained Six may however be the fact that they were not amateur or semi-skilled artist per se, but people only participated in a workshop targeted at encouraging non-professional society to attempt the artistic endeavour, which eventually produced creatively imaginative minds that would emerge as masters of the form. \n \nOver fifty years down the line, the initiative which gave birth to the iconic venture would pull a gathering of enthusiasts, professionals and scholars in the nation\u2019s capital, Abuja, for a convergence in celebration mentorship, invention, imagination and initiative. \n \nThe event played host to rare art pieces and important works from pioneering members of the Oshogbo Art Movement such as Twins Seven-Seven, Jacob Afolabi, Muraina Oyelami, Adebisi Fabunmi, Jimoh Buraimoh and Rufus Ogundele, the Ordained Six. \n \nAccording to a Director at the National Gallery of Art, Mufu Onifade, Oshogbo Art had, in the beginning, sneaked in through the backdoor of primitivism, or naivety of form, but owing to conspiracy theory of time, consistency of practice and sustenance of exhibitions and salons, the Art advanced on to an unprecedented acceptability and a huge followership. \n \n\u201cIn Nigerian Art historical evolution, no Art Group has been celebrated as much as the Osogbo Art Group,\u201d Onifade said. \n \nOnifade narrated that apart from training and producing as many successors as possible, Osogbo Art also extended its frontiers by influencing a new generation of artists who hail from Osogbo, based in Osogbo or had had contact with the Osogbo Art tradition. Primitivism soon developed into a giant constituency of originality and authenticity. \n \n\u201cToday, the Nigerian creative industry hankers for entrepreneurial approach to Art so that Nigerian artists can live by the \u2018mercantilistic\u2019 benefit of their art. Ironically, this has always been one of the strengths of Osogbo Art. \n \n\u201cIts part focus on \u2018sellable\u2019 and \u2018commercially profitable\u2019 art has assisted its exponents\u2019 explorative aggressiveness, thus resulting in sustainable marketability. This is why it is easy to find artists who imbibe the Osogbo spirit of entrepreneurship at embassies, international mission houses and events, presenting their art in a most simplified way that guarantees commercial action and success,\u201d he added. \n \nOf the Six artists celebrated, only two were present at the exhibition. Chiefs Jimoh Braimoh and Muraina Oyelami. The elder artists, who are both titled chiefs in their respective communities, were fully accessible throughout the jubilee celebration especially during the Artist Talk also held at exhibition space in the Thought Pyramid Art Centre venue in Abuja. \n \nWhile three of the artists have passed, one of them, Adebisi Fabunmi, was however not in attendance. \n \nJimoh Braimoh, one of the exhibiting artists at the jubilee event and member of the celebrated \u2018Ordained Six\u2019 is a pioneering artist in the history of modern art in Africa. This is mostly nonetheless owed to his being Africa\u2019s first bead painter having in 1964 created the contemporary art form, inspired by the Yoruba tradition of incorporating beadwork designs into ceremonial fabrics and beaded crowns. Some of his works were exhibited. \n \nMuraina Oyelami, on the other hand, is a painter, printmaker, poet, musician and actor. His works of Oil on Board were also featured along with Chief Braimoh\u2019s and the other four artists. \n \nChief Oyelami made his strong views about the Oshogbo Art School noted especially on the influences of Georgina Beier and Uli Beier and he was quite unflinching about it. At the Artist talk event, Oyelami explained how the inner strengths and spirit of the artists had paved the path to their self discovery of self and style as he laid to rest the controversy that Georgina Beier had taught the artists how to paint. \n \n\u201cGeorgina never taught us how to paint, she just gave us materials and we didn\u2019t know what she meant it for. But we loved doing it. We never saw so much paint, so many colours. The art workshop was a wonderful experience because it taught us to see our own potential. \n \n\u201cI think that I can say that Fabunmi, Rufus, Twins Seven-Seven and myself, each discovered a new dimension in ourselves and painting is really like going into a strange place, like an unknown territory, and then you have to let your own integrity guide you. The importance of the art workshop to us was that it gave us our own identity,\u201d he said. \n \nWhile he encouraged younger artists to imbibe strong moral values with their art practice, he urged against dependence on government for development and advancement. \n \nWhen asked of his views on government\u2019s diversification agenda, Chief Oyelami said: \u201cHas government ever done anything for the arts? With our 50 years of experience, no governmental agency has come to say to in appreciation of our works and for posterity\u2019s sake take up collections of our works. \n \n\u201cAs far as the Oshogbo Arts movement is concerned, government has done nothing for the arts. They have done nothing on the diversification of the economy in respects to tourism and arts. They have done nothing to create jobs in the arts. \n \n\u201cLai Mohammed is now in charge. Maybe they are yet to settle down because of the political unrest, we have to forge ahead even if we are in trouble. We cannot say because we have crises, we cannot eat when we are hungry. No! You eat, so you can continue to face the problem. I think it is high time government unveiled what they want to do on diversification. \n \n\u201cI recently spoke to some staff of the NGA where they have directors who claim to have deep appreciation for the arts, yet, they can\u2019t boast of any work of art collected by their agency,\u201d he said. \n \nWhile agreeing that issues being faced in the arts sector should be on the front burner for government, especially with its diversification plan to shift the nation\u2019s dependence on oil revenue, implored government to develop an Arts Trust Fund. \n \nHe stipulated that the existence of such funds may most likely exist, but where square pegs in round holes are the order of the day, it will never amount to any good. \n \n\u201cI mean government tends to appoint people who either have no business in the industry or are even least qualified simply because they are connected or know someone in the high echelon of the society. \n \n\u201cFor example, when once a man like Sir Victor Uwaifo was given a notable appointment in the culture sector, there were revolutionary trends during the period because it was like a round peg put in a round hole. \n \n\u201cThis is lacking in so many of these parastatals that has to do with arts and culture. Not until we have people who are experts in their chosen fields placed in the right places before we can see a government official acknowledging or truly admiring the works of the arts.\u201d \n \nChief Braimoh, on the aspect of mercantilism and commercial profitability, however, advised young artists not to be dependent on proceeds from sale of their works but develop a sort of bilateral relationship between their work in the art and have a job on the side in the interest of preserving the integrity of their creative engagement. \n \n\u201cWhat we do is to express ourselves through art. If people come to us to buy, we sell. When no one comes, it didn\u2019t matter to us if we didn\u2019t sell. The reason is because I have something else to fall back to. Even Chief Oyelami also has something to fall back to. \n \n\u201cThis is why we ask every artist to have a second job. Like Bruce Onobrakpeya who was once a teacher. When he was teaching, he was at the same time working on his art. The same goes for Yusuf Grillo, Oshinowo and so on. I had my own job too before coming into the arts and I still have something I am doing,\u201d he said. \n \nWhile strongly advising against compromise of quality for the sake of profitability, he encouraged young artists to alongside having a job, have an agent to help oversee affairs with their creations and try as much as possible not to present themselves cheaply for cheap gains. \n \n\u201cArtists should not chase buyers around but organise befitting exhibition and respectfully in honour of their work and art. Also, we do art to promote Nigeria, its image and culture home and abroad and impart on the younger generation so that they can imbibe the idea and not to loose direction or origins. \n \n\u201cIf you get to my house now, you will find series of works I kept and may refuse to sell sometimes maybe for a while because I am not a commercial artist like those in \u2018Bar Beach\u2019. Artists may sell, but should attempt to only sell few and preserve,\u201d he added. \n \nAyo Ayanwale, who is member of the Board of Trustees of CBCIU, and Assistant Director of Culture, Ministry of Information and Culture, is also a traditional drummer and traditional poet. He coordinated a \u201cOrisa Dances in Yoruba land\u201d video also launched at the jubilee celebration along with a journal by the CBCIU. \n \nHe advocated for the commercialisation of art, especially Yoruba art but mostly for the purpose of exposing the artists from the present all through history. He said most masters of creative arts are gone but their works remain and are deserving of appreciation. Also, he stressed the need to encourage and enlighten young artists, which is part of the purpose of the Oshogbo School of Arts celebration. \n  \n\nSource link \n   Related","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: fine arts news","group":"Entertainment"},{"name":"Africa news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Nigeria news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"How to drive economic diversification through cultural and artistic enterprise \u2013 Arts Nigeria","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Western Africa","countryCode":"NG","country":"Nigeria"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Paxnigerian.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"608959157","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Paxnigerian.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.paxnigerian.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://guardian.ng/art/how-to-drive-economic-diversification-through-cultural-and-artistic-enterprise/"],"sequenceId":"695199278867","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:45:18Z","adultLanguage":"true","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:50:24Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

That's something you've got to get through, the first 10-15 overs are crucial. With the line-up that we play, if we can have wickets in the shed at the back end then we will score a lot of runs at the end of the (innings).\" \n \nThe keeper found out the perils of taking on Eden Park's small boundaries when he played at the ground for the first time last February, caught at cow corner trying to heave Corey Anderson over the ropes. \n \nThe Australians were all out for 148 on that occasion, with the Black Caps' seamers running riot on the way to a 2-1 series win. It was a similar story a year earlier, with the Aussies skittled for 151 in a World Cup clash that the Kiwis only won by a wicket. \n \nAt the same time, Eden Park's unusual dimensions have resulted in big scores before. Although the tourists failed to pass 150 last time around, New Zealand posted a score of 8-307 in the same game. \n \nIndeed, before Australia's innings that day, seven of the last eight innings at the ground had gone past 280 runs. \n \n\"(The Eden Park pitch) just has a bit in it,\" New Zealand veteran Ross Taylor said. \"I don't think there is a par score, some wickets here are 300, some are 200. \n \n\"You just have to analyse it as quickly as possible, whether you're batting or bowling.\" \n \nThe Kiwis were trounced 3-0 in Australia when the sides met in December, but Wade is expecting a tougher time on New Zealand's turf. \n \n\"We played them in Australia (on) big grounds (with) long boundaries. It's a completely different ball game,\" he said. \n \n\"(On) the smaller grounds (in New Zealand) they'll still play aggressive; they're still going to be able to hit plenty of fours and sixes at grounds that they play at. \n \n\"They play well here (in NZ) and they play this venue very well. \n \n\"We like to think we're hard to beat in Australia and it's the same when we come here - we expect a hard challenge over the next three games but we've got a young squad and we're excited to go out and really have a crack at it.\" \n \nCaptaining the side for the first time, Wade maintains his job is simply to continue the fine work of the leadership duo of Steve Smith and vice-captain David Warner. \n \n\"I don't think for me personally it's about putting a stamp on the team,\" he said. \"It's about driving the values and the game plan that we have in one-day cricket moving forward. \n \n\"Steven and David have put their stamp on the team, it's just about me keeping on driving those key messages through to the players. \n \n\"We've performed really well in one-day cricket over a long period of time so it's not about trying to change too much - it's about keeping the ball rolling.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"New Zealand news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Aussies wary of Black Caps on home turf","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"AU","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Coolum News North Shore","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"606907577","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Coolum News North Shore","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.coolum-news.com.au"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199279234","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T00:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:50:24Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Though I trust they got their own hearts right with God, the gospels say I don\u2019t need to pay for their sins.

Instead, they should have calm, quiet, inner confidence that the accusers are playing in the devil\u2019s playground.

In addition, these schools prohibit representatives from Aluma, an organization that encourages military service for religiously observant women, from their schools. \n\r\n                                                                                         \r\n                \r\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \r \nIn late 2016, Education Minister and Habayit Hayehudi Chairman Naftali Bennett spoke out against banning Aluma from schools.

Even Russia\u2019s chief negotiator at the discussion reached the point of complaining, more than once, about diverse complications. And the main obstacle remains Iran, due to the fact that a true ceasefire in Syria should spell the end of its foothold. \n \nThe talks have even been dubbed a diplomatic coup , with all three sponsors, Moscow, Ankara, and Tehran accused of seeking separate objectives. The truth is there is no ceasefire thanks to Iran\u2019s support for Syrian dictator Bashar Assad. Despite the so-called \u201cceasefire pact\u201d sealed on December 30th, pro-Assad forces backed by Iran -- including the Lebanese Hizb\u2019allah -- have continued attacks on the besieged rebel-held area of Wadi Barada near Damascus. \n  \nThe Syrian regime has resorted to the ridiculous excuse that al-Qaeda-affiliated \u201cterrorist groups\u201d are in control of Ain al-Fijeh, a small town in Wadi Barada. This despite locals reporting only a \u201ctiny minority\u201d of such elements being present. It is thus crystal clear that neither Assad, nor his Iranian masters, have ever sought a meaningful ceasefire in Syria. \n \nIn other areas, regime warplanes launched further airstrikes targeting rebel-controlled areas in west Syria, leaving 12 dead in one area alone, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. \n \nThe fact is that the Astana talks have left many loopholes, and this is exactly what Iran will exploit to plunge the entire process into utter failure. \n No details are available about a mechanism to monitor a supposed ceasefire.  Political issues failed to achieve any tangible progress and the talks are described as narrowly focused.  One senior Western diplomat criticized the entire initiative as \u201cnot very serious,\u201d adding, \u201cYou don\u2019t seal a ceasefire in two days.\u201d There are no indications of any work on modalities, observers, mechanisms, maps, and so forth.  No document has been signed by Syrian opposition or regime representatives, the two parties who actually have to reach an arrangement.  While the agreement promises a separation of rebel forces into legitimate opposition and terrorists, no specific method is laid out over how, and according to what merits.  \nRussia may be considered the main benefactor of the talks, especially since the U.S. cited transition duties and participated only as an observer. Iran is amongst those tasked to monitor the ceasefire, while it is obvious Iran-backed Shiite militias, already accused of violating this ceasefire, will seek to exploit the numerous Astana agreement loopholes. \n \nEven the next date set for future talks between Syrian opposition and regime delegations, Feb. 8 in Geneva, lacks firm confirmation. The Astana negotiations ultimately did not go as planned due to different interests pursued by all three sponsors, proving that Washington and the Gulf States must take part in any future effort. \n \nEven such a goal encounters difficulty due to stark differences seen between Russia and Iran over the United States possibly taking part. Moscow is in favor of Washington, under the Trump administration, taking part, while Iran flatly rejects the proposal. \n \n\u201cThey (the Russians) can now see how difficult their partners are,\u201d one Western diplomat described, according to Reuters . \n \n\u201cThey are finding a lot of obstacles from Hezbollah forces, Iran and the regime,\u201d explained Mohammed Alloush, head of the Syrian opposition delegation. \n \nWestern diplomats have also voiced concerns, viewing Iran as a main obstacle to progress. Uncertainty is the least that can be said about Tehran\u2019s commitment to what can hardly be described as a ceasefire. \n \nAt a time of concerns regarding Iran\u2019s involvement in Syria , including a conglomerate of militias and Assad forces continuing to launch attacks on civilians in rebel-held areas, there are serious questions and doubts over Tehran\u2019s legitimacy as a broker in this entire ordeal. \n \nAs seen over the past four decades, Tehran thrives on two pillars of domestic crackdown and provoking unrest across the Middle East. This leaves the international community lacking an obvious solution. \n \n\u201cThe regime in Tehran is the source of crisis in the region and killings in Syria; it has played the greatest role in the expansion and continuation of ISIS.

November's total of $718 million was up by $123 million compared with a year earlier.\n\nThe results reversed a mid-year slump in the state's stamp duty receipts.\n\nTurnover was very strong in the final quarter of the year. Stamp duty was paid on 21,239 residential transfers across NSW in December, which was 31 per cent higher than in July.\n\nThe average stamp duty received per transaction in December was $34,385 \u2013 around $2100 more than the corresponding month a year earlier.\n\nThe strong stamp duty figures suggest Sydney's property market defied predictions of a slow-down and picked up pace in late 2016.\n\nFigures released by the Domain Group last Tuesday showed Sydney's median house price jumped 4.7 per cent in last three months of the year to reach $1.124 million. The city's median unit prices rose nearly 3 per cent in the quarter to $711,256.\n\nDomain's measure of Sydney's median house price has risen by 69 per cent \u2013 or $450,000 \u2013 in the past four years.\n\nWhile the end-of-year surge in stamp duty will bolster the state's already healthy bottom line, the figures also underscore how difficult it will be for the new Premier, Gladys Berejiklian, to improve housing affordability.\n\nAt her first press conference as Premier last week Ms Berejiklian vowed to address the housing affordability crisis, declaring it \"the biggest issue people have across the state\".\n\nShe said specific policies to deal with this challenge would be outlined \"in the near future\".\n\nStamp duty revenue will get a further boost in coming months as a new surcharge on the stamp duty paid by foreign investors comes into effect. The surcharge was introduced in the June 2016 state budget but revenue from the new measure is not expected until early this year.\n\nSydney's four-year housing boom has helped deliver the state government a massive increase in the transfer duty levies on the transfer of property and other assets.\n\nIn 2011-12, just before the boom began, the government received $3.8 billion in transfer duty but that had swelled to nearly $9 billion by 2015-16.\n\nResidential stamp duty alone accounted for about 9 per cent of the state government's revenue last financial year.\n\nThe half-yearly review of the NSW budget, released last month, lifted the forecast for the state's budget surplus for this financial year by about $300 million to $4 billion.\n\nThe story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Matt Wade"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2650","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Wagga Wagga","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Riverina Rural","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169702607","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Riverina Rural","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.therural.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199285103","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:37Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:50:24Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/e3c18faa-fe37-48b4-bad2-520457875b09.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Also out of cabinet is Liberal MLC John Ajaka, who was minister for ageing, disability services and multiculturalism. However, Mr Ajaka is set to become President of the Legislative Council.\n\nIn strategic appointments with an eye on the crucial electoral battleground of western Sydney, two new MPs from the area, Mulgoa's Tanya Davies and Castle Hill MP Ray Williams, have been elevated to cabinet.\n\nMs Berejiklian has also created the new portfolio of minister for WestConnex, to be held by Penrith MP Stuart Ayres, who is also minister for western Sydney.\n\nThe move is being seen as an attempt to reset the discussion about the $16.8 billion road project from complaints about the disruption of inner-Sydney communities to the benefits it will bring commuting western Sydney families.\n\nAnother surprise announcement is the new position of minister for counter terrorism which Ms Berejiklian said was necessary \"unfortunately due to the circumstances our world is in\".\n\nLiberal MP David Elliott \u2013 a leader of the centre-right faction that supported Ms Berejiklian's election as Liberal leader and premier after the retirement from politics of former premier Mike Baird \u2013 adds the role to his existing portfolio area of corrections.\n\nIt will involve liaising with state, Commonwealth and international counter terrorism bodies.\n\nUnveiling the new cabinet, Ms Berejiklian repeated the pledge that her government would listen, consult and act and \"wants to make sure every single community across NSW gets its fair share\".\n\nMr Piccoli will be replaced in education by Rob Stokes, whose planning portfolio will be taken over by former industry and energy minister Anthony Roberts.\n\nMr Roberts, a leader of the right faction whose numbers also supported Ms Berejiklian's election, also becomes special minister of state.\n\nNationals MP for Oxley Melinda Pavey enters cabinet to take over the roads portfolio from Mr Gay, while her party colleague Sarah Mitchell has been promoted to the ministry to take on early childhood education and Aboriginal affairs.\n\nAmong the biggest winners are two of Ms Berejiklian's strongest supporters in her own left faction: former Legislative Council president Don Harwin and Hornsby MP and former parliamentary secretary Matt Kean.\n\nMr Harwin comes into cabinet as energy and resources minister and minister for the arts.\n\nHe has also been appointed leader of the government in the Legislative Council.

Voter Eligibility \n \nTrump has suggested that millions of illegal votes were counted. The media has almost uniformly denied this, but there is ample evidence -- anecdotal and otherwise -- establishing that there is substantial vote fraud. What states do with respect to local elections is their own business under the federal system, but respecting federal elections, it\u2019s long past time to have the Department of Justice and FBI review the record and prosecute those who engage in it. \n \nSlightly over two years ago the Washington Post conceded millions of votes have been cast in prior elections by illegal aliens , though it later tried to walk back the cat. \n  \nOur data comes from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES). Its large number of observations (32,800 in 2008 and 55,400 in 2010) provide sufficient samples of the non-immigrant sub-population, with 339 non-citizen respondents in 2008 and 489 in 2010. For the 2008 CCES, we also attempted to match respondents to voter files so that we could verify whether they actually voted. \n \nHow many non-citizens participate in U.S. elections? More than 14 percent of non-citizens in both the 2008 and 2010 samples indicated that they were registered to vote. Furthermore, some of these non-citizens voted. Our best guess, based upon extrapolations from the portion of the sample with a verified vote, is that 6.4 percent of non-citizens voted in 2008 and 2.2 percent of non-citizens voted in 2010. \n  \nEstimated Voter Turnout by Non-Citizens \n     \n2008 \n   \n2010 \n   \nSelf reported and/or verified \n   \n38 (11.3%) \n   \n13 (3.5%) \n   \nSelf reported and verified \n   \n5 (1.5%) \n   \nN.A. \n   \nAdjusted estimate \n   \n21 (6.4%) \n   \n8 (2.2%) \n  \nBecause non-citizens tended to favor Democrats (Obama won more than 80 percent of the votes of non-citizens in the 2008 CCES sample), we find that this participation was large enough to plausibly account for Democratic victories in a few close elections. Non-citizen votes could have given Senate Democrats the pivotal 60th vote needed to overcome filibusters in order to pass health-care reform and other Obama administration priorities in the 111th Congress. Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) won election in 2008 with a victory margin of 312 votes. Votes cast by just 0.65 percent of Minnesota non-citizens could account for this margin. It is also possible that non-citizen votes were responsible for Obama\u2019s 2008 victory in North Carolina. Obama won the state by 14,177 votes, so a turnout by 5.1 percent of North Carolina\u2019s adult non-citizens would have provided this victory margin. \n  \nProfessor Jesse Richman of Old Dominion University extrapolated from a 2014 study on voting in the 2008 and 2010 elections that 800,000 noncitizens voted in the last presidential election.  \n \nThe Pew Foundation study went further. Examining duplicate registrations in more than one state and dead voters still on registration lists, Pew concluded that the possibility of fraud was enormous. \n  Approximately 24 million -- one of every eight -- voter registrations in the United States are no longer valid or are significantly inaccurate.  More than 1.8 million deceased individuals are listed as voters.  Approximately 2.75 million people have registrations in more than one state.   \nOne citizen tried to spearhead an examination into voting integrity -- Catherine Engelbrecht -- and in response, a \u201cweaponized IRS\u201d, OSHA, BATF working with Congressman Elijah Cummings singled her out for onerous audits of herself, her family, her business and nonprofit organization. \n \nClearly, the left was worried  about an examination of voter fraud and any attempt to end it.  \n \nIn fact, Obama himself appears to have encouraged non-citizens to vote this November with a convoluted answer to a question about non-citizen voting.  Project Veritas videotaped admissions by Democrat operative Robert Creamer and his sidekick Scott Foval in which the later discussed moving illegals around through the Midwest to vote illegally, bragging that they\u2019d fixed elections there for decades. Creamer visited the White House 32 time s in the runup to the election, something the White House declined to explain: \n \nMany Democratic leaders, in fact, have made no secret of their efforts to allow non-citizens to vote . \n \nWhether Trump is right that the margin of Clinton\u2019s popular vote was as a result of illegal voting remains to be seen, but that there is such voting and it is not insubstantial seems likely and deserves examination .  \n  \n[A]s [John] Fund and [Hans] von Spakovsky point out, \"we don't know how big of a problem voter fraud really is because no systematic effort has ever been made to investigate it.\" \n \nThat's a knowledge gap that needs to be filled in, and Democrats should eagerly embrace such an effort. \n \nAfter all, they are the ones who keep insisting that we have to \"count every vote\" and \"every vote counts.\" Well, every single vote cast by an ineligible voter cancels out one legitimate ballot, which means that any level of fraud should be intolerable. \n \nPlus, if Trump is wrong about the scale of voter fraud, a thorough investigation is the only way to prove it. \n \nSomehow, we doubt Democrats will see it this way.  \n  \nMy online friend Henry notes that such fraud is usually accompanied by an impossible-to-follow audit trail and suggests the same rules that apply to businesses be applied to vote counters: \n  \nIt is not clear to me that an investigation will yield a number of illegal votes. Just around here, the police audited Milwaukee's 2004 vote and found many registrations were multiple voters at vacant lots. Something in the neighborhood of Kerry's 2004 victory margin of undeliverable voter confirmation cards were found. No way to tie that to who voted though. Same thing in the recall in Racine at the Cesar Chavez Center polling location. Total pandemonium, no way to tell what happened as audit trails were broken. Then Detroit in Stein's Michigan recount, complete chaos on many polling places where ballots did not match up to vote totals. \n \nIn all three cases, not so much as a slapped wrist for the government types whose job was to fairly manage the election. In the private sector, your numbers don't add up and the audit trail is broken? Go to jail (SARBOX). Need that for elections. \n  \nC. The March of the Loony Pussies \n \nThousands of women, many dressed as vulvas and carried vulgar signs, who purported to have been offended by some bawdy Trump locker room talk years ago marched on Washington. Leading organizers and speakers of the march included Angela Davis, a Communist closely connected with the Black Panther party, Donna Hylton, who served 27 years in jail for the 15- to 20- day kidnapping, starving, torture and murder of a man and Linda Sarsour, an advocate of Sharia Law . \n \nSo these delicate souls are okay with Stalinist repression, Islamic denigration of their rights and psychopathy. Got it. I especially loved shots of these largely upper-class urban white women willingly draping themselves in American flag hijabs. I score this another self-inflicted Democrat wounding. \n \nD. Immigration \n \nIn his 1995 State of the Union address then-President Clinton spoke about securing our borders and restricting immigration to a standing ovation . A 2006 law signed by G.W. Bush authorized the construction of a wall on the Mexican border but the Democratic Congress prevented it in its spending bill. The law, however, was never repealed, so Trump and the new Congress can get to work on it without requiring the passage of a new law and he has several means at his disposal to get Mexico to pay for it. \n \nIn addition to effective Southern border security, this week Trump issued an executive order providing a ninety-day suspension of all visas from Iran, the Sudan, and Syria, state sponsors of terrorism, and Libya, Somalia, and Yemen \u201ccountries of concern.\" \n \nIt begins by noting that \u201cState Department policy prevented consular officers from properly scrutinizing the visa applications of several of the 19 foreign nationals\u201d who carried out the 9/11 attacks, and that after-enacted measures did little to stop attacks on American soil by foreign nationals. It places the onus on the countries involved to provide us with information we need to determine that visa applicants from those countries are not a \u201csecurity or public-safety threat\u201d. Its key provisions include the following: \n  \nNationals of countries, which upon notification of information we need, do not cooperate within 60 days will, with few diplomatic exceptions be, barred entry. Uniform screening standards for all immigration programs will be put in force. The totally corrupted Refugee Resettlement Program in which religiously denominated NGOs (the shells of their original organizations which received funds to flak for more open borders) will be suspended for 120 days. When the suspension period is over, refugee claims will be re-prioritized to give preference to \u201cIndividuals on the basis of religious-based persecution, provided that the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual\u2019s country of nationality\u201d. States and localities \u201cwill be granted a role in the process of determining the placement or re settlement in their jurisdiction \u201c of alien refugees, The \u201dcompletion and implementation of a biometric entry-exit tracking systems for all travelers to the US\u201d will (at long last) be expedited. The Visa Interview Waiver program is suspended. All applicants not covered by specific statutory exceptions, must undergo an in-person interview. We will collect and report the number of foreign nationals charged with, convicted of, or removed because of terrorism-related offenses here. \n  Obama banned Iraq refugees in 2011 ,   and the determination of to which countries the travel suspension now applies was made by Obama\u2019s Department of State which, by the way, did not include Saudi Arabia on the listing.  \nThe Democrats, bureaucrats, and terrorists imagined that they could beset us all without consequences -- they should have heeded Hosea\u2019s warning. \n  \nThe first full week of President Trump\u2019s term has seen Hosea\u2019s \u201cThey who have sown the wind, shall reap the whirlwind\u201d made manifest to his political opponents, the federal bureaucracy and the terrorist sponsors of the Middle East. \n \nA. The Congress and Bureaucracy \n \nThe Democrats rammed through ObamaCare. To c ite Judge Napolitano ,  Trump has begun dismantling it by an executive order that \n  \nregulations already in place be enforced with a softer, more beneficent tone, and he ordered that no penalty, fine, setoff or tax be imposed by the IRS on any person or entity who is not complying with the individual mandate, because by the time taxes are due on April 15, the IRS will be without authority to impose or collect the non-tax tax, as the individual mandate will no longer exist. Why take money from people that will soon be returned? \n \nThen he ordered a truly revolutionary act, the likes of which I have never seen in the 45 years I have studied and monitored the government\u2019s laws and its administration of them. He ordered that when bureaucrats who are administering and enforcing the law have discretion with respect to the time, place, manner and severity of its enforcement, they should exercise that discretion in favor of individuals and against the government. \n  \nEPA overreached its mission and authority and Trump has reigned it in and promises drastically to cut its staffing and budget. \n \nThe prior administration, working with radical environmental groups, halted construction of the Keystone XI and the Dakota Access Pipelines. Trump greenlighted them. Crude oil will flow from Canada to Gulf Coast refineries and from North Dakota to Illinois. He ordered that steel and other materials used in the pipelines be fabricated here. No wonder construction unions are pleased. We should be, too -- it will make us more energy independent and stands to reduce OPEC and Russian energy profits by increasing world supply. \n \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s opinion that the dreadful Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the creature of Elizabeth Warren, formerly the Harvard Law School\u2019s token \u201cIndian\u201d professor) is unconstitutional because it does not provide for Congressional oversight means it is likely CFRB will be overhauled or scrapped. \n \nDodd-Frank is likely to be restructured and the Department of Labor rules under it respecting fiduciaries and ERISA plans probably will be significantly changed. \n \nRepublicans in Congress are considering a resolution to wipe out Obama\u2019s coal-mine killing regulations and overly restrictive rules on methane emissions.  \n \nScores more federal regulations likely will be wiped out by the Congressional Review Act of 1996 .   \n \nB.

Obama won the state by 14,177 votes, so a turnout by 5.1 percent of North Carolina\u2019s adult non-citizens would have provided this victory margin. \n  \nProfessor Jesse Richman of Old Dominion University extrapolated from a 2014 study on voting in the 2008 and 2010 elections that 800,000 noncitizens voted in the last presidential election.  \n \nThe Pew Foundation study went further. Examining duplicate registrations in more than one state and dead voters still on registration lists, Pew concluded that the possibility of fraud was enormous. \n  Approximately 24 million -- one of every eight -- voter registrations in the United States are no longer valid or are significantly inaccurate.  More than 1.8 million deceased individuals are listed as voters.  Approximately 2.75 million people have registrations in more than one state.   \nOne citizen tried to spearhead an examination into voting integrity -- Catherine Engelbrecht -- and in response, a \u201cweaponized IRS\u201d, OSHA, BATF working with Congressman Elijah Cummings singled her out for onerous audits of herself, her family, her business and nonprofit organization. \n \nClearly, the left was worried  about an examination of voter fraud and any attempt to end it.  \n \nIn fact, Obama himself appears to have encouraged non-citizens to vote this November with a convoluted answer to a question about non-citizen voting.  Project Veritas videotaped admissions by Democrat operative Robert Creamer and his sidekick Scott Foval in which the later discussed moving illegals around through the Midwest to vote illegally, bragging that they\u2019d fixed elections there for decades. Creamer visited the White House 32 time s in the runup to the election, something the White House declined to explain: \n \nMany Democratic leaders, in fact, have made no secret of their efforts to allow non-citizens to vote . \n \nWhether Trump is right that the margin of Clinton\u2019s popular vote was as a result of illegal voting remains to be seen, but that there is such voting and it is not insubstantial seems likely and deserves examination .  \n  \n[A]s [John] Fund and [Hans] von Spakovsky point out, \"we don't know how big of a problem voter fraud really is because no systematic effort has ever been made to investigate it.\" \n \nThat's a knowledge gap that needs to be filled in, and Democrats should eagerly embrace such an effort. \n \nAfter all, they are the ones who keep insisting that we have to \"count every vote\" and \"every vote counts.\" Well, every single vote cast by an ineligible voter cancels out one legitimate ballot, which means that any level of fraud should be intolerable. \n \nPlus, if Trump is wrong about the scale of voter fraud, a thorough investigation is the only way to prove it. \n \nSomehow, we doubt Democrats will see it this way.  \n  \nMy online friend Henry notes that such fraud is usually accompanied by an impossible-to-follow audit trail and suggests the same rules that apply to businesses be applied to vote counters: \n  \nIt is not clear to me that an investigation will yield a number of illegal votes. Just around here, the police audited Milwaukee's 2004 vote and found many registrations were multiple voters at vacant lots. Something in the neighborhood of Kerry's 2004 victory margin of undeliverable voter confirmation cards were found. No way to tie that to who voted though. Same thing in the recall in Racine at the Cesar Chavez Center polling location. Total pandemonium, no way to tell what happened as audit trails were broken. Then Detroit in Stein's Michigan recount, complete chaos on many polling places where ballots did not match up to vote totals. \n \nIn all three cases, not so much as a slapped wrist for the government types whose job was to fairly manage the election. In the private sector, your numbers don't add up and the audit trail is broken? Go to jail (SARBOX). Need that for elections. \n  \nC. The March of the Loony Pussies \n \nThousands of women, many dressed as vulvas and carried vulgar signs, who purported to have been offended by some bawdy Trump locker room talk years ago marched on Washington. Leading organizers and speakers of the march included Angela Davis, a Communist closely connected with the Black Panther party, Donna Hylton, who served 27 years in jail for the 15- to 20- day kidnapping, starving, torture and murder of a man and Linda Sarsour, an advocate of Sharia Law . \n \nSo these delicate souls are okay with Stalinist repression, Islamic denigration of their rights and psychopathy. Got it. I especially loved shots of these largely upper-class urban white women willingly draping themselves in American flag hijabs. I score this another self-inflicted Democrat wounding. \n \nD. Immigration \n \nIn his 1995 State of the Union address then-President Clinton spoke about securing our borders and restricting immigration to a standing ovation . A 2006 law signed by G.W. Bush authorized the construction of a wall on the Mexican border but the Democratic Congress prevented it in its spending bill. The law, however, was never repealed, so Trump and the new Congress can get to work on it without requiring the passage of a new law and he has several means at his disposal to get Mexico to pay for it. \n \nIn addition to effective Southern border security, this week Trump issued an executive order providing a ninety-day suspension of all visas from Iran, the Sudan, and Syria, state sponsors of terrorism, and Libya, Somalia, and Yemen \u201ccountries of concern.\" \n \nIt begins by noting that \u201cState Department policy prevented consular officers from properly scrutinizing the visa applications of several of the 19 foreign nationals\u201d who carried out the 9/11 attacks, and that after-enacted measures did little to stop attacks on American soil by foreign nationals. It places the onus on the countries involved to provide us with information we need to determine that visa applicants from those countries are not a \u201csecurity or public-safety threat\u201d. Its key provisions include the following: \n  \nNationals of countries, which upon notification of information we need, do not cooperate within 60 days will, with few diplomatic exceptions be, barred entry. Uniform screening standards for all immigration programs will be put in force. The totally corrupted Refugee Resettlement Program in which religiously denominated NGOs (the shells of their original organizations which received funds to flak for more open borders) will be suspended for 120 days. When the suspension period is over, refugee claims will be re-prioritized to give preference to \u201cIndividuals on the basis of religious-based persecution, provided that the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual\u2019s country of nationality\u201d. States and localities \u201cwill be granted a role in the process of determining the placement or re settlement in their jurisdiction \u201c of alien refugees, The \u201dcompletion and implementation of a biometric entry-exit tracking systems for all travelers to the US\u201d will (at long last) be expedited. The Visa Interview Waiver program is suspended. All applicants not covered by specific statutory exceptions, must undergo an in-person interview. We will collect and report the number of foreign nationals charged with, convicted of, or removed because of terrorism-related offenses here. \n  Obama banned Iraq refugees in 2011 ,   and the determination of to which countries the travel suspension now applies was made by Obama\u2019s Department of State which, by the way, did not include Saudi Arabia on the listing.  \nThe Democrats, bureaucrats, and terrorists imagined that they could beset us all without consequences -- they should have heeded Hosea\u2019s warning.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Reaping the Whirlwind","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"American Thinker","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169801596","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1400"},"name":"American Thinker","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.americanthinker.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://donsurber.blogspot.com/2017/01/the-instapresident.html","http://dailycaller.com/2017/01/27/gop-plan-to-use-filibuster-proof-resolutions-to-wipe-out-obama-era-coal-regs/#ixzz4WzzG93ds","http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/11/trump-and-next-congress-could-quickly-erase-scores-major-regulations","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2014/10/24/could-non-citizens-decide-the-november-election/?utm_term=.ef6e7ff242ef","http://www.dailywire.com/news/12760/flashback-wapo-publishes-study-claims-millions-john-nolte#.WIi1GAwcxJw.twitter","http://projects.iq.harvard.edu/cces/home","https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/obama-legacy/?tid=a_inl","http://dailysignal.com/2016/11/28/more-than-800000-noncitizens-could-have-voted-in-2016-election-experts-say/","http://www.pewtrusts.org/~/media/legacy/uploadedfiles/pcs_assets/2012/pewupgradingvoterregistrationpdf.pdf","https://theconservativetreehouse.com/2017/01/26/catherine-engelbrecht-voter-fraud-is-institutionalized-heres-how/","https://oversight.house.gov/release/new-irs-e-mails-lois-lerner-funneled-elijah-cummings-info-targeted-conservative-group/","http://hotair.com/archives/2016/11/07/video-obama-encouraging-illegal-immigrants-vote/","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDc8PVCvfKs","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/10/19/two-democratic-operatives-lose-jobs-after-james-okeefe-sting/?utm_term=.5f2215c2f1ba","http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/10/20/white-house-dodges-details-robert-creamer-visits/","http://downtrend.com/71superb/rep-keith-ellison-fights-for-illegal-alien-right-to-vote","http://www.nationalreview.com/article/431676/obama-administration-enabling-noncitizen-voting","http://www.investors.com/politics/editorials/illegals-did-vote-in-november-and-trump-is-right-to-investigate/","https://spectator.org/the-women-movements-embrace-of-psychopath-donna-hylton/","http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/444274/watch-march-organizer-complains-about-22-states-opposing-sharia-law","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3yesvvYEvs","http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/article/2613124How","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/27/us/politics/refugee-muslim-executive-order-trump.html","http://http://thefederalist.com/2015/11/18/the-obama-administration-stopped-processing-iraq-refugee-requests-for-6-months-in-2011/"],"sequenceId":"695199286104","language":"English","adultLanguage":"true","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:50:24Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It should be seen as an opportunity to highlight all the hard work you have done in a year. There should be enthusiasm and zest. It is your decision to treat as a pleasure or pressure. Those who treat it as a pleasure will gain and those who treat it as pressure will repent. \n\u201cMy view is that examination is a celebration. Take it as if it is a festival. And when there is a festival or celebration, then the best comes out of us. We feel the society\u2019s strength during celebrations. Whatever is the best comes out\u2026 Smile more to score more,\u201d he said. \nHe gave the example of discipline seen among masses in \u2018kumbh\u2019 fair even though it is generally felt that there is a lot of indiscipline among people. \u201cThis is the strength of celebration.\u201d \nDuring examination, there should be a festive atmosphere among students, families and neighbours and it will convert this pressure into pleasure. \nHe also asked people to put examination in perspective and not treat it as \u201ca question of life and death or as a test of life but merely of the study students have put in during the year\u201d. \nHe urged students not to chase marks but gain knowledge. \n\u201cOnly studying for marks will lead to shortcuts and one will limit himself or herself. It is important to study for knowledge. Marks and marksheetd have a limited use. Knowledge, skill, self-confidence and commitment will be of use to you during life,\u201d Modi said. \nHe have the example of late President A P J Abdul Kalam\u2019s failure in an air force recruitment examination and said had he accepted it as a defeat, then India would not have got such a great scientist and President. \nHe also asked students to desist from resorting to shortcuts and cheating to score more. \n\u201cTo cheat is to be cheap. It makes you a bad person. If you form a habit of cheating, there will be no desire to learn. Trying to cheat involves one\u2019s time to find ways. Use it for better purposes. People have told you often but I am saying again \u2014 do not cheat. Even if no one catches you, you know that you have cheated in exams,\u201d he said. \n(AGENCIES) \n     Share this:   Download Daily Excelsior Apps Now:  \n\n Share With    Tweet","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Education news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Smile more to score more: PM to students, parents ahead of exam season","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Daily Excelsior.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"373505182","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"17"},"name":"Daily Excelsior.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://dailyexcelsior.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://excelsiornews.com/","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dailyexcelsior","https://itunes.apple.com/in/app/daily-excelsior/id1073026978","https://twitter.com/share"],"sequenceId":"695199287656","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:43:09Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:50:26Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.dailyexcelsior.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/pm-modi-7592-759x198.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Haskell is survived by his wife, Patricia Moore; his stepchildren, Kenneth and wife Mary Steger, Christopher and wife Carey Steger, and Kathryn P. Brisart; and stepgrandchildren, Jennifer, Stacey, James and Campbell. He is also survived by siblings, Geraldine Reeder, Robbie and husband Larry Terry, Elaine and husband Frank Bell and Ron Moore, as well as numerous nieces and nephews. He was preceded in death by his parents, Robbie and Arthur Moore; siblings, Harold Moore, Sally Douglas, Aline Adcock and Ruth Moore; and stepgranddaughter, Kristen Steger. \n \nA native of eastern Oklahoma, Haskell (lovingly referred to as \"Hack\") graduated from Spiro High School in 1951, and attended Northeastern State University in Tahlequah. He left college to play baseball in Modesto, Calif., eventually joining a farm team for the Cincinnati Reds. Following a two year stint in semi-pro baseball, Haskell joined the United States Navy, where he served honorably for six years. During his time in the Navy, he continued to play baseball and taught English in addition to his other duties. Following military service, Haskell engaged in various business pursuits, eventually relocating to Houston, Texas, where he stayed for 21 years. It was during that time that he met and married his wife of 39 years, Patricia. \n \nIn 1996, Haskell and Patricia retired to Waveland, Miss., to live near the beach. They enjoyed nine wonderful years there and viewed it as one of the happiest times of their lives. Their retirement was interrupted in 2005 when Hurricane Katrina demolished their home. Having experienced one hurricane too many, they relocated to Fort Smith. \n \nHaskell was known to all as a kind and gracious man, quick with a joke and generous with his laughter. For a time, he parlayed these traits into a part-time job as an auctioneer \u2014 something he enjoyed immensely. He had a gentle spirit, and would pull his car over to rescue a lost animal or stop on the sidewalk to help a stranger. Love and kindness are the qualities that most epitomized his life. The world is a poorer place without his generous spirit. \n \nHaskell's family expresses special appreciation to the skilled professionals of Peachtree Hospice who provided loving care to Haskell as he transitioned from this life to the next. \n \nTo honor Haskell's wishes, a private memorial service is planned for the spring in Waveland, Miss. \n \nArrangements are under the direction of Edwards Funeral Home.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Obituaries","group":"Society"}],"title":"Haskell Moore","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Sebastian","zipCode":"72901","state":"Arkansas","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Fort Smith","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Southwest Times Record","feed":{"genre":"Obituaries","tags":[],"id":"169667438","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"154"},"name":"Southwest Times Record","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.swtimes.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199287827","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:50:26Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

He added that many of them wanted to mount an official protest. \n \nLabour-led Derby City Council wants to introduce the new system, which would see powers taken away from councillors and put into the hands of council officers, using a points-based system based on previous convictions, from June 30. \n \nIt will cost almost £140,000 to pay for five additional staff to run the system, which is meant to be self-funding and intended to stop rogue taxi drivers operating in Derby. \n READ MORE: How shock £138,500 for more staff could drive up taxi fees and fares  \nAccording to officers, \"any additional costs the council may incur in introducing some or all of the proposals, will need to be met by the trade\". \n \nThis has caused members of the council's licensing committee to question the new system and Mr Quayum said they are right to be concerned. \n \nHe said: \"Taxi drivers are having to work all hours now \u2013 sometimes up to 15 a day to make a decent living. But the extra cost of increased fees because of a new system they do not want will be the final straw for many of them. \n \n\"Others who do not want to pay the extra will go elsewhere to get licences, where there isn't a points-based system, ensuring that the council is powerless to stop rogue taxi drivers in Derby.\" \n \n\n \nThere are 1,300 drivers licensed with the city council but estimates suggest that there are around 2,800 working in the area, not licensed in Derby. \n \nMr Quayman said: \"The legislation only says that a taxi driver has to be a 'fit and proper person' to hold a licence. Those two things can be checked using a DBS (disclosure and barring check) and a medical. \n \n\"Two things will happen if this comes into force. One, taxi fares will go up from around £3.80 a mile to £5 and two, a possible 500 drivers will go elsewhere meaning that licence fees and fares could be even higher because the new system has been costed based on the current 1,300 licensed drivers.\" \n READ MORE: The new points-based system gets Derby City Council go-ahead last November  \nOne of the new posts would be £52,000 to pay for a lawyer because it was anticipated that the number of appeals against licence refusal would increase and have to go before magistrates to be defended. They said this had happened in Leicester, which has a similar system, leading to a 350% increase in appeals, according to council officers. \n \nThe points system was developed following a damning report stating failings in Derby City Council's taxi licensing system . Expert auditors found that the authority's taxi licensing sub-committee had allowed licences for people with criminal records who had committed offences including \"hate crime, harassment, intimidation and making improper comments to young women\". \n \nIn one instance, a taxi driver was granted a licence despite \"publishing material threatening or intending to stir up religious/sexual hatred\". In the new points-based system, criminal convictions for the most severe crimes including rape and murder will trigger an automatic lifetime disqualification. \n \n\n \nOther lesser crimes will accrue points on a sliding scale. Assault of a police officer, for example, would mean instant refusal for an applicant if it happened less than four years ago. But it would mean six points if committed five years ago, then five points for six years ago, four for seven years ago, and so on. \n \nAny applicant or existing driver who gets \"above 12 points\" would be disqualified. An alternative change would have seen council officers operate committees similar to the ones currently run by councillors. \n READ MORE: Tory pledge to reverse new system if they gain power on Derby City Council  \nMr Quayum added: \"We have polled our members and increasingly, it seems they want to take action and protest against the system. Many taxi drivers are very resentful but are suffering in silence.\" \n \nTory councillor Mick Barker said: \"It is now obvious that the extra costs, which will be passed on to the taxi trade, will raise serious concerns to drivers and operators alike and potentially cause them to register in cheaper authority areas - leaving Derby with limited control over taxi services.\" \n \n\"We are in danger of pushing drivers too far in demanding extra exacting standards and extortionate fees which will lead them to seek registration elsewhere. That being the case, it undermines the ability of the city council to administer standards on both vehicles and drivers, which is to the detriment of our public that both we and the taxi trade serves.\" \n OTHER NEWS: See what the late Derbyshire-born actor John Hurt had to say about Derby","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"England news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Derby taxi fares could rise by almost a third if new licensing...","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","county":"Derbyshire","zipCode":"DE1","state":"England","countryCode":"GB","zipArea":"Derby","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Derby Telegraph","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659128","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Derby Telegraph","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk","publisher":"Local World"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/derby-taxi-fares-could-rise-by-almost-a-third-if-new-licensing-system-adopted/story-30092499-detail/story.html#comments","http://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/taxi-drivers-hit-fine-dropping-fares-bus-stops/story-28862483-detail/story.html","http://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/st-george-s-day-celebrations-and-mad-hatters-tea-room-discussed-at-lively-derby-city-council-meeting/story-30088314-detail/story.html","http://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/shock-138-500-cost-of-new-derby-taxi-licensing-system-could-force-up-fees-and-fares/story-30077270-detail/story.html","http://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/points-based-system-to-clamp-down-on-rogue-taxi-drivers-approved-in-derby/story-29929866-detail/story.html","http://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/half-of-derby-s-taxi-drivers-are-registered-elsewhere/story-29745345-detail/story.html","http://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/councillor-pledges-to-reverse-any-changes-to-taxi-licensing-if-tories-are-voted-into-power-in-derby/story-29829169-detail/story.html","http://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/mickbarker","http://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/sir-john-hurt-the-wonderful-things-the-derbyshire-born-actor-has-said-about-derby/story-30093476-detail/story.html"],"sequenceId":"695199299480","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:50:34Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/images/localworld/ugc-images/276250/Article/images/30092499/15825081-thumb.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

So, in 2013 Roseleaf Café, behind Dubai Garden Centre, became the first venue for Freshly Ground Sounds. \n\nThe inaugural event went down well with folk, and Izzy was invited for a repeat show the following week. \n\nSlowly the numbers started growing and Freshly Ground Sounds moved to a park big enough to accommodate 200 people. More than 15 local acts started showing interest in joining the line-up for the events. \n\n\"The idea to form this creative initiative was to bring together a local community that enjoyed playing or listening to local music,\" explained Izzy, founder and creative director of The Freshly Ground Sounds. We speak to the Izzy to know more.\n\nTo develop a sustainable community for local independent music and the creative arts, contributing to the creative economy of the UAE. It's a social enterprise.\n\nThe local music scene in the UAE is what you make of it. Freshly managed to start with one guitar in a cafe and grew through the support of the local community and business. The support is there and it's important to remember the wider context of how far the scene has come in such a short space of time. As musicians develop and begin to compare the music scenes of Seattle, Melbourne and East London to Dubai, it's natural to get frustrated when such comparisons are made. Dubai should be compared with other cities the same age and for its age and transient nature, the UAE's music scene is great. It's a small community, but it's passionate. \n\nAll genres. We've had everything from gypsy folk, Iraqi hip hop, indie pop, classic rock, rap to ethereal electro. Anything goes. Freshly encourages creativity and variety. \n\nAt the moment we have 11 members. Izzy is the creative director and overall strategy. Eliot is the general manager, managing local relationships and day-to-day operations and looks after our new creative arm, Freshly Pressed DXB. The other nine members support us in all our ventures. We also have a videographer, a commercial fixer, a photographer, an artist liaison manager and a sound engineer. There is no hierarchy in Team Freshly and everyone does whatever they find fun. That's part of the charm of being part of the Freshly team. \n\nFreshly is run by part-time volunteers, each with different backgrounds and full-time jobs. It is self-sustaining through sponsorship from local brands and venues and by the community. In 2016, Freshly Ground Sounds launched a new creative arm, Freshly Pressed DXB, which generates revenue through creative consultancy services that grew in demand as the Freshly Ground Sounds brand identity grew. \n\nFreshly does not have a \"best\" gig, each community event is unique to us. In the way we curate and theme it. However, one gig that stands out for everyone is the one in December 2013. It was a cold Tuesday evening in Safa Park and members of local television stations and newspapers came down to cover the event because it was new and unique to the UAE at that time. From about 40 people initially, the gig had a total turnover of more than 200 people. \n\nWe don't really have a dream stage. We achieved some major milestones in the UAE including various awards, and government support. If a talent that began on Freshly's stage gained large-scale international recognition and became a full-time musician, then that would be fantastic for us.Any UAE-based musician can join Freshly, at any level. We (Freshly) find a place for them at their various community or local gigs and if they are semi-professional, we work to book them for commercial gigs and venues. Anyone with enthusiasm and interest in local live music can join Freshly. There is no audition process and a Facebook or Soundcloud page for your band is not a pre-requisite. It is open to everyone. Once a musician joins Freshly, an e-mail is sent to them a few weeks before each gig with details of how to play at the event. \n\nTo sign up go to www.freshlygroundsounds.com/play-with-us\n\nUsually you can expect to see two events per month, but there's no fixed schedule or venues - it keeps on changing from time to time. Freshly also pops-up at other events. People can find out about our concerts through social media channels and the press.

Kennedy International Airport on Friday night and was detained for about five hours. \n\nTrump's order signed on Friday upended the travel plans of people without U.S. citizenship who were arriving in the United States from those seven countries, including Syria, Iran and Sudan, causing confusion and sparking protests at airports as immigrants and refugees were stranded. \n\nElamin said she had been in Sudan for academic research and boarded a plane on Friday morning. After presenting her U.S. green card, a designation of legal permanent residence, at JFK, she said she was questioned, patted down and handcuffed. \n\n\"It was an uncomfortable pat down, they touched my breast area and my groin area,\" Elamin said in a phone interview. \"Then I got handcuffed and I just started crying.\" \n\nElamin said the handcuffs were soon removed and it appeared authorities were using them to escort people between areas of the airport. \n\nElamin was released, but she worried about leaving the country again and about her parents in Sudan, whom she hoped one day to help immigrate to America. \n\n\"It scares me that I'm not able to see them if I want to,\" said Elamin, who lives in New Jersey. \n\nTrump's executive order means legal permanent residents who have passports from the seven countries have to be cleared back into the United States on a case-by-case basis, a senior U.S. administration official told reporters. \n\nThe Department of Homeland Security, which overseas entry at airports, in a statement later said it will \"treat all of those we encounter humanely and with professionalism.\" \n\nThe executive order also upended the plans of some people planning to leave the United States. \n\nShirana Navabha, 57, a U.S. citizen originally from Iran, said she was scheduled to fly to Iran on Sunday, but will not go after Tehran said it would stop U.S. citizens entering the country in retaliation to Trump's action. \n\n\"I told everybody that I'm coming, everyone was so excited and now I'm not going, it's just frustrating,\" Navabha, who lives in Dallas, said by phone. \n\n(Reporting by Alex Dobuzinskis in Los Angeles; Editing by Stephen Coates)","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sudan news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Africa news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"North Africa news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Education news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"'I got handcuffed and just started crying' - Sudanese student describes U.S. detention","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"GB","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"Yahoo!

Kennedy Airport, where 12 refugees were detained Saturday. Celebrities including \"Sex and the City\" actress Cynthia Nixon joined the demonstration. \"What Donald Trump did in the last 24 hours is disgusting, disgraceful and completely un-American and I'm here in protest,\" said protester Pamela French. The agency that runs the airport tried to restore order by shutting down the train that runs to airport terminals. Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, reversed that decision, saying people had a right to protest. \"The people of New York will have their voices heard,\" he said in a statement. \n \n___ \n \nNEWARK, NEW JERSEY \n \nMore than 120 people clutching signs denouncing the Trump immigration orders gathered at Newark Liberty International Airport. NorthJersey.com reports that they joined lawyers who'd rushed to the airport to defend the rights of refugees and immigrants who were being detained and denied entry. \n \n___ \n \nFAIRFAX, VIRGINIA \n \nDozens of protesters inside Washington Dulles International Airport chanted \"Love, Not Hate, Makes America Great\" and \"Say It Loud, Say it Clear, Muslims Are Welcome Here,\" as travelers walked through a terminal to a baggage claim area to collect luggage and greet their loved ones. There was a heavy police presence during the peaceful protest. Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe said during a press conference at Dulles that he has asked Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring to look into \"all legal remedies\" available to help individuals who may be detained in Virginia. \n \n___ \n \nDENVER \n \nDozens of people converged on Denver International to show their support for refugees. Standing in the main terminal Saturday, they sang \"Refugees are welcome here.\" Some held signs declaring their identity, such as Jew or Christian, and the phrase \"I come in peace.\" Denver has some direct international flights but it wasn't clear whether anyone has been detained under the president's executive order. \n \n___ \n \nCHICAGO \n \nA crowd of demonstrators held a rally at O'Hare International Airport. The Chicago Sun-Times reports protesters blocked vehicle traffic to O'Hare's international terminal for a time. The newspaper says some arriving travelers joined the protest, while others were upset by the demonstrations. \n \nLawyers working with the International Refugee Assistance Project tell the Chicago Tribune that 17 people who had been detained at O'Hare all released by late Saturday. \n \nAmong those released before the federal judge's order was Hessan Noorian, a suburban Park Ridge resident returning with his family from Iran, the Tribune reported. \n \nNoorian, who is of British and Iranian citizenship and has a green card, was detained at O'Hare after he and his wife, Zahra Amirisefat, a U.S. citizen, arrived from Tehran, the newspaper said. \n \nThe couple, who told the Tribune that they work at a community college in the Chicago area, said they were questioned for five hours. \n \nAfter Noorian was released, his wife told the Tribune: \"I can't believe something like this can happen to someone with a green card.\" \n \n__ \n \nDALLAS \n \nProtesters who gathered at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport Saturday evening voiced their displeasure with Trump's executive order. The crowd of a few dozen ballooned into hundreds of demonstrators who frequently chanted \"Set them free!\" At times, cheers erupted from the crowd as those who were detained got released. \n \nAmong those still held at the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport at midnight Saturday was a 70-year-old Iranian widow, Shahin Hassanpour, whose son said she suffers from high blood pressure and had breast cancer surgery four years ago. She obtained an immigrant visa in November on her son's petition. \n \nBahzad Honarjou, a 43-year-old network engineer, said he spoke twice to his mother by phone after her 9 a.m. arrival, but that they hadn't talked since courts stayed the executive order, meaning she should have been released. \n \nHundreds of protesters stood in the waiting area and chanted \"This is what democracy looks like.\" \n \nImmigration agents were not being very communicative, Honarjou said. \n \n\"They were like a machine when I talked to them today,\" he said. His mother only speaks a few words of English and a fellow passenger was translating for her from her native Farsi as no immigration agents spoke the language, he said. \n \nHassanpour was originally going to be deported on a Sunday flight, she informed her son the first time they spoke. \n \n\"She was about to cry,\" he said. \"She is not able to take (tolerate) a 20-hour flight back to Iran.\" \n \nHonarjou said he is a U.S. citizen, obtained entry in a lottery, and has been in the country for seven years. Why did he come? \n \n\"To have a better life and to make more money,\" he said. \"And, you know, for the freedom.\" \n \n___ \n \nSEATTLE \n \nAbout 1,000 protesters gathered at Seattle-Tacoma Airport, sitting down in the concourse with a large American flag reading \"We are America.\" Aayah Khalaf, a Muslim American, was sitting at home watching the protest on television when she and her friend studying from Egypt decided to join the rally. It was her second time joining a protest. The first one was the Women's March. \"It's not just against Muslims. It against environmental rights and human rights overall. I think everybody has to stand up against this,\" said Khalaf, 29. \n \n___ \n \nPORTLAND, OREGON \n \nA protest by several dozen people in and around Portland International Airport briefly disrupted light rail service at the airport. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports that the demonstrators carried signs and chanted \"Say it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here\" and \"No ban no wall America is for us all.\" \n \n___ \n \nLOS ANGELES \n \nAbout 300 people expressed their displeasure with the ban at Los Angeles International Airport Saturday night. Protesters entered the airport's Tom Bradley International Terminal after holding a candlelight vigil. \n \nAvriel Epps held a candle and a large photo a drowned 3-year-old Syrian boy who washed up on a Turkish beach in 2015 and became a haunting symbol of the Syrian refugee crisis. \n \n___ \n \nSAN FRANCISCO \n \nHundreds of protesters blocked the street outside at San Francisco International Airport's international terminal to express their opposition to the barring of some people from Muslim-majority nations. \n \n___ \n \nSAN DIEGO \n \nAs motorists honked their support, demonstrators outside San Diego International Airport chanted \"No hate, no fear, everyone is welcome here.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Airline industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Political unrest news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Protests erupt at airports following Trump travel ban","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Orange","zipCode":"32801","state":"Florida","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Orlando","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WFTV","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657701","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"277"},"name":"WFTV","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wftv.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199312531","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:50:39Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It will be a case seeing double for teachers at Linton Primary School and Ballarat North Primary School when two sets of twins embark on their first day at school this week. \n\nThey will be joining the hundreds of children from across Victoria, pulling on their school uniforms and heading into classrooms for the first time.\n\nBut for Linton mother Kelly Dishot, the milestone is all the more special. \n\nHer five-year-old fraternal twin boys, Liam and Rhys, were both diagnosed as being on the autism spectrum when they were two. \n\n\u201cFor us, it\u2019s a huge milestone,\u201d Ms Dishot said. \u201cWe were always really proactive about getting them a lot of assistance early on to get to the point where they could go to a mainstream school with support in place for them throughout their schooling.\u201d \n\nThe boys will start at Linton Primary School on Tuesday. \n\nMs Dishort said six of the seven preps starting at the tight-knit primary school had attended kindergarten together.\n\n\u201cThe other children already have a big acceptance of the boys and their differences already,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s also really great because it has educated the other children who have gone to kindergarten with Liam and Rhys from a young age, that all children are different, and not everybody is the same.\u201d\n\nMs Dishort said she wanted to send her boys to Linton Primary School because of its inclusiveness and the and the strong educational support system the school has in place.\n\nAnd, if the boys were feeling a little apprehensive on their first day, their older sister Tara will be there who is starting grade two at the school, will be right there beside them. \n\nBallarat father David Willison is expecting the house will be a a lot quieter without his five-year-old twin daughters Ella and Jade.

In its centenary year the Ballarat RSL is more confident than ever that it will last the test of time and continue to play a vital role in community relations. When the group first formed 100 years ago it was a place for returned servicemen to meet up and confide in each other. \n\nNow the group plays a vital role connecting returned service men and women and their families with support services and pensions available through the Department of Veteran Affairs.\n\nThe branch\u2019s current and first female president Alexandra Tascas said reaching a centenary was critical \u2013 particularly when many other branches were struggling to survive. \n\nShe said it was a tribute to the willingness of the branch and its members to remain involved in the community and to broaden its direction and focus. \n\n\u201cThe significance (of the celebration) is that for 100 years we have been a constant RSL with continued service to the community which is only getting stronger,\u201d Ms Tascas said.\n\nThe branch will move from its home of six years, The George, to the Midlands Gold Club in June this year once it\u2019s new rooms have been built. \n\nThe unanimous decision was made largely because of an aging population and the golf club\u2019s better parking facilities. \n\n\u201cThe role of the RSL is to look after service men and service women and those that been in the services including the Army, Navy and Airforce,\u201d Ms Tascas said.\n\nBut the branch\u2019s role is ever evolving.\n\nIt uses funds raised from its Anzac Day and Remembrance Day collections tom employ a welfare officer to help returned service people transition back into civilian life. Ms Tascas said it can be difficult to return to society and some veterans suffer Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. \n\n\u201cThe officers can help with pensions and access to services. That\u2019s our main work to make sure we support those that have served,\u201d Ms Tascas said. \n\n\u201cWe have to change, and we are stronger than ever.\u201d \n\n\u201cBut we also do things for the community. For the first time we paid for and support two children from lower socio-economic backgrounds to attend a camp in Portsea.\u201d \n\nThey loved every moment of the camp and the branch hopes to continue to send more children to the camp. \n\n\u201cWe have to engage with the community and it\u2019s really good as they can ask us what we can do for them.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Olivia Shying"},"topics":[{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"RSL still relevant century forward","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"3350","state":"Victoria","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Ballarat","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Ballarat Courier","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169666253","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"67"},"name":"Ballarat Courier","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.thecourier.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199320720","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T04:36:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:50:41Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/NZXMGVFj5Cp6uxrm5dGesD/a5e9b111-e539-46c1-b8aa-63ad0fd42aa9.jpg/r0_257_4716_2922_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"},{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/NZXMGVFj5Cp6uxrm5dGesD/a5e9b111-e539-46c1-b8aa-63ad0fd42aa9.jpg/r0_261_4716_2918_w600_h338_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

That was in large part because of a contract dispute with his former promoter \u2013 Bob Arum \u2013 that caused Garcia to sit for 21/2 years.\n\nGarcia, 29, came back in July and defeated Elio Rojas via fifth-round TKO. But, at least on paper, he figured to be in deeper waters against Zlaticanin, who, like Garcia came in undefeated.\n\nBut this was a blowout. After dominating the first two rounds but not hurting Zlaticanin, Garcia knocked Zlaticanin cold in the third round at 2:21. The final punch in the flurry was a vicious right hand that sent Zlaticanin crashing to the canvas. It followed a brutal right uppercut that hurt Zlaticanin. Related: Garcia (36-0, 30 knockouts), who grew up in Oxnard and trains in Riverside, has now won world titles in three weight classes. He previously won championships at featherweight and super featherweight.\n\n\u201cI think it was a great performance,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cI fought smart, I controlled the distance.\u201d\n\nGarcia described what took place after he landed the uppercut that wobbled Zlaticanin.\n\n\"When he turned back to look at me, I knew he was hurt and I came with the overhand right,\" Garcia said.\n\nZlaticanin (18-1) came in as Montenegro's only world champion in history. He was on the canvas for several minutes before being helped to his feet.\n\nThe bout was contested on the undercard for the featherweight title fight between Leo Santa Cruz and champion Carl Frampton at MGM Grand.\n\nGarcia's brother and trainer, Robert Garcia, said he believes his brother will fight for another five years. He said it will take that kind of time for him to realize all of his goals.\n\n\"He wants to get 135, 140 and 147,\" Robert Garcia said in the days leading to Saturday's fight. He was referring to titles in the lightweight, junior welterweight and welterweight divisions. If it comes to fruition, that would be championships in five weight classes.\n\nAlso, Jerry Perez of Harbor City made his pro debut a successful one when he stopped Javier Cepeda (0-4) of Roswell, N.M., at 2:54 of the first round of their featherweight bout that was scheduled for four rounds.\n\nLedaun Barthelemy Cuba is now 12-0 after he won a six-round unanimous decision over Jesus Aguinaga (5-5-1) of Phoenix in the junior lightweight division.

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 26 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Sebastian","zipCode":"72904","state":"Arkansas","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Fort Smith","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"4029 TV","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659416","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"195"},"name":"4029 TV","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.4029tv.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199328064","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:50:46Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

I offered up an essay I wrote about Grant Wood, about how the interpretation of his work shifts as people change the way they see the Midwest. The woman said, \u201cI don\u2019t know why you had to make it political. Rural America is not political. People don\u2019t think.

It\u2019s also made me impatient with broad brush strokes and flattened explanations of the behavior of strangers. \n   \nThat woman\u2019s comment rang in my head. My hackles didn\u2019t go down. I know there\u2019s a lot more words to be written and spoken about us, about this place. 2017 is the mea culpa tour as journalists and authors and pollsters strain to hear what they couldn\u2019t hear before the election. And there\u2019s something to admire in that, in self-examination. But my defenses are up and if those words are going to go out, I want to contribute. \n   \n Get news headlines sent daily to your inbox  \n   \nFor a while, I want to use this my editor\u2019s column differently, and I need your help. I want to write about what people believe and how they got there and how it continues to evolve. I\u2019m looking for people willing to let me in to their lives and their thoughts, so we can explore ideas together \u2013 in the moment and in this column. I\u2019m not quite sure what shape or direction this will take, but I\u2019d like to try it, with your input and, most likely, a little patience. \n   \nIf you want to be part of a column, or if you have a suggestion of someone who might be willing, send me an email or give me a call. I look forward to hearing from you.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Phillips: What they don't know about us","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Scott","zipCode":"52801","state":"Iowa","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Davenport","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"QC Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169762840","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1558"},"name":"QC Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.qctimes.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199328386","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:50:47Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

All four of their Super Bowl victories have come since the 2001 season with that venerable coach-quarterback pair, with this their seventh appearance together. \n \nThen there are the Atlanta Falcons, still seeking their first Vince Lombardi Trophy after 51 years. \n \nThough this pairing of teams with such disparate title-game histories is striking, it's not exactly uncommon. Here's a look back at some of the other memorable championship matchups involving trophy-case inequity in major sports: \n \nYANKEES PROWESS: Less than two months after the terrorist attacks knocked down the World Trade Center towers, the New York Yankees had the country behind them for once during the 2001 World Series as emotional renditions of \"God Bless America\" stirred fans and players alike. Having won four of the previous five World Series, bringing their all-time total to 26 of what's now 27 titles, the Yankees faced a Diamondbacks team in its mere fourth season of existence, let alone lacking a championship. Arizona's purple and teal uniforms clashed with the navy pinstripes donned by the Yankees for decades. The games in Phoenix were played under a retractable roof in an airplane-hangar-like ballpark with a swimming pool behind center field instead of the hallowed monuments looming there at Yankee Stadium. \n \nThe Diamondbacks proved they belonged between the lines, though, with Randy Johnson and Curt Schilling comprising a dominant duo of starting pitchers that kept Yankees stars Derek Jeter, Tino Martinez and Bernie Williams quiet at the plate. In a Game 7 for the ages, Luis Gonzalez drove in the winning run in the bottom of the ninth inning with a single off often-unhittable closer Mariano Rivera. \n \nSO CLOSE: Duke, every bit the villain the Yankees have usually been, had no such national support in the 2010 NCAA basketball championship game. Not only were coach Mike Krzyzewski and the Blue Devils approaching their fourth of five titles, but they were playing lovable underdog Butler. \n \nThe Final Four that year was in Indianapolis, too, just a few miles away from where the Bulldogs play. Though Butler's Hinkle Fieldhouse has a rich history, the Bulldogs don't have the cachet Duke carries. One of the all-time upsets nearly happened when Gordon Hayward's heave from half court hit the backboard and the front rim before bouncing out at the buzzer to give the Blue Devils a 61-59 victory. \n \nSTEELY RESOLVE: No team has won more Super Bowls than the Pittsburgh Steelers with six titles in the 50-year history of the event. Few franchises have been around for so long with so little accolade as the Arizona Cardinals, who date back to St. Louis and Chicago. \n \nThe Cardinals nearly pulled off a championship stunner following a 2008 season during which their 9-7 record was good enough to win a weak division. The Steelers led 20-7 midway through the fourth quarter in Tampa, Florida, before a pair of touchdown passes from Kurt Warner to Larry Fitzgerald sandwiched around a safety put the Cardinals in front. But Ben Roethlisberger deftly drove the Steelers for the go-ahead score on a throw to Santonio Holmes with 35 seconds left. The 16-point rally by the Cardinals would've been the biggest comeback in Super Bowl history. \n \nFOREVER YOUNG: Sometimes the result on the field mirrors the imbalance in historical success. The San Francisco 49ers became the first team to win a fifth Super Bowl, when they blew out the San Diego Chargers 49-26 to close the 1994-95 season in superior fashion. \n \nSteve Young threw six touchdown passes, still a Super Bowl record. He found Jerry Rice for a 44-yard score just three plays into the game against a Chargers team making its only Super Bowl appearance. \n \nWORTH MENTIONING: Pittsburgh Penguins beat San Jose Sharks in 2016 Stanley Cup finals. North Carolina beats Illinois in 2005 NCAA basketball championship game. Los Angeles Lakers beat Indiana Pacers in 2000 NBA finals. St. Louis Cardinals beat Milwaukee Brewers in 1982 World Series. \n \n___ \n \nFor more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: NFL - Arizona Cardinals news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: MLB - St Louis Cardinals news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: NFL - Atlanta Falcons news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: NFL - Pittsburgh Steelers news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: MLB - New York Yankees news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: NFL - New England Patriots news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Patriots-Falcons, the latest case of trophy inequity","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Maui","zipCode":"96761","state":"Hawaii","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Lahaina","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Lahainanews.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"192828365","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Lahainanews.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Sports"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.lahainanews.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.pro32.ap.org/","http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL"],"sequenceId":"695199329173","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:50:47Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Not that there's anything wrong with that. \n \nAs a franchise, MAD Greens got its start in Colorado back in 2004. It has since expanded to Arizona, Texas and Utah. The Lehi restaurant, which opened its doors last month, is the first Utah location. A second, in Farmington, is due to debut in early October. \n \nWe popped into MAD Greens late on a Thursday night. We were a bit worried about cutting our visit a little close to closing, but the staff couldn't have been more helpful and friendly, with one server even going out of his way to let us know that we could take as long as we needed to finish up. \n \nAs previously mentioned, MAD Greens specializes in out-of-this-world salads, wraps and sandwiches. These are not run-of-the-mill ingredient combinations either, but a wide and interesting range of options that left me mentally going back and forth between multiple choices because they all appeared so intriguing. A sign on the wall even boasted that MAD Greens makes use of 21 salad dressings, 25 different ingredients and 11 herbs and spices. Some tough choices indeed. \n \nOrders are placed at a front counter, with your salads prepared in front of you as you make your way down the line. One thing that hung me up in choosing a salad was that each one comes with a pre-chosen signature dressing on the menu. Many salad combinations looked great to me, only to be paired with a dressing that maybe would not have been of my choosing. However, I was informed at the counter that you can indeed select any dressing you want with any salad. Dilemma averted. \n \nSalads can be selected in the medium or large size, with a $1 difference between them -- and it should be noted that these are definitely bountiful serving sizes. \n \nI was momentarily thrown for a loop when, as my salad was nearly ready, a server asked me, \"Light, medium or heavy?\" My first thought was, \"That's a little bit personal of a question, isn't it?\" However, the realization soon hit that I was merely being asked my preference for the amount of dressing to be mixed into my salad. \n \nThe restaurant has a variety of seating options available depending on the size of your group, with tables, booths, a bar and also an outdoor pavilion with many tables that are shared by other restaurants in the immediate vicinity. \n \nMy selection of the Ty Cobb salad might have been a subconscious ode to my love of baseball, the fact that I was leaving town the next morning for an out-of-state softball tournament or simply because the combination of ingredients most caught my fancy. No matter the reason, it was a home run in my book. The ingredients included Romaine lettuce, grilled Southwestern chicken, avocado, bacon, red onions, eggs and tomatoes. The suggested dressing was blue cheese, but I swapped that out for honey mustard. \n \nAnother member of our party opted for the MAD Caesar salad, which came with Romaine lettuce, slow-roasted chicken, Parmesan cheese, tomatoes, house-made croutons and Caesar dressing. It was also delicious. \n \nOther salads were provocatively named and creatively combined with mouth-watering ingredient mixes. Some of our favorite names included the Siam I Am, Edgar Allan Poe, Dionysis, Mad Molly Brown, Butch Cassidy, Don Quixote and the Crazy Ivan. There were several additional options as well. We look forward to sampling some of these others on future visits. \n \nTwo of our other favorite samplings included Albert E's BLT in the MAD Wraps category, and the Annie Oakley panini sandwich. The Albert E wrap featured slow-roasted chicken, bacon, Romaine lettuce, tomatoes and a ranch dressing. The Annie Oakley includes slow-roasted chicken, avocado, bacon, Swiss cheese and ranch dressing. Both were outstanding. \n \nMAD Greens also boasts a series of seven MAD Juice creations. We tried two of them -- the Bright Buzz (apple, banana, bee pollen, carrot, pineapple and lime) and the Wake Up (carrot, orange, ginger, apple and lime). They were both interesting and tasty in their own way. \n \nIn summary, you don't have to be mad as a hatter to eat at MAD Greens, but it helps if you can embrace your inner crazy.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Restaurant industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"8 locally reviewed restaurants to check out in Lehi","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Utah","zipCode":"84604","state":"Utah","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Provo","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Central Utah Daily Herald","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659389","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1631"},"name":"Central Utah Daily Herald","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Arts","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.heraldextra.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199336955","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T17:30:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:50:50Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/heraldextra.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/d/fa/dfa17983-0dfd-5ac4-a480-d82fcdce3db8/588bb90d0485c.preview.jpg?resize=300%2C199"}],"video":[]}}

As per the media release of the cricket board, Law's appointment becomes effective from February 15 and he has a two-year contract. \n\nHis professional playing career was over a ten-year period where he played in one Test for Australia and 54 one-day-internationals. He had a successful first class tenure with Queensland, Essex, Lancashire and Derbyshire. \n\nHe is touted as the most successful captain in Australia's domestic cricket with five first class and two one day titles and additionally scoring the most runs at that level - 27,080 in 367 matches. Law has the distinction as being named one of five Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1998 and was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia in 2007. \n\nExpressing delight over his appointment, the 48-year-old said, \"I am excited at the opportunity to contribute to what I think is an interesting time for West Indies. I think this assignment has come at an important time of my career.\" \n\nOutgoing Director of West Indies Cricket, Richard Pybus who sat as part of the selection panel said, \"We are delighted to welcome Stuart to West Indies Cricket, he comes at an exciting and critical time in the development of the WI men's team, with the emergence of some outstanding young talent, as seen in the most recent test series against Pakistan. He has great experience and breadth of knowledge as a player and coach and his cross-cultural experience and winning attitude will be key assets in the development of the team. \" \n\nIn a career spanning almost 30 years as a professional coach and player, Law was the batting coach for the Australian men's team to Sri Lanka in 2016. Before that he was part of the coaching staff for Bangladesh Under-19, Queensland Bulls, Brisbane Heat and had stints as high performance coach for Cricket Australia and head coach for Sri Lanka and Bangladesh senior teams. \n\nHe completes the senior technical team headed by newly-appointed director of cricket, Jimmy Adams and chairman of selectors, Courtney Browne.

Vern Buchanan (R-Longboat Key). \n H.R. 646 , or the No Pay Raise for Congress Act, prevents pay raises for Congressional lawmakers if they do not pass a balanced budget for the current fiscal year.  \nThe legislation is currently awaiting action by the U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. Text of the bill is not yet available. Its summary reads: \"To provide that rates of pay for Members of Congress shall not be adjusted under section 601(a)(2) of the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 in the year following any fiscal year in which outlays of the United States exceeded receipts of the United States.\" \n \nIn a statement, Buchanan said, \"Successful businesses do not reward an employee who fails to do their job. This same common sense must be used in Washington. Members of Congress should not be eligible for pay raises if they cannot fulfill one of their most basic responsibilities.\" \n \nBuchanan also cited the looming $20 trillion number of the federal debt, calling its continued growth \"downright immoral\" on the part of lawmakers. \n \n\"Forty-nine states, including Florida, are required by law to balance the budget. In Florida, passing a balanced budget is priority number one for the state legislature. Washington should not be held to a different standard,\" Buchanan also said in his statement.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"US politics news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US Federal Government news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Bill to Ban Congressional Pay Raises Introduced by Rep.

The Sundance Film Festival is everything film buffs want: 10 days of pure movie heaven, with American and international filmmakers, Q&As and bragging rights that you saw the Oscar nominees, like, a whole year ago. \n \nEvery year, press from New York and industry players from Los Angeles flock to Park City, Utah. Be careful what you say in public, because you just might be sitting next to the cinematographer whose movie you thought was out of focus. Bidding wars for the most coveted films get heated, with multimillion-dollar rights contracts as the result. And the price tags seem to keep going up \u2014 last year, Birth of a Nation broke records with a $17.5 million deal. This year, The Big Sick sold early, at $12.5 million. Not bad for a comedy. \n \nMost people, though, don\u2019t get to see the glory of Sundance, so here\u2019s the lowdown: \n \nDuring the year, Park City is much like any other ski town. The mountains, which are everywhere you turn, are top-notch, and resorts drive much of the economy. But during Sundance , the mountains are pretty quiet \u2014 hotels and Airbnbs are booked solid with moviegoers, not skiers. We asked one group of locals clutching snowboards if they hate this week. Their reply? \u201cYes, sometimes.\u201d Uber rides can set you back $40 for a mile-long drive, so thank God for the bus that runs a theater loop for free. (Dear Mr. Kalanick, Uber co-founder, can you please let the people watch movies without surge!) \n  \nThe best part about the festival is its informality. There\u2019s no stuckupitude whatsoever. \n  \nThe biggest films premiere at Eccles Theatre, a venue that seats more than a thousand. Massive bidding wars for rights sometimes take place immediately after industry people have watched a movie there. Pro tip: Want to know which Sundance films are likely to be Oscar contenders the following year? Look at the schedule and how many times a film screens at Eccles. If it\u2019s shown multiple times, odds are it\u2019ll be big. Let\u2019s call this \u201cThe Eccles Rule.\u201d This year? Hellooo, Mudbound and The Big Sick. \n\n \nThe name \u201cEccles Theatre\u201d may sound grandiose \u2014 perhaps even foreign, or plucked from history \u2014 but the theater itself is attached to a high school, so it\u2019s basically an upscale auditorium. Similarly, the \u201cMARC\u201d in MARC Theatre stands for \u201cMunicipal Athletic & Recreation Center.\u201d Not very Hollywood. But really, what\u2019d you expect? How many ski towns do you know of that can accommodate nearly 50,000 moviegoers (according to last year\u2019s estimates) over the span of 10 days using only traditional movie theaters? The best part about the festival is its informality. There\u2019s no stuckupitude whatsoever. \n \nSo if you do snag a ticket or credentials (green means press; purple means industry; red means you paid for total access, no ticket required, you moneybags, you), stay warm, and may the ticketing be ever in your favor.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Libby Coleman"},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: fine arts news","group":"Entertainment"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"}],"title":"The Insider's Guide to Sundance","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"OneOzy.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"499773332","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"OneOzy.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://one.ozy.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199358641","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:50:58Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://pictures.ozy.com/pictures/738x554/9/6/8/102968_screenshot20170127at2.43.56pm.png"}],"video":[]}}

which came undone quickly during a recession, will take time to put together again. \n \nHouseholds continue to embrace thrift even as the ruble tests new highs and inflation at the slowest in history strengthens purchasing power. \n \nWhile unemployment unexpectedly declined in December and real wages surged more than estimated for their fifth monthly gain, retail sales plunged 5.9 percent from a year earlier, the Federal Statistics Service said recently. Their decline for a record 24th month was worse than all but one forecast in a Bloomberg survey of 13 economists, whose median was for a drop of 3.7 percent. \n \nWith the economy on the cusp of recovery after its longest recession in two decades, consumers are reluctant to spend. \n \n\"People are still in crisis deleveraging mode and are acting thrifty, so any additional income isn't spent,\" said Vladimir Osakovskiy, chief economist for Russia at Bank of America in Moscow. \"This supports deposit generation, but at the same time constrains spending.\" \n \nConsumer spending, the main driver of Russia's economic expansion in the past decade, is still so brittle because broader economic gains aren't translating into improvements for the millions of people who bore the brunt of the recession. \n \n\"An increase in poverty is causing a divergence between relatively positive income and unemployment figures and consumption patterns,\" said Natalia Orlova, chief economist at Alfa Bank in Moscow. \n \nReal disposable incomes fell the most in four months, shrinking 6.1 percent in December from a year earlier, according to the statistics service. The median estimate in a Bloomberg poll of nine economists was for a drop of 5.1 percent. \n \nA poll published early last week by the Higher School of Economics showed the financial situation worsened for 39 percent of respondents in the past 12 months and improved for only 9 percent. When asked about the future, 23 percent believe their personal welfare will deteriorate in the coming year, with 11 percent expecting it to get better. \n \n\"The population has already adapted to the new reality: in other words, tightened the belt by cutting spending as much possible,\" Georgy Ostapkovich, head of the Institute for Statistical Studies and Economics of Knowledge that conducted the study, said. \n \nThe savings rate, at 10 percent of disposable incomes in January-November, remains at almost double the ratio in 2008. Still, it has fallen from 14.3 percent in 2015, with the central bank mentioning a decrease in the propensity to save as a threat for its 4 percent inflation target this year. \n \nThe average maximum deposit rate offered by the country's 10 biggest holders of savings fell to 8.29 percent as of Jan. 20, the lowest level since February 2014, according to the central bank. \n \nTo encourage savers, the central bank plans to hold interest rates above inflation. Besides keeping down price pressures, the Bank of Russia is counting on the policy to help transform deposits into investment and ensure healthy growth for the economy. It left the benchmark rate at 10 percent in December, while price growth slowed to 5.4 percent from a year earlier. \n \n\"Consumers became much more cautious and rational,\" said Vladimir Miklashevsky, senior strategist at Danske Bank in Helsinki. \"We don't expect a quick recovery in retail sales as cautiousness will remain, along with a high sensitivity of consumers to prices.\" \n \nSundayMonday Business on 01/29/2","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"OLGA TANAS BLOOMBERG NEWS"},"topics":[{"name":"Russia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Russian consumers holding back","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Harris","zipCode":"77023","state":"Texas","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Houston","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Arkansas Online","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169675615","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"6070"},"name":"Arkansas Online","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.arkansasonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199367145","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:45:27Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:51:00Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://media.arkansasonline.com/img/photos/2017/01/27/resized_99261-305964593_1-5_78-22506.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Bevin then added another in stoppage time as Wanderers chased an equaliser themselves. \n \nIn Wellington, Canterbury United made light work of the Wellington Phoenix reserves, winning 4-1 with a pair of goals in each half - the first two to Stephen Hoyle and the second two coming courtesy of the opposition and Andre de Jong, who was left to run his side's midfield in the absence of Aaron Clapham and the suspended Gary Ogilvie. Ruairi Cahill-Fleury scored his side's consolation effort in the second half, 10 minutes from time. \n \nHawke's Bay United were also missing key men - coach Brett Angell and midfielder Cory Chettleburgh - due to suspension, but shrugged that off to beat Tasman United 3-2 in Palmerston North, a result that has left six teams separated by just four points at the top of the table. \n \nSam Mason-Smith scored a brace for Hawke's Bay in 17 minutes, either side of a response from Tasman's Tinashe Marowa. Saul Halpin than put the Bay 3-1 up in the 20th minute, following up his penalty attempt that was saved, and while Marowa pulled one back in the 52nd minute, Tasman couldn't find another. \n \nAuckland City and Eastern Suburbs are the other two teams that make up the top four as things stand, three points behind the leading pair, with Canterbury and Hawke's Bay a point behind them. \n \nMost teams have five games remaining, spread over seven weekends, while Wanderers and Southern each have six, and Auckland City seven. \n \nAuckland City and Southern United didn't play this weekend, with their fixture postponed due to Auckland's involvement in the Nike Lunar New Year Cup, where they beat Korean champions FC Seoul on Saturday night to qualify for the final on Tuesday. \n \nAT A GLANCE \n \nStirling Sports Premiership, Rd 13 \n \nWaitakere United 1 (Stansfield)  drew with Eastern Suburbs 1 (Lovemore ) \nHT: 0-1 \n \nWellington Phoenix reserves 1 (Cahill-Fleury)  lost to Canterbury United 4 (Hoyle 2, de Jong, OG) \nHT: 0-2 \n \nHamilton Wanderers 2 (Gunemba, Scott)  lost to Team Wellington 4 (Bevin 2, Margetts, Moretti) \nHT: 0-1 \n \nHawke's Bay United 3 (Mason-Smith 2, Halpin)  Tasman United 2 (Marowa 2) \nHT: 3-1 \n \nPoints: Team Wellington 24; Waitakere United 24; Auckland City 21; Eastern Suburbs 21; Canterbury United 20; Hawke's Bay United 20; Wellington Phoenix reserves 16; Hamilton Wanderers 12; Southern United 10; Tasman United 7 \n \n ","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"ANDREW VOERMAN"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: soccer news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Waitakere United rescue a draw against Eastern Suburbs but slip from the top","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"NZ","country":"New Zealand"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Dominion Post","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169672420","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1076"},"name":"Dominion Post","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://stuff.co.nz"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199367413","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:21:01Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:51:00Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

A constituency that has more bark than bite, more meow than scratch, if you will. \n \nPetCoach's goal is to become the go-to source for pet care. \n \n\"At the end of the day, I want to transform the pet-health industry,\" said Brock Weatherup, chief executive officer and co-founder of PetCoach, himself an impressive breed of serial entrepreneur. \n \nRight now, the company, based in suburban Philadelphia, operates PetCoach.co, a technology and health-care platform attracting 150,000 visitors and 13,000 questions a month and growing. The site offers personalized answers to questions, articles and educational information, and access to experts, including veterinarians, pet nutritionists and trainers. The philosophy behind the business model is that getting more pet owners to ask more questions will lead to healthier happier, and preferably longer lives for pets -- and more confident owners. \n \nLaunched in 2014, PetCoach was bought by Weatherup in July from founder David Martin, a native of Madrid, now a resident of the Philadelphia region, who continues with the company as chief digital officer, one of 10 employees. They met through a mutual contact when PetCoach was enrolled in a DreamIt accelerator in Austin, Texas, and Weatherup was CEO of Pet360 and mentoring a DreamIt company in Philadelphia. \n \nWhen PetCoach left DreamIt, Weatherup recruited it, giving it office space and valuable insight on the pet industry. At the time, PetCoach's strength was technology. \n \nThey're a long way from knowing whether PetCoach will become the kind of blockbuster endeavor Weatherup's last one became -- a rebranding and scaling that led to the sale of Pet360.com to PetSmart for $160 million in fall 2014. \n \nIn November, PetCoach announced that it had raised $2 million in seed funding, led by Comcast Ventures, a private venture-capital affiliate of Comcast Corp. Maveron, a consumer-only venture-capital firm based in Seattle and San Francisco, also put up money, along with DreamIt Ventures. \n \n\"I was surprised and frankly humbled by their response,\" said Weatherup, 45. \"I've raised money around ideas when there was a highly defined business with lots of metrics, like Pet360. In this case, it was more theory around an idea. I've never done that.\" \n \nThough there are a variety of online sites offering information on pets and pet-related services, such as mobile vets and equipment enabling vets to consult with customers via phone and internet, nobody was bringing it all together or providing customized answers to questions. Growth potential is especially strong for exotics: birds, reptiles, rodents, rabbits. \n \n\"If you're not involved across the board, you don't own the trust of the consumer,\" said Weatherup, who also is president of Philly Startup Leaders, a support group for early-stage companies. \n \nIn funding such young businesses, the selling point for investors is often \"about the team, secondarily about the market,\" said Sam Landman, managing director at Comcast Ventures. He identified Weatherup as a primary reason for his firm's investment, the amount of which he would not reveal as a matter of policy. \n \n\"I've been building a relationship with Brock six or seven years, and I've come to believe he's an extraordinary entrepreneur by any standard -- New York, Silicon Valley, certainly a special entrepreneur in the Philadelphia region,\" Landman said. \n \nWeatherup's pet-industry expertise was a big draw, too, Landman said, calling it \"a very large market that has not evolved significantly over the many decades I have been a pet owner. Not only is it a very large market, but I think the experience for the pet owner and the pet is suboptimal.\" \n \nLandman said his 8-year-old golden retriever, Jackson, has \"gone to the vet enough times he knows he doesn't like it. And so, to the extent you could deliver excellent care in the home, not only is it less stressful for the pet, it's also less stressful and more convenient for the pet owner.\" \n \nBeing a source for in-home care is among the additional services PetCoach plans to provide. Weatherup did not want to reveal other considerations, but made a point of saying vets should not feel threatened by PetCoach. Getting pet owners to ask more questions will drive more people to seek a vet's help, he maintains. PetCoach.co offers help in finding vets. \n \n\"I think the veterinary community is split on whether telemedicine is a good thing or not,\" said Len Donato, a veterinarian at Radnor Veterinary Hospital who has been in practice 20 years. \"I do not feel threatened by it. This would only augment what I'm doing.\" \n \nHe doesn't expect it to reduce the times he treats Weatherup's 5-year-old English retriever, Boulder. \n \n\"I don't typically hear from Brock,\" Donato said. \"His sister is a veterinarian. He just texts her, probably.\" \n \nWeatherup said he also calls. \n \nSundayMonday Business on 01/29/2","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"DIANE MASTRULL THE PHILADELPHIA INQUIRER"},"topics":[{"name":"Consumer: pets news","group":"Lifestyle"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"},{"name":"Entrepreneur news","group":"Business"}],"title":"Startup entrepreneur's firm offers information on pet care","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Harris","zipCode":"77023","state":"Texas","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Houston","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Arkansas Online","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169675615","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"6070"},"name":"Arkansas Online","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.arkansasonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199370465","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:46:18Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:51:00Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

That's something you've got to get through, the first 10-15 overs are crucial. With the line-up that we play, if we can have wickets in the shed at the back end then we will score a lot of runs at the end of the (innings).\" \n \nThe keeper found out the perils of taking on Eden Park's small boundaries when he played at the ground for the first time last February, caught at cow corner trying to heave Corey Anderson over the ropes. \n \nThe Australians were all out for 148 on that occasion, with the Black Caps' seamers running riot on the way to a 2-1 series win. It was a similar story a year earlier, with the Aussies skittled for 151 in a World Cup clash that the Kiwis only won by a wicket. \n \nAt the same time, Eden Park's unusual dimensions have resulted in big scores before. Although the tourists failed to pass 150 last time around, New Zealand posted a score of 8-307 in the same game. \n \nIndeed, before Australia's innings that day, seven of the last eight innings at the ground had gone past 280 runs. \n \n\"(The Eden Park pitch) just has a bit in it,\" New Zealand veteran Ross Taylor said. \"I don't think there is a par score, some wickets here are 300, some are 200. \n \n\"You just have to analyse it as quickly as possible, whether you're batting or bowling.\" \n \nThe Kiwis were trounced 3-0 in Australia when the sides met in December, but Wade is expecting a tougher time on New Zealand's turf. \n \n\"We played them in Australia (on) big grounds (with) long boundaries. It's a completely different ball game,\" he said. \n \n\"(On) the smaller grounds (in New Zealand) they'll still play aggressive; they're still going to be able to hit plenty of fours and sixes at grounds that they play at. \n \n\"They play well here (in NZ) and they play this venue very well. \n \n\"We like to think we're hard to beat in Australia and it's the same when we come here - we expect a hard challenge over the next three games but we've got a young squad and we're excited to go out and really have a crack at it.\" \n \nCaptaining the side for the first time, Wade maintains his job is simply to continue the fine work of the leadership duo of Steve Smith and vice-captain David Warner. \n \n\"I don't think for me personally it's about putting a stamp on the team,\" he said. \"It's about driving the values and the game plan that we have in one-day cricket moving forward. \n \n\"Steven and David have put their stamp on the team, it's just about me keeping on driving those key messages through to the players. \n \n\"We've performed really well in one-day cricket over a long period of time so it's not about trying to change too much - it's about keeping the ball rolling.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"New Zealand news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Aussies wary of Black Caps on home turf","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"AU","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Central Telegraph","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"606907284","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Central Telegraph","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.centraltelegraph.com.au"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199370640","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T00:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:51:00Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

technology could revolutionise trade\u2014making it cheaper, quicker, and simpler for businesses to trade internationally. \n \nFrom letters of credit to bills of lading, merchandise trade today is heavily reliant on paper documents. In our digital, connected world, there is a growing need to modernise trade\u2019s many paper-based processes. Digitisation would reduce bureaucracy, improve security, minimise errors, and make it easier to amend documents, ultimately saving time and money. \n \nDozens of financial services organisations are exploring how blockchain\u2014which records transactions in blocks and then forms chains of permanent data\u2014could be applied to trade as well other key processes. Each time someone enters a new transaction, a \u201cblock\u201d of information is added to a \u201cchain\u201d of existing data. Other people within the network can see the information in the database and verify new transactions as they come in. This creates a permanent, chronological record of each transaction. Technical progress has been rapid. And over the past year, there have been a series of announcements from organisations demonstrating how blockchain technology could, in theory, be used. \n \nHSBC, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, and the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore, for example, have published a proof of concept showing how blockchain technology could be applied to letters of credit. More than $2tn of trade currently depends on the physical exchange of letters of credit, which are issued by banks and used by importers and exporters to reduce the risk of trading with each other and give suppliers certainty over payment. \n \nIn November, HSBC and Reliance Industries completed the first electronic exchange of letters of credit in India. In fast-growing countries such as India, where non-tariff barriers, such as paperwork requirements, represent a potential drag on trade, a switch to online technologies could help to reduce delays, cost, and uncertainty. \n \nBut there are other areas of trade that could also benefit from adopting blockchain technology. It could, for example, be used to digitise bills of lading, the documentation that details what cargo is aboard and where goods or commodities are being shipped. \n \nTesting the theory behind blockchain is one thing, but the real work is in creating a scalable, legally compliant platform that exporters and importers want to use. There are significant hurdles to clear in terms of the legal and regulatory environment\u2014trade may be global but each country has its own laws and regulations so getting policymakers onboard is essential. It will also require significant investment. \n \nWithin three to five years, however, we believe it would be possible to use blockchain technology on a \u201cclosed network\u201d basis\u2014whereby transactions are visible only to registered participants, including buyers and sellers. But this can only happen if there is collaboration on a global scale. \n \nBanks and others must continue to talk to each other as they experiment and test ideas. At the same time, companies involved in trade also need to engage in the process, outlining how blockchain technology can work for them. It is only by working together that we will create a platform that all those involved in trade want to use, from banks, exporters, and shippers to regulators and lawmakers. \n \nInnovation in banking is about understanding what customers want and need and using new technology to deliver it to them. Trade needs to find a 21 st century answer to an age-old problem. Blockchain could provide at least part of the solution. \n \nWhat is blockchain? \n \nA blockchain is a type of distributed ledger, an electronic database that continuously records and verifies blocks of information in a digital format. Each time someone enters a new transaction, a \u201cblock\u201d of information is added to a \u201cchain\u201d of existing data. Other people within the network can see the information in the database and verify new transactions as they come in. This creates a permanent, chronological record of each transaction. \n \nThe post appeared first on Daily News Egypt .","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Vivek Ramachandran , gobal head of trade products at HSBC"},"topics":[],"title":"Blockchain can pull trade into the digital age","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Northern Africa","countryCode":"EG","country":"Egypt"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Daily News Egypt","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169698171","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"11"},"name":"Daily News Egypt","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/author/v-ramachandran/","http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2017/01/29/blockchain-can-pull-trade-digital-age/","http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/"],"sequenceId":"695199380737","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:30:33Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:51:02Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/app/uploads/2017/01/5-4-3-e1485609987279-200x200.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US.

Dimitroff\u2019s first NFL job was on the Cleveland Browns\u2019 grounds crew when his father was a scout and Belichick was the coach. \n \nDimitroff climbed the ranks before spending five years as the Patriots\u2019 director of college scouting under Belichick. \n \nNow Belichick and the Patriots stand in the way of the Falcons\u2019 attempt to win their first Super Bowl. \n \nIt\u2019s a challenge Dimitroff said he relishes. \n \n\u201cThis is kind of a dream game that way, to be able to go against the Patriots and against one of my mentors in this league,\u201d Dimitroff said. \n \nDimitroff\u2019s respect for his former boss is obvious. He says New England is where he learned the most important lessons that prepared him for the opportunity in Atlanta. \n \n\u201cI learned a lot from my father and from different places I was at, of course, but it wasn\u2019t until I got to the Patriots that I truly realized the idea at the core of the team concept,\u201d he said. \n \n\u201cI mean, I grew up hearing it all the time, but actually being put into effect there in New England, I\u2019ll take that with me forever.\u201d \n \nThe Falcons retained Dimitroff when hiring coach Dan Quinn in 2015. The two formed a management partnership that produced Atlanta\u2019s second Super Bowl berth, perhaps faster than either could have predicted. \n \nThough Quinn was given ultimate control of player personnel decisions, the two appear comfortable sharing authority with no apparent sign of friction. Dimitroff calls their relationship a \u201cpartnership.\u201d \n \nThe coach and GM often are seen in warm embraces on the field after games, and Dimitroff says they talk 10 or more times during a day \u201con so many levels from policy to acquisitions to how we\u2019re going to replace lights in this (indoor practice) facility.\u201d \n \nDimitroff says Quinn is \u201ca general manager\u2019s dream to be with.\u201d Quinn has started four rookies and four second-year players on defense this season. \n \nThe success of the young players, including rookies Keanu Neal, Dion Jones, De\u2019Vondre Campbell and Brian Poole, is the best reward for a general manager and his scouts. \n \n\u201cI mean, he has all kinds of nerve to go into this season and start four rookie defensive players,\u201d Dimitroff said. \u201cTo me, that\u2019s amazing. I\u2019ve had countless personnel men call me and ... laud Dan for that. That\u2019s what personnel men want, that\u2019s what general managers want.\u201d \n \nQuinn was willing to commit to the rookies because of their speed and athleticism. That\u2019s the Falcons\u2019 new image, according to Belichick. \n \n\u201cI\u2019d say the stamp on the team, the thing that I would notice the most is just the speed, the team speed that the Falcons have,\u201d Belichick said. \u201cThey have a lot of fast guys. Defensively they close up space very quickly.\u201d \n \nQuinn said when he interviewed with Atlanta he was looking for \u201ca general manager who together we could share the whole vision of what a team could be.\u201d \n \nDimitroff\u2019s vision bears the imprint of his time under Belichick. The Patriots\u2019 influence also comes from Falcons assistant GM Scott Pioli, the former New England GM. \n \nDimitroff signed a three-year extension on Nov. 7 that carries through the 2019 season. \n \nBelichick said he remembers the young Dimitroff in Cleveland \u201cworking in the organization when he was coming out of high school and into college.\u201d \n \n\u201cBut he\u2019s a football guy, so it\u2019s in the family,\u201d Belichick said. \u201cHe works hard. He knows the game. He did a real good job for us with skill players, defensive backs, receivers, linebackers, running backs, things like that.\u201d \n \nThe Super Bowl will provide Dimitroff his ultimate test to prove he learned his lessons well under Belichick and taken them to a new level with Quinn. \n \n\u201cA lot of things that I brought to the table were learned in New England,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just been fun watching us develop here over the years. \n \n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely a northeastern stamp on it in certain ways, and yet we\u2019ve really evolved into something that is very much the Falcons and not, obviously, the Patriots.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: NFL - Atlanta Falcons news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: NFL - New England Patriots news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: American football news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: NFL news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Super Bowl: Falcons' GM hopes to beat former employer","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Indiana","zipCode":"15701","state":"Pennsylvania","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Indiana","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Indiana Gazette","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"172621035","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"16"},"name":"Indiana Gazette","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.indianagazette.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199394542","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:50:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:51:06Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

And swift action if it was a player who actually placed a bet. \n \nPaul Hornung and Alex Karras each were suspended for the 1963 season for gambling on NFL games. When the league suspended Art Schlichter in 1983, then-commissioner Pete Rozelle said the quarterback would not be reinstated \u201cuntil the league can be solidly assured that the serious violations of cardinal NFL rules he has committed will not be repeated.\u201d \n \nBut slowly over the decades, the league has pulled back on how far it will go to enforce those \u201ccardinal NFL rules.\u201d And earlier this month, one of the last lines was crossed: The Raiders announced plans to move to Las Vegas, the epicenter of the action, where more than $130 million could be wagered on next weekend\u2019s Super Bowl. \n \nIf the NFL approves the move, the Raiders\u2019 new stadium could literally be walking distance from a few of the city\u2019s dozens of sports books. \n \n\u201cWe\u2019re a gambling nation now,\u201d said Orin Starn, a Duke professor who studies sports in society. \u201cIt used to be, 40 years ago, if you wanted to gamble or get a quick divorce, you had to go to Las Vegas. In the old days, it would\u2019ve been crossing a red line for the NFL to bring a team to Las Vegas. I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s true anymore.\u201d \n \nThe bottom-line explanation for this move speaks as much about priorities in Vegas as in the NFL: It\u2019s about cold, hard cash. The new stadium will be funded by $750 million from the county, another $650 million from either billionaire Sheldon Adelson or another investor and the remaining $500 million from the Raiders and the league. \n \nThat amount of public money makes it a fantastic deal in the current economic climate for new stadiums. Given the more lucrative terms than either a move to Los Angeles or staying put in Oakland would present, the Raiders and the league are pressing forward. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell explained the league\u2019s still-awkward do-si-do with gambling in an interview on Fox Sports Radio . \n \n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen the changes in the culture around the country in gambling,\u201d Goodell said. \n \n\u201cWe\u2019re obviously very sensitive to that, but we\u2019re also going to evaluate the Raiders case on the relocation application in what\u2019s in the overall best interests of the league. But one thing we can\u2019t ever do is compromise on the game.\u201d \n \nAnd yet, there\u2019s evidence that the league has been compromising for years. The NFL has long been America\u2019s most popular sport to bet on. \n \nInjury reports, which help set the point spreads that drive so much interest in the league, have been league-mandated for decades \u2014 an attempt to keep as much information in the hands of the public and not simply for backroom bettors and bookies who could use that information to their advantage. \n \nFantasy football, which the NFL has tacitly endorsed through sponsorship deals with individual teams and media groups that televise its games, is viewed in some legal circles as gambling. \n \nThat thought has become more prevalent over the past 36 months with the influx of daily games, in which players put up money to assemble new teams every week. \n \nIn 2003, the NFL was so sensitive about gambling that it refused to take a Super Bowl ad touting Las Vegas. The league eased up on that in 2009, although commercials that depicted gaming were still prohibited. \n \nAt the core of the ease-up is the growing sense that NFL players, with seven-figure salaries, have become far less susceptible to bribes from people trying to fix games, which is ultimately what the league fears. \n \n\u201cI think their shield is that they have enough confidence in player compliance to where Las Vegas is not a threat to the integrity of their game anymore,\u201d said Billy Hawkins, who teaches a course in sports governance at University of Houston, not far from where this year\u2019s Super Bowl will be played. \n \nNBA commissioner Adam Silver has spoken to the realities of modern-day gambling \u2014 it happens across the globe, online and in person, not just at the betting windows in Las Vegas \u2014 saying \u201cit should be legal, it should be regulated, it should be transparent.\u201d \n \nThe NFL, at least by what it says, is not there quite yet. \n \nBut how it acts? \n \nWhen the Raiders moving van backs into that new stadium in the shadow of the Strip, it will mark as sure a sign as ever that the league doesn\u2019t view gambling as the threat it once was. \n \n\u201cThe NFL and people broadcasting the NFL are recognizing that gambling is part of the game,\u201d Starn said. \u201cIt\u2019s also a little difficult for them to get on a high moral horse about Las Vegas when it\u2019s so obvious that so much interest in the NFL is driven by gambling and fantasy football.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: American football news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: NFL news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"NFL: Views toward gambling have eased up","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Indiana","zipCode":"15701","state":"Pennsylvania","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Indiana","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Indiana Gazette","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"172621035","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"16"},"name":"Indiana Gazette","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.indianagazette.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199394711","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:50:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:51:06Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

With Coach Smith, we had five in a row. A great credit to him.\u201d \n \nBlank, of course, was the one who fired Smith after back-to-back losing seasons. He was replaced by Dan Quinn, who has received widespread acclaim \u2014 and rightly so \u2014 for guiding the Falcons to their second Super Bowl. \n \nSmith, meanwhile, awaits another head coaching chance that may or may not come. \n \nAfter being dumped by Falcons in 2014, he sat out a year before returning this season as Tampa Bay\u2019s defensive coordinator. After the Bucs went 9-7, just missing out on the playoffs. Smith was a candidate for Jacksonville\u2019s head coaching job. He was beaten out by interim coach Doug Marrone, whose record is not nearly as impressive as Smith career mark of 66-46. \n \nThe other vacancies were filled by young assistants with no real head coaching experience \u2014 most notably, 31-year-old Sean McVay to the Los Angeles Rams, perhaps signaling a new generation that has left the 57-year-old Smith behind. \n \n\u201cI think he\u2019ll get another opportunity, I really do,\u201d Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan said. \u201cHe showcased what he can do here for seven years, and he\u2019s done a great job at Tampa.\u201d \n \nThrough the Bucs, Smith turned down any interview requests about his time with the Falcons. But, before the first of two regular-season meetings between the division rivals, he expressed no bitterness about the way things ended. In fact, he seemed to relish the chance to work again as an assistant. \n \n\u201cI sleep better at night,\u201d he said. \n \nEven though there\u2019s been a huge turnover on the Falcons roster the last two years, it\u2019s worth remembering where Atlanta was when Smith was hired in 2008. \n \nThe team was coming off one of the most horrific seasons in its 51-year history, and that\u2019s saying something. Star quarterback Michael Vick was sent to prison for running a dogfighting ring. Coach Bobby Petrino abandoned the team only 13 games into his tenure. The Falcons staggered to a 4-12 finish and seemingly faced a rebuilding job that would take years to complete. \n \nInstead, with Thomas Dimitroff coming aboard as general manager and Smith in his first head coaching job after a career spent largely as an overlooked assistant, the Falcons turned things around quicker than anyone could\u2019ve imagined. They went 11-5 and claimed a wild-card berth. \n \nIt helped to land Ryan, another franchise quarterback, with their first draft pick. But he was far from the player he would become, so Smith relied heavily on Michael Turner and a bruising ground game. Smith also brought a fire the team was desperately lacking, best epitomized by at least two sideline confrontations with opposing players. \n \nWhile Atlanta didn\u2019t make the playoffs the next year, it might\u2019ve been an even better coaching job by Smith. When Ryan missed two games with an injury and the Falcons dropped out of postseason contention, it would\u2019ve been easy for the team to pack it in. Yet they won their final three games to finish 9-7. \n \nIt was the first time the team ever had consecutive winning seasons. \n \n\u201cHe\u2019s a helluva coach,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cI really, really loved playing for him.\u201d \n \nThe best years were still to come. A 13-3 mark and a division championship in 2010. A repeat of that in 2012, when the Falcons finally won a playoff game and hosted the NFC championship against the San Francisco 49ers. \n \nTurns out, that was the summit of Smith\u2019s tenure in Atlanta. \n \nThe 49ers rallied from 17 points down for a 28-24 victory, stopping the Falcons\u2019 final chance at the 10-yard line. \n \n\u201cWe were close with Smitty here,\u201d said star receiver Julio Jones, another holdover from the previous regime. \u201cHe instilled that mentality in us of working hard and going hard.\u201d \n \nUnfortunately for Smith, they didn\u2019t come anywhere close his final two seasons. \n \nPoor drafts and wasted free-agent signings \u2014 largely Dimitroff\u2019s responsibility \u2014 finally caught up with the team, especially on the offensive and defensive lines. Smith made some horrible clock-management decisions that turned wins into losses. He was already on a bit of a short leash, regarded as a coach who turned timid in the big games, resulting in only one victory in four playoff appearances. \n \nFrom Super Bowl contender, the Falcons plummeted to 4-12 in 2013. The team showed only marginal improvement the next year, going 6-10. \n \n\u201cWe decided for a variety of reasons after two very difficult years for the franchise, and for him personally, that long-term it was the right time to make a change,\u201d Blank said. \n \nNo one is questioning that decision now. \n \nQuinn has done a magnificent job. \n \nBut that doesn\u2019t take away what Smith accomplished in Atlanta. \n \nHe deserves a few props. \n \nHe deserves another head coaching job.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: NFL - Atlanta Falcons news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Commentary: Former Falcons coach deserves credit","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Indiana","zipCode":"15701","state":"Pennsylvania","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Indiana","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Indiana Gazette","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"172621035","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"16"},"name":"Indiana Gazette","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["National","Geographic","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.indianagazette.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199396221","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:50:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:51:07Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

I mean, I haven\u2019t played in a final for a number of years, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s something you forget,\u201d she said. \u201cI mean, I played a good amount of them, so experience was right there for me.\u201d \n \nWhen Venus revealed in 2011 that she\u2019d been diagnosed with Sjogren\u2019s syndrome, an autoimmune disease, few expected she\u2019d return to the same dominating presence that saw her win seven Grand Slam titles, including five at her favorite tournament, Wimbledon. Her ranking fell outside the top 100 as she coped with her illness and injuries, and from 2011 to 2014, she only advanced past the third round at a major once. \n \nVenus kept going, though, even as the early-round losses continued to mount and questions about retirement came up time and again. \n \nThose questions are still asked, but she\u2019s become used to brushing them aside. And her recent career renaissance \u2014 she\u2019ll rise to No. 11 in the rankings next week \u2014 suggests she\u2019ll continue to be a force in the sport for however long she wants to play. \n \n\u201cI feel motivated to continue, to continue to go out there and hit the ball the way I know I can,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s only things I can improve on, to be honest, and to build on.\u201d \n \nSerena is making history, but Venus is setting her own marks these days, too. Her gap of 14 years in between appearances in the Australian Open final (2003-2017) smashed the previous record of seven years. \n \nHer 7ﾽ-year break in between Grand Slam finals (Wimbledon \u201809-Australian \u201917) also broke the previous record by six months.

All four of their Super Bowl victories have come since the 2001 season with that venerable coach-quarterback pair, with this their seventh appearance together. \n \nThen there are the Atlanta Falcons, still seeking their first Vince Lombardi Trophy after 51 years. \n \nThough this pairing of teams with such disparate title-game histories is striking, it\u2019s not exactly uncommon. Here\u2019s a look back at some of the other memorable championship matchups involving trophy-case inequity in major sports: \n \nSTEELY RESOLVE: No team has won more Super Bowls than the Pittsburgh Steelers with six titles in the 50-year history of the event. Few franchises have been around for so long with so little accolade as the Arizona Cardinals, who date back to St. Louis and Chicago. \n \nThe Cardinals nearly pulled off a championship stunner following a 2008 season during which their 9-7 record was good enough to win a weak division. The Steelers led 20-7 midway through the fourth quarter in Tampa, Florida, before a pair of touchdown passes from Kurt Warner to Larry Fitzgerald sandwiched around a safety put the Cardinals in front. But Ben Roethlisberger deftly drove the Steelers for the go-ahead score on a throw to Santonio Holmes with 35 seconds left. The 16-point rally by the Cardinals would\u2019ve been the biggest comeback in Super Bowl history. \n \nYANKEES PROWESS: Less than two months after the terrorist attacks knocked down the World Trade Center towers, the New York Yankees had the country behind them for once during the 2001 World Series as emotional renditions of \u201cGod Bless America\u201d stirred fans and players alike. Having won four of the previous five World Series, bringing their all-time total to 26 of what\u2019s now 27 titles, the Yankees faced a Diamondbacks team in its mere fourth season of existence, let alone lacking a championship. Arizona\u2019s purple and teal uniforms clashed with the navy pinstripes donned by the Yankees for decades. The games in Phoenix were played under a retractable roof in an airplane-hangar-like ballpark with a swimming pool behind center field instead of the hallowed monuments looming there at Yankee Stadium. \n \nThe Diamondbacks proved they belonged between the lines, though, with Randy Johnson and Curt Schilling comprising a dominant duo of starting pitchers that kept Yankees stars Derek Jeter, Tino Martinez and Bernie Williams quiet at the plate. In a Game 7 for the ages, Luis Gonzalez drove in the winning run in the bottom of the ninth inning with a single off often-unhittable closer Mariano Rivera. \n \nSO CLOSE: Duke, every bit the villain the Yankees have usually been, had no such national support in the 2010 NCAA basketball championship game. Not only were coach Mike Krzyzewski and the Blue Devils approaching their fourth of five titles, but they were playing lovable underdog Butler. \n \nThe Final Four that year was in Indianapolis, too, just a few miles away from where the Bulldogs play. Though Butler\u2019s Hinkle Fieldhouse has a rich history, the Bulldogs don\u2019t have the cachet Duke carries. One of the all-time upsets nearly happened when Gordon Hayward\u2019s heave from half court hit the backboard and the front rim before bouncing out at the buzzer to give the Blue Devils a 61-59 victory. \n \nFOREVER YOUNG: Sometimes the result on the field mirrors the imbalance in historical success. The San Francisco 49ers became the first team to win a fifth Super Bowl, when they blew out the San Diego Chargers 49-26 to close the 1994-95 season in superior fashion. \n \nSteve Young threw six touchdown passes, still a Super Bowl record. He found Jerry Rice for a 44-yard score just three plays into the game against a Chargers team making its only Super Bowl appearance. \n \nWORTH MENTIONING: Pittsburgh Penguins beat San Jose Sharks in 2016 Stanley Cup finals. North Carolina beats Illinois in 2005 NCAA basketball championship game. Los Angeles Lakers beat Indiana Pacers in 2000 NBA finals. St. Louis Cardinals beat Milwaukee Brewers in 1982 World Series.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: NFL - Arizona Cardinals news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: MLB - St Louis Cardinals news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: NFL - Pittsburgh Steelers news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: MLB - New York Yankees news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: NFL - New England Patriots news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: American football news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: NFL news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Super Bowl: Patriots are latest of trophy inequity","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Indiana","zipCode":"15701","state":"Pennsylvania","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Indiana","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Indiana Gazette","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"172621035","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"16"},"name":"Indiana Gazette","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.indianagazette.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199399763","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:50:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:51:07Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Three-point shooting was critical for Kansas (19-2) as it shook off an 0-for-8 first half to make 5 of 11 after halftime, with Jackson\u2019s consecutive 3s starting the rally for the Jayhawks. They shot 59 percent in the second half. \n \nMalik Monk and Derek Willis each had 18 points for Kentucky (17-4), which dropped its second straight. \n \nSYRACUSE 82, NO. 6 FLORIDA STATE 72: Andrew White scored 24 points, John Gillon had 21 points and matched his career high with 11 assists, and Syracuse earned its first victory over a ranked team. \n \nTyler Lydon had 14 points, 11 rebounds and a career-high six blocks for the Orange (13-9, 5-4 Atlantic Coast Conference), who led 44-26 at halftime.

The Bears trailed 50-40 early in the second half, but pushed ahead to take their first lead at 56-54 with 10:25 left after Johnathan Motley made a pair of free throws. \n \nIt was a close game from that point forward. Lecomte hit a decisive 3-pointer with 23 seconds left that made it 78-72 and sent many of the Ole Miss fans to the exits. \n \nSebastian Saiz and freshman Breein Tyree scored 20 points apiece for Ole Miss (12-9). \n \nMIAMI 77, NO. 9 NORTH CAROLINA 62: Freshman Bruce Brown scored a career-high 30 points, and Miami snapped North Carolina\u2019s seven-game win streak. \n \nThe Hurricanes (14-6, 4-4 Atlantic Coast Conference) had success with a swarming zone defense.

They were coming off a 71-51 win against No. 16 Creighton on Wednesday. \n \nKelan Martin scored 22 points for Butler (18-4, 7-3), which lost for the first time in five games. Andrew Chrabascz had 16 points. \n \nGEORGIA TECH 62, NO. 14 NOTRE DAME 60: Josh Okogie made a fast-break layup as time expired, Tadric Jackson had a career-high 25 points and Georgia Tech earned another surprising victory over a ranked opponent. \n \nThe inexperienced Yellow Jackets (13-8, 5-4 Atlantic Coast Conference), in their first year under coach Josh Pastner, already had two wins over top-10 opponents before taking down the Fighting Irish (17-5, 6-3). \n \nNotre Dame\u2019s Matt Farrell went up for a short jumper but missed off the rim with 7 seconds remaining. Jackson grabbed the rebound, tossed the ball to a streaking Okogie, and McCamish Pavilion erupted in cheers. \n \nBen Lammers, the only player on either team to play the entire game, had 15 points and 10 rebounds for Georgia Tech. \n \nV.J.

He was the only player for Wisconsin (18-3, 7-1 Big Ten) to shoot above 50 percent; the Badgers shot 33.3 percent (20 for 60) from the field, including a 3-for-25 performance from 3-point range. \n \nCorey Sanders had 15 points for the Scarlet Knights (12-10, 1-8), who lost for the ninth time in 10 games. \n \nNO. 16 CREIGHTON 83, DePAUL 66: Khyri Thomas scored 18 points and Marcus Foster had 15, leading Creighton to the win at home. \n \nJustin Patton added 14 points as Creighton (19-3, 6-3 Big East) won for the first time in three games since star point guard Maurice Watson Jr. was shelved by a major knee injury. \n \nBilly Garrett Jr. scored 18 points and Brandon Cyrus had 12 for the Blue Demons (8-13, 1-7). \n \nCreighton has won 10 of its last 11 meetings with DePaul, including eight of nine since joining the Big East in 2013. \n \nNO. 17 DUKE 85, WAKE FOREST 83: Luke Kennard hit a 3-pointer with 6.6 seconds left, helping Duke rally for the road win. \n \nKennard finished with 34 points \u2014 one shy of his career high \u2014 and Grayson Allen had 19 for the Blue Devils (16-5, 4-4 Atlantic Coast Conference).

Putin told Trump he \u201csees the U.S. as a most important partner in the fight against international terrorism,\u201d according to a readout of the call from the Kremlin that described the conversation as \u201cpositive and businesslike.\u201d \n   \nThe conversation, one of several Trump held with world leaders on Saturday, was the among the first formal steps in his effort to reset relations with the Kremlin, which soured under the Obama administration after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and its support for Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad in his fight against rebel groups. Trump\u2019s critics have questioned the wisdom of his calls for better ties with Putin, especially in light of the U.S. intelligence community\u2019s conclusion that Russia hacked e-mails of the Democratic National Committee in a bid to swing the November election in Trump\u2019s favor. \n   \nTrump has said he would consider easing financial penalties imposed by the U.S. over the annexation of Crimea in 2014 in exchange for Russia\u2019s support on a nuclear weapons deal or fighting terror groups like the Islamic State. Critics have argued that Russia\u2019s support of Assad has nothing to do with Islamic State fighters based there, pointing to the fact that its air war has focused on rebels around Aleppo not affiliated with the group. \n  \n \u2018Active Joint Efforts\u2019  \n  \nVice President Mike Pence participated in the call with Putin along with senior counselor Stephen Bannon, chief of staff Reince Priebus, national security adviser Michael Flynn and press secretary Sean Spicer. The White House said the call lasted about an hour. \n   \n\u201cIn the course of the conversation, both sides demonstrated a desire for active joint efforts to stabilize and develop Russia-American relations on a constructive, equitable and mutually beneficial basis,\u201d the Kremlin said. \u201cThe importance was underlined of restoring mutually beneficial trade and economic ties between business on both sides.\u201d \n   \nThere was no mention in either readout of the wide-ranging U.S. sanctions targeting Russia\u2019s banking, energy, and defense sectors. Some were imposed via executive order by former President Barack Obama, which Trump has the power to undo quickly. \n   \nTrump downplayed the possibility of sanctions relief during a press conference on Friday, saying, \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens. As far as the sanctions, very early to be talking about that.\u201d \n  \n Climate Accord  \n  \nAlso Saturday, Trump spoke with Japan\u2019s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, French President Francois Hollande, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Hollande said the sanctions on Russia must only be lifted if progress is made on the Minsk agreement aimed at bringing peace to Ukraine, according to his office. \n   \nHe told Trump that \u201cthe defense of democracies requires observing fundamental principles and among these are welcoming refugees,\u201d a criticism of the president\u2019s executive order, signed Friday, that suspended refugee admissions and put a 90-day ban on admissions of immigrants from seven Muslim-majority nations including Iran, Iraq and Syria. \n   \nHollande also warned Trump of the \u201ceconomic and political consequences\u201d of protectionism, according to his office, as the U.S. president looks to renegotiate trade agreements and potentially put a tax on imports. \n  \n NATO Alliance  \n  \nIn the call with Merkel, Trump agreed on the importance of the NATO alliance and the need for allies to contribute their fair share, according to readouts from both sides. The White House said they discussed Ukraine but provided no details; Merkel has previously said she wants Europe to maintain pressure on Russia over Ukraine regardless of what the U.S. decides to do. \n   \nTrump accepted Merkel\u2019s invitation to attend a Group of 20 summit in Hamburg in July, according to the readouts. \n   \nLawmakers on Capitol Hill also warned Trump they would look to act if he rolled back the penalties on Russia. \n  \n \u2018Reckless Course\u2019  \n  \nSenator John McCain, an Arizona Republican, on Friday called on Trump to \u201creject such a reckless course\u201d and remember that Putin is \u201ca murderer and a thug who seeks to undermine American national security interests at every turn.\u201d \n   \n\u201cIf he does not, I will work with my colleagues to codify sanctions against Russia into law,\u201d McCain said. \n   \nThere was no indication that Putin and Trump discussed Russian attempts to interfere in the election. The Obama administration imposed additional sanctions and expelled Russian intelligence officials from the U.S. over alleged interference. As part of a report detailing the Russian effort, both the former and current president also were briefed on an unsubstantiated dossier of salacious personal and business intelligence about Trump allegedly collected by Russian security services. \n   \nTrump has denied the allegations in the dossier, which was subsequently published by the website BuzzFeed, and the Kremlin has said it didn\u2019t spy on the president during his trips to Russia as a private citizen. \n   \nIn his call with Turnbull, Trump vowed to uphold an agreement with Australia to resettle asylum seekers held in Pacific island camps , according to an Australian government official. About 1,600 asylum seekers who tried to reach Australia by boat are being detained on Manus Island and Nauru, with many potentially eligible to be resettled in the U.S. under an agreement reached last year with the Obama administration.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Mobile industry news","group":"Technology"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Russia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Trump, Putin Use First Formal Phone Call To Seek Better Ties","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Bloomberg-Quint","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"608142543","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"8"},"name":"Bloomberg-Quint","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Politics","Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bloombergquint.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-29/trump-said-to-honor-pacific-island-refugee-deal-with-australia"],"sequenceId":"695199405717","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:51:09Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

But plenty did, culminating in a 17-12 loss to Argentina that meant the three-time defending champions finished sixth.\n\nThe World Sevens Series continues in Sydney this weekend and New Zealand co-coach Waldrom is desperate for the change in scenery to also herald a change of fortunes. The team had been fairly chipper after beating England 24-0 on Sunday afternoon, but the Argentine defeat knocked the smile off everyone's face.\n\n\"It's been a pretty tough week. We had to deal with a lot around the old [Gordon] Tietjens controversy, the poor [crowd] numbers and the lack of support and then the coach getting Bell's Palsy so his face is a bit munted and he's talking a bit funny,\" Waldrom said.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\n* Commentary: Wellington 7s - finals day\n\n* Gifford: Wellington Sevens lacks stars \n\n\"The guys have been through a lot and to walk away on that note's been disappointing, because we know we're better than that.\"\n\nBell's Palsy is a kind of facial paralysis which affected Waldrom in the last few days and was the last thing he needed.\n\nParticularly at a time when the team have been under pressure regarding the lack of spectator interest in this tournament. One of the - many - remedies mooted has been for New Zealand to pick more \"name\" players. Who knows, it might work. In the meantime, though, that kind of talk hardly makes young players feel they deserve to be here representing New Zealand.\n\n\"We've tried to stay away from it. It's nothing we can control. Obviously better performances might get more support,\" said Waldrom.\n\nFiji's supporters at Westpac Stadium appeared to outnumber - and definitely out-sung - New Zealand's in Sunday's quarterfinal and that hurt the team.\n\n\"Obviously we were out-supported by the Fijians in that one and to me it felt the Argentinian crowd was even louder than ours. That's a little bit disappointing for the boys that when they do get to play in front of a home crowd, it's not there.\"\n\nA lack of support won't hurt so much when the team hit Sydney where Waldrom is confident they'll be better. They'll definitely need to be, because they can't continue to make the sort of soft errors and missed tackles that thwarted their title aspirations in Wellington.\n\n\"There was some pretty stern words from everyone after that [Argentine] game and we're certainly good enough. You've just got to look at some of the games yesterday [Saturday] and the England game,\" Waldrom said.\n\n\"If we can put in six games like that then we can certainly be a contender for the cup.\"\n\nTim Mikkelson hobbled off early against Argentina and captain Scott Curry copped a few knocks too. Waldrom indicated that New Zealand would probably take the same side to an event at which they're again the defending champions.\n\nSouth Africa will be the undoubted favourites in Sydney after claiming the Wellington title with a convincing win 26-6 over Fiji","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Hamish Bidwell"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"NZ Sevens team happy to leave Wellington and lick their wounds","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"NZ","country":"New Zealand"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Stuff.co.nz","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169662685","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1076"},"name":"Stuff.co.nz","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Rugby","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.stuff.co.nz/"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199409576","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:48:42Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:51:10Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://resources.stuff.co.nz/content/dam/images/1/g/w/y/3/w/image.related.StuffLandscapeSixteenByNine.620x349.1gwyq1.png/1485676122942.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

You know, it's the time of the year, where we look at it purely as a business, there's a lot of events around. \n\n\"But it's been such an iconic Wellington event, we still want to hold it and, if we can turn it around, we'd like to be part of that.\"\n\nNew Zealand Rugby executive member Nigel Cass will host a conference call with media on Monday morning to outline the parameters of its looming review of the tournament.\n\nHowever, Dunbar insisted the process was \"standard practice\". \"We go through a review with all the Wellington stakeholders, the council, with the economic development agency, with the stadium, with Wellington Rugby, who are our partner in the tournament.\n\n\"We'll look at the things that went well, we'll look at the things that we could be improving on and go from there.\" New Zealand Rugby still has two years left of a three-year licence with World Rugby to host the sevens, but Dunbar said it was possible the tournament could be moved to another New Zealand centre.\n\n\"World Rugby own the series, they give hosting rights to New Zealand Rugby. New Zealand Rugby, then, make recommendations about what city their tournament is held in.\n\n\"At the end of the day, it's [World Rugby's] decision. They will decide, but things need to work well for them, and their measures are broadcast viewership and sponsorship.\n\n\"It needs to work well for New Zealand Rugby. We have different financial risks, and it needs to work well for the city as well. \"We will get together with the key Wellington stakeholders within the next two weeks. We'll have to have a chat to World Rugby, we'll have to start to mop up the numbers, and that can take a while, as you'd imagine for a tournament of this size.\"\n\nComment was sought from World Rugby, but Stuff was told nobody was available.\n\nHarmon, however, remained an optimist. \"I still think there's a future for sevens in Wellington.\n\n\"The question is, is there enough interest in sevens rugby in New Zealand? That's the one [thing] we have got to explore.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"KATARINA WILLIAMS"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"New Zealand news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Sevens D-day may be close","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"NZ","country":"New Zealand"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Stuff.co.nz","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169662685","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1076"},"name":"Stuff.co.nz","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Rugby","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.stuff.co.nz/"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199419969","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:51:13Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://resources.stuff.co.nz/content/dam/images/1/g/p/u/z/l/image.related.StuffLandscapeSixteenByNine.620x349.1gwvb0.png/1485676153074.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Opener Kyle Hope made 36 and captain Denesh Ramdin, 33. \n \nBarbadian Mayers finished with three for 59 while captain and off-spinner Liam Sebastien picked up two for 31. \n \nSunil Ambris and former West Indies captain, Darren Sammy, had earlier entertained with dashing half-centuries, to help Volcanoes up to 266 for seven off their 50 overs after being sent in. \n \nAmbris hit 69 from 88 deliveries while Sammy\u2019s cavalier unbeaten 60 needed just 36 balls. Andre Fletcher offered support with 35 and Delorn Johnson, an audacious 16-ball, unbeaten 26. \n \nRampaul shines with four wickets \n \nOut-of-favour West Indies pacer Ravi Rampaul shone with four for 43 while current Windies spearhead Shannon Gabriel claimed two for 53. \n \nVolcanoes were rattled early on when Rampaul struck twice to reduce them to 18 for three in the eighth over. Gabriel struck first when he had left-hander Devon Smith caught at slip for six at nine for one in the fifth over and Rampaul then bowled Johnson Charles for three and had Tyrone Theophile caught at the wicket for six, in successive overs. \n \nAmbris led the fightback by spearheading three key partnerships before Sammy arrived to do the damage at the end. \n \nWhen Ambris played back to seamer Rayad Emrit and was bowled in the 40th over, Sammy entered to take charge \u2013 adding 50 off 35 balls for the seventh wicket with Mayers and a whirlwind 66 off 29 deliveries with Johnson in an unbroken eighth wicket partnership. \n \nWhile Sammy belted four fours and five sixes, Johnson thrice cleared the ropes, in an entertaining stand that climaxed the innings nicely. \n \nRed Force responded strongly, mainly through Lewis who slammed nine fours and three sixes to inspire an opening partnership of 94 with Hope. \n \nHe was in full flight when he holed out to long-off off left-arm spinner Hodge and his dismissal triggered a slide where three wickets fell for 31 runs to leave Red Force on 125 for three in the 22nd over. However, Mohammed and Ramdin combined in a 92-run fourth wicket stand which seemed to put Red Force in the driver\u2019s seat. \n \nMohammed hit seven fours and a six while Ramdin counted three fours in his 45-ball knock. The tide swung again when Mayers ran Ramdin out with a direct hit from mid-off off the first ball of the 41st over and three balls later, seamer Mervin Matthew bowled Nicholas Alexis without scoring. \n \nMayers injected more excitement into the contest when he removed both Mohammed and Emrit (0) to catches at the wicket in the space of four deliveries in the 45th over but Imran Khan and Primus kept their wits to deny Volcanoes.

That's something you've got to get through, the first 10-15 overs are crucial. With the line-up that we play, if we can have wickets in the shed at the back end then we will score a lot of runs at the end of the (innings).\" \n \nThe keeper found out the perils of taking on Eden Park's small boundaries when he played at the ground for the first time last February, caught at cow corner trying to heave Corey Anderson over the ropes. \n \nThe Australians were all out for 148 on that occasion, with the Black Caps' seamers running riot on the way to a 2-1 series win. It was a similar story a year earlier, with the Aussies skittled for 151 in a World Cup clash that the Kiwis only won by a wicket. \n \nAt the same time, Eden Park's unusual dimensions have resulted in big scores before. Although the tourists failed to pass 150 last time around, New Zealand posted a score of 8-307 in the same game. \n \nIndeed, before Australia's innings that day, seven of the last eight innings at the ground had gone past 280 runs. \n \n\"(The Eden Park pitch) just has a bit in it,\" New Zealand veteran Ross Taylor said. \"I don't think there is a par score, some wickets here are 300, some are 200. \n \n\"You just have to analyse it as quickly as possible, whether you're batting or bowling.\" \n \nThe Kiwis were trounced 3-0 in Australia when the sides met in December, but Wade is expecting a tougher time on New Zealand's turf. \n \n\"We played them in Australia (on) big grounds (with) long boundaries. It's a completely different ball game,\" he said. \n \n\"(On) the smaller grounds (in New Zealand) they'll still play aggressive; they're still going to be able to hit plenty of fours and sixes at grounds that they play at. \n \n\"They play well here (in NZ) and they play this venue very well. \n \n\"We like to think we're hard to beat in Australia and it's the same when we come here - we expect a hard challenge over the next three games but we've got a young squad and we're excited to go out and really have a crack at it.\" \n \nCaptaining the side for the first time, Wade maintains his job is simply to continue the fine work of the leadership duo of Steve Smith and vice-captain David Warner. \n \n\"I don't think for me personally it's about putting a stamp on the team,\" he said. \"It's about driving the values and the game plan that we have in one-day cricket moving forward. \n \n\"Steven and David have put their stamp on the team, it's just about me keeping on driving those key messages through to the players. \n \n\"We've performed really well in one-day cricket over a long period of time so it's not about trying to change too much - it's about keeping the ball rolling.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"New Zealand news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Aussies wary of Black Caps on home turf","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"4570","state":"Queensland","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Gympie","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Gympie Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169679096","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"9"},"name":"Gympie Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.gympietimes.com.au","publisher":"APN Holdings NZ Limited"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199424670","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T00:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:51:18Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

His older brother Hance Kallicharan received the award on his behalf. \n \nThe awards were presented by Dr Keith Clifford, chairman of the Foundation and Karen Darbassie, Group Chief Executive Officer at First Citizens Bank Limited. \n \nSprinter St Fort had another banner year last season and that is reflected in her being voted as the best among a host of talented young women at the gala ceremony. \n \nShe mounted the podium at the IAAF World U-20 Championships in Bydgoszcz, Poland where she bagged a bronze medal in the women\u2019s 100 metres in a time of 11.18 seconds. This followed up her gold medal winning performance at the CARIFTA Games in St George\u2019s, Grenada in the same event in 11.40. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s all worth it,\u201d said St Fort flashing one of her brilliant smiles, when asked how it feels to collect the top youth award for the second straight year. St Fort came into local spotlight in 2015 when she captured gold in the women 100m at the 2015 Pan American Junior Championships in Edmonton, Canada. She also got silver in the 100m at the IAAF Youth Championships in Cali, Colombia and bronze with the women 4x100m relay team at the IAAF World Championships in Beijing, China. \n \n\u201cThis is just as sweet receiving the award for representing your country,\u201d said the American-born sprinter. \u201cIt\u2019s a great feeling.\u201d Although Kallicharan wasn\u2019t there in person, he certainly was quite aware of all the happenings on the evening. \u201cHe knew he was a nominee so when they called us on stage he asked if we could FaceTime him so he could see what his position is,\u201d said Hance, understanding fully well the importance of the award he was accepting for his brother, who was probably recuperating from his team second loss in the Super 50 to the Hurricanes earlier that day. \n \nSpeaking on behalf of Kirstan, he said, \u201cI know he was quite surprised and honoured to be the winner of this accomplishment.\u201d \n \nKallicharan helped the WI team cop the title at the ICC U-19 World Cup in Bangladesh. The 16-year-old had also contributed 244 runs (including knocks of 110 and 91) in helping T&T capture the three-day competition trophy at the Regional U-19 Championships in St Vincent and the Grenadines and captained this country to its first ever WI U-17 Championship trophy at home, where he posted two half-centuries. \n \nOf the top 11 present to share in the moment were swimmer Jeron Thompson, last year\u2019s men\u2019s winner, Tyriq Horsford (athletics), Chelsea Mofford (taekwondo), table tennis player Brittany Joseph, Kate Gordon (karate) and cyclist Nicholas Paul. \n \nFor those who were unable to be there in person, family members and love ones collected on their behalf. The remaining top recipients were table tennis player Aaron Wilson, whose coach Dennis La Rose received for him, Anand Kumar was presented the award for his son golfer Sachin Kumar and swimmer Gabriela Donahue.

But plenty did, culminating in a 17-12 loss to Argentina that meant the three-time defending champions finished sixth.\n\nThe World Sevens Series continues in Sydney this weekend and New Zealand co-coach Waldrom is desperate for the change in scenery to also herald a change of fortunes. The team had been fairly chipper after beating England 24-0 on Sunday afternoon, but the Argentine defeat knocked the smile off everyone's face.\n\n\"It's been a pretty tough week. We had to deal with a lot around the old [Gordon] Tietjens controversy, the poor [crowd] numbers and the lack of support and then the coach getting Bell's Palsy so his face is a bit munted and he's talking a bit funny,\" Waldrom said.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\n* Commentary: Wellington 7s - finals day\n\n* Gifford: Wellington Sevens lacks stars \n\n\"The guys have been through a lot and to walk away on that note's been disappointing, because we know we're better than that.\"\n\nBell's Palsy is a kind of facial paralysis which affected Waldrom in the last few days and was the last thing he needed.\n\nParticularly at a time when the team have been under pressure regarding the lack of spectator interest in this tournament. One of the - many - remedies mooted has been for New Zealand to pick more \"name\" players. Who knows, it might work. In the meantime, though, that kind of talk hardly makes young players feel they deserve to be here representing New Zealand.\n\n\"We've tried to stay away from it. It's nothing we can control. Obviously better performances might get more support,\" said Waldrom.\n\nFiji's supporters at Westpac Stadium appeared to outnumber - and definitely out-sung - New Zealand's in Sunday's quarterfinal and that hurt the team.\n\n\"Obviously we were out-supported by the Fijians in that one and to me it felt the Argentinian crowd was even louder than ours. That's a little bit disappointing for the boys that when they do get to play in front of a home crowd, it's not there.\"\n\nA lack of support won't hurt so much when the team hit Sydney where Waldrom is confident they'll be better. They'll definitely need to be, because they can't continue to make the sort of soft errors and missed tackles that thwarted their title aspirations in Wellington.\n\n\"There was some pretty stern words from everyone after that [Argentine] game and we're certainly good enough. You've just got to look at some of the games yesterday [Saturday] and the England game,\" Waldrom said.\n\n\"If we can put in six games like that then we can certainly be a contender for the cup.\"\n\nTim Mikkelson hobbled off early against Argentina and captain Scott Curry copped a few knocks too. Waldrom indicated that New Zealand would probably take the same side to an event at which they're again the defending champions.\n\nSouth Africa will be the undoubted favourites in Sydney after claiming the Wellington title with a convincing win 26-6 over Fiji","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"HAMISH BIDWELL"},"topics":[{"name":"New Zealand news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Argentina news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Sydney news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Sydney or the bush for NZ","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"NZ","country":"New Zealand"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Stuff.co.nz","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169662685","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1076"},"name":"Stuff.co.nz","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Rugby","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.stuff.co.nz/"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199437803","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:51:13Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://resources.stuff.co.nz/content/dam/images/1/g/w/y/3/w/image.related.StuffLandscapeSixteenByNine.620x349.1gwyq1.png/1485676122942.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

That puts 12 players within two shots of the co-leaders. \n \nFormer Santa Margarita High star Beau Hossler, making his first PGA start as a professional at age 21, struggled to a 2-over 74 on Saturday to drop to even par, one shot ahead of Saturday\u2019s secondary cut, and is tied for 58th. \n \nSuffice it to say, it was much more surprising that tour stars Tiger Woods, Jason Day, Dustin Johnson, Rickie Fowler and Jimmy Walker all missed the 36-hole cut than it is that Snedeker is contending again at Torrey Pines. \n \n\u201cMy rookie year I finished third here and ever since then, it\u2019s had a special place in my heart,\u201d Snedeker said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to quantify, but I definitely think there are certain golf courses (where) you show up and your attitude \u2014 the way you go about things \u2013 and your confidence level kind of wills you to have a good week. ... This is a place that I love and play great on.\u201d \n \nTwo of Snedeker\u2019s eight career tour victories came at Torrey Pines. He won the 2012 Farmers in a playoff after Kyle Stanley triple-bogeyed the 72nd hole to open the door for him, and he won last year\u2019s storm-delayed tournament after shooting 69 Sunday in a driving rain and heavy winds that suspended play and then watching the leaders falter on Monday. \n \nThe only two players who have won the Farmers more often are Woods (seven of his 79 tour titles) and Phil Mickelson (three of his 42 tour titles), who moved up the leaderboard to 18th Saturday after a third-round 68. \n \n \n\u201cAny time you put your name on a list next to those guys, you\u2019re doing OK,\u201d Snedeker said. \u201cIt\u2019ll probably enter my head at some point (in the final round), but to do that I\u2019ve got a lot of golf to play. This course is ready to take a bite out of you if you\u2019re not paying attention.\u201d \n \nRodgers, 24, a former Stanford star who tied Woods\u2019 career record of 11 college victories, overpowered the South Course with his long-distance driving Saturday en route to a bogey-free 67 to put himself in the final group on a Sunday for the first time. He has led the field in driving distance all three rounds, with a cumulative average of 311.2 yards. \n \n\u201cFor me, driving the ball has always been a staple of my game; I feel like it\u2019s what got me out here,\u201d said Rodgers, who is seeking his first PGA Tour victory in 59 starts. \u201cI\u2019m hitting my new Callaway \u2018Epic\u2019 driver a long way, and it\u2019s a huge advantage for me on this course.\u201d \n \nRodgers had the longest drives on 6 of the 14 par-4s and par-5s on Saturday, including a 336-yarder on No. 9 and 330-yarder on No. 13. He reached the par-5 13th in two with a 5-iron from 221 yards and the par-5 18th with a 4-iron from 238 yards, though his second shot on the closing hole kicked into a bunker. He failed to get up and down for birdie, so he had to settle for sharing the lead with Snedeker. \n \nHossler, who had high hopes after a 5-under 67 in his first round of his first PGA Tour start, gave back all five of those strokes by shooting 75 and 74 in his first two rounds on the South. He is learning that it won\u2019t be as easy as it as for him in amateur and college golf. \n \nWhen he made the turn at 2 under Saturday \u2013 after a two-birdie, two-bogey front nine \u2013 he was two shots out of the top 10. That was significant, because a top-10 finish this week would get him into the field at next week\u2019s Waste Management Phoenix Open. \n \nBut his round unraveled in the span of two holes, when he bogeyed the par-3 11th after snap-hooking his tee shot and then double-bogeyed the 504-yard, par-4 12th to temporarily fall to 1 over. Though he bounced back with birdies on No. 13 and No. 14, he was not happy afterward. \n \n\u201cI\u2019m just not playing well at all; I\u2019m struggling in all facets of the game,\u201d said Hossler, who is competing on a sponsor\u2019s exemption. \u201cAny time you play at a higher level, you just have to up your game, and I certainly haven\u2019t done that the last couple of days. It\u2019s been frustrating, but having the opportunity to compete is really special, especially close to home. It\u2019s a privilege to be here and I just want to finish it off well and get some momentum moving forward.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Brandt Snedeker contends again at Farmers Insurance Open","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"San Bernardino","zipCode":"92373","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Redlands","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Redlands Daily Facts","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169681040","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"6"},"name":"Redlands Daily Facts","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.redlandsdailyfacts.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199440434","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:51:21Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

A panel of top foreign policy honchos, which included former national security advisor Shivshankar Menon, was true to form at the Jaipur Literature Festival last week as they agreed that the disruption caused by the 45th US President is \u201cgood for India\u201d because it creates spaces for middling powers like Delhi to manoeuvre foreign policy in the national interest. And if that sounded cold-blooded and transactional, said Carnegie India director C Rajamohan, then that was a good thing as India has to be \u201ceven more, more and more transactional\u201d if that suited her. Perhaps it has always been like this in key centres of power worldwide. At the height of the non-aligned movement (NAM), led by the troika of India, Egypt and Yugoslavia, several NAM members were unafraid of striking deals at the cost of other NAM relationships. Also Read: In one week, Trump shakes up Washington and the world So should the pursuit of foreign affairs subject itself to the high moral ground? The Jaipur Litfest panel cited above would certainly say no. But for a unique civilization like India, which marshalled a freedom movement to redeem itself, it cannot be that its foreign policy is so divorced from national values and so devoted to vaulting ambition that it shuts its eyes to all that is wilfully abominable. Hint of Desperation When Trump called Modi earlier this week to say hello, media outlets gushed that he was only the fifth head of government the US president had spoken to. \u201cEven before Putin,\u201d some media outlets crowed. Modi is likely to make that trip to America sooner than later, so as to quickly establish a relationship with the most powerful man in the world. As India\u2019s relations with China deteriorate, the PM will increasingly see Trump as a hedge against the other Asian power \u2014 especially as Trump has openly stated his intention to curb Xi Jinping\u2019s dream of becoming Numero Uno. The realpolitik school is already applauding. And what of Trump\u2019s open hostility to Muslims and Muslim immigrants? For a country with the world\u2019s second largest Muslim population, that is a course to worry about. Then there is Trump\u2019s determination to build a wall so as to prevent Mexicans from neighbouring Mexico enter his country. Or the decision to ban abortion and roll back decades of the women\u2019s liberation movement \u2014 not to speak of his abhorrent \u201clocker-room talk\u201d on the campaign trail. It boggles the mind, but I\u2019m almost sure Indira Gandhi wouldn\u2019t have fallen forward so determinedly. Perhaps that assumption is also being made because Mrs Gandhi was also a woman \u2014 although in that department of high female standards which includes a sense of distinctive right and wrong, the British PM Theresa May seems terribly lacking as she rushed to meet Trump this weekend. Come to think of it, how many women does Modi have in his senior echelons who could strike a dissenting note and offer restraining advice? Sushma Swaraj, the best of them all, was marginalised even before she fell ill. Everyone knows Vasundhara Raje and Modi hardly see eye-to-eye. The Chinese philosopher Sun Tzu said that for any leader to be successful, he should know his enemy. Deng Xiaoping took a leaf out of that book to formulate his \u201cTwenty-Four Character\u201d strategy which enjoined his fellow-men and women to \u201cobserve the situation calmly\u201d and refuse to react. Modi should read Deng\u2019s book and follow his advice. In the turbulence that follows Trump\u2019s ascension to power, so much better to stay cool and refuse to be flattered. A multi-polar world suits India\u2019s interests far better than hanging on to the coat-tails of just one power, especially one which refuses to respect large parts of his population. India\u2019s foreign policy has to be rooted in domestic values and must emerge from it.

But it's not clear the measures will help prevent attacks on American soil, and they could wind up emboldening extremists who already view the US as at war with Islam. Recent acts of deadly extremist violence have been carried out either by US citizens or by individuals whose families weren't from the nations singled out. And the list of countries in Trump's order doesn't include Saudi Arabia, where most of the Sept. 11 hijackers were from, or other places with a more direct link to terrorism in America. The admissions ban announced Friday also does not directly address a more urgent law enforcement concern: homegrown violent extremists already in the United States who plot their attacks without any overseas connections or contacts. \"The primary terrorism-related threat facing the US today comes from individuals living here who become inspired by what they see on the internet, who carry out attacks independent of any terrorist organization,\" said John Cohen, a former Department of Homeland Security counterterrorism official who worked in government under Democratic and Republican administrations and who has been involved in refugee vetting policy. The FBI has for years been concerned by the prospect of airplane bomb plots and terrorists dispatched from overseas to commit violence in America. But the ascendancy of the Islamic State, and the group's ability through slick and easily accessible propaganda to reach susceptible young Americans in all corners of the country, has been a more immediate challenge - and a more realistic danger - for counterterrorism officials than any threat posed by refugees from abroad. \"Dealing with that threat should be a top priority for this administration,\" Cohen said. The executive order suspends refugee admissions for 120 days and bars all immigration for 90 days from Muslim-majority countries with terrorism concerns: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. It indefinitely bars the processing of refugees from Syria, a country that's been of particular country to the FBI even though the number of Americans who have looked to travel there to fight with the Islamic State has been dwindling. But the culprits of recent deadly terror attacks aren't linked to the countries singled out by Trump's order. Omar Mateen, the man responsible for the Orlando nightclub shooting, the deadliest terror attack in the US since the Sept. 11 attacks, was born in New York to Afghan parents. Syed Rizwan Farook, who took part in the December 2015 San Bernardino attack, was born in Chicago. His wife, Tashfeen Malik, had been living in Pakistan and visiting family in Saudi Arabia before she passed the background check and entered the US The brothers who bombed the Boston Marathon were ethnic Chechens who had been living in the US In general, Islamic extremists have accounted for a minuscule amount of the roughly 240,000 murders since Sept. 11, 2001, said Charles Kurzman, a sociology professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Kurzman said his research identified zero fatalities since Sept. 11 caused by extremists from the seven nations in Trump's order. He said people with ancestry from those countries have accounted for only a small fraction of extremist-related arrests and disrupted plots during the same time period. \"I can only conclude that this is whipping up fear and hostility toward Americans who have family background from these countries,\" Kurzman said. Still, while refugees are subject to screening - including in-person interviews, checks with law enforcement databases and collection of biometric data, when available - the process is not perfect. FBI counterterrorism officials have long expressed concern about the lack of background information about refugees from Syria, a home base of the Islamic State, and Director James Comey has said that he could not guarantee a mistake-free vetting process. There have been isolated incidents of refugees later accused in terror-related plots. An Iraqi refugee who entered the US in 2009, for instance, pleaded guilty in Houston in October to attempting to provide material support to the Islamic State. Two Iraqi refugees who lived in Kentucky are now in prison after having been convicted in a plot to send sniper rifles, Stinger missiles and money to al-Qaida operatives waging an insurgency back home. And the man accused in the November car-and-knife that injured 11 people at Ohio State University was a refugee originally from Somalia who, as an adolescent, moved with his family to the United States in 2014 after living in Pakistan. Though not immune from lapses, the screening process has improved over the years, Cohen said. He said he was concerned that the refugee ban could deter Muslim-majority countries from cooperating with the US on policy matters and could embolden an extremist already bent on violence. \"That's something,\" Cohen said, \"that law enforcement folks are going to be factoring into their violence prevention efforts.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Terrorism news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Trump shuts door on refugees, but will it prevent attack on US?","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Eastern Europe","countryCode":"BG","country":"Bulgaria"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Bullfax.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"613768328","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"Bullfax.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Business"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bullfax.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199451388","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:51:22Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Looking at the growth in demand in these markets, we are expecting close to 10 per cent growth in the gems and jewellery exports led by polished diamonds,\" Gem Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC) Chairman Praveen Shankar Pandya told PTI here. Total exports witnessed 28.26 per cent growth at Rs 1.44 lakh crore during April-December 2016, compared to Rs 1.12 lakh crore in the corresponding period of FY15, according to government data. Cut and polished diamonds saw flat growth at Rs 13,499.76 crore in the period, compared to Rs 13,537.21 crore in the same period of the previous financial year. Pandya said all eyes are on US President Donald Trump, who is expected to boost the American economy. \"When the economy improves, there are more jobs and a rise in demand for jewellery. It is already a big market, which is expected to be even bigger,\" he said. He said exporters are also watching what Trump does with the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) -- a three-country accord negotiated by the governments of Canada, Mexico and the United States. \"If NAFTA is abrogated, the exports will increase. However, the negotiations will have to be done carefully,\" he added. On Europe, Pandya said the situation is improving but the US dollar and Euro parity have made things more competitive. On exploring new markets, Pandya said GJEPC will strive to strengthen the existing markets and also explore new ones. \"We are making efforts to strengthen our strong markets like US, Europe. However, we also continue to explore new export destinations for the sector that will earn revenue for the country. We are looking at markets like Korea and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries,\" he said. GJEPC is also striving to increase the country's exports to Japan and the Middle East, Pandya said.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Gems, jewellery exports likely to rise 10 per cent in...","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Eastern Europe","countryCode":"BG","country":"Bulgaria"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Bullfax.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"613768328","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"Bullfax.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Business"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bullfax.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199451563","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:51:22Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

According to the report, major changes in politics across the globe have led to this overall decrease. Key changes include the election of Donald Trump and Brexit referendum, which result in the UK\u2019s  departure from the European Union. \n \nCovering most of the world\u2019s population, the EIU Democracy Index report accounts for 165 independent states and two territories. \n \nEach country is scored on indicators in five important categories; electoral process and pluralism, civil liberties, the functioning of government, political participation and political culture. \n \nThis score classifies each country to be under one of four regimes: a \u201cfull democracy,\u201d a \u201cflawed democracy,\u201d a \u201chybrid regime,\u201d or an \u201cauthoritarian regime.\u201d  \n \nThe Middle East and North Africa ( MENA ) \n \nThe MENA region as a whole, was politically stagnated as many countries moved more in favour of greater authoritarianism than full democracy in 2016. Examples of countries with an authoritarian regime are Sudan and Syria, with Syria ranking second from last in the global ranking. \n \nFor the MENA region, the most disappointing outcome of the year was Tunisia, which dropped a significant 12 places to the 69th position in the global ranking, after being \u201cwidely regarded as having been the sole democratic success of the Arab Spring.\u201d \n \nThe report recognized \u201cmarginal improvements\u201d made by Egypt, Morocco and Iran. Although Morocco is still classified as a \u201chybrid regime,\u201d the October 2016 parliamentary election elevated Morocco\u2019s position slightly, moving up in the ranking by two places. \n \nThis was due to the 2016 election providing better female representation in the legislature. Women in Morocco secured more than 20% of its legislative  seats, which represents 81 female candidates in the lower house (Chamber of Representatives). \n \nUnited States of America \n \nThe U.S. generally tends to perform well in democracy rankings, but it fell behind in comparison to other Western countries, especially countries in Northern Europe. \n \nA major change noted in the report for 2016 is that \u201cthe US fell below the threshold for a \u201cfull democracy\u201d in 2016 and is now considered a \u201cflawed democracy.\u201d \n \nThe change in score and type of regime is due to the lack of confidence that the nation has shown in its government over the past few years. The Pew Research Centre claims that public trust in government has declined since the events of 9/11. \n \nMoreover, Donald Trump\u2019s presidency has also led to the public\u2019s frustration with its democratic institutions and representatives. The article notes, however, that \u201cTrump\u2019s candidacy was not the cause of the deterioration in trust but rather a consequence of it.\u201d \n \nSub-Saharan Africa (SSA) \n \nMost countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are considered to be under \u201cauthoritarian regimes.\u201d This has been a fact since The Economist Intelligence Unit\u2019s Democracy Index launched. \n \nCountries in Sub- Saharan Africa have improved in terms of political participation and, because of this, the region has made some democratic progress. \n \n\u201cWhile elections have become commonplace across much of the region, the regional score for electoral processes has remained persistently low, reflecting a lack of genuine pluralism in most countries.\u201d \n \nAlthough in 2017, it will be likely that there will be an increase in democratic progress, \u201cmuch of the region will continue to be characterized as deeply entrenched one-party states that go through the motions of holding elections without providing the freedoms necessary to promote genuine democracy.\u201d \n \nSource :Morocco World News","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"North Africa news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Morocco news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Africa news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Morocco Ranks 4 in MENA Region","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"GB","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Arabstoday.net","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"195129065","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"Arabstoday.net","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.arabstoday.net"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.arabtoday.net/news-39/african-commission-attempts-to-prevent-moroccos-return-to-au-065148","http://www.arabtoday.net/environ-182/egypt-keen-on-improving-electricity-services-in-upper-egypt-211530"],"sequenceId":"695199458122","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:51:24Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Juan Francisco del Canizo, a Universidad Complutense de Madrid researcher, said: \"Knowing how to mix the biological components, in what conditions to work with them so that the cells don't deteriorate and how to correctly deposit the product is critical to the system.\" \n \nThe process for producing these tissues can be carried out in two ways: To produce allogeneic skin from a stock of cells, done on a large scale, for industrial processes; and to create autologous skin, which is made case by case from the patient's own cells, for therapeutic use, such as in the treatment of severe burns. \n \n\"We use only human cells and components to produce skin that is bioactive and can generate its own human collagen, thereby avoiding the use of the animal collagen that is found in other methods,\" the researchers noted. \n \nThis method of bioprinting allows skin to be generated in a standardised, automated way and the process is less expensive than manual production. \n \n© 2017 IANS India Private Limited.

It demonstrates that if you give Vitamin C (along with hydrocortisone and thiamine) for just over two days in patients admitted with sepsis (blood poisoning) the mortality rate falls from 40% to 8.5%. The mortality rate in low income countries is normally around 60%. \nNow, this was a small study, but it seems robust. It represents an almost five-fold reduction in mortality, but I think it provides some pretty strong support for the benefits of vitamin C. The conclusions of the study, repeated below were that. \n \n'Our results suggest that the early use of intravenous vitamin C, together with corticosteroids and thiamine may prove to be effective in preventing progressive organ dysfunction including acute kidney injury and reducing the mortality of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock.' \n  Hydrocortisone, Vitamin C and Thiamine for the Treatment of Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock: A Retrospective Before-After Study \nPaul E. Marik, MD, FCCM, FCCP; Vikramjit Khangoora, MD; Racquel Rivera, Pharm D; Michael H. Hooper, M.D., MSc; John Catravas, PhD, FAHA, FCCP \n\nChest. 2016. doi:10.1016/j.chest.2016.11.036 \n\nAbstract \n\nBackground: The global burden of sepsis is estimated as 15 to 19 million cases annually with a mortality rate approaching 60% in low income countries. \n\nMethods: In this retrospective before-after clinical study, we compared the outcome and clinical course of consecutive septic patients treated with intravenous vitamin C, hydrocortisone and thiamine during a 7-month period (treatment group) compared to a control group treated in our ICU during the preceding 7 months. The primary outcome was hospital survival. A propensity score was generated to adjust the primary outcome. \n\nFindings: There were 47 patients in both treatment and control groups with no significant differences in baseline characteristics between the two groups. The hospital mortality was 8.5% (4 of 47) in the treatment group compared to 40.4% (19 of 47) in the control group (p < 0.001). The propensity adjusted odds of mortality in the patients treated with the vitamin C protocol was 0.13 (95% CI 0.04-0.48, p=002). The SOFA score decreased in all patients in the treatment group with none developing progressive organ failure. Vasopressors were weaned off all patients in the treatment group, a mean of 18.3 ± 9.8 hours after starting treatment with vitamin C protocol. The mean duration of vasopressor use was 54.9 ± 28.4 hours in the control group (p<0.001). \n\nConclusion: Our results suggest that the early use of intravenous vitamin C, together with corticosteroids and thiamine may prove to be effective in preventing progressive organ dysfunction including acute kidney injury and reducing the mortality of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. Additional studies are required to confirm these preliminary findings.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Consumer: health news","group":"Lifestyle"}],"title":"Vitamin C update - Recent study","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Sott.net","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"424104123","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"398"},"name":"Sott.net","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Science"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.sott.net"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sott.net%2Fimage%2Fs18%2F373773%2Ffull%2Fvitamin_c1.jpg&hl=en-US","http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sott.net%2Farticle%2F341004-Vitamin-C-update-Recent-study&media=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sott.net%2Fimage%2Fs18%2F373773%2Ffull%2Fvitamin_c1.jpg&description=","http://journal.publications.chestnet.org/article.aspx?articleid=2593508&resultClick=1"],"sequenceId":"695199461775","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T03:07:54Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:51:21Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Railway Budget merged with General Budget will have about two-page mention of railways' upcoming activities, including major projects, expenditure and revenue targets for the next fiscal. The national transporter is forming up a holding company with networth of Rs 34,000 crore comprising 14 railways PSUs including IRCTC, RITES, Concor, RailTel and MRVC, to leverage loan from the market with zero debt and also be a beneficiary in case of selling of the shares of its subsidiaries. Railways has embarked on an ambitious project to speed up train movement in busy corridors and accordingly undertaken an ardous task of fencing off the Delhi-Howrah and Delhi-Mumbai routes at a cost of about Rs 45 lakh per km to run trains at 160 km per hour. Fencing off the entire route is crucial for running trains at 160 km per hour which can be later raised to 200 km per hour, a senior Railway Ministry official said. Describing it as a paradigm shift for rail network development, he said fencing is essential for preventing trespassing and cattle movement to ensure high speed and safety and it will find prominent mention in the budget papers. Besides fencing, track and signalling upgradation and elimination of unmanned level-crossings along the way for major trunk routes of Delhi-Mumbai and Delhi-Howrah sections will be taken up at an estimated cost of Rs 21,000 crore. According to the feasibility study, it is a remunerative project with both routes having high rate of return. While the rate of return for Delhi-Howrah route is 18 per cent, it is 14.7 per cent for Delhi-Mumbai, he said. The Delhi-Mumbai section will cover Baroda-Ahmedabad route and Delhi-Howrah sector will also include Kanpur-Lucknow corridor in the project. The two major trunk routes have been taken up in the first phase and later on Howrah-Chennai and Mumbai-Chennai sectors will also be taken up, he said. Since the Railways has of late seen some derailments, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley will announce of a special safety fund of about Rs 20,000 crore for the fiscal 2017-18. Railways has sought Rs 1.19 lakh crore over the next five years from the government for safety upgradation of the rail network and the Finance Ministry is likely to grant Rs 20,000 crore in the first year.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Mumbai news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Indian subcontinent news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"In Budget, fencing of Delhi-Howrah & Mumbai routes to...","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Eastern Europe","countryCode":"BG","country":"Bulgaria"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Bullfax.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"613768328","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"Bullfax.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Business"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bullfax.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199461943","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:51:21Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

While we are very strong in the mid-tier or popular range and the mass range, premium is one place where we have started making our mark felt,\" Parle Products Category Head Mayank Shah told PTI. \"We have brands like Hide & Seek and Milano and of late we also launched their variants. Having done that, we are seeing an increase in market share in that particular segment. We have seen our market share going up by almost 4-5 per cent in premium segment in last one year,\" he added. The premium biscuit category is estimated to be worth around Rs 5,000 crore, growing at 15-17 per cent. Shah said the company is expecting its market share to increase to 18-20 per cent in fiscal 2017-18 from 15 per cent at present. Its premium offerings include Milano, Simply Good, Happy Happy and Hide & Seek, while the mass brands are Parle G, Parle Marie, KrackJack and Monaco, among others. The biscuits major will also focus on consolidating its position in the popular and mass segments. \"While we would like to improve our share by focusing on premium biscuits, we would also like to consolidate our position in mid-tier and low price range,\" he said. Parle Products has a market share of 28 per cent in the overall Rs 36,000 crore biscuit market. The company has expanded its portfolio over the last two years by launching new products and would be consolidating them before launching new items. On overall rural demand, Shah said there would be an impact of 2-3 per cent on growth in this segment due to demonetisation. \"This year, with a good monsoon, we were expecting good growth coming in from rural but with demonetisation, growth across urban and rural has taken a hit. While we are seeing recovery in urban India, rural will take a bit of more time. \"While we expect rural to be the growth driver, the impact of rural growth coming in would only be seen in the next fiscal. This fiscal, we will not be able to realise the full potential of rural demand,\" he said. \"We were expecting category growth in rural to be in double digits but after demonetisation there would be at least 2-3 per cent impact in rural growth,\" he added. The company, which has presence in confectionery and snack segments with brands like Mango Bite, Melody, Fulltoss and Mexitos, among others, said it cut its advertising budget by 15-20 per cent post demonetisation. \"From mid-November to end December, there was hardly any advertising that was done and on an average it would have been 15-20 per cent cut in advertising as a result of demonetisation,\" Shah said, adding that the company spends 7-10 per cent of its revenue on advertising.

Insisting that increasing the budget allocation for health and family planning is of \"utmost concern\", Population Foundation of India (PFI) has said low spending by the country in the sector has caused growing inequities, insufficient access and poor quality of healthcare services. \"India spends just 1.3 per cent of its GDP on healthcare. This figure is much lower compared to BRICS countries - Brazil spends around 8.3 per cent, Russian Federation 7.1 per cent and South Africa around 8.8 per cent. \"Among SAARC countries, Afghanistan spends 8.2 per cent, Maldives 13.7 per cent and Nepal 5.8 per cent. This low spending by India has been a cause for the growing inequities, insufficient access (to), and poor quality of healthcare services,\" Poonam Muttreja, Executive Director, PFI said. PFI said the 12th five year plan recommends increasing public expenditure on health to 2.5 per cent of GDP by 2017. Between 2015-16 and 2016-17, the government's allocations for Health Ministry increased by 13 per cent but the share of National Health Mission in the Ministry's budget declined to 48 per cent. Trends in budget allocations indicate that percentage share to family planning has remained unchanged between 2013-14 and 2016-17 -- at 2 per cent of the total Health Ministry's budget. Noting that during 2015-16, 59 per cent of government fund was released primarily in the last quarter while 72 per cent was released in the first two quarters in 2014-15, PFI said this evidences staggered supply of funds for health resources and affects investments. \"Investing in health is critical for achieving the economic development goals. The health sector, which drives domestic demand for health care, has the potential of providing new jobs. The lack of skilled workforce is stark in the health sector. Increased investment will also bring down the prices of health services and assist in sustaining the medium term inflation target of four per cent. \"Adequate and proportionate resources invested (in health and specifically family planning) in the upcoming budget announcement will bear positive dividends for the country's future,\" Muttreja said. According to Census 2011, 53 per cent of the country's population is reproductive age group (15- 49 years) while one of five persons in the country is an adolescent (10-19 years) and every third is a young person (15-24 years). \"There is a collective responsibility on the government, civil society and other stakeholders to work together to plan adequate and suitable opportunities to meet their needs and aspirations and address the health and well-being of this population,\" she said. PFI said that at the London Summit 2012, India committed to provide family planning services to an additional 48 million new users by 2020. To fulfill our FP-2020 commitments and meet the responsibility towards the large young population, investments in health and family planning need to be proportionately increased. \"According to the FP-2020 progress report 2015-16, India has only reached 7.7 million additional users, by July 2016. Three million additional users have been reached last year, in contrast to 1.5 million additional users reached, each for the first three years. \"The accelerated efforts of the government towards universal access to family planning are also evident in its introduction of three new spacing methods of contraception in the family planning programme... in 2015, offering greater choice and autonomy to the users of family planning,\" she said.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Indian subcontinent news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"India spends less than BRICS, SAARC nations on health","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Eastern Europe","countryCode":"BG","country":"Bulgaria"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Bullfax.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"613768328","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"Bullfax.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Business"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bullfax.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199463419","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:51:22Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 24 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Milwaukee","zipCode":"53201","state":"Wisconsin","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Milwaukee","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WISN Milwaukee","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659888","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"504"},"name":"WISN Milwaukee","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wisn.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199463592","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:51:24Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Together they are planning to invest over Rs 1,000 crore in phase 1 which is expected to be completed by October this year,\" ELCINA Secretary General Rajoo Goel told PTI. The ELCINA Electronics Manufacturing Cluster (EMC) is spread over 100 acres in Bhiwadi, Rajasthan, and is to be completed in two phases. \"We expect direct employment in the range of 5,000-6,000 people and indirect employment of up to 12,000 in phase 1. We have utilised 28 acre of land as of now. Besides domestic component makers, we are also in talks with foreign component makers based out of Taiwan to set up their units here,\" Goel said. Investors in the cluster include Sahasra Electronics, Deki Electronics, Elin Electronics, Fiem Industries, Digital Circuits, Kraft Box and E-Durables. The companies investing in EMC are involved in sectors such as consumer appliances, PCB Assembly, contract manufacturing, mobile phone accessories, solar lanterns, plastic molding, LED Lighting Products and TVs. Goel said the proposed Dedicated Freight Corridor (DFC) runs alongside the cluster plot which will give them advantage to quickly ship their product to the market. \"The importance of this Cluster lies in providing an efficient manufacturing environment and reducing costs. This would enable domestic manufacturers to compete globally, export more and reduce import dependence,\" he said. Units that will be set-up in this cluster will get various incentives including capital subsidy up to 25 per cent of capital expenditure of the project besides refund of indirect taxes paid on capital equipments. The Ministry of Electronics and IT has given Rs 20.24 crore for this cluster under the EMC scheme. The funds will be used for developing basic infrastructure and facilities in Phase-I including IT and Telecom, training center, support services for manufacturing and hostels for employees. Government has approved 28 EMCs till date. However, Elcina expects that Bhiwadi EMC is likely to be first to start production.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Local electronic component makers to invest Rs 1,000 crore in 2017","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Eastern Europe","countryCode":"BG","country":"Bulgaria"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Bullfax.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"613768328","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"Bullfax.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Business"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bullfax.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199469271","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:51:25Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The move, that will make flying, eating out, phone bills and a host of other services expensive, would be an attempt to take the rates closer to the proposed tax slabs for GST. GST, which will subsume central and state levies like excise duty, service tax and VAT, is scheduled to be rolled out from July 1. The tax slabs decided for the GST are 5, 12, 18 and 28 per cent and taking service tax closer to one of the slabs is a logical move in the Budget, tax experts said. Tax experts say, Jaitley, who had in his previous budget hiked service tax rate by 0.5 per cent to 15 per cent, may raise the levy by at least one percentage point to 16 per cent. Some others feel there could be different service tax rates with a lower 12 per cent for basic services and a higher 18 per cent for the rest. Also, a higher service tax for April-June will help the government garner more revenue to meet expenses on schemes and programmes it may be planning to contain the impact of demonetisation. A service tax rate closer to the GST rate will also help consumers avoid a greater price shock when the new national sales tax is rolled out. While service tax until now is a central levy, it will be equally split between the Centre and states under the new GST regime. Most services, except essential ones like primary healthcare and basic education, will be covered by GST. Service tax was budgeted to provide Rs 2.31 lakh crore in 2016-17, more than 14 per cent of the Centre's total tax revenues of Rs 16.30 lakh crore. This will be the third time that Jaitley will raise service tax rate. Service tax from June 1, 2015 was hiked from 12.36 per cent to 14 per cent. A 0.5 per cent Swachh Bharat Cess was levied on all services, taking the total incidence of service tax to 14.5 per cent from November 15, 2015. In the last Budget, he imposed a Krishi Kalyan Cess at the rate of 0.5 per cent on all taxable services to take the levy to 15 per cent.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Tax news","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Jaitley may hike service tax to 16-18% in Budget","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Eastern Europe","countryCode":"BG","country":"Bulgaria"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Bullfax.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"613768328","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"Bullfax.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Business"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bullfax.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199469577","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:51:26Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

DELHI: Investors wealth surged by over Rs 3.64 lakh crore on Dalal Street in the week gone by, with the benchmark BSE Sensex climbing over 848 points on strong global cues, Budget expectations and quarterly earnings by early birds that have beat consensus estimates and eased concerns over cash ban impact on the economy. A slowdown in the pace of selling by foreign institutional investors also supported the domestic equity market during the week. The Nifty50 index climbed 291.90 points, or 3.50 per cent, to close at 8,641 on January 27 compared with 8,349 on January 20. The domestic market was closed on January 26 on account of Republic Day. Dipen Shah, Senior Vice-President for PCG Research at Kotak Securities, said: \u201cThe market ended the week with over 3 per cent gain with several midcaps performing much better. Better-than-expected quarterly results from domestically-oriented companies, slight weakening of the dollar and Budget expectations improved sentiments for the market. Quarterly results have so far reflected muted impact of demonetisation.\u201d Market capitalisation of the BSE-listed companies jumped from Rs 110.23 lakh crore on January 20 to Rs 113.87 lakh crore on January 27. Smallcap and midcap stocks notched up decent gains. The BSE Midcap index surged 3.14 per cent for the week, while the BSE Smallcap index gained 2.75 per cent. All the sectoral indices on BSE settled the week in the green, with the BSE Metal index climbing the most at 5.93 per cent, followed by the Consumer Durables index (up 5.55 per cent), PSU index (up 5.46 per cent) and Oil & Gas index (up 4.86 per cent). Other sectoral indices such as Auto, Power, Capital Goods and Telecom rose 4.47 per cent, 3.72 per cent, 2.37 per cent and 2.22 per cent, respectively. Firm metal prices in international markets continued to support the metal stocks. In the Nifty 50 pack, Hindalco surged the most at 11.13 per cent to Rs 190.75 as of January 27 from Rs 171.65 on January 20. Other stocks such as HDFC (up 11.02 per cent), Idea Cellular (up 9.09 per cent), Bank of Baroda (up 8.65 per cent) and Kotak Mahindra Bank (up 8.57 per cent) were among the other major gainers in the 50-share pack. On the other hand, shares of Wipro, Infosys, Hindustan Unilever (HUL), Tech Mahindra, Sun Pharma and RIL declined 2.58 per cent, 0.69 per cent, 0.52 per cent, 0.33 per cent, 0.16 per cent and 0.07 per cent, respectively, during the week. Overall, 45 stocks from the Nifty50 pack ended in the green, while six settled the week in the red. Foreign portfolio investors have sold equities worth Rs 2,139 crore so far this month. This has been far better than Rs 8,176 crore outflow seen in December and Rs 18,224 crore outflow in November. Inflows from domestic institutional investors continued to outpace and compensate for foreign outflows during the period. Domestic institutional investors have pumped Rs 4,471.56 crore into domestic equities, in addition to Rs 9,136 crore of inflows in December and Rs 18,227 crore in November. Equity investors are eyeing government announcements in the Budget to accelerate growth, especially after the impact of the demonetisation drive and in view of the goods and services tax (GST) to be implemented during the financial year, which again may put the economic growth back on track. Going into next week, investors will be eyeing the outcome of the US Federal Market Open Committee (FOMC) meeting scheduled for January 31 and February 1 for any hint of the next rate hike. Market outlook Short covering coupled with buying on investor optimism have led to a sharp rise in the benchmark equity indices. Market indicators have signalled an overbought condition, calling for caution in the immediate term. Jimeet Modi, Chief Executive Officer, SAMCO Securities, said: \u201cThe prices have touched the upper end of the channel, which will most likely attract profit booking. Traders should be cautious in times of high volatility and take a reactive view once the Budget gets over. Long positional trades should be trailed with stop losses below 8,300, while short-term traders may partially book profit and trail the balance below the 8,450 mark. Traders should buy on dips while investors should hold on to their portfolios.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"The week that was: Investor wealth up Rs 3.50L cr; metals rose","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Eastern Europe","countryCode":"BG","country":"Bulgaria"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Bullfax.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"613768328","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"Bullfax.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Business"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bullfax.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199470003","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:51:26Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Is Narendra Modi turning populist? We shall have the answer on Wednesday when ister presents the Budget. The the finance minister presents the Budget. The nation elected Mr Modi on an aspirational platform of creating jobs, containing inflation, and stopping corruption. Indeed, in the first half of his term, he has pursued responsible policies to meet these goals. As a result, the economy has turned around; inflation has been licked; fiscal indicators are healthy . The big weakness is the lack of jobs, an objective that has suffered a setback in the past three months by a badly executed demonetisation. Modi has recognised this, and is this why his rhetoric has changed? Instead of the aspirational talk of opportunities and jobs -of startups, ease of doing business, make in India -we have begun to hear the tired, pro-poor rhetoric of the Congress party . Nowhere was this more obvious than on New Year's Eve when Modi peppered his defensive speech with populist giveaways to farmers, pregnant women, senior citizens, etc. Gone was the refreshing talk of personal responsibility that we heard during his election campaign: `India doesn't owe you cheap diesel, free electricity and loan waivers; the only thing it owes you is good governance; after that, it's up to you to work hard, pull yourself up, pay your taxes, and make India a great nation.' So, what should we expect from this coming Budget? Let us hope the government will stay the course with the sound strategies pursued so far.Let's not take high growth for granted. Every rupee given away in populist doles is a rupee not available for job creation. Remember, recent state elections have also been won through purposive, long-term development, not giveaways. The window of opportunity for a grand demographic dividend is limited to the next decade, and it would be tragic to lose it to populism. Job growth has been weak because the economy has been firing on a single cylinder: consumption. The other cylinders -private investment and exports -have failed. It is easy to get discouraged when jobs are disappearing around the world through technological change. The best course is to stay focused on bettering infrastructure, logistics, ease of doing business, implementing sectoral plans -such as the fine package for the labourintensive textile industry -and resolving NPAs (non-performing assets) of public sector banks.The long-term solution is to bite the bullet and privatise these banks; eliminate the power of politicians to tamper with state electricity boards, and reform labour laws. So, no new schemes, please! Tell people that achhe din will take time; if you are honest, they will believe you. Since non-farm jobs will take time, keep improving the productivity of farm jobs by allowing traders and farmers to buy and sell freely via eNAMs (National Agriculture Market), thus ending the APMC (Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee) raj. Have a predictable export-import regime for farm products rather than the present switch-on, switch-off policy . Get over the unscientific bias against genetically modified crops, which is holding back productivity . On taxes, keep lowering corporate tax rate by 1% a year as committed (while eliminating exemptions) until we get to the effective rate of competitors. Move indirect tax rates closer to where they will be in the Goods and Services Tax. On personal income, stretch out the slabs rather than raising the limit for tax-free income to protect the tax base. Only implement the universal basic income scheme when all subsidies have been scrapped and supporting infrastructure is in place. Whatever the cost-benefit of demonetisation, the Budget must snatch its long-term gains of a wider tax base, higher savings rate, and more resources for investment. Technology has offered a chance to bring banking to the masses. If we seize the opportunity , the aam aadmi can leapfrog over the bank branch into a digital banking future, just as he hopped over the landline with the cellphone.The Budget can fuel this revolution and keep alive the moral crusade against black money . It was a fresh voice that reminded us in early 2014 that the state did not owe us anything except good governance, and it won Modi the election.People want opportunities and jobs, not loan waivers and sops. In fact, Arun Jaitley would do well on Wednesday to quantify the jobs that each lakh of rupees in the Budget will bring. It would be a pity to lose the Narendra Modi who wanted to make vikas a `jan andolan', a mass movement. Views expressed above are the author's own.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Is Narendra Modi turning populist?

In the run-up to the event, the S&P BSE Sensex has already rallied about 2,000 points in last one month or so. The S&P BSE Sensex witnessed strong momentum despite muted global cues this past week and closed 3.1 per cent higher, while the Nifty50 ended 3.5 per cent up. Foreign portfolio investors have sold equities worth Rs 2,139 crore so far this month. This has been far better than Rs 8,176 crore outflow seen in December and Rs 18,224 crore outflow in November. It will be a busy news-heavy week for investors and volatility cannot be ruled out. However, analysts say given the fact that the long-term story remains intact, investors should use every opportunity to buy on dips. \"After the recent surge, we might see a pause for a session or two and it will be healthy for the market ahead of the Union Budget. We suggest traders to book some profit and wait for some consolidation or correction in the index before going for fresh longs,\" Jayant Manglik, President, Retail Distribution, Religare Securities, said. \"Individual stocks, on the other hand, will continue to see volatile moves across the board in anticipation of Budget announcements and also in reaction to the earnings,\" he said. The last days of January will see Motilal Oswal, Bajaj Auto, Cadila Health, Dabur, ICICI Bank, IDFC, IOC, Oil India, and ONGC announcing their results. Going by the buzz on Dalal Street, here is a list of five factors that could chart market direction during the week: Market likely to react to GAAR clarification: One thing foreign investors do not like uncertainty. The tax department's clarification on General Anti-Avoidance Rule (GAAR) on Friday post market hours was a step in the right direction. The clarification has come as a relief for the overseas portfolio investors, who use off-shore derivative instruments known as participatory notes (P-notes) to bet on Indian stocks. The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) on Friday clarified that GAAR will not be invoked against those foreign portfolio investors (FPIs), who can prove their main purpose is not to obtain tax benefits by locating in a certain jurisdiction. Economic Survey and Union Budget 2017: The big event to track this coming week will be the Union Budget 2017, which is scheduled for February 1, as well as the Economic Survey, which will be tabled on January 31. Some analysts on Dalal Street think it will be a populist one to compensate the common man reeling under the impact of demonetisation. A Budget skewed towards populist measures might not go down well with foreign investors. Some experts think it will be a balanced one with a focus on reducing tax liability for individuals to boost consumption, higher infrastructure spends and at the same time adhering to the fiscal consolidation path. \"This time Budget expectations would be more on reducing tax liability for individuals, infrastructure development, strengthening and increasing spending on defence sector,\" Yogesh Mehta, VP-Equity Advisory, MOSL, told ETMarkets.com. \"The Nifty50 has rallied pre-Budget, sustaining and continuation of the rally is dependent on various announcements on direct and indirect taxes and fiscal deficit target, among othera. Any major correction would provide an opportunity to investors,\" he said. January auto sales numbers: Four-wheeler and two-wheeler stocks will be in focus in the coming month as auto sale numbers for January will be announced starting from February 1. Stocks like Maruti Suzuki, Hero MotoCorp, Bajaj Auto and Ashok Leyland will be on the watch list. FOMC Meet: Investors will be watching the US Federal Market Open Committee (FOMC) meeting scheduled for January 31 and February 1 for the outlook for the US economy and interest rates in 2017. However, the US Fed is expected to keep the Fed funds target range unchanged next week. Technical outlook: The domestic market is likely to start on a soft note when it resumes trading on Monday, as traders may unwind some of their long positions built in the closing hours of Friday. Volatility cannot be ruled out ahead of the Budget as well as after the event. Hence, traders are advised to trade with strict stop losses. The Nifty50 has rallied by around 780 points in last five weeks and it might move in the overbought territory, which may creatw a pause or less risk-reward ratio for fresh long positions. \"The index has to hold above 8,580 level to extend its upward move towards 8,700-8,720 zone, while holding below 8,550 might drag it due to profit booking towards 8,510 and then 8,480 levels,\" Chandan Taparia, Derivatives & Technical Analyst - Equity Research at Anand Rathi Financial Services, told ETMarkets.com. On the options front, fresh Put writing was seen at strike prices 8,600, 8,500 and 8,700 while Call writing was seen at strike prices 8,900, 9,000 and 9,100. Option data indicates immediate hurdle at 8,700 level while on the downside, the 8,580 level might provide immediate support to the Nifty5","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"5 factors that are likely to chart mkt direction in the Budget week","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Eastern Europe","countryCode":"BG","country":"Bulgaria"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Bullfax.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"613768328","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"Bullfax.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Business"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bullfax.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199470790","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:51:26Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Why, pickets are asking, does a play apparently set in ancient China have an all-white cast? Howard Barker has said that the protesters are over-literal and that his play, , is a fable which is \u201cessentially\u201d European. The Print Room declared that although the setting \u201creferences\u201d ancient China and \u201cthe characters\u2019 names are Chinese\u201d, this is a way of suggesting that the play takes place \u201cnot here, not now, not in any actual real \u2018where\u2019\u201d.

But how prepared is One Nation to govern, who are Senator Hanson's supporters and what do voters think they're buying from her? \n\nCafe owner Gary Morris prefers things old-school. His cafe in Laidley, an hour's drive from Brisbane, transports diners back in time with its 1950s music. It's also a hub for local workers. \n\n\"I have old-fashioned values, Aussie jobs for Aussie kids,\" Mr Morris said. \n  \nHe wants politicians to focus on similar issues and thinks he's found the answer. \n\n\"Pauline is selling a future for Australia where we're not governed by the interests of big business and political parties furthering their own agenda.\" \n\nA former Labor loyalist, Mr Morris lives in One Nation heartland, where more people support the party than anywhere else in the country. \n\nHe says he's abandoned the established political parties in favour of one that has great ambitions, even if it doesn't wield any real power in a Government. \n\n\"In the case of the Labor Party and all the major parties, I think they've lost their way, they are so out of touch with the man on the street.\" \n\nHe's not alone. Once you get out of the big cities, it's not hard to find people warming to Senator Hanson's style. Not everyone agrees with all her views, but her plain speaking on immigration does resonate and people feel like she's standing up for their jobs and their towns. \n\nMs Hanson isn't afraid to pick a fight with the major political parties, but some supporters concede One Nation may not quite be up to running a Government. \n\n\"They may not have not have the people in the party at the moment but by the time it came to that I'm sure they would,\" supporter Pam Thorley said. \n\nDeputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce said One Nation's plan was ambitious. \n\n\"You've actually got to run the country, it's not just, you know, a soap box to say the issue of the day. You've actually got to run a department, balance the books,\" he said. \n\nQueensland Education Minister, Labor's Kate Jones, argued One Nation's policies would not deliver employment opportunities. \n\n\"Our focus is on jobs and job creation of Queensland. Banning a burqa does not create new jobs in Queensland,\" she said. \n\nMs Hanson said One Nation is campaigning to win the next Queensland election and insisted her party was capable of running the state's health, transport and education departments, for example. \n  \n\"Oh listen, don't talk about transport system, the trains shut down here they didn't have the drivers. Then we had the health problems they weren't even getting the pays right,\" Senator Hanson said. \n\n\"So it's about time someone took over the reins, maybe we can deliver far better services.\" \n\nPolitical analyst Geoff Cockfield is based in the regional Queensland town of Toowoomba, at the University of Southern Queensland. \n\nHe said One Nation could have more success in regional areas in upcoming polls, but warned they don't have much power yet. \n\n\"One Nation, even with a good Senate result, doesn't hold the balance of power in their own right so they are a player but they aren't the only player,\" Professor Cockfield said. \n\nSenator Hanson has promised to curb Muslim immigration and ban the burka, but Professor Cockfield said that does not necessarily translate to political success. \n\n\"Whether those are policies that ever have any outcome who knows, but that doesn't particularly matter because that's not the design of them.\" \n\nThere's another group of people following One Nation closely. \n\nGrain grower Wayne Newton, a more \"centre-leaning\" voter, farms near Dalby on Queensland's Darling Downs. It's a pretty safe LNP area, but many feel ignored by the major parties. \n  \n\"It's almost like we're not to be worried about at the moment, either side knows who we're going to vote for so that's the end of the matter, let's move on,\" Mr Newton said. \n\n\"Whereas you actually go to those seats that are in much closer balance, well they do listen a lot more to the people in those seats. They do consider a lot more of what they're asking for.\" \n\nSenator Hanson will try to capitalise on that voter frustration, as she continues her state campaigns while balancing her responsibilities in federal politics.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"political reporter Caitlyn Gribbin"},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Pauline Hanson's One Nation party is on the rise but who's voting for her and why?","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"AU","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"ABC Online","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169587933","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"506"},"name":"ABC Online","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society","Religion"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.abc.net.au","publisher":"Australian Broadcasting Corporation"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199474762","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:51:27Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

That's something you've got to get through, the first 10-15 overs are crucial. With the line-up that we play, if we can have wickets in the shed at the back end then we will score a lot of runs at the end of the (innings).\" \n \nThe keeper found out the perils of taking on Eden Park's small boundaries when he played at the ground for the first time last February, caught at cow corner trying to heave Corey Anderson over the ropes. \n \nThe Australians were all out for 148 on that occasion, with the Black Caps' seamers running riot on the way to a 2-1 series win. It was a similar story a year earlier, with the Aussies skittled for 151 in a World Cup clash that the Kiwis only won by a wicket. \n \nAt the same time, Eden Park's unusual dimensions have resulted in big scores before. Although the tourists failed to pass 150 last time around, New Zealand posted a score of 8-307 in the same game. \n \nIndeed, before Australia's innings that day, seven of the last eight innings at the ground had gone past 280 runs. \n \n\"(The Eden Park pitch) just has a bit in it,\" New Zealand veteran Ross Taylor said. \"I don't think there is a par score, some wickets here are 300, some are 200. \n \n\"You just have to analyse it as quickly as possible, whether you're batting or bowling.\" \n \nThe Kiwis were trounced 3-0 in Australia when the sides met in December, but Wade is expecting a tougher time on New Zealand's turf. \n \n\"We played them in Australia (on) big grounds (with) long boundaries. It's a completely different ball game,\" he said. \n \n\"(On) the smaller grounds (in New Zealand) they'll still play aggressive; they're still going to be able to hit plenty of fours and sixes at grounds that they play at. \n \n\"They play well here (in NZ) and they play this venue very well. \n \n\"We like to think we're hard to beat in Australia and it's the same when we come here - we expect a hard challenge over the next three games but we've got a young squad and we're excited to go out and really have a crack at it.\" \n \nCaptaining the side for the first time, Wade maintains his job is simply to continue the fine work of the leadership duo of Steve Smith and vice-captain David Warner. \n \n\"I don't think for me personally it's about putting a stamp on the team,\" he said. \"It's about driving the values and the game plan that we have in one-day cricket moving forward. \n \n\"Steven and David have put their stamp on the team, it's just about me keeping on driving those key messages through to the players. \n \n\"We've performed really well in one-day cricket over a long period of time so it's not about trying to change too much - it's about keeping the ball rolling.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"New Zealand news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Aussies wary of Black Caps on home turf","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"AU","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Balonne Beacon","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"606907262","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Balonne Beacon","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.balonnebeacon.com.au"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199477164","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T00:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:51:29Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

And a piano prize-winner\u2019s UK debut A long, frozen winter, the surprise of spring renewal, bird song and folk melody: Rimsky-Korsakov\u2019s The Snow Maiden (1882) pulls us deep into the poetic world of Russian folklore and the story of the ice girl who will melt if exposed to the sun. Only with her death can winter end. That sudden moment when white turns to water and spring bursts has long obsessed Russian artists \u2013 novelists, playwrights, landscape painters, but no one more potently than Stravinsky in his ballet The Rite of Spring. Rimsky\u2019s opera, gentle in comparison but not without its raw moments, opened Opera North\u2019s 2017 season of fairytale operas. A mentor to so many of his fellow Russian composers, Rimsky was at his most brilliant in the kitchen of orchestration John Fulljames\u2019s new staging is described as the first \"full professional production\" in this country for 60 years. In Russia it remains mainstream. Numerous versions exist of the archetypal tale, its origins probably Slavic. Arthur Ransome introduced the icicle maid in his Old Peter\u2019s Russian Tales. Rimsky-Korsakov based his libretto on Alexander Ostrovsky\u2019s play, a more elaborate and adult affair spurned by the literary world. Tolstoy, usually a fan, found it dull. You can see why, but it makes an ideal foil for music. A mentor to so many of his fellow Russian composers, Rimsky was at his most brilliant in the kitchen of orchestration. The solo woodwind, clarinet especially, and the vivid splash of Russian, eastern and western styles makes The Snow Maiden instantly enchanting. Using the if-you-like-this ploy, usually quite unreliable, anyone should feel confident to try this rarity by the composer of that popular symphonic suite, Scheherazade. Fascinating, too, is the way this music points towards the 20th century. Stravinsky was Rimsky\u2019s student; the younger composer\u2019s Funeral Song, found recently and performed last month in St Petersburg, was dedicated to Rimsky\u2019s memory. The quirky marches of Shostakovich and Prokofiev are there too, incipient in their irony. The Snow Maiden: reinventing a Russian folk opera for modern Britain Read more Yet The Snow Maiden is an odd, lopsided work in Rimsky\u2019s fluent telling. The first half concentrates on customary folk-fairy elements \u2013 lost girl, benign ruler, ritual pricking, pinching and beating of one dubious character. The remaining two acts expand into a more affecting human love story, with ambitious, lyrical music and memorable arias and choruses, enthusiastically delivered by the forces of Opera North conducted by Leo McFall in his company debut. Some of the jigsaw refused to fit together. Giles Cadle\u2019s sets, with costumes by Christina Cunningham and video designs by Will Duke, looked attractive in a busy, brightly coloured picture-book way.\n\nNo distinction is made between traditional and contemporary. Lel, the trouser-role love interest engagingly portrayed by Heather Lowe, carries a smartphone. The village women work in a sewing sweatshop straight out of The Pajama Game, producing clothes for all seasons, from jeans to bridal gowns, which bob by on a pulley behind them. Spring Beauty, touchingly sung by Yvonne Howard, wore a traditional sun headdress and green cloak, while Father Frost \u2013 the Snow Maiden was a product of their careless liaison \u2013 was robustly delivered by a silver-coated James Creswell. The crystal-voiced Aoife Miskelly was a canny choice for the title role, with Elin Pritchard generous and winningly blowsy as the vodka-steeped Kupava. Heather Lowe as Lel and Elin Pritchard as Kupava. Photograph: Richard Hubert Smith It\u2019s hard to pinpoint what was missing. Perhaps the restraints of the slim story were too sorely exposed when sung in an artful English translation by Alasdair Middleton. Opera North\u2019s flexibility in performing some works in English, some in the original language as they see best, is admirable. Here, though, you needed the rich sounds of Russian, as integral to Rimsky-Korsakov\u2019s palette as the hearty choruses of boyars and village peasants. Ensemble was not always good, and some of the cast suffered intonation problems \u2013 all of which could be attributed to first-night nerves. The production tried too hard, resulting in a confusion between stylisation and naturalism. Next on the fairytale front: Humperdinck\u2019s Hansel and Gretel (Susan Bullock\u2019s Witch is sure to be one of the unmissable performances of the season) and Rossini\u2019s La Cenerentola. \u2018Meticulous\u2019: Luca Burrato at Wigmore Hall. Photograph: Katherine Anne Rose for the Observer Whatever you think about piano competitions, if you think about them at all \u2013 with so many around, the instinct to ignore them is understandable \u2013 some stand out as important. The Honens, taking place every three years in Calgary, Canada, is one. The 24-year-old Italian Luca Buratto, the 2015 prize laureate, attracted a crowd of serious pianists and pianophiles to Wigmore Hall for his UK debut last week. One appeal was the interesting programme, which ranged from a John Dowland pavan (arranged by William Byrd) to Thomas Adès\u2019s Darknesse visible, to Beethoven\u2019s Appassionata and Schumann\u2019s majestic Fantasie. Graceful, analytical, meticulous, Buratto is a name to watch. His playing is economical of gesture and outward expression. Next time perhaps he will allow himself a flicker of smile when he takes his bow. Without compromising his integrity and reserve, he now needs to let rip. Then the results should be not just formidable but hotly compelling.\n\nStar ratings (out of 5)\n\nThe Snow Maiden ★★★\n\nLuca Buratto ★★★★\n\nThe Snow Maiden is in rep at the Grand theatre, Leeds

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 24 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Cumberland","zipCode":"04101","state":"Maine","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Portland","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WMTW","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659817","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"89"},"name":"WMTW","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Recreation"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wmtw.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199479201","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:51:30Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The \"sanitised\" report was declassified recently by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). \n \nThe report, whose complete title is not available as it is part deleted, was prepared on the basis of inputs available to the CIA till January 1986. \n \nThe very first sentence of the report's available (undeleted) page reads, \"Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi faces at least an even chance of assassination before his tenure in office ends in 1989.\" It, however, later clearly said that \"assassination is the major near-term threat\" to him. \n \nOver five years later, Gandhi was assassinated at Sriperumbudur in Tamil Nadu on May 21, 1991. \n \nThe first section titled \"Key Judgments\" analyses and deliberates upon what likely scenario would emerge in the domestic and international political situation if there is a sudden change in leadership minus Rajiv Gandhi and the likely impact on India's relations with the US, the then USSR and the region. \n \nIt also dealt with the threats posed to Gandhi's life by various extremist groups at that time and the likely consequences of his murder. \n \n\"If Gandhi fell to a Sikh or Kashmiri Muslim assassin, widespread communal violence probably would erupt even if strong preventive security measures - including deployment of Army and paramilitary troops across northern India \u2013 were taken by the Indian President ......(deleted),\" it said. \n \nInterestingly, it also named P V Narasimha Rao and V P Singh, as the \"interim successor\" and \"likely candidates\" in case of a sudden exit by Gandhi. Rao took over as the Prime Minister in 1991. \n \nIn a section, titled The Threat of Assassination: Stability in Jeopardy , the report says \"In our view, there is at least an even chance in the next several years of an assassination, most likely by extremist Sikhs or disgruntled Kashmiri Muslims who have targeted Rajiv,\" besides \"a fanatical Hindu\". \n \nSince a significant portion of this section is deleted, it is not clear whether Sri Lankan Tamil extremists were also included in the analysis. However, another section deals in-depth with Gandhi's mediation efforts to resolve \"the conflict between militant Sri Lankan Tamils and the Sinhalese-dominated government in Colombo...\" \n \nBesides Gandhi's possible assassination, the report also analysed various scenarios of his \"abrupt departure\" from the political scene before 1989. \n \n\"Although we believe assassination is the major near-term threat to Rajiv's tenure, any of several other events could cause his abrupt departure from the political scene before 1989,\" it said while listing out several other possibilities including \"his death from natural causes or by accident\". \n \nIt ruled out the possibility of a decision by him \"to resign out of frustration\", saying \"we see no signs of this and believe it would be out of character\". \n \nThe CIA report also noted, \"We suspect, however, that Rajiv would calculate -- as we do -- that he and his kin would be targets for extremist violence even if he left public office.\" \n \nIn a section called \"Implications for the United States\", the report says \"We believe (Rajiv) Gandhi's death would represent a significant blow to US interests, regardless of the circumstances of the succession.\" \n \nIt also added, \"...We believe Indo-US relations could also suffer as a result of domestic political changes following Rajiv's assassination.\" \n \nThe report assessed Gandhi's policies ranging from dealing with extremists, foreign relations (including Sri Lankan Tamil issue) to promoting acquisition of selected foreign technology\" among others, and their outcome. \n \n\"Although some of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's policies will continue to encounter serious resistance over the next several years, we believe his dominance of the Indian political scene is secure until at least the end of his present term of office in December 1989, barring his incapacitation or death,\" it said. \n \nThe report also dealt with the possibility of a \"national government\" taking over in case of a sudden exit by Gandhi, while discounting the possibility of a military coup in such a scenario. \n \nSeveral portions of the 23-page report were deleted before the CIA decided to release it under the Freedom of Information Act.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Indian subcontinent news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Sri Lanka news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"}],"title":"CIA assessed Rajiv Gandhi\u2019s assassination 5 yrs before his death","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Deccan Chronicle","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169673440","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"137"},"name":"Deccan Chronicle","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.deccanchronicle.com/"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199484916","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:51:36Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Kennedy Airport, where 12 refugees were detained Saturday. Celebrities including \"Sex and the City\" actress Cynthia Nixon joined the demonstration. \"What Donald Trump did in the last 24 hours is disgusting, disgraceful and completely un-American and I'm here in protest,\" said protester Pamela French. The agency that runs the airport tried to restore order by shutting down the train that runs to airport terminals. Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, reversed that decision, saying people had a right to protest. \"The people of New York will have their voices heard,\" he said in a statement. \n \n___ \n \nNEWARK, NEW JERSEY \n \nMore than 120 people clutching signs denouncing the Trump immigration orders gathered at Newark Liberty International Airport. NorthJersey.com reports that they joined lawyers who'd rushed to the airport to defend the rights of refugees and immigrants who were being detained and denied entry. \n \n___ \n \nFAIRFAX, VIRGINIA \n \nDozens of protesters inside Washington Dulles International Airport chanted \"Love, Not Hate, Makes America Great\" and \"Say It Loud, Say it Clear, Muslims Are Welcome Here,\" as travelers walked through a terminal to a baggage claim area to collect luggage and greet their loved ones. There was a heavy police presence during the peaceful protest. Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe said during a press conference at Dulles that he has asked Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring to look into \"all legal remedies\" available to help individuals who may be detained in Virginia. \n \n___ \n \nDENVER \n \nDozens of people converged on Denver International to show their support for refugees. Standing in the main terminal Saturday, they sang \"Refugees are welcome here.\" Some held signs declaring their identity, such as Jew or Christian, and the phrase \"I come in peace.\" Denver has some direct international flights but it wasn't clear whether anyone has been detained under the president's executive order. \n \n___ \n \nCHICAGO \n \nA crowd of demonstrators held a rally at O'Hare International Airport. The Chicago Sun-Times reports protesters blocked vehicle traffic to O'Hare's international terminal for a time. The newspaper says some arriving travelers joined the protest, while others were upset by the demonstrations. \n \nLawyers working with the International Refugee Assistance Project tell the Chicago Tribune that 17 people who had been detained at O'Hare all released by late Saturday. \n \nAmong those released before the federal judge's order was Hessan Noorian, a suburban Park Ridge resident returning with his family from Iran, the Tribune reported. \n \nNoorian, who is of British and Iranian citizenship and has a green card, was detained at O'Hare after he and his wife, Zahra Amirisefat, a U.S. citizen, arrived from Tehran, the newspaper said. \n \nThe couple, who told the Tribune that they work at a community college in the Chicago area, said they were questioned for five hours. \n \nAfter Noorian was released, his wife told the Tribune: \"I can't believe something like this can happen to someone with a green card.\" \n \n__ \n \nDALLAS \n \nProtesters who gathered at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport Saturday evening voiced their displeasure with Trump's executive order. The crowd of a few dozen ballooned into hundreds of demonstrators who frequently chanted \"Set them free!\" At times, cheers erupted from the crowd as those who were detained got released. \n \nAmong those still held at the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport at midnight Saturday was a 70-year-old Iranian widow, Shahin Hassanpour, whose son said she suffers from high blood pressure and had breast cancer surgery four years ago. She obtained an immigrant visa in November on her son's petition. \n \nBahzad Honarjou, a 43-year-old network engineer, said he spoke twice to his mother by phone after her 9 a.m. arrival, but that they hadn't talked since courts stayed the executive order, meaning she should have been released. \n \nHundreds of protesters stood in the waiting area and chanted \"This is what democracy looks like.\" \n \nImmigration agents were not being very communicative, Honarjou said. \n \n\"They were like a machine when I talked to them today,\" he said. His mother only speaks a few words of English and a fellow passenger was translating for her from her native Farsi as no immigration agents spoke the language, he said. \n \nHassanpour was originally going to be deported on a Sunday flight, she informed her son the first time they spoke. \n \n\"She was about to cry,\" he said. \"She is not able to take (tolerate) a 20-hour flight back to Iran.\" \n \nHonarjou said he is a U.S. citizen, obtained entry in a lottery, and has been in the country for seven years. Why did he come? \n \n\"To have a better life and to make more money,\" he said. \"And, you know, for the freedom.\" \n \n___ \n \nSEATTLE \n \nAbout 1,000 protesters gathered at Seattle-Tacoma Airport, sitting down in the concourse with a large American flag reading \"We are America.\" Aayah Khalaf, a Muslim American, was sitting at home watching the protest on television when she and her friend studying from Egypt decided to join the rally. It was her second time joining a protest. The first one was the Women's March. \"It's not just against Muslims. It against environmental rights and human rights overall.

US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has briefed the global trade group that passport-holders from states such as Iran and Iraq, including cabin crew, will be barred entry to the United States, IATA said in an email to its member airlines, seen by Reuters. The email underscores airlines' confusion about the situation as well as the challenge some may face from crew scheduling. Airlines also stand to lose business: for instance, around 35,000 travelers from Iran visited the United States in 2015, according to the US Department of Homeland Security. \"Much of this development has come over the weekend and at a time when IATA's Facilitation team has been on duty travel. Unfortunately, our response has been slower than we would have preferred,\" the email said. \"A number (of questions) have yet to be resolved.\" The executive order by President Donald Trump bans travelers with passports from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days. IATA was informed that lawful permanent residents of the United States - or green-card holders - from those countries are not included in the ban. However, a Trump administration official told reporters that green-card holders from the countries need to check with a US consulate to see whether they can return, causing some confusion for airlines, which still plan to follow CBP guidance. Qatar Airways said earlier on its website yesterday that passengers would need a green card or diplomatic visa to enter the United States.

Kennedy Airport, where 12 refugees were detained Saturday. Celebrities including \"Sex and the City\" actress Cynthia Nixon joined the demonstration. \"What Donald Trump did in the last 24 hours is disgusting, disgraceful and completely un-American and I'm here in protest,\" said protester Pamela French. The agency that runs the airport tried to restore order by shutting down the train that runs to airport terminals. Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, reversed that decision, saying people had a right to protest. \"The people of New York will have their voices heard,\" he said in a statement. NEWARK, NEW JERSEY\n\nMore than 120 people clutching signs denouncing the Trump immigration orders gathered at Newark Liberty International Airport. NorthJersey.com reports that they joined lawyers who'd rushed to the airport to defend the rights of refugees and immigrants who were being detained and denied entry. Dozens of protesters inside Washington Dulles International Airport chanted \"Love, Not Hate, Makes America Great\" and \"Say It Loud, Say it Clear, Muslims Are Welcome Here,\" as travelers walked through a terminal to a baggage claim area to collect luggage and greet their loved ones. There was a heavy police presence during the peaceful protest. Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe said during a press conference at Dulles that he has asked Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring to look into \"all legal remedies\" available to help individuals who may be detained in Virginia. Dozens of people converged on Denver International to show their support for refugees. Standing in the main terminal Saturday, they sang \"Refugees are welcome here.\" Some held signs declaring their identity, such as Jew or Christian, and the phrase \"I come in peace.\" Denver has some direct international flights but it wasn't clear whether anyone has been detained under the president's executive order. A crowd of demonstrators held a rally at O'Hare International Airport. The Chicago Sun-Times reports protesters blocked vehicle traffic to O'Hare's international terminal for a time. The newspaper says some arriving travelers joined the protest, while others were upset by the demonstrations.\n\nLawyers working with the International Refugee Assistance Project tell the Chicago Tribune that 17 people who had been detained at O'Hare all released by late Saturday.\n\nAmong those released before the federal judge's order was Hessan Noorian, a suburban Park Ridge resident returning with his family from Iran, the Tribune reported.\n\nNoorian, who is of British and Iranian citizenship and has a green card, was detained at O'Hare after he and his wife, Zahra Amirisefat, a U.S. citizen, arrived from Tehran, the newspaper said.\n\nThe couple, who told the Tribune that they work at a community college in the Chicago area, said they were questioned for five hours.\n\nAfter Noorian was released, his wife told the Tribune: \"I can't believe something like this can happen to someone with a green card.\" Protesters who gathered at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport Saturday evening voiced their displeasure with Trump's executive order. The crowd of a few dozen ballooned into hundreds of demonstrators who frequently chanted \"Set them free!\" At times, cheers erupted from the crowd as those who were detained got released.\n\nAmong those still held at the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport at midnight Saturday was a 70-year-old Iranian widow, Shahin Hassanpour, whose son said she suffers from high blood pressure and had breast cancer surgery four years ago. She obtained an immigrant visa in November on her son's petition.\n\nBahzad Honarjou, a 43-year-old network engineer, said he spoke twice to his mother by phone after her 9 a.m. arrival, but that they hadn't talked since courts stayed the executive order, meaning she should have been released.\n\nHundreds of protesters stood in the waiting area and chanted \"This is what democracy looks like.\"\n\nImmigration agents were not being very communicative, Honarjou said.\n\n\"They were like a machine when I talked to them today,\" he said. His mother only speaks a few words of English and a fellow passenger was translating for her from her native Farsi as no immigration agents spoke the language, he said.\n\nHassanpour was originally going to be deported on a Sunday flight, she informed her son the first time they spoke.\n\n\"She was about to cry,\" he said. \"She is not able to take (tolerate) a 20-hour flight back to Iran.\"\n\nHonarjou said he is a U.S. citizen, obtained entry in a lottery, and has been in the country for seven years. Why did he come?\n\n\"To have a better life and to make more money,\" he said. \"And, you know, for the freedom.\" About 1,000 protesters gathered at Seattle-Tacoma Airport, sitting down in the concourse with a large American flag reading \"We are America.\" Aayah Khalaf, a Muslim American, was sitting at home watching the protest on television when she and her friend studying from Egypt decided to join the rally. It was her second time joining a protest. The first one was the Women's March. \"It's not just against Muslims. It against environmental rights and human rights overall. I think everybody has to stand up against this,\" said Khalaf, 29. A protest by several dozen people in and around Portland International Airport briefly disrupted light rail service at the airport. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports that the demonstrators carried signs and chanted \"Say it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here\" and \"No ban no wall America is for us all.\" About 300 people expressed their displeasure with the ban at Los Angeles International Airport Saturday night. Protesters entered the airport's Tom Bradley International Terminal after holding a candlelight vigil.\n\nAvriel Epps held a candle and a large photo a drowned 3-year-old Syrian boy who washed up on a Turkish beach in 2015 and became a haunting symbol of the Syrian refugee crisis. Hundreds of protesters blocked the street outside at San Francisco International Airport's international terminal to express their opposition to the barring of some people from Muslim-majority nations. As motorists honked their support, demonstrators outside San Diego International Airport chanted \"No hate, no fear, everyone is welcome here.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Airline industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Political unrest news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Protests erupt at airports following Trump travel ban","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Lauderdale","zipCode":"35630","state":"Alabama","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Florence","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Times Daily","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169663374","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"456"},"name":"Times Daily","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.timesdaily.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://NorthJersey.com/"],"sequenceId":"695199511960","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:28:05Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:51:49Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/timesdaily.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/ca/8cad16ca-9de6-5332-91aa-38de9a68e60d/588d9d9931334.image.jpg?resize=512%2C335"},{"url":"http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/timesdaily.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/ca/8cad16ca-9de6-5332-91aa-38de9a68e60d/588d9d9931334.image.jpg?resize=300%2C196"}],"video":[]}}

In the lawsuit filed in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, the two men challenged Trump's directive on constitutional grounds. The suit said their connections to US forces made them targets in their home country and that the pair had valid visas to enter the United States. The lawsuit highlights some of the legal obstacles facing Trump's new administration as it tries to carry out the directive, which the president signed late on Friday to impose a four-month ban on refugees entering the United States and a 90-day hold on travelers from Syria, Iran and five other Muslim-majority countries. In an emergency ruling on Saturday, US District Judge Ann Donnelly ordered US authorities to refrain from deporting previously approved refugees as well as \"approved holders of valid immigrant and non-immigrant visas and other individuals ... legally authorized to enter the United States\" from the countries targeted in Trump's order. The American Civil Liberties Union, which sought the temporary stay, said it would help about 100 to 200 people who found themselves detained in transit or at US airports after Trump signed the order. \"I am directing the government to stop removal if there is someone right now in danger of being removed,\" Donnelly said in the court hearing. \"No one is to be removed in this class.\" Many of the people in a huge crowd that had gathered outside the Brooklyn courthouse broke out into cheers after word of the ruling filtered out. It was not immediately clear if the ruling would require the US government to allow travelers detained at airports to enter the United States or would only prevent their deportation back to the countries from where they came. \"This has unfolded with such speed that we haven't had an opportunity to address all the legal issues,\" U.S. Department of Justice attorney Susan Riley said during the emergency hearing. \"TARGETED BY TERRORISTS\" The plight of one of the men who brought the lawsuit, a former US Army interpreter who was detained at John F Kennedy International Airport, is especially compelling, said David Leopold, a former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, who is not involved in the suit. \"Here is a guy who was a translator who worked for the US military for years, who himself was targeted by terrorists,\" he said. \"It is clear that if he is sent back, he is facing a direct threat to his life.\" That man, Hameed Khalid Darweesh, was released later yesterday and told a crowd of reporters at JFK Airport that he did not have ill feelings about his detention. \"America is the greatest nation, the greatest people in the world,\" he said. Darweesh, 53, worked for the US Army and for a US contractor in Iraq from 2003 to 2013 as an interpreter and engineer, the lawsuit said. The second plaintiff, Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, 33, was also detained at JFK Airport but has since been released. He is the husband of an Iraqi woman who worked for a US contractor in Iraq. She already lives in Houston, the suit said. Trump, a Republican, has said his order would help protect Americans from terrorist attacks. The lawsuit on behalf of the Iraqis challenges Trump's order on several grounds. It says the order violates the US Constitution's guarantee of due process by taking away their ability to apply for asylum, and violates the guarantee of equal protection by discriminating against them on the basis of their country of origin without sufficient justification. It also says the order violates procedural requirements of federal rulemaking. The next hearing in the case was set for February 10. Supporters of the order say the president has wide authority to limit the entry of foreign nationals from specific countries when it is in the national interest. \"Even if they do and they win, my answer is so what?\" said Mark Krikorian, the director of the conservative Center for Immigration Studies. \"We are talking a few dozen people - that is just a last-ditch effort to get the last few people in. It doesn't really change the policy,\" he said. Trump's order does not mention specific religions but Trump said in an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network on Friday he was acting to help Christians in Syria who were \"horribly treated.\" Comments like that could come back to haunt the president in litigation over his order, said Hiroshi Motomura, an immigration expert at UCLA School of Law. \"There were comments during the campaign that focused very much on religion as the target,\" Motomura said. \"If the record showed that the origins of a particular measure were based on targeting a particular group, that could be challenged in court.\" REUTERS SHS RK1","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Terrorism news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Lawsuits news","group":"Business"}],"title":"Two Iraqis lead legal fight against Trump order blocking entry","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"NetIndia123.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169687461","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"NetIndia123.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard","Global","Geographic"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.netindia123.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199513053","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:51:51Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Saturday night's ruling came in response to a challenge filed on behalf of two Iraqi men detained Friday night at JFK International Airport and impacted up to 200 others held across the country. \n \nAn unknown number of others intending to come back to the United States are trapped in other countries, unable to board planes. \n\n \nJudge Ann Donnelly's emergency stay, issued after an emergency hearing in Brooklyn, does not allow those detained at airports and those  in transit Saturday to enter or re-enter the United States. Her ruling, however, prevents the government from returning them to their home countries. Dozens of airport arrivals remain in limbo, unable to enter the country. \n \nThe judge also ordered the federal government to turn over a list of everyone currently being detained. \n \nShe did not rule on the constitutionality of Trump's order. And the order did nothing to quell the uncertainty and chaos at U.S. entry points caused by the order, issued without notice and little or no guidance to immigration agents on how to handle those arriving. \n\n \nTrump made no exception for people already vetted and admitted into the country legally but who were out of the country when he signed the executive order. \n \nOne of the Iraqi men, who was handcuffed at JFK Airport, worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Army in Iraq for 10 years. He had been granted a special immigrant visa. He was among dozens of people stopped at airports around the United States on Saturday. At Chicago's O'Hare International Airport , as many as 18 people were reportedly detained, including children and a man with a green card returning from a family wedding in Saudi Arabia . The detentions at the nation's major airports moved thousands of people to arrive at airports in New York, Chicago, Boston, San Francisco and other cities to protest, chanting \"let them in\" and \"this is what democracy looks like.\" \n \n\"We won,\" said the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Voting Rights Project, Dale Ho, reacting to the ruling. \n \nJack Vimo, policy analyst for the National Immigration Law Center, said the lawyers for the two JFK detainees met four crucial factors: \n the executive order causes irreparable harm; they have a likelihood of success on merits; there is no harm to the government; there is a likelihood of receiving class certification. \nVimo tweeted that the ACLU informed the judge the government was putting someone on a plane back to Syria. The judge saw that as putting someone at risk of irreparable harm. \n \nThe ACLU said it will continue to file suits on behalf of anyone who is stopped. \n \nIt was not clear if the government would appeal the judge's ruling. If it does, both sides will file briefs and a hearing will likely be held within days. \n\n \nShortly after the ruling, another judge, hearing a similar case in the federal court in Virginia, struck another blow against Trump's order. \n \nJudge Leonie Brinkema ordered that the government refrain from deporting any green-card holders being detained at Dulles International Airport and allow lawyers to meet with the detainees. \n\nA third federal judge - this one in Washington - also ordered a stay. \n\nJudge Thomas Zilly granted an emergency stay forbidding the government from removing two individuals from the United States until a hearing next week. \n\nThere are also cases pending in Chicago, New York, and other cities. \n \nTrump's executive order \u2014 which exempts certain diplomats traveling to the United States but does not mention those legally residing in the country as lawful permanent residents or with student or employment visas who might be returning to the U.S. \u2014 has created a new class of detainees in the United States. \n\n \nLawyers involved in the case heard in Brooklyn put the number of those held at 100 to 200. \n \nWhile many of Trump's executive orders have been met with criticism for their message, the immigrant ban has already had real impact on real people. \n \nThe seven countries in the order are not named but officials say they include Iraq, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Iran, Yemen and Sudan. Trump's order also bans the resettlement of refugees for four months and indefinitely suspends the entry of Syrian refugees. \n\n \nPeople who had been given visas to enter the United States after putting their families at risk by helping American troops were stopped as they exited airplanes arriving in airports in New York, Philadelphia, Boston, Dallas, and other cities. \n \nThe lawyers for two Iraqis who had been granted visas to enter the United States and were detained at John F. Kennedy airport, also are seeking class certification so that they can similarly represent all individuals covered by the executive order. That includes people with approved refugee applications, holders of valid immigrant and non-immigrant visas and other individuals from the seven countries banned by the executive order but who would have otherwise been granted legal admission to the U.S. \n \nWhen signing the order, Trump said it was aimed at keeping out \"radical Islamic terrorists.\" \n \nLawyers consulted by ProPublica said the ban could apply to hundreds of thousands of people from these countries who already live in the U.S. under green cards or on temporary student or employee visas. Reuters reported that green card holders from the seven countries who are now out of the U.S. will have to be cleared on a case-by-case basis to re-enter. \n \nA State Department statement reviewed by the Wall Street Journal but not been officially released says the ban would also apply to citizens of those seven countries who hold dual nationality. A federal law enforcement official told The Associated Press that those already in the U.S. with a visa or a green card would be allowed to stay. \n \nA senior administration official pushed back on the idea that the order was a Muslim ban, listing several predominantly Muslim countries that were not affected by the ban. \n \n\"We\u2019re dealing with a relatively small universe of people,\" the official said. \"It\u2019s important to keep in mind that no person living or residing overseas has a right to entry to the U.S.\" \n \nAsked about the immigration executive order on Saturday, Trump said it was not a Muslim ban. \n \n\"It\u2019s working out very nicely,\" he said. \"You see it at the airports, you see it all over.\u201d \n \nThe administration is still working to define \"in transit\" for the purposes of the hardship exemption for refugees who have been approved to enter the United States but are currently in a third country, according to the official. \n \nThe ACLU has lawyers stationed at airports across the country. \"If you know someone entering country, tell them not to sign anything before talking to lawyer,\" the ACLU tweeted . \n \nEven after the stay was issued Saturday night, it wasn't immediately clear what would happen to refugees and immigrants detained at airports across the country. \n \nAt JFK International Airport in New York City, dozens of attorneys huddled in the Terminal 1 arrivals hall attempted to explain to anxious family members what would happen to their relatives, who were still in federal custody. \n \nJennifer Johnson, another attorney volunteering Saturday at JFK, said she and others were still being denied access to the detainees. She said that tried to deliver a printed copy of the stay to the airport's CBP headquarters, but officers wouldn't accept it \u2014 so she slipped it under the door. \n \n\"Where are our clients? Where are our friends? Where are our family members?\" she said. \"Let's talk about the people still detained.\" \n\n \nSoon after, one Syrian woman in a wheelchair was released from Terminal 8 at JFK. \n \nIn Chicago, where the international terminal was packed with protesters, both inside and out, tearful reunions took place amid cheers as some detainees were released. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, responding to the O'Hare detentions, blasted the president's actions. \n \nTrump's actions \"have tarnished America's standing as a beacon of hope for the free world,\" Emanuel saidin a statement. \"Following the stay that was granted this evening, I am calling on the federal government to immediately produce a list of the names of anyone currently being detained at O'Hare or Midway airports, and calling on those unjustly affected to immediately be released and allowed access to legal counsel.\" \n\n\nAfter the judge's ruling in Brooklyn, those detained in Chicago were released. \n \nNBC Philadelphia reported two Syrian families detained at Philadelphia Airport were sent home on a return flight. The New York Times reported that the trip of a Syrian family of six headed for a new life to Ohio had been called off. According to the Times, a young Iranian woman and her family were ordered to leave a flight that had stopped in Istanbul. \n\n \nSEE ALSO: \n \nHameed Khalid Darweesh, one of the Iraqis detained at JFK, had worked on behalf of the U.S. in Iraq for 10 years and the other, Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, was coming to join his wife and young son who live in Houston. \n\n \nDarweesh and his family were granted special immigrant visas, according to the lawsuit. Between 2003 and 2013, he worked for the U.S. military and two U.S. government projects. Because of his association with the U.S. Armed Forces, the lawsuit states he was directly targeted twice. To obtain the special immigrant visa, Darweesh had to obtain a Chief of Mission approval from the embassy, a lengthy process that determines whether the applicant provided a \"faithful and valuable service to the United States.\" \n \nAfter receiving COM approval in January 2015, he and his family were granted the visas on Jan. 25, 2017. The suit states that they immediately boarded a flight to the U.S. because of the sensitive and dangerous nature of Darweesh's situation. \n \nDarweesh was later released from detention. Photos posted to Twitter by New York representatives Jerry Nadler and Lydia Velazquez showed Darweesh standing with the two representatives past the passport control and customs section of the airport. \n \nAt a press conference outside the airport, Darweesh thanked those who supported him. \n \n\"This is the humanity, this is the soul of America,\" he said. \n \n\"I'm very happy, really I forget what all I faced, whatever happened to me.\" \n \nAsked by a reporter what he thought of America, Darweesh replied that \"America is the greatest nation, the greatest people in the world.\" \n \nDarweesh worked as an interpreter for Brandon Friedman, who posted a photo of the two from 2003. \n \nThe second man, Alshawi, had been given a Follow to Join Visa to be with his wife and young son. His wife worked as an accountant for a U.S. contractor in 2006, as did her brother, which made them a target for insurgents, according to the lawsuit. She applied for refugee status for her and her son in 2011 and the two currently live in the country as lawful permanent residents. \n \nAlshawi's wife, who identified herself as D to the New York Times , said their 7-year-old son did not know that his father was coming home. \n \n\u201cIt was a surprise for him,\u201d she told the Times. \n \nNew York representatives Nydia Velazquez and Jerry Nadler, went to the airport to help those being detained. Velazquez says she was told by CBP agents that they are waiting for direction from the Department of Homeland Security to act. A protest at JFK  Saturday targeted the detention. \n \nChants of  \"hey hey JFK, no more fascist USA,\" and \"no hate, no hear, Muslims are welcome here,\" could be heard coming from the crowd. Around 300 people were gathered across the street from Terminal 4 at JFK near the arrivals area and the number was swelling. \n \nSpeaking at the protest, Becca Heller, director of the International Refugee Assistance Project, said in addition to Alshawi there were 10 others being detained at JFK but the organization was unable to take legal action on their behalf because their names had not been released. She called on CBP to release the names. \n \nThe lawsuit filed Saturday was the first of what is expected to be several legal challenges to Trump's executive order. The Council of Islamic Relations said on Friday that it would hold a news conference on Monday announcing the filing of a federal lawsuit on behalf of more than 20 individuals challenging the order. \n\n \nJohn Santore, Marc Torrence, Simone Wilson, Alison Bauter, Jonah Meadows, and Colin Miner contributed reporting. \n \nMain Image via Nydia Velazquez \n \nPhoto Credit: Terminal 4 at JFK by lemoncat1 via Flickr/Creative Commons","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Feroze Dhanoa"},"topics":[{"name":"Airline industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US Federal Government news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Lawsuits news","group":"Business"}],"title":"U.S. Judges Halt Trump's Deportations Of Dozens Held At Airports","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Nassau","zipCode":"11530","state":"New York","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Garden City","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"East Meadow Patch","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"172084483","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"East Meadow Patch","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.eastmeadow.patch.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-executive-order-could-block-legal-residents-from-returning-to-america","http://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-visa-ban-also-applies-to-citizens-with-dual-nationality-state-department-says-1485628654?mod=e2fb","https://twitter.com/ACLU/status/825443851808669696","http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/Two-Syrian-Families-Detained-at-Philadelphia-International-Airport-Told-to-Fly-Back-Family-Member-Says-412047173.html?_osource=SocialFlowTwt_PHBrand","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/28/us/refugees-detained-at-us-airports-prompting-legal-challenges-to-trumps-immigration-order.html?emc=edit_na_20170128&nl=breaking-news&nlid=72675407&ref=cta","https://www.facebook.com/events/623562661169807/","https://www.cair.com/press-center/press-releases/14062-cair-to-announce-constitutional-challenge-to-trump-s-muslim-ban-executive-order.html","https://www.flickr.com/photos/lemoncat1/"],"sequenceId":"695199513422","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T16:53:20Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:51:51Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://cdn20.patch.com/users/22877259/20170128/091105/styles/T600x450/public/article_images/image_uploaded_from_ios_1024-1485654598-9499.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 24 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Sebastian","zipCode":"72904","state":"Arkansas","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Fort Smith","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"4029 TV","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659416","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"195"},"name":"4029 TV","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Sports"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.4029tv.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199518095","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:51:56Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Inc., Facebook Inc., Microsoft Corp., Uber Technologies Inc. and other companies expressed concern about the immigration order's effect on their employees, with some executives saying the ban violated their personal and company principles. \n \nThe ramifications of tighter immigration rules stretch from finance to meat packing to construction. In Silicon Valley, which relies on skilled foreigners to fill key roles, the order resonates with prominent founders, executives and engineers, many of whom were also foreign-born. \n \nMicrosoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella, who was born in India, said the company will continue to be an advocate on the issue. \"As an immigrant and as a CEO, I've both experienced and seen the positive impact that immigration has on our company, for the country, and for the world,\" he said Saturday in an online post. \n \nApple Chief Executive Tim Cook said in an email to employees that his company has contacted the White House to explain the \"negative effect\" the restrictions will have on workers. Mr. Cook, who visited Washington last week, said he spoke to officials there about Apple's belief \"in the importance of immigration--both to our company and to our nation's future.\" \n \nMr. Trump on Friday signed an executive order that, for at least 90 days, bans people from seven nations--Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen--from entering the U.S. The order indefinitely bans Syrian refugees from the U.S. and suspends the broader refugee program. Mr. Trump said the order was intended to keep out \"radical Islamic terrorists.\" \n \nThe broader impact emerged Saturday. Any passport holders of those seven countries can't enter the U.S. under the ban, even if they hold a passport from another country, such as the U.K. or Canada. U.S. citizens aren't affected. \n \nLate Saturday, a federal judge ordered the government to stop the removal of refugees and immigrants who had been detained at airports across the country--blocking the enforcement of parts of President Donald Trump's executive order. \n \nPoliticians and civil-rights advocates quickly criticized the president's move as religious persecution. In the world of business, Silicon Valley emerged as a leading voice against the policy. \n \nIn an email to staff Friday, Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said the new order affected at least 187 Google employees, including one who had to rush back to the U.S. from overseas to avoid being blocked from the country. Mr. Pichai asked any affected employees abroad to contact the company's global security team. \n \n\"We're upset about the impact of this order and any proposals that could impose restrictions on Googlers and their families, or that could create barriers to bringing great talent to the U.S.,\" Mr. Pichai said in the email, a copy of which was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. \"It's painful to see the personal cost of this executive order on our colleagues.\" \n \nA spokesman for venture capitalist Peter Thiel, Mr. Trump's biggest supporter in the tech industry, said late Saturday that \"Peter doesn't support a religious test, and the administration has not imposed one.\" \n \nBrad Smith, Microsoft's president and legal chief, said Saturday in an email to staff posted online that the company had contacted 76 employees who are citizens of the banned countries and was working to identify others who might be affected by the policy. \n \n\"Microsoft believes in a strong and balanced high-skilled immigration system,\" Mr. Smith said in the email. \"We believe that immigration laws can and should protect the public without sacrificing people's freedom of expression or religion. And we believe in the importance of protecting legitimate and law-abiding refugees whose very lives may be at stake in immigration proceedings.\" \n \nFacebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg wrote on his Facebook page Friday that he was \"concerned\" by the order. \"We need to keep this country safe, but we should do that by focusing on people who actually pose a threat,\" he wrote. \n \nAaron Levie, chief executive of digital-storage firm Box Inc., said Mr. Trump's move is \"totally infuriating\" and \"morally wrong.\" He said he was investigating how to get involved personally to help fight the order. \n \nBeth Galetti, Amazon.com Inc.'s vice president of human resources, sent an email to staff Saturday, recommending U.S.-based employees from countries listed in the restrictions refrain from traveling outside the U.S., adding that employees should contact Amazon for contingency plans if they are already outside the borders for travel. \n \n\"As we've grown the company, we've worked hard to attract talented people from all over the world, and we believe this is one of the things that makes Amazon great--a diverse workforce helps us build better products for customers,\" Ms. Galetti said in her email. \n \nInternational Business Machines Corp. declined to comment. Oracle Corp. didn't respond to a request for comment. \n \nThe tech industry relies on skilled foreigners to create new startups and fill engineering roles. Foreigners founded more than half of U.S. startups valued at more than $1 billion, according to a recent study by the National Foundation for American Policy, a nonpartisan think tank focused on immigration issues. \n \nThe Internet Association, a tech trade group representing Google, Facebook, Microsoft and others, said Mr. Trump's executive order had troubling consequences. \"Internet companies in particular thrive in the U.S. because the best and the brightest are able to create innovative products and services right here in America,\" the group said. \n \nThe tech industry is also lobbying in Washington regarding expected changes to the work-visa programs for skilled foreigners, which Silicon Valley is dependent on for employees. For instance, 77% of full-time graduate students in electrical engineering and 71% in computer science at U.S. universities are international students, said Stuart Anderson, head of the National Foundation for American Policy. \n \nIn fiscal 2013, the U.S. issued nearly 274,000 skilled-worker visas, known as H-1B visas. Citizens from the banned countries received 1,220 of those visas, including 810 to Iranians, 280 to Syrians and 53 to Libyans, according to government data compiled by Ron Hira, a Howard University political-science professor who tracks immigration trends. The 2013 data is the most recent complete data Mr. Hira analyzed. \n \nMicrosoft and Google employed the most H-1B visa holders from those countries that year, with 31 and 15, respectively, according to the data. \n \nMany tech executives were guarded following Mr. Trump's election, and even tried courting his administration in recent weeks, despite their opposition to him during the campaign. Shortly after the election, executives from across Silicon Valley met with Mr. Trump in New York to discuss issues pertinent to the industry. \n \nEric Schmidt, chairman of Alphabet, visited Trump Tower again weeks after the summit of tech leaders. Apple's Mr. Cook recently had dinner with Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner, a senior adviser to the president, two people familiar with the trip said. \n \nSeveral executives, including Tesla Motors Inc. Chief Executive Elon Musk, IBM Chief Executive Ginni Rometty and Uber Chief Executive Travis Kalanick, are serving on groups advising the Trump administration. \n \nRolfe Winkler, Tripp Mickle and \n \nJay Greene \n \ncontributed to this article. \n \nWrite to Jack Nicas at jack.nicas@wsj.com \n   \n(END) Dow Jones Newswires \n \nJanuary 29, 2017 01:10 ET (06:10 GMT) \nCopyright (c) 2017 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Real estate news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Tech latest","group":"Technology"},{"name":"Silicon Valley news","group":"Technology"},{"name":"Apple news","group":"Companies"},{"name":"Facebook news","group":"Internet"},{"name":"Internet latest","group":"Internet"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Silicon Valley Leaders Target Donald Trump's Travel Restrictions -- Update","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"Morningstar.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169658108","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"5"},"name":"Morningstar.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","RealEstate"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.morningstar.com","publisher":"Morningstar"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199521280","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:51:58Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

and posts published online, leaders from companies including Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp. framed the order as one at odds with a nation that welcomes foreigners and an industry that counts foreign-born executives in its upper ranks. In doing so, they broke with weeks of cautious engagement with the new administration. \n \nHere is a rundown of their statements. \n \nApple CEO \n \nTim Cook \n \nTeam, \n \nIn my conversations with officials here in Washington this week, I've made it clear that Apple believes deeply in the importance of immigration--both to our company and to our nation's future. Apple would not exist without immigration, let alone thrive and innovate the way we do. \n \nI've heard from many of you who are deeply concerned about the executive order issued yesterday restricting immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries. I share your concerns. It is not a policy we support. \n \nThere are employees at Apple who are directly affected by yesterday's immigration order. Our HR, Legal and Security teams are in contact with them, and Apple will do everything we can to support them. We're providing resources on AppleWeb for anyone with questions or concerns about immigration policies. And we have reached out to the White House to explain the negative effect on our co-workers and our company. \n \nAs I've said many times, diversity makes our team stronger. And if there's one thing I know about the people at Apple, it's the depth of our empathy and support for one another. It's as important now as it's ever been, and it will not weaken one bit. I know I can count on all of you to make sure everyone at Apple feels welcome, respected and valued. \n \nApple is open. Open to everyone, no matter where they come from, which language they speak, who they love or how they worship. Our employees represent the finest talent in the world, and our team hails from every corner of the globe. \n \nIn the words of Dr. Martin Luther King, \"We may have all come on different ships, but we are in the same boat now.\" \n \nMicrosoft CEO \n \nSatya Nadella \n \nAs an immigrant and as a CEO, I've both experienced and seen the positive impact that immigration has on our company, for the country, and for the world. We will continue to advocate on this important topic. \n \nMicrosoft President \n \nBrad Smith \n \nAs a company, Microsoft believes in a strong and balanced high-skilled immigration system. We also believe in broader immigration opportunities, like the protections for talented and law-abiding young people under the Deferred Access for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) Program, often called \"Dreamers.\" We believe that immigration laws can and should protect the public without sacrificing people's freedom of expression or religion. And we believe in the importance of protecting legitimate and law-abiding refugees whose very lives may be at stake in immigration proceedings. \n \n(Full statement here.) \n \nGoogle CEO \n \nSundar Pichai \n \nWe're upset about the impact of this order and any proposals that could impose restrictions on Googlers and their families, or that could create barriers to bringing great talent to the U.S....It's painful to see the personal cost of this executive order on our colleagues. \n \nUber Technologies CEO \n \nTravis Kalanick \n \nExpedia CEO \n \nDara Khosrowshahi \n \nOurs is a nation of immigrants. These are our roots, this is our soul. All erased with the stroke of a pen. I was incredibly fortunate to arrive in the U.S. with my family after the Iranian revolution. I don't have an Iranian passport and have never been back but have no idea if I'm on a list someplace listed as an Iranian citizen. And I'm a lucky one. We should strive for safe borders. But we have a responsibility as the world's greatest nation. And we sure aren't acting our part. \n \nFacebook \n \nCEO \n \nMark Zuckerberg \n \nMy great-grandparents came from Germany, Austria and Poland. Priscilla's parents were refugees from China and Vietnam. The United States is a nation of immigrants, and we should be proud of that. \n \nLike many of you, I'm concerned about the impact of the recent executive orders signed by President Trump. \n \nWe need to keep this country safe, but we should do that by focusing on people who actually pose a threat. Expanding the focus of law enforcement beyond people who are real threats would make all Americans less safe by diverting resources, while millions of undocumented folks who don't pose a threat will live in fear of deportation. \n \n(Full statement here.) \n \nTesla Motors \n \nCEO \n \nElon Musk \n \nMany people negatively affected by this policy are strong supporters of the U.S. They've done right, not wrong & don't deserve to be rejected....The blanket entry ban on citizens from certain primarily Muslim countries is not the best way to address the country's challenges \n \nTweets: https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/825502618680045568 and https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/825502400454594561 \n \nCode.org CEO \n \nHadi Partovi \n \nMy family left Iran to escape a bloody war when I was 11, during the Reagan administration. America welcomed us as legal immigrants with visas. Code.org and the Hour of Code wouldn't exist otherwise. \n \n(Facebook post here.) \n \nAirbnb CEO \n \nBrian Chesky \n \nOpen doors brings all of US together. Closing doors further divides US. Let's all find ways to connect people, not separate them. \n \nTweet: https://twitter.com/bchesky/status/825407087085645824 \n \nY Combinator President \n \nSam Altman \n \nThe tech community is powerful. Large tech companies in particular have enormous power and are held in high regard. We need to hear from the CEOs clearly and unequivocally. Although there is some business risk in doing so, there is strength in numbers--if everyone does it early this coming week, we will all make each other stronger. \n \n(Full statement here.) \n \nNetflix \n \nCEO \n \nReed Hastings \n \nTrump's actions are hurting Netflix employees around the world, and are so un-American it pains us all. Worse, these actions will make America less safe (through hatred and loss of allies) rather than more safe. A very sad week, and more to come with the lives of over 600,000 Dreamers here in a America under imminent threat. It is time to link arms together to protect American values of freedom and opportunity. \n \n(Facebook post here.) \n \nSalesforce.com CEO \n \nMarc Benioff \n \nWhen we close our hearts & stop loving other people as ourselves (Mk 12:31) we forget who we truly are--a light unto the nations. #noban \n \nTweet: https://twitter.com/Benioff/status/825470203299377152 \n \nUber Technologies CEO Travis Kalanick \n \nOur People Ops team has already reached out to the dozen or so employees who we know are affected: for example, those who live and work in the U.S., are legal residents but not naturalized citizens will not be able to get back into the country if they are traveling outside of the U.S. now or anytime in the next 90 days. Anyone who believes that this order could impact them should contact immigration@uber.com immediately. \n \nThis order has far broader implications as it also affects thousands of drivers who use Uber and come from the listed countries, many of whom take long breaks to go back home to see their extended family. These drivers currently outside of the U.S. will not be able to get back into the country for 90 days. That means they will not be able to earn a living and support their families--and of course they will be separated from their loved ones during that time. \n \nWe are working out a process to identify these drivers and compensate them pro bono during the next three months to help mitigate some of the financial stress and complications with supporting their families and putting food on the table. We will have more details on this in the coming days. \n \n(Full statement here.) \n \nBox CEO Aaron Levie \n \nOn every level--moral, humanitarian, economic, logical, etc.--this ban is wrong and is completely antithetical to the principles of America. \n \nTweet: https://twitter.com/levie/status/825424282679283712 \n \nTwitter \n \nCEO \n \nJack Dorsey \n \nThe Executive Order's humanitarian and economic impact is real and upsetting. We benefit from what refugees and immigrants bring to the U.S. \n \nTweets: https://twitter.com/jack/status/825476172658200577 \n \nSlack Technologies CEO \n \nStewart Butterfield \n \n\"And he's just getting started.\" -- It's still so hard to believe that this is real life. Nearly every action seems gratuitously...evil. \n \nTweet: https://twitter.com/stewart/status/825431304112009217 \n \nLinkedIn CEO \n \nJeff Weiner \n \n40% of Fortune 500 founded by immigrants or their children.

Dropbox embraces people from all countries and faiths \n \nTweet: https://twitter.com/drewhouston/status/825462890949861377 \n \nEBay CEO \n \nDevin Wenig \n \nOver the past several months, I've talked with you repeatedly about my unyielding commitment to our company's values. I've been clear that we will always stand up for those values and act in the interests of our employees and customers....I believe this decision fundamentally contradicts our company's values and America's values. \n   \n(END) Dow Jones Newswires \n \nJanuary 29, 2017 02:36 ET (07:36 GMT) \nCopyright (c) 2017 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Real estate news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Tech latest","group":"Technology"},{"name":"Apple news","group":"Companies"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Internet latest","group":"Internet"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Tech Executives React to Trump Immigration Order in Their Own Words -- Update","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"Morningstar.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169658108","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"5"},"name":"Morningstar.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","RealEstate"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.morningstar.com","publisher":"Morningstar"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/825502618680045568","https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/825502400454594561","https://twitter.com/bchesky/status/825407087085645824","https://twitter.com/Benioff/status/825470203299377152","https://twitter.com/levie/status/825424282679283712","https://twitter.com/jack/status/825476172658200577","https://twitter.com/stewart/status/825431304112009217","https://twitter.com/jeffweiner/status/825437102162792451","https://twitter.com/drewhouston/status/825462890949861377"],"sequenceId":"695199522214","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:51:58Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

They told us that they haven\u2019t had major complaints from customers over the move.\n\nIn 2004, Ireland became the first country in the world to ban smoking in the workplace, and the price of tobacco has risen in subsequent budgets.\n\nJust under a quarter of adults in Ireland are smokers. The latest Healthy Ireland survey found that 23% of adults in Ireland smoke \u2013 the same proportion as in the 2015 survey. But it also found that 48% of all smokers want to quit.\n\nAlmost 13 years on from the smoking ban, playgrounds are next on the list for being designated as non-smoking areas.\n\nWhere is smoking banned?\n\nUnder the law, smoking is banned in a place of work, including a licensed premises once it is a place of work.\n\nThe Citizens Information Board explains:\n\nIt also notes that employers have the discretion to provide an outdoor smoking area, \u201csubject to the requirements of the law\u201d \u2013 this means a place or premises, or part of a place or premises, that is not covered by a roof \u2013 or one that is covered by a roof, as long as not more than 50% of the perimeter \u201cis covered by a wall, windows, gate, or similar\u201d.\n\nJoe Macken of JoBurger and Niall Kavanagh (co-owner with Eileen Kavanagh) of Metro Café told us why they have taken steps to limit where their customers can smoke.\n\n\u201cWe are getting a really good response\u201d\n\nAt JoBurger, a Dublin gourmet burger chain, they have had smoking on their outside terrace banned for almost a year, while another business Metro Café recently designated part of its outside terrace for no-smoking. In both cases, food is served on the terraces.\n\nMacken, of JoBurger, told TheJournal.ie that despite the fact he and most of his managers are smokers, they decided to introduce the measure at their two restaurants on Castle Market and at Smithfield because of their \u201cgeneral disgust for smoking when you\u2019re eating \u2013 it\u2019s just horrible\u201d.\n\nFor Macken, the decision has a lot to do with the needs and health of his staff, as well as customers. \u201c[With] no smoking laws you\u2019re not allowed to smoke in a workplace, and a terrace is a workplace,\u201d he pointed out.\n\n\u201cWe found we are getting a really, really good response to it,\u201d said Macken. \u201cOur customers are really responding to it.\u201d\n\nThe terraced area outside JoBurger is marked off with wind-breakers. Macken said that they haven\u2019t gotten many complaints about the move, saying that smokers have adapted.\n\n\u201cWe get some people that just stand outside the door [to smoke],\u201d he said. \u201cMost people get the whole buzz about it.\u201d\n\nHealth concerns\n\nMacken is such a proponent of the idea that he has even asked people from neighbouring restaurants and cafés if they plan on bringing in the change.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s invasive,\u201d said Macken of smoking in public areas. \u201cI am real fussy, I can\u2019t hide it and I can\u2019t deal with the smell.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a choice it\u2019s more about respect \u2013 it\u2019s only when you\u2019re eating,\u201d he added.\n\n\u2018People used to laugh at me sitting outside\u2019\n\nA young couple smoking outside a café in Paris. \n\nOver at Metro Café, the introduction of a no-smoking area outside the café at 43 South William Street came after some planning. \u201cWe had planned on introducing it last year and we just never got around to it, so it was always on my mind,\u201d said co-owner Niall Kavanagh.\n\nThe site also doesn\u2019t have wifi, because the owners \u201cwanted to have people chatting and talking away and I didn\u2019t think the cafe was the right place to be staring at a computer as a mini office\u201d explained Kavanagh.\n\nWhile currently around 30% of Metro\u2019s outside space is designated non-smoking, Kavanagh wants to more than double this. \u201cSo far we have designated a small area, but we\u2019re waiting on the heaters to come so we can expand that. [We want] 80% of it non-smoking. I think 20% of it would be sitting outside that you can smoke.\u201d\n\nHe and his partner were inspired by New York\u2019s café culture when it came to opening their own premises, with the aim of having a warm space outside where people can watch the world go by. And now, this means most of the clientele won\u2019t be able to have a smoke while doing so.\n\nBut Kavanagh has always been ahead of the trend when it comes to making big changes.\n\nKavanagh, who is a non-smoker, said that he loves to sit outside his café and wants his customers to feel the same.\n\nHe wants his customers to enjoy the \u201cfree theatre\u201d of sitting outside on South William Street, and \u201cnot to have to endure someone\u2019s else\u2019s smoke\u201d.\n\nOn a walk down South William St, TheJournal.ie noticed that most cafés have ashtrays on their outside terraces.\n\nLike Macken, Kavanagh also cited concerns about his staff members\u2019 health. He is also a major proponent of small, locally-owned cafés.\n\n\u201cPeople are browned off with chains \u2013 they want the experience,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the future,\u201d he said of smoke-free café experiences. \u201cLike café culture was the future years ago.\u201d\n\n\u2018They are within their rights\u2019\n\nAdrian Cummins of the Restaurant Association of Ireland said he hadn\u2019t heard from members about a major move to bring in more non-smoking areas, but \u201cif food is served obviously they are within their rights to do so\u201d.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t heard of any member talking about it \u2013 by and large it doesn\u2019t seem to be an issue and I haven\u2019t heard any consumers giving out,\u201d he said. \u201cWithin my knowledge they are within their rights to do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s up to the restaurant owners to do what they want to do and we would support them,\u201d said Cummins.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s a public area outside that\u2019s defined as a pub and not private property that brings in a totally other legal concept,\u201d said Cummins.\n\n\u201cWhereas if you have a windbreaker and you\u2019re defining your property from within that that\u2019s within your property.\n\n\u201cWe abide by the law and we support it.\u201d\n\nThe smokers\u2019 point of view\n\nThe spokesperson for smokers\u2019 group Forest Ireland told TheJournal.ie that the group believes \u201cthe public should be allowed to make up their own mind\u201d about smoking areas, and this extends to pub and restaurant owners.\n\n\u201cIn Holland you can decide; you can designate your pub as a smoking pub,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the way we thought it should have been done here.\u201d\n\nThe spokesperson said he doubted that there would be consistent interest in outdoor non-smoking areas from non-smokers. \u201cSmokers will go out in the cold and rain,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will all look lovely in the summertime [but not in winter].\u201d\n\n\u201cThey have no other choice so they will go out,\u201d he said of smokers\u2019 enthusiasm for outdoor areas.\n\nForest Ireland\u2019s preference is for indoor smoking areas away from the main non-smoking areas. \u201cAnd what do the smokers want anyway \u2013 it would be lovely if they had a smoking room away from the main bar with a roof on it and tables and chairs and so on, that they could just go out to,\u201d said the spokesperson of pubs.\n\nBut he also said that \u201cout of courtesy you wouldn\u2019t have people smoking in front of people eating. If people have food outside it wouldn\u2019t make sense if people are eating.\u201d\n\nHe said that smokers are outside because \u201cthey are forced out there\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey just decided to force them out to shame them out onto the street. Now they make it difficult for them by not providing any facilities outside.\u201d\n\nThe spokesperson said that Forest Ireland is not in favour of people smoking and doesn\u2019t promote smoking.\n\nHe added that a recent study by Forest in the UK which looked into why people smoke found that the vast majority said they smoke because they enjoy it.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Aoife Barry"},"topics":[{"name":"Restaurant industry news","group":"Industry"}],"title":"\"It's the future\": Restaurants and cafés are cracking down on smoking outside","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"IE","country":"Ireland"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"TheJournal.ie","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"175383370","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"286"},"name":"TheJournal.ie","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.thejournal.ie"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.joburger.ie/","http://www.metrocafe.ie/","http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2003/si/481/made/en/print","http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment_rights_and_conditions/health_and_safety/ban_on_smoking_in_the_workplace_in_ireland.html"],"sequenceId":"695199524190","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:52:01Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://img2.thejournal.ie/article/3201397/river/?height=400&version=3203045"}],"video":[]}}

A federal judge in New York issued an emergency stay to block implementation of Trump\u2019s executive order Saturday evening, putting a halt to possible deportations.\n\nNasri said her in-laws, Mohammad Hossein Nasri and Farania Moghimi, were held while returning from a trip to Iran for their son\u2019s wedding. The couple are legal residents and have lived in the Las Vegas Valley for five years.\n\nAfter a lengthy process that involved calls to the Border Patrol and help from the ACLU and the office of Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nev., Bita Nasri confirmed that the couple were being held in Chicago, and after the order was lifted, Nasri\u2019s mother-in-law called to say that they would be coming home.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been exhausting and scary and stressful because we had no contact with them and we had no information,\u201d she said.\n\nNasri said she wasn\u2019t notified of the fact that her in-laws were being held and heard of the ban through the news.\n\nShe worried about her mother-in-law\u2019s health and began making calls, but she couldn\u2019t get through to border patrol after the first call.\n\n\u201cImagine your parents, your in-laws traveling, and then all of a sudden you have no contact with them. How would you feel?\u201d she asked.\n\nBoth of her in-laws are retired, though her father-in-law does part-time work. The couple moved to Henderson from Iran, where they both worked in education.\n\nSince then, they\u2019ve been helping behind the scenes with the family\u2019s launch of a school, the Nasri Academy for Gifted Children, which debuted in September.\n\nACLU Nevada legal director Amy Rose said neither border nor customs personnel were cooperative when she and an attorney from the American Immigration Lawyers Association arrived at McCarran International Airport about 2 p.m. Saturday to aid anyone affected by Trump\u2019s order.\n\nThey arrived about 4½ hours before the emergency stay.\n\n\u201cOne of the frustrations we\u2019ve run into is that customs and border protection keep directing us to the airport public information officer,\u201d Rose said. \u201cWe aren\u2019t getting any official answers.\u201d\n\nAs of 9 p.m. Saturday, no one had been detained at McCarran International Airport, airport Chief Marketing Officer Chris Jones said.\n\nAt least a dozen protesters were seen about 6:30 p.m. in McCarran\u2019s Terminal 3, but they were asked to stop by the Metropolitan Police Department for not requesting a protest permit. People wishing to demonstrate at the airport must complete paperwork and get airport directors\u2019 approval, Jones said.\n\nMetro officers had protesters ditch their signs before escorting them to the international arrivals area to join Rose.\n\nBy 9 p.m., Rose and a few protesters were left, waiting with a man expecting his parents on a British Airways flight from London. The man\u2019s parents and sister, coming to visit him, were questioned for at least an hour when boarding their flight in London, Rose said. Only his parents were allowed on the flight to Las Vegas, leaving his sister behind.\n\nHis parents, who are Syrian citizens, have American travel documents but were held at McCarran for more than two hours after landing at about 7 p.m. They were released about 10:20 p.m.\n\nRose said she\u2019ll follow up with the father to obtain details about the delay at McCarran and to gather facts on the sister\u2019s case.\n\nReview-Journal writer Jessica Terrones contributed to this report.

He was 68. \nBlack Sabbath guitarist Tony Iommi confirmed the news on Facebook. \"I'm so saddened to hear the loss of one of my dearest and closest friends Geoff Nicholls. He's been suffering for a while now with lung cancer and he lost his battle this morning. Geoff and I have always been very close and he has been a real true friend to me and supported me all the way for nearly 40 years. I will miss him dearly and he will live in my heart until we meet again. \nRest In Peace my dear friend. \nTony\" \n\nFrontman Ozzy Osbourne tweeted: \"Geoff Nicholls was a great friend of mine for a long time. He will be greatly missed. I'm very saddened at the news.\" \n\nBlack Sabbath bassist Geezer Butler also shared his condolences on Facebook. \"Very sad to hear of old friend and Sabbath keyboard player Geoff Nicholls passing. RIP Geoff,\" Butler wrote. \n\nGeoffrey James \"Geoff\" Nicholls (28 February 1948 - 28 January 2017) was a British musician and keyboardist who was a longtime member of the heavy metal band Black Sabbath, until 2004. Nicholls also played in the NWOBHM band Quartz before joining Black Sabbath. In the late 1960s/early 1970s, Geoff played lead guitar for the Birmingham band Johnny Neal and the Starliners. \n\nNicholls was originally brought in as a second guitarist when Black Sabbath doubted whether they would even continue under that name. Nicholls then switched to bass when Geezer Butler left briefly, and then became the band's keyboardist upon Butler's return and the decision to keep the Sabbath name. Nicholls' first appearance on a Black Sabbath album was on 1980's Heaven and Hell, and was credited as keyboardist on every Sabbath release from that time until 13, although he was not an official member until 1986. He remained an official member until 1991, then regained member status from 1993 to 1996. He was an unofficial member once again since the reunion with Ozzy Osbourne in 1997. Although his main role with Sabbath has been on the keyboard Nicholls also played some rhythm guitar on the reunion tours, e.g. during Iommi's solo in \"Snowblind\" and a few tracks during the Headless Cross and Forbidden tours. \n\nIn addition to not always being credited as a full member of the band, Nicholls has rarely appeared on stage proper during Sabbath shows, instead usually playing from a side-stage or backstage position. One exception to this was the tour in support of the 1986 album Seventh Star, where he played on stage as an equal member of the band. Another is a concert in May 1988, where Nicholls played bass for a charity function. \n\nNicholls' involvement with the band ended when Adam Wakeman (a member of Ozzy Osbourne's solo band) was chosen to play keyboards during Sabbath's 2004 and 2005 tours as part of Ozzfest and Scott Warren (Dio) handled keyboard duties on the 2007 Heaven & Hell tour. \n\nUntil his death, Nicholls played keyboards with former Black Sabbath singer Tony Martin in his band Tony Martin's Headless Cross. Nicholls had previously performed on both of Martin's solo albums and their support tours. \nNicholls died from lung cancer on 28 January 2017 at the age of 68 surrounded by his family.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"Geoff Nicholls, Longtime Keyboardist For Black Sabbath, Dies Aged 68","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Top40-Charts","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169669807","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"108"},"name":"Top40-Charts","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Arts","Music"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.top40-charts.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199527660","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:12:05Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:52:04Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

That's something you've got to get through, the first 10-15 overs are crucial. With the line-up that we play, if we can have wickets in the shed at the back end then we will score a lot of runs at the end of the (innings).\" \n \nThe keeper found out the perils of taking on Eden Park's small boundaries when he played at the ground for the first time last February, caught at cow corner trying to heave Corey Anderson over the ropes. \n \nThe Australians were all out for 148 on that occasion, with the Black Caps' seamers running riot on the way to a 2-1 series win. It was a similar story a year earlier, with the Aussies skittled for 151 in a World Cup clash that the Kiwis only won by a wicket. \n \nAt the same time, Eden Park's unusual dimensions have resulted in big scores before. Although the tourists failed to pass 150 last time around, New Zealand posted a score of 8-307 in the same game. \n \nIndeed, before Australia's innings that day, seven of the last eight innings at the ground had gone past 280 runs. \n \n\"(The Eden Park pitch) just has a bit in it,\" New Zealand veteran Ross Taylor said. \"I don't think there is a par score, some wickets here are 300, some are 200. \n \n\"You just have to analyse it as quickly as possible, whether you're batting or bowling.\" \n \nThe Kiwis were trounced 3-0 in Australia when the sides met in December, but Wade is expecting a tougher time on New Zealand's turf. \n \n\"We played them in Australia (on) big grounds (with) long boundaries.

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country.

Saturday night's ruling came in response to a challenge filed on behalf of two Iraqi men detained Friday night at JFK International Airport and impacted up to 200 others held across the country. \n \nAn unknown number of others intending to come back to the United States are trapped in other countries, unable to board planes. \n\n \nJudge Ann Donnelly's emergency stay, issued after an emergency hearing in Brooklyn, does not allow those detained at airports and those  in transit Saturday to enter or re-enter the United States. Her ruling, however, prevents the government from returning them to their home countries. Dozens of airport arrivals remain in limbo, unable to enter the country. \n \nThe judge also ordered the federal government to turn over a list of everyone currently being detained. \n \nShe did not rule on the constitutionality of Trump's order. And the order did nothing to quell the uncertainty and chaos at U.S. entry points caused by the order, issued without notice and little or no guidance to immigration agents on how to handle those arriving. \n\n \nTrump made no exception for people already vetted and admitted into the country legally but who were out of the country when he signed the executive order. \n \nOne of the Iraqi men, who was handcuffed at JFK Airport, worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Army in Iraq for 10 years. He had been granted a special immigrant visa. He was among dozens of people stopped at airports around the United States on Saturday. At Chicago's O'Hare International Airport , as many as 18 people were reportedly detained, including children and a man with a green card returning from a family wedding in Saudi Arabia . The detentions at the nation's major airports moved thousands of people to arrive at airports in New York, Chicago, Boston, San Francisco and other cities to protest, chanting \"let them in\" and \"this is what democracy looks like.\" \n \n\"We won,\" said the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Voting Rights Project, Dale Ho, reacting to the ruling. \n \nJack Vimo, policy analyst for the National Immigration Law Center, said the lawyers for the two JFK detainees met four crucial factors: \n the executive order causes irreparable harm; they have a likelihood of success on merits; there is no harm to the government; there is a likelihood of receiving class certification. \nVimo tweeted that the ACLU informed the judge the government was putting someone on a plane back to Syria. The judge saw that as putting someone at risk of irreparable harm. \n \nThe ACLU said it will continue to file suits on behalf of anyone who is stopped. \n \nIt was not clear if the government would appeal the judge's ruling. If it does, both sides will file briefs and a hearing will likely be held within days. \n\n \nShortly after the ruling, another judge, hearing a similar case in the federal court in Virginia, struck another blow against Trump's order. \n \nJudge Leonie Brinkema ordered that the government refrain from deporting any green-card holders being detained at Dulles International Airport and allow lawyers to meet with the detainees. \n\nA third federal judge - this one in Washington - also ordered a stay. \n\nJudge Thomas Zilly granted an emergency stay forbidding the government from removing two individuals from the United States until a hearing next week. \n\nThere are also cases pending in Chicago, New York, and other cities. \n \nTrump's executive order \u2014 which exempts certain diplomats traveling to the United States but does not mention those legally residing in the country as lawful permanent residents or with student or employment visas who might be returning to the U.S. \u2014 has created a new class of detainees in the United States. \n\n \nLawyers involved in the case heard in Brooklyn put the number of those held at 100 to 200. \n \nWhile many of Trump's executive orders have been met with criticism for their message, the immigrant ban has already had real impact on real people. \n \nThe seven countries in the order are not named but officials say they include Iraq, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Iran, Yemen and Sudan. Trump's order also bans the resettlement of refugees for four months and indefinitely suspends the entry of Syrian refugees. \n\n \nPeople who had been given visas to enter the United States after putting their families at risk by helping American troops were stopped as they exited airplanes arriving in airports in New York, Philadelphia, Boston, Dallas, and other cities. \n \nThe lawyers for two Iraqis who had been granted visas to enter the United States and were detained at John F. Kennedy airport, also are seeking class certification so that they can similarly represent all individuals covered by the executive order. That includes people with approved refugee applications, holders of valid immigrant and non-immigrant visas and other individuals from the seven countries banned by the executive order but who would have otherwise been granted legal admission to the U.S. \n \nWhen signing the order, Trump said it was aimed at keeping out \"radical Islamic terrorists.\" \n \nLawyers consulted by ProPublica said the ban could apply to hundreds of thousands of people from these countries who already live in the U.S. under green cards or on temporary student or employee visas. Reuters reported that green card holders from the seven countries who are now out of the U.S. will have to be cleared on a case-by-case basis to re-enter. \n \nA State Department statement reviewed by the Wall Street Journal but not been officially released says the ban would also apply to citizens of those seven countries who hold dual nationality. A federal law enforcement official told The Associated Press that those already in the U.S. with a visa or a green card would be allowed to stay. \n \nA senior administration official pushed back on the idea that the order was a Muslim ban, listing several predominantly Muslim countries that were not affected by the ban. \n \n\"We\u2019re dealing with a relatively small universe of people,\" the official said. \"It\u2019s important to keep in mind that no person living or residing overseas has a right to entry to the U.S.\" \n \nAsked about the immigration executive order on Saturday, Trump said it was not a Muslim ban. \n \n\"It\u2019s working out very nicely,\" he said. \"You see it at the airports, you see it all over.\u201d \n \nThe administration is still working to define \"in transit\" for the purposes of the hardship exemption for refugees who have been approved to enter the United States but are currently in a third country, according to the official. \n \nThe ACLU has lawyers stationed at airports across the country. \"If you know someone entering country, tell them not to sign anything before talking to lawyer,\" the ACLU tweeted . \n \nEven after the stay was issued Saturday night, it wasn't immediately clear what would happen to refugees and immigrants detained at airports across the country. \n \nAt JFK International Airport in New York City, dozens of attorneys huddled in the Terminal 1 arrivals hall attempted to explain to anxious family members what would happen to their relatives, who were still in federal custody. \n \nJennifer Johnson, another attorney volunteering Saturday at JFK, said she and others were still being denied access to the detainees. She said that tried to deliver a printed copy of the stay to the airport's CBP headquarters, but officers wouldn't accept it \u2014 so she slipped it under the door. \n \n\"Where are our clients? Where are our friends? Where are our family members?\" she said. \"Let's talk about the people still detained.\" \n\n \nSoon after, one Syrian woman in a wheelchair was released from Terminal 8 at JFK. \n \nIn Chicago, where the international terminal was packed with protesters, both inside and out, tearful reunions took place amid cheers as some detainees were released. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, responding to the O'Hare detentions, blasted the president's actions. \n \nTrump's actions \"have tarnished America's standing as a beacon of hope for the free world,\" Emanuel saidin a statement. \"Following the stay that was granted this evening, I am calling on the federal government to immediately produce a list of the names of anyone currently being detained at O'Hare or Midway airports, and calling on those unjustly affected to immediately be released and allowed access to legal counsel.\" \n\n\nAfter the judge's ruling in Brooklyn, those detained in Chicago were released. \n \nNBC Philadelphia reported two Syrian families detained at Philadelphia Airport were sent home on a return flight. The New York Times reported that the trip of a Syrian family of six headed for a new life to Ohio had been called off. According to the Times, a young Iranian woman and her family were ordered to leave a flight that had stopped in Istanbul. \n\n \nSEE ALSO: \n \nHameed Khalid Darweesh, one of the Iraqis detained at JFK, had worked on behalf of the U.S. in Iraq for 10 years and the other, Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, was coming to join his wife and young son who live in Houston. \n\n \nDarweesh and his family were granted special immigrant visas, according to the lawsuit. Between 2003 and 2013, he worked for the U.S. military and two U.S. government projects. Because of his association with the U.S. Armed Forces, the lawsuit states he was directly targeted twice. To obtain the special immigrant visa, Darweesh had to obtain a Chief of Mission approval from the embassy, a lengthy process that determines whether the applicant provided a \"faithful and valuable service to the United States.\" \n \nAfter receiving COM approval in January 2015, he and his family were granted the visas on Jan. 25, 2017. The suit states that they immediately boarded a flight to the U.S. because of the sensitive and dangerous nature of Darweesh's situation. \n \nDarweesh was later released from detention. Photos posted to Twitter by New York representatives Jerry Nadler and Lydia Velazquez showed Darweesh standing with the two representatives past the passport control and customs section of the airport. \n \nAt a press conference outside the airport, Darweesh thanked those who supported him. \n \n\"This is the humanity, this is the soul of America,\" he said. \n \n\"I'm very happy, really I forget what all I faced, whatever happened to me.\" \n \nAsked by a reporter what he thought of America, Darweesh replied that \"America is the greatest nation, the greatest people in the world.\" \n \nDarweesh worked as an interpreter for Brandon Friedman, who posted a photo of the two from 2003. \n \nThe second man, Alshawi, had been given a Follow to Join Visa to be with his wife and young son. His wife worked as an accountant for a U.S. contractor in 2006, as did her brother, which made them a target for insurgents, according to the lawsuit. She applied for refugee status for her and her son in 2011 and the two currently live in the country as lawful permanent residents. \n \nAlshawi's wife, who identified herself as D to the New York Times , said their 7-year-old son did not know that his father was coming home. \n \n\u201cIt was a surprise for him,\u201d she told the Times. \n \nNew York representatives Nydia Velazquez and Jerry Nadler, went to the airport to help those being detained. Velazquez says she was told by CBP agents that they are waiting for direction from the Department of Homeland Security to act. A protest at JFK  Saturday targeted the detention. \n \nChants of  \"hey hey JFK, no more fascist USA,\" and \"no hate, no hear, Muslims are welcome here,\" could be heard coming from the crowd. Around 300 people were gathered across the street from Terminal 4 at JFK near the arrivals area and the number was swelling. \n \nSpeaking at the protest, Becca Heller, director of the International Refugee Assistance Project, said in addition to Alshawi there were 10 others being detained at JFK but the organization was unable to take legal action on their behalf because their names had not been released. She called on CBP to release the names. \n \nThe lawsuit filed Saturday was the first of what is expected to be several legal challenges to Trump's executive order. The Council of Islamic Relations said on Friday that it would hold a news conference on Monday announcing the filing of a federal lawsuit on behalf of more than 20 individuals challenging the order. \n\n \nJohn Santore, Marc Torrence, Simone Wilson, Alison Bauter, Jonah Meadows, and Colin Miner contributed reporting. \n \nMain Image via Nydia Velazquez \n \nPhoto Credit: Terminal 4 at JFK by lemoncat1 via Flickr/Creative Commons","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Feroze Dhanoa"},"topics":[{"name":"Airline industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US Federal Government news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Lawsuits news","group":"Business"}],"title":"U.S. Judges Halt Trump's Deportations Of Dozens Held At Airports","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Providence","zipCode":"02919","state":"Rhode Island","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Johnston","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Johnston Patch","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"172081211","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Johnston Patch","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.johnston.patch.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-executive-order-could-block-legal-residents-from-returning-to-america","http://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-visa-ban-also-applies-to-citizens-with-dual-nationality-state-department-says-1485628654?mod=e2fb","https://twitter.com/ACLU/status/825443851808669696","http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/Two-Syrian-Families-Detained-at-Philadelphia-International-Airport-Told-to-Fly-Back-Family-Member-Says-412047173.html?_osource=SocialFlowTwt_PHBrand","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/28/us/refugees-detained-at-us-airports-prompting-legal-challenges-to-trumps-immigration-order.html?emc=edit_na_20170128&nl=breaking-news&nlid=72675407&ref=cta","https://www.facebook.com/events/623562661169807/","https://www.cair.com/press-center/press-releases/14062-cair-to-announce-constitutional-challenge-to-trump-s-muslim-ban-executive-order.html","https://www.flickr.com/photos/lemoncat1/"],"sequenceId":"695199537249","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:52:11Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

I still look forward to seeing myself in the arms of Pete Edochie. I don\u2019t mind the fact that he is married; he is my dream husband. \n \n\u201cI like the way he talks, walks and acts. Nobody else can substitute him in my life right now. Not even his younger version, Yul Edochie; he doesn\u2019t entice me. All I want is Pete and not his sons or look alike! \n \n\u201cI love him regardless of his age. Older men make good husbands. Age is just a number. If I love a 70-year old man, I don\u2019t see why I shouldn\u2019t marry him. \n \n\u201cI don\u2019t have time for small boys still running around and wearing studs in their ears with lots of chains hanging around their necks.\u201d \n \nShe also added that aside being old, her lover must be wealthy as well. \n \n\u201cAny man that wants to date or marry me must be tall. I can\u2019t date a short man because I will always be looking at him like he is my child. \n \n\u201cI want someone that I would look up to. He has to be rich and caring too. Handsomeness is an added advantage.\u201d \n \nOn the reasons she came to Nigeria to pursue her acting career, Ms Brown said that back in her country, Nigerian actors were seen as gods and everyone looked forward to acting alongside them. \n \n\u201cIn Liberia we see Nigerian actors as gods. That is why the likes of Frank Artus, Juliet Ibrahim, and Van Vicker among a host of others moved over to Nigerian. \n \n\u201cNow I am here and I look forward to taking over from Yvonne Nelson and Ini Edo among others\u201d, she stated. \n \nTop Stories","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"John Owen Nwachukwu"},"topics":[{"name":"Nigeria news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Pete Edochie is my dream husband, I must marry him - Actress, Blessing Brown","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Western Africa","countryCode":"NG","country":"Nigeria"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Daily Post Nigeria","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"594932946","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"12443"},"name":"Daily Post Nigeria","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://dailypost.ng"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199538941","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:46:11Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:52:12Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://cdn1.dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/BROWN-300x277.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

That's something you've got to get through, the first 10-15 overs are crucial. With the line-up that we play, if we can have wickets in the shed at the back end then we will score a lot of runs at the end of the (innings).\" \n \nThe keeper found out the perils of taking on Eden Park's small boundaries when he played at the ground for the first time last February, caught at cow corner trying to heave Corey Anderson over the ropes. \n \nThe Australians were all out for 148 on that occasion, with the Black Caps' seamers running riot on the way to a 2-1 series win. It was a similar story a year earlier, with the Aussies skittled for 151 in a World Cup clash that the Kiwis only won by a wicket. \n \nAt the same time, Eden Park's unusual dimensions have resulted in big scores before. Although the tourists failed to pass 150 last time around, New Zealand posted a score of 8-307 in the same game. \n \nIndeed, before Australia's innings that day, seven of the last eight innings at the ground had gone past 280 runs. \n \n\"(The Eden Park pitch) just has a bit in it,\" New Zealand veteran Ross Taylor said. \"I don't think there is a par score, some wickets here are 300, some are 200. \n \n\"You just have to analyse it as quickly as possible, whether you're batting or bowling.\" \n \nThe Kiwis were trounced 3-0 in Australia when the sides met in December, but Wade is expecting a tougher time on New Zealand's turf. \n \n\"We played them in Australia (on) big grounds (with) long boundaries. It's a completely different ball game,\" he said. \n \n\"(On) the smaller grounds (in New Zealand) they'll still play aggressive; they're still going to be able to hit plenty of fours and sixes at grounds that they play at. \n \n\"They play well here (in NZ) and they play this venue very well. \n \n\"We like to think we're hard to beat in Australia and it's the same when we come here - we expect a hard challenge over the next three games but we've got a young squad and we're excited to go out and really have a crack at it.\" \n \nCaptaining the side for the first time, Wade maintains his job is simply to continue the fine work of the leadership duo of Steve Smith and vice-captain David Warner. \n \n\"I don't think for me personally it's about putting a stamp on the team,\" he said. \"It's about driving the values and the game plan that we have in one-day cricket moving forward. \n \n\"Steven and David have put their stamp on the team, it's just about me keeping on driving those key messages through to the players. \n \n\"We've performed really well in one-day cricket over a long period of time so it's not about trying to change too much - it's about keeping the ball rolling.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: cricket news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Aussies wary of Black Caps on home turf","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2486","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Tweed Heads South","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Tweed Daily News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169671209","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Tweed Daily News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Sports","Cricket"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.tweeddailynews.com.au","publisher":"APN Holdings NZ Limited"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199541234","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:52:14Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

But the Gaels responded with 10-2 with Hermanson scoring five points. His 3-pointer with the shot clocking running down off a Naar feed increased the lead to 65-52 and sealed the Gaels' 14th win in their last 15 games. \n\nThe Broncos played without starting guard Matt Hauser who was sidelined with the flu. The team had just eight scholarship players available and four played at least 35 minutes. \n\nSaint Mary's quick start to the second half proved too much to overcome. The Gaels scored 12 of the first 14 to push a five-point halftime lead to 47-35 with 15:15 left in the game. Naar sandwiched a pair of layups around a Hermanson 3-pointer and the Broncos went 8 of 9 from the field to start the second half. \n\nSanta Clara got a spark from Emmanuel Ndumanya who started a 13-2 run with layup and kept it going with a pair of steals. His 3-point play cut the lead into single digits with less than eight minutes left. He matched his career high with nine points. \n\nKJ Feagin had 11 points and a season-high eight assists, but he and Brownridge combined to hit only 8 of 29 from the floor. \n\n\"They did a good job and he probably didn't bring his 'A' game,\" Santa Clara head coach Herb Sendek said about Brownridge's accuracy. \"But people are trying to stop him every game and he doesn't get to come out of the game. He has terrific mental toughness and we've asked him to do a lot.\" \n\nJoe Rahon, who had eight points and five assists, shadowed Brownridge for the majority of the game. \n\n\"We did a pretty good job on him (Jared) last year,\" Saint Mary's head coach Randy Bennett said. \"He's a heck of a player\u2014one of the best to play in this conference. I have so much respect for that kid. But, Joe Rahon is one of the best defenders in this conference, so that was key. You have to do a good job on Brownridge and then everybody else starts getting going too.\" \n\nIn Thursday's win against BYU, Santa Clara connected on a season-high tying 14 3-pointers, but couldn't duplicate that effort against the Gaels who allow opponents to hit only 31 percent from behind the 3-point line. \n  \nVIDEO | @SantaClaraHoops highlights from tonight's bout with No. 21 Saint Mary's #StampedeAhead  #SCUBroncos  https://t.co/wEDZSi9hJQ  pic.twitter.com/fGRD8DRKUz \n\u2014 Santa Clara Broncos (@SCUBroncos) January 29, 2017  \nThe Broncos did get the start they needed in an attempt to knock off a deep Gaels squad. \n  \nBoth teams hit 5 of their first 6 shots, but the Broncos missed their next eight allowing Saint Mary's to sprint to a 26-11 lead. \n\nLandale, who had a game-high 10 rebounds, was the catalyst with 10 points during a 16-0 run. \n\nBut the Broncos clawed their way back behind Kratch, who connected both inside and from the perimeter. His 3-pointer from the left wing cut the deficit to 30-24 with less than three minutes remaining in the half. He had 14 of the team's 30 first-half points. \n\nEvan Wardlow started in place of Hauser and contributed six points and two assists. \n\n\"Evan really battled for us tonight and gave us some good minutes,\" Sendek said. \n\nAfter four straight at home, the Broncos now hit the road for four, beginning Thursday at Portland. Tipoff is set for 7 p.m. \n\nTeam Notes : The two top teams in the WCC in assist percentage combined to assist on 76.5 percent of the field goals made in the game. Santa Clara recorded 18 assists on 23 buckets (78.2 percent) while Saint Mary's assisted on 18 of 24 field goals made (75 percent) ... the Broncos turned the ball over just four times, their lowest total in a game this season ... the Gaels controlled the tempo, recording just 56 possessions on the night, four below their nation-lowest average of 60.2 possessions per game ... SMC shot 16 of 20 from the charity stripe while the SCU knocked down seven of the 10 they attempted ... Santa Clara hauled in a season-low 20 rebounds, losing the rebounding battle to Saint Mary's by 11 ... the Gaels shot 57.1 percent from the field, the highest an opponent has shot from the field against the Broncos this season. \n\nIndividual Notes : In just the sixth start of his career and first of the season, Wardlow chipped in six points, two rebounds and two assists in a season-high 32 minutes ... Kratch's 14 points was his second-best 1st-half total of the season, second only to his 15 points in the first half against Cal State East Bay (Dec. 10). He finished the game tying his season-high of 19 points ... Brownridge's five-game streak of recording more than 20 points was snapped as he tallied just 13 points on the night ... with his eight assists, Feagin has dished out 5+ assists in eight consecutive games ... Ndumanya tied career-highs in points (nine), steals (three) and minutes (35). \n \nConnect with the Broncos on Social Media \n \nAthletics:  Facebook  |  Twitter  |  Instagram  |  YouTube \n \nMen's Basketball: Twitter  |  Instagram |  YouTube | Snapchat (SantaClaraHoops)","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: American football news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: basketball news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest scores","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Men\u2019s Basketball Has Gritty Effort, But No. 21/21 Saint Mary\u2019s Prevails 72-59","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Santa Clara","zipCode":"95053","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Santa Clara","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Santa Clara Broncos","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169697221","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3"},"name":"Santa Clara Broncos","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.santaclarabroncos.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://twitter.com/SantaClaraHoops","https://twitter.com/hashtag/StampedeAhead?src=hash","https://twitter.com/hashtag/SCUBroncos?src=hash","https://t.co/wEDZSi9hJQ","https://t.co/fGRD8DRKUz","https://twitter.com/SCUBroncos/status/825599057934446594","https://www.facebook.com/santaclarabroncos/","https://twitter.com/scubroncos","http://instagram.com/scubroncos","http://www.youtube.com/user/SantaClaraBroncos","https://twitter.com/santaclarahoops","https://www.instagram.com/santaclarahoops","http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZAfl959vBfv239CxNnterXtMgqqycN0q","https://www.snapchat.com/"],"sequenceId":"695199577721","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:52:33Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Both the Volunteers and Jayhawks mixing in zone defenses didn\u2019t help UK\u2019s offense but UK\u2019s own defense shoulders some of the blame as well.   \n \n\u201cWe just got to say, look, guys if you want to do this, you got to be a defensive team first,\u201d head coach John Calipari said. \u201cNow, if you defend and rebound, what does that give us an opportunity to do? Fly. If you can\u2019t stop a team from scoring, how are you going to play fast? You can\u2019t play fast. So if you want to run, you got to defend first.\u201d \n \nBoth Tennessee and Kansas were able to get to the spots they wanted on offense and UK suffering a beating in second chance points and points in the paint was the result. \n \nOver half of Kansas\u2019 points (44) came in the paint against UK. While that number may be higher than usual because the Jayhawks struggled to shoot from outside in the first half, it still points out that they were able to get inside and convert on enough quality looks inside to really hurt UK. \n \n\u201cThey were able to get to the basket and hit second chance points,\u201d Dominique Hawkins said. \u201cI felt like at times, we weren\u2019t communicating on defense and playing lazy defense. And they took advantage of it.\u201d  \n \nThe easy buckets inside were back-breakers for UK as they tried to come back in the second half but they were also crucial in that every made layup or put back by the Jayhawks was one less opportunity UK had to get out and run.  \n \nUK\u2019s offense has struggled other times since conference play began but UK had its crutch of getting out in transition to lean on. One game that stands out is the road win in Nashville, Tenn. against Vanderbilt. The refs played a big role in UK never really settling into a rhythm on offense but the Commodores chucked up enough bad three-point attempts to give UK all the opportunities in transition that it needed. \n \nIn UK\u2019s last three losses against Louisville, Tennessee, and now Kansas, the opposing offenses were more disciplined and, in turn, were able to force the issue of UK having to look elsewhere for offense in the half court. \n \nKansas and head coach Bill Self rattled the UK offense with a zone and increased focus on Malik Monk. After Monk scored 12 points in the first half to lead UK, he was held to just six points in the second on far less efficient shooting.  \n \nUK\u2019s other freshman guard De\u2019Aaron Fox showed his age in his carelessness with the ball. He finished with five turnovers to lead UK, which as a team threw it away 17 times. \n \nEven though UK was still within reach in the closing minutes, an offensive rebound and put back from Kansas freshman Josh Jackson essentially sealed the game.  \n \nUK finished the game allowing 10 offensive rebounds, while also being on the losing side of points in the paint (44-34, KU) and second chance points (17-7, KU). The brakes from this two-game skid, have effectively led to the UK offense coming to a screeching stop, but improvement will have to start on defense for the Cats to turn it around. \n \n\u201cThis was, we got out-toughed and we didn\u2019t guard the way we needed to guard, which is all curable,\u201d Calipari said. \u201c\u2026The greatest thing about this group is they will want to win and they will want to learn.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Anthony Crawford"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Defensive woes, Kansas' defense puts the brakes on UK offense in the loss","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Fayette","zipCode":"40506","state":"Kentucky","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Lexington","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Kentucky Kernel","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169772225","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"9"},"name":"Kentucky Kernel","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.kykernel.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199582177","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T03:09:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:52:34Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/kykernel.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/7/3f/73f25e2e-e5d0-11e6-8bce-f3192a47441c/588d5d1644ba9.image.jpg?resize=300%2C200"}],"video":[]}}

Social media managers, cloud service specialists, and professional drone racers would\u2019ve all seemed out of this world to the average person in the early 2000s. \n \nThe technological changes made since then haven\u2019t just impacted the kind of jobs that are available, but how we do those jobs too. Whole companies can be built without the staff ever setting foot in the same office, people can print out 3D prototypes in a matter of minutes, and many can carry everything they need to do their job in a single pocket. \n \nBut what does the future of work look like? What changes will the next decade, and beyond, bring? It\u2019s hard to tell, but if the following TED talks are anything to go by, we\u2019re in for a wild ride. \n Andrew McAfee: What will future jobs look like?  \n \n \nOne of the greatest fears of workers throughout the ages has been of machines taking their jobs. It\u2019s something that has happened in the past. And, as economist Andrew McAfee points out in this TED Talk, it will continue to happen in the future. The nature of technology means that it\u2019ll likely happen much faster and across a much wider variety of fields though. \n \nMcAfee does not, however, believe that this means we\u2019ll end up handing over our souls to our robot overlords. Instead, he suggests that with the right facts and understanding, we can build a society where humans are freed from drudgery and toil and where innovation and creativity are the primary goals. \n Erik Brynjolfsson: The key to growth? Race with the machines  \n\n \nAnother TED alumnus, who doesn\u2019t think we should fear the rise of the machines, is American academic Erik Brynjolfsson. \n \nSome believe that technological advancements and automation means stagnant growth at a great cost to jobs and economies. Brynjolfsson is more optimistic. \n \nHe believes that we\u2019re simply experiencing the growing pains of a radically reorganised economy. And, if we want to get things right, we need to think of \u201cthe machines\u201d as teammates rather than competitors. \n Wingham Rowan: A new kind of job market  \n\n \nThe rise of services such as Airbnb, Uber, and TaskRabbit has dramatically impacted the way we think about making money. \n \nBut, says policy entrepreneur Wingham Rowan, they\u2019re actually pretty slow when you compare them to the services available to organisations at the top of the economy. \n \nThe opportunity waiting to be exploited, Rowan believes, is one which allows people with flexible hours to connect meaningfully with employers that have flexible needs. \n Rainer Strack: The Workforce Crisis of 2030\u2014and how to start solving it now  \n\n \nIt may sound a little counter-intuitive, especially given how much space we\u2019ve dedicated to automation in this piece, but the year 2030 could see a major talent shortage in developed countries. \n \nIf they\u2019re to overcome those challenges and keep growing, those countries will have to look elsewhere for talent. \n \nBefore they can do that however, Rainer Strack says, these countries need to help the businesses within them change their corporate cultures. \n Anthony Goldbloom: The jobs we\u2019ll lose to machines \u2014 and the ones we won\u2019t  \n\n \nMachine learning is one of the most complex, but important trends driving automation in the workplace. \n \nWhere machines could once only beat humans at things like assessing credit scores and sorting mail. Today they can grade school papers and diagnose diseases. \n \nAccording to Anthony Goldbloom, that means machines will take many jobs. He suggests, however, that computers struggle when they\u2019re presented with novel situations. Goldbloom therefore believes that people in jobs that present these on a daily basis \u2013 copywriting and business strategy being two examples \u2013 will be safely employed for a long time to come. \n \nThe post appeared first on Engage Me .","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Stuart Thomas: Editor-in-Chief"},"topics":[{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"5 Fascinating TED Talks about the future of work","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Western Asia","countryCode":"AE","country":"United Arab Emirates"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Engage Me","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"609667203","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Engage Me","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Business"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://engageme.online"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199584589","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:00:53Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:52:32Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

KETTLEWELL \n \nVoyaging is about repairing your boat in exotic places. \n  \nRemember when you used to read those magazine articles about voyaging off into the sunset to get away from it all? And now that you\u2019re out there doing it, you realize that to stay out there you need to be more organized than you used to be, with more lists of things to do, and your job description has grown longer by pages. Voyaging is really about repairing your boat in exotic places, so you have to embrace it or the voyage will be short, unpleasant and not have a happy ending. \n\nOil changes, filter changes, coolant changes, engine adjustments and lubrication, battery top-ups, pump maintenance and many other chores have their own schedules that will rule your life. When the hours are up, you will be doing your oil and filter changes or eventually you\u2019ll be doing an engine change. We all know this and plan for this, but I have found that you need two lists to replace the one your significant other used to hand you as headed off to work. \n\nStop and shop \nThe first list is both content- and time-based. It is the list of routine maintenance stuff needed over the period of time between major stocking ports. What is a \u201cmajor stocking port\u201d? There is no master list, but they are generally easy to identify from afar. The surest sign of one is the presence of the very first-world Travelift-type of boat-hauling gear located in a marina with floating docks loaded with pleasure boats. These signs indicate a proximity to stores selling motor oil, filters, batteries, paint, etc. Chances are your voyaging plans will include a few of these, and for my part I try to include one every year for the annual haulout and maintenance binge. \n\nYes, it is possible to get hauled at fishing boat yards, commercial yards, etc., but in my experience the cost savings does not usually make up for the inconvenience. Often the cost savings of the cheap haulout place evaporates if you add in the necessity to take taxis to find stuff, or the need to ship in heavy supplies. Keep in mind too that in many parts of the world there is no reliable mail service and shipping is often very expensive. When I was in Colombia the cost to get a small FedEx box of mail was more than $50 (USD). \n   \nJohn Kettlewell\u2019s pocket list includes parts for boat and motorcycle. \n  \nTwice is nice \nIn any case, I recommend a yearly arrival at your chosen haulout port where there is a reasonable chance of finding the quality and quantity of maintenance supplies you need. Obviously, the distance and time between two of these stops will determine the quantity of oil, filters, etc., needed. My rule of thumb is to have on board at all times a minimum of twice the quantity of these expendables I plan on using. \n\nIn other words, if I am expecting to run 200 engine hours during the year, that will add up to two complete oil changes and two oil filters, so I will have at least double those quantities of my preferred brands on board. By the way, the existence of oil recycling facilities are also limited to those first-world boatyards you will be seeking once a year, so please plan on retaining your dirty oil until you get someplace where you can dispose of it in an environmentally sound manner. \n\nWhat quantity of engine coolant to bring is problematic. I have found that quality coolant is often harder to find than engine oil. I purchase coolant that is rated for five years of life anyway, so the need to completely replace it is low if I collect and reuse coolant when doing system repairs. I like to carry enough coolant to provide a complete change if needed, though I don\u2019t plan on doing that very often. In a pinch it is certainly possible to use water from a reverse osmosis watermaker or even just plain drinking water. I always have at least one white plastic utility bucket and sealing lid on board that can be used to capture drained coolant when necessary. Being white makes it easy to see if it is clean before the coolant goes in. \n\nFilters tend to be harder to locate than the proper oil and they are also easier to store, and basically last forever. I stock up when I find them at a reasonable price, so I often have multiple years\u2019 worth on board. This is important, particularly for fuel filters, in case you have an emergency situation where filters are plugging up due to bad fuel. I know of voyagers who limped back to Florida from the Bahamas by changing fuel filters every few hours as they plugged up one after the other. \n\nI choose a dry day with low humidity and then seal my filters in zipper-type freezer bags, then store them in plastic boxes in a dry spot. Stored like that, filters have lasted years on board in the tropics \u2014 so don\u2019t be shy about bringing plenty. \n   \nYou might be hunting for supplies at a fishing boat dock instead of a marine supply store.  \n  \nThe second list \nThis \u201cdouble the spares\u201d rule means if you get to that boatyard with the lift and there is no oil, or more likely they don\u2019t have the right type of oil, you can probably make it to the next first-world marina before your maintenance situation becomes dire. This is where the second list comes into play. The first list \u2014 the master list \u2014 of everything you need and in what quantities is your on board list, while the second list is your pocket list, or backpack list, or maybe your phone list. It is the one you will always have on you as you explore the backstreets of exotic backwaters around the world. \n\nThe second list is the oil you need, the filters you\u2019re running low on, the spark plugs for the dinghy outboard, etc., that you were unable to replenish at the last nice marina you were in almost a year ago. You never know when you\u2019ll stumble upon a treasure of such stuff, and you have to pounce when you do. I remember feeling like a kid visiting a toy store when I walked into a fishing boat supply store in Honduras and there before me were racks of marine hardware, shelves full of oil, fresh-looking batteries, and so on. I spent several days anchored nearby just to make sure I had all the bits and bobs I needed on my various lists. \n\nThe same situation played out over the many weeks I spent in Cartagena, Colombia. My pocket list was always there if I spotted some auto parts store, or a hardware store in an odd spot. I found quality gasket-making material in one shop, another happened to have silicone sealant, one down on the waterfront happened to have two-stroke oil, while it took two or three shops to piece together the various hydraulic fittings I needed. None of these things were available in the small marine stores near the marinas, but I was always ready to switch into list mode while out sightseeing, etc. \n\nOf course, it will be impossible to purchase the exact brand and quality of material you are replacing so it is important to have notes on the pocket list providing you with alternatives. Mine includes numerous filter types that cross-reference to my engine oil filter. It is important to get close to your engine oil specs, but don\u2019t be surprised if you can\u2019t find exactly what you want. In Panama I couldn\u2019t easily locate my usual 15W-40 diesel engine oil so I had to make do with some Texaco-branded straight 40 I found in a large supermarket of all places. In Colombia I found a fast oil change car place that advertised Shell products and was able to order a case of diesel spec Rotella for me, but it was in different bottles and had different specs than oil I have purchased in the U.S. Luckily, my engine manual had a long list of alternate oils and specs that were allowable and I had notes on my pocket list. \n   \nAn important element of all your lists should be engine oil specifications so you can pick up oil when you run across it. \n  \nFor both lists I prefer to use the simple old paper list. Sure, store the information in a spreadsheet on your computer, but print out a few hard copies so these are always readily available. A paper list folded twice fits neatly into a zipper-type sandwich bag for water protection. You never know when you\u2019ll be fueling up and you\u2019ll spot something you need behind the counter, and you don\u2019t want to be firing up your computer just to check your oil or filter specs. I keep the most important info on oil, filters and impellors written within the first few pages of my logbook so it is always handy. \n\nPhone it in \nInevitably, there will be something you can\u2019t locate in your exotic anchorage, so be prepared with a contact back home who is ready and willing to assist. Ideally, this person will be another boater or at least someone who is mechanically savvy and can locate that odd pump part that is impossible to find in Fiji. I like to have on board several marine master catalogs from places like Hamilton Marine, Defender and West Marine. Yes, the Internet is your friend, but connections are not always available and it can be useful to be able to compare images in the catalogs to the installed part on your boat. It is often better to order the parts yourself, have them shipped to your friend and then have that friend consolidate various orders and ship them to you when you arrive at a place with reliable connections to the outside world. \n\nIf your friend is capable, you can leave behind one of your master lists just in case you need him or her to hunt you up some new fuel filters. Always seize the opportunity of guest visits becoming parts delivery runs. My father arrived in Colombia with a suitcase bulging with unobtainable spares. Don\u2019t worry, most guests will see it as part of the excitement of their exotic vacation! \n\nJohn J.

Following an early trading of buckets by the two teams, the Cats started to get things going offensively, more specifically Malik Monk, who continued to perform in primetime. \n \nMonk hit his first five shots in route to a 12-point first half that helped the Cats build a decent size lead midway through the first half, but Monk was not alone. Derek Willis was a perfect 2-2 from deep in the first and provided offense off the bench that the Cats lacked Tuesday against Tennessee. \n \nAs UK\u2019s offense was able to get going, Kansas\u2019 only true big-man Landen Lucas picked up his second foul, and the Jayhawks switched to zone. While the fouls on Lucas were a big deal, the bigger story may have been the frustration that Kansas\u2019 zone provided for UK. \n \nIn the final five minutes of the first half, the Cats saw a 10-point lead dwindle down to five at the half, but it was the sloppy play of UK that prevented it from taking near total control of the game. The way that the Jayhawks played in the first half left the door open for the Cats, but they could not capitalize which paved the way for KU to open the second half in striking distance. \n \nA team like Kansas with veteran guards and a stud freshman is almost guaranteed to put it together no matter the situation, and that is what the Jayhawks did right out of the gate to start the second half. \n \nJosh Jackson, KU\u2019s star freshman came roaring out of the gate in the second half, giving the Jayhawks the lead with a pair of threes. Not only was it Jackson who got going, but the backcourt duo of Frank Mason III and Devonte\u2019 Graham hit that veteran gear and ramped up their play on both ends of the floor. \n \nThe two savvy veteran guards were clearly unbothered by the chaos that was Rupp Arena and against a young duo like UK\u2019s, Mason III and Graham constantly kept their team composed which prevented the typical second half UK offensive outburst.  \n \nThat outburst that fans have been accustomed to seeing was absent Saturday night largely in-part to the composure of both Mason and Graham that kept Kansas within themselves the entire second half. \n \nKansas\u2019 ability to remain calm was ultimately the biggest difference in a game that UK had the opportunity to grab hold of, but a little crack in the door was all the veteran-led Jayhawks needed Saturday.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Chris Angolia"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Kansas keeps composure down the stretch, hands UK second straight loss","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Fayette","zipCode":"40506","state":"Kentucky","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Lexington","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Kentucky Kernel","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169772225","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"9"},"name":"Kentucky Kernel","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.kykernel.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199588308","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T01:36:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:52:34Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/kykernel.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/a/43/a430c554-e5cf-11e6-90e5-1392f37c179c/588d5bb9b0143.image.jpg?resize=300%2C200"}],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official.

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 28 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Lancaster","zipCode":"17603","state":"Pennsylvania","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Lancaster","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WGAL Channel","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169674001","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"166"},"name":"WGAL Channel","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wgal.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199597254","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:52:40Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

But generally speaking it's already set for the whole season.\" \n \nMouratoglou said numbers alone were not the main factor behind Serena's continuing hunger, even in her 20th year on tour. \n \n\"She was not motivated by 22, she was motivated to win grand slams,\" he said. \n \n\"That's her motivation. This won't change until she maybe one day wakes up and is not motivated to win grand slams, but for now she is. That's enough. The record is not the thing that makes her play.\" \n \nAnd Mouratoglou said Serena would not obsess over the record of 24 held by Court. \n \n\"With all the respect for Margaret Court, it was another era, the draws were like 16 players and they were not professionals,\" he said. \n \n\"Of course the record is here and we definitely want to beat it, but there was a professional era and the record was Steffi Graf.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: tennis news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Serena to play fewer tournaments","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Southern Africa","countryCode":"ZA","country":"South Africa"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"SuperSport","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659065","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"161"},"name":"SuperSport","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Tennis","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.supersport.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://twitter.com/share"],"sequenceId":"695199610861","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:24:48Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:52:50Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://images.supersport.com/2017/1/Serena-Williams-170128-Signing-G-80.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

EST January 29, 2017 \n   \nHartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport  (Photo: WXIA) \n    \nATLANTA -- Tense moments arose on Saturday as up to 11 people were detained while returning to Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport just one day after President Donald Trump announced his plans of an immigration ban involving refugees from certain countries. \n \nHowever, as 11Alive learned, these regulations also impacted foreign-born residents of Georgia who were returning from countries such as Iran. \n \nAmong those who were stopped on their trip home were a family of three, including a 10-year-old child, and a grandmother who is not related to the other detainees.  Hours later - after 7 p.m. - the family was released to go home. \n \nToo emotional to speak on camera, they said they wanted to get their 10-year-old daughter home. Brother-in-law Mansour Kenareh said the Suwanee family was in good spirits but frustrated. \n \nA spokesperson tells 11Alive that the family were originally from Iran but were residents of Georgia. They were returning from vacation in the country and were deplaning a flight from Amsterdam when they were detained around 12:30 p.m. Neither airport nor federal officials have confirmed these reports as of Saturday afternoon. \n \nThe detainment reports come amidst others around the country following a crackdown on immigration by the newly seated Trump administration. The President\u2019s executive action temporarily bans citizens from 7 Muslim-majority nations from entering the US.  Immigration activists say that includes green card holders. \n \n\"If you had come in at 4 yesterday afternoon you would not have this problem,\" Immigration Attorney Sarah Owings said. \n \nOwings said the travelers she had learned of were visiting family in Iran when they ran into issues returning to America while at Hartsfield-Jackson. \n \n\"Based on this executive action which was very hasty - very last minute - it was not something that was discussed by the legal community,\" Owings said. \"Or even the agencies that are impacted by this because they don\u2019t actually know what they\u2019re doing or how to do it.\" \n \nKenareh said his in-laws have been in the US for a little more than a year. The father is in the process of opening a business locally.  Kenareh hopes the issue is resolved soon. \n \n\"I don't blame the  people who are doing their job,\" he said. \"I give them credit, they are confused.\" \n \nUSA TODAY reports that  about 50 people were detained at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport , according to Alia Salem, executive director for DFW Chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR). Families have been waiting at Terminal D in anticipation of meeting relatives who been held up in U.S Customs. A representative with CAIR met with families waiting for relatives. Some of them have been waiting for several hours. \n \nMeanwhile at Philadelphia International Airport,  two Syrian families, described as Christians, were briefly detained Saturday after arriving from Qatar and sent back three hours later. The families included two brothers, their wives and two children, according to a family member form Allentown, Pa., NBC10 reported . \n \nMohammed Al Rawi, chief information officer for Los Angeles County, said on Facebook that his father was removed from a flight in Qatar as a direct result of the order. \n \nIn addition to protests planned at airports around the country, there is also one planned for Hartsfield-Jackson in response to the executive orders. \n \n(© 2017 WXIA)","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US immigration news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"As many as 11 detained at Hartsfield-Jackson following Trump immigration ban","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Bibb","zipCode":"31211","state":"Georgia","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Macon","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"13WMAZ","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169661796","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"13"},"name":"13WMAZ","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Politics","Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.13wmaz.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/01/28/trump-refugee-ban-blocks-7-migrants-boarding-ny-bound-plane-cairo/97181446/","http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/Two-Syrian-Families-Detained-at-Philadelphia-International-Airport-Told-to-Fly-Back-Family-Member-Says-412047173.html?_osource=SocialFlowTwt_PHBrand"],"sequenceId":"695199611486","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:52:55Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

If we get 1 on 1, I\u2019m going your way so you\u2019d better win,\u2019\u201d Webb said. \u201cAnd he did. He won multiple times.\u201d \n \nWebb spread the ball around to other receivers like Mississippi State\u2019s Fred Ross as well. The Pac-12 Conference\u2019s leading passer directed scoring drives on all three of his possessions while completing 11 of 16 passes for 165 yards, including a 39-yard touchdown strike on a well-thrown fade to Reynolds. Reynolds had six catches for 96 yards, most of them on that first drive with Webb. \n \nNate Peterman of Pittsburgh had a similarly strong passing performance for the North in the showcase game for senior NFL prospects that actually featured late drama. Peterman fired a 6-yard scoring pass to East Carolina\u2019s Zay Jones with 1:51 left but the North went for two points and a potential lead. \n \nUnder heavy pressure from Chattanooga\u2019s Keionta Davis, Peterman\u2019s pass was deflected and intercepted by BYU\u2019s Harvey Langi. The South ran out the clock from there. \n \nThe week was about auditioning for NFL teams, more than winning, but Peterman said he wanted that last completion \u201cvery bad.\u201d \n \n\u201cYou\u2019re always competitive,\u201d said Peterman, who was 16-of-23 passing for 153 yards and played most of the game. \u201cTo say you can drive down and win the Senior Bowl in the last seconds, that would have been pretty cool. We didn\u2019t get it but it was a great experience still.\u201d \n \nWebb was the game\u2019s overall MVP after passing for 4,295 yards and 37 touchdowns last season as a graduate transfer from Texas Tech. \n \nHe led the South to a touchdown and field goal in the final three minutes of the first half. He and Reynolds proved a prolific combination on the touchdown drive, moving downfield on connections of 21 \u2014 on a third-and-10 play \u2014 and 13 yards before the touchdown. \n \nGame rules require teams to go for two points in the second quarter, and the South\u2019s attempt failed to keep the halftime lead at 9-3. \n \nAWARD WINNERS \n \nToledo running back Kareem Hunt ran for 118 yards on 15 carries to earn North Outstanding Player Honors, including a 20-yarder and a 43-yarder on back-to-back plays. \n \n\u201cHonestly, the guys up front did a great job and I just showed some patience and was able to hit it,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cIt opened up. It was pretty clear reads up there. Everybody was going hard. We wanted to win.\u201d \n \nThe South\u2019s honoree was Kansas State defensive end Jordan Willis, who forced two fumbles and had a pair of sacks. \n \nWillis said he wanted to get on people\u2019s radar since \u201cI feel like a lot of people don\u2019t know about me.\u201d He said Browns defensive coordinator Gregg Williams emphasized forcing turnovers. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s find ball, see ball, get ball,\u201d Willis said. \u201cThat\u2019s what coach Williams was saying all week long.\u201d \n \nHEAVY TURNOVER \n \nThe South committed five turnovers and turned it over on its first three possessions. That included a pair of interceptions thrown by Antonio Pipkin of Division II Tiffin and another by Tennessee\u2019s Josh Dobbs. Saint Francis linebacker Lorenzo Jerome forced a fumble and made two interceptions for the North. \n \nCOACHING STAFFS \n \nHue Jackson and his Cleveland Browns staff led the South team, and have the first, 12th and 33rd overall picks in the April draft. The Chicago Bears\u2019 John Fox, who has the No. 3 pick, coached the North. They\u2019re mostly looking for players beyond their top pick in Mobile, since stars like Clemson quarterback Deshaun Watson and Alabama defensive lineman Jonathan Allen turned down invitations and Texas A&M defensive end Myles Garrett is a junior and not eligible.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Webb, Reynolds have strong connection in Senior Bowl win","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Lubbock","zipCode":"79401","state":"Texas","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Lubbock","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Lubbock Online","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169792140","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"318"},"name":"Lubbock Online","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://lubbockonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199611663","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:52:55Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

There\u2019s not enough drama. It\u2019s not real NFL football. \n \nBut Incognito, a Buffalo Bills guard, is like the vast majority of the 88 players invited to this all-star gathering Sunday night. He sees the Pro Bowl more as a celebration of achievement and as a way to thank the fans. \n \nHe wouldn\u2019t change a thing. \n \n\u201cIn my mind it\u2019s as good as it should be,\u201d Incognito said. \u201cYou really can\u2019t ask guys to come out here and fly around at full speed when we\u2019ve been off for the last two or three weeks. And some guys are just coming down here after conference championship games. Maybe make it more fan interactive, get the fans involved more, do more of the skills competition.\u201d \n \nThe NFL has seemed open to ways to energize its end-of-the-year showcase that is now sandwiched between conference championship and Super Bowl weeks. A few years ago the league broke from the traditional AFC-NFC Pro Bowl matchup and allowed celebrity coaches to draft two teams. \n \nNow, in hopes of giving the game a lift, the NFL has moved the Pro Bowl from Hawaii to Orlando, where it has become more of a weeklong event, complete with a re-imagined Skill Showdown. The AFC-NFC matchup has also returned after three years of nonconference games. \n \nStill, it remains to be seen if the NFL can continue selling a game that bears little resemblance to the product it puts on the field during the season. The players come to the Pro Bowl to have fun, not get hurt and maybe win. \n \n\u201cThis Pro Bowl for me in a sense is special because you are coming here to celebrate what you\u2019ve accomplished,\u201d New York Giants receiver Odell Beckham, Jr. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of fun.\u201d \n \nSeattle Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman says the intensity would rise and more invited players would show up if the NFL gave them their weekly game salaries. Under the collective bargaining agreement, each player from the winning team will make $61,000 this week and the losing players will take home $30,000. \n \n\u201cYou pay them what you are paying them and you get this performance,\u201d Sherman said. \u201cIt\u2019s a different element. \u2026 I guarantee you less guys would miss the Pro Bowl if you told you are going to pay them their normal salary for one more game.\u201d \n \nFormer NFL player and coach Herm Edwards says the game as played now is fine. He says the Pro Bowl is not about the game, it\u2019s about the fans and the players giving back. Thousands of fans have been out at ESPN\u2019s Wide World of Sports complex this week watching both the AFC and NFC practice. \n \nAfter the practices were over most of the players signed autographs and took pictures in the laid-back atmosphere. All of the practices are short and glorified walk-throughs, and the players are mostly having fun with each other and the fans. \n \n\u201cWe are all ambassadors to this great game of football and how you conduct yourself once you leave this practice field is more important than how you play the game,\u201d said Edwards, who now works as analyst. \u201cThe fans aren\u2019t going to remember the game. The fans remember if Odell Beckham, Patrick Peterson, or if Drew Brees takes a picture with them, signs an autograph.\u201d \n \nEdwards, however, understands the criticism. He even admits, as a football purist, he doesn\u2019t watch the Pro Bowl. \n \nBut he says if the game does become more fiercely contested it would come at a cost that players, teams and even fans may not want to pay. \n \n\u201cThe only way to make it better is you do this: If you want all of them to show up, make the game worth $500,000,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cThey will all show up and now they play. Here is the problem, when one of them gets hurt you have the same problem.\u201d \n \nOakland Raiders general manager Reggie McKenzie acknowledges being torn when his players are selected for the Pro Bowl. On one hand, he is excited for their recognition. On the other, he\u2019s concerned about injuries. \n \nMcKenzie would be in favor of more of skills challenge than a game where key players can be injured. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s a risk,\u201d said McKenzie, who will have four players representing the AFC on Sunday. \u201cI cringe every time I go to practice, but it\u2019s the nature of the game. It\u2019s what it is. But you do everything you can to set your safety-type precautions. What else can you do? Not play?

Then there was a dispute over the way the players got off the plane once they landed in Miami. For some reason, receiver Terance Mathis decided the Super Bowl stage would be a good week to talk about his battle with alcohol and a feeling that he wasn\u2019t appreciated. And brash cornerback Ray Buchanan turned media day into a full-blown circus by wearing a dog collar \u2014 the Falcons were underdogs, you see \u2014 and saying Broncos star Shannon Sharpe looked like a horse. \n \nAll of that paled in comparison to what happened the night before the game, when safety Eugene Robinson \u2014 perhaps the most respected member of the team \u2014 was arrested for trying to pick up a prostitute. Robinson was bailed out of jail and played in the game, only to get beaten on a long touchdown pass. \n \nNot surprisingly, the Broncos cruised to a 34-19 victory and their second straight title in John Elway\u2019s final game. \n \n\u201cAny kind of distraction hurts,\u201d Reeves recalled in an interview from his Atlanta home. \u201cWhen one player causes a distraction the night before the game, it makes it more difficult. But we just got beat by a better team.\u201d \n \nDespite the loss, the team is still remembered fondly in Atlanta, a city that has produced only one championship team \u2014 the 1995 World Series-winning Braves \u2014 in any of the major sports. \n \nJamal Anderson, who rushed for more than 1,800 yards and takes credit for the arm-flapping dance that gave the team its nickname, said he can hardly go anywhere without someone remembering the \u201898 Falcons. \n \n\u201cNo matter what airport I\u2019m in, when people recognize me, they yell, \u2018Dirty Bird!\u2019\u201d Anderson said. \n \nEighteen years later, with the Falcons headed back to the Super Bowl for only the second time in franchise history, the team that paved the way left behind some useful lessons. \n \nFor one, never assume there will be a return trip if things don\u2019t work out. The Dirty Birds certainly thought they\u2019d get another shot, but they followed up their 14-2 season by going 5-11 the following year \u2014 the first of three straight losing campaigns. They didn\u2019t even get back to the playoffs until 2002, with a largely different cast. \n \nBy then, Anderson was out of the league, his career cut short at age 29 by two severe knee injuries. \n \n\u201cYou never know what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you get a chance to be there, you\u2019ve got to lay it all on the line.\u201d \n \nPlus, the sting of losing the final game of the season never leaves you. \n \nTo this day, the 44-year-old Anderson has never watched a replay of his lone Super Bowl. \n \n\u201cYou don\u2019t ever get over losing a Super Bowl,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople\u2019s careers are made by being the MVP of that game. You get that title forever. I\u2019m very proud of winning the NFC championship and the way we did it. At least we got to hang that banner. But I sure wanted to win the Super Bowl.\u201d \n \nThe NFC championship game remains the highlight of the season for Reeves, especially since it came just three weeks after he underwent quadruple-bypass heart surgery. \n \nDespite their lofty record, the Falcons were huge underdogs going on the road to face the Minnesota Vikings, who had lost only one game while setting an NFL scoring record. In the raucous Metrodome, Atlanta trailed by 10 points early in the fourth quarter, and it looked as though the Vikings would clinch the victory when Gary Anderson lined up for a 38-yard field goal with just over 2 minute remaining. \n \nStunningly, Anderson missed for the first time all season. \n \nThe Falcons drove for the tying touchdown and won in overtime on Morten Andersen\u2019s 38-yard field goal. \n \nOn the stage in the middle of a stunned, emptying stadium, Reeves did the \u201cDirty Bird\u201d with his players. \n \n\u201cThere\u2019s not any question, the win in Minnesota\u201d was the game Reeves remembers most. \u201cBecause of the circumstances and how good a football team they were and winning on the road, having everything really against you as far as the crowd and everything,\u201d he said. \u201cCertainly, the fact I had bypass surgery made it little more special.\u201d \n \nUnfortunately for Reeves and the Falcons, they couldn\u2019t win the game that really counted. \n \nLittle did they know, their loss would have a profound effect on a current Falcons star. \n \nVic Beasley was just 6 years old, but he was already a huge fan of the team growing up about an hour\u2019s drive north of Atlanta. Now an All-Pro defensive end who led the league in sacks, he hasn\u2019t forgotten the pain he felt watching the Falcons\u2019 first Super Bowl. \n \n\u201cI cried that night,\u201d Beasley said. \u201cI still remained a fan through thick and thin.\u201d \n \nNow, he and his teammates have a chance to finish the job. \n \nThey\u2019ve got no bigger fans than the Dirty Birds. \n \n\u201cI\u2019m very happy for them,\u201d Jamal Anderson said. \u201cI\u2019m really, really happy for the city. I\u2019m really happy for Falcons fans, the true and hardcore fans who are supportive and encouraging. You know, we have an interesting history in this city. I\u2019m just happy to see that we finally made it back.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: NFL - Denver Broncos news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: NFL - Atlanta Falcons news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: NFL - Minnesota Vikings news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"As Falcons return to big game, remembering the Dirty Birds","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Lubbock","zipCode":"79401","state":"Texas","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Lubbock","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Lubbock Online","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169792140","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"318"},"name":"Lubbock Online","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://lubbockonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199612014","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:52:55Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It shut down his former team and then the potent Packers to get to the title match with New England. \n \nBefore Quinn begins figuring out how to figure out Brady, Bill Belichick and the rest of the Patriots, his first task is simply guiding the Falcons down a path they aren\u2019t familiar with. \n \nRegardless of how that Super Bowl turned out two years back, at least Quinn has traveled this way twice before, including a romp over Denver in February 2014, when his D was too much for Peyton Manning and the Broncos. \n \n\u201cFor a lot of guys, playing in their first divisional game a couple weeks ago, and playing in their first NFC championship game, and all those experiences are new,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cYou have to have awareness for those. And this experience is different, also. I want to fully recognize that. \n \n\u201cHowever, when we do get to the game, it\u2019s still going to be the game. There\u2019s a lot of hype that leads up to it. There\u2019s more media exposure that goes along with it. But our process of getting ready doesn\u2019t change. \n \n\u201cOur intent of how we\u2019re going to play doesn\u2019t change. The attitude and identity that we want to play with doesn\u2019t change. So those things are going to stay really consistent and really the same.\u201d \n \nReally consistent and really the same is what can be expected from the other side. No team or coaching staff is better at planning for a specific opponent than the Patriots. Belichick, defensive coordinator Matt Patricia offensive coordinator and Josh McDaniels will devise strategies that can rob Atlanta of its most dangerous options. \n \nIf that means shutting down All-Pro receiver Julio Jones, that\u2019s where New England will focus. If it means neutralizing NFL sacks leader Vic Beasley Jr., that\u2019s also where the Patriots will concentrate efforts. \n \nThis is old hat for Belichick, in his record seventh Super Bowl as head coach (he\u2019s 4-2). The spotlight in this matchup will glare on Quinn, and not just because he is more personable and entertaining. \n \nJust how will he handle the biggest challenge of his career? \n \nTechnically, he\u2019s already into it. Speaking of Brady\u2019s prolific offense \u2014 yes, Atlanta\u2019s was even more prolific in 2016, but the season\u2019s final game is an entirely different scenario \u2014 Quinn was spot-on. \n \n\u201cNumber one, they\u2019re difficult to defend,\u201d he said. \u201cThey use a variety of different formations, personnel groups. They\u2019ve got a huge playbook from the pass game into the run game, the gap schemes, trap schemes and run game, quick game. So I would say it\u2019s offense that\u2019s well-versed. They have different ways to attack you.\u201d \n \nQuinn knows his defense must be doing just as much attacking. He need look no further back than the Patriots\u2019 rout of Pittsburgh last Sunday to see what happens when a team takes the conservative route. \n \nFortunately for the Falcons, Quinn, like mentor Pete Carroll, is often a turn-it-loose coach. Those units that helped carry Seattle to the top of the NFC and to a Lombardi Trophy were assertive, relentless and, well, downright nasty. \n \nHe needs for those traits to spill over into this Super Bowl. \n \nQuinn also must make sure offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan, in what appears to be his final game with Atlanta before taking over as head coach in San Francisco, attacks from the outset, too. Trying to outsmart the Patriots isn\u2019t the trick to winning. Outplaying them is. \n \nWhile Quinn assesses those challenges, Belichick dryly explains what his coaches can use from two years ago. \n \n\u201cYeah, sure, they have some of their own characteristics and of course the players are different, so that makes it different. But schematically there is quite a bit of carry-over,\u201d Belichick said of Seahawks-Falcons similarities. \n \n\u201cI think just kind of at first glance it might be a little more pressure from Atlanta than Seattle ran, but you know, Seattle did some of it, too. \n \n\u201cI think overall the schemes are very similar, so the players that you can relate to those schemes are. Both teams have them: (Kam) Chancellor and (Keanu) Neal,\u201d Belichick said of the big-hitting safeties for Seattle and Atlanta. \n \n\u201cGo right down the line. They\u2019re similar. They play a similar position in a similar defense, so that\u2019s the player. I\u2019m not saying their skills are the same, but that\u2019s what they do.\u201d \n \nNo one is saying the skills of the head coaches are the same right now, at least judging by the resumes.

He has appeared on Fox News Channel, Fox Business Channel, CNN, MSNBC, C-SPAN, NBC, and talk-radio programming worldwide. A former self-employed business owner of more than 30 years, Mychal\u2019s complete Bio is The following was written for January 29, 2017, \u201cOur Daily Bread\u201d by Bill Crowder:\n\n*******************\n\nJeralean Talley died in June 2015 as the world\u2019s oldest living person\u2014116 years of age. In 1995, the city of Jerusalem celebrated its 3,000th birthday. One hundred sixteen is old for a person, and 3,000 is old for a city, but there are trees that grow even older. A bristlecone pine in California\u2019s White Mountains has been determined to be older than 4,800 years. That precedes the patriarch Abraham by 800 years!\n\nJesus, when challenged by the Jewish religious leaders about His identity, also claimed to pre-date Abraham. \u201cVery truly I tell you,\u201d He said, \u201cbefore Abraham was born, I am!\u201d (John 8:58). His bold assertion shocked those who were confronting Him, and they sought to stone Him. They knew He wasn\u2019t referring to a chronological age but was actually claiming to be eternal by taking the ancient name of God, \u201cI am\u201d (see Ex. 3:14). But as a member of the Trinity, He could make that claim legitimately.\n\nIn John 17:3, Jesus prayed, \u201cThis is eternal life: that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.\u201d The timeless One entered into time so we could live forever. He accomplished that mission by dying in our place and rising again. Because of His sacrifice, we anticipate a future not bound by time, where we will spend eternity with Him. He is the timeless one.\n\nThe earth shall soon dissolve like snow, the sun forbear to shine; but God, who called me here below, will be forever mine. John Newton\n\nINSIGHT:\n\nWhen the Lord Jesus declared, \u201cBefore Abraham was born, I am,\u201d in John 8:58, He was merely borrowing the unique title used of God in Exodus 3:14 (I am). What is meant by the title \u201cI Am\u201d? God is the self-existent and only supreme Being. If God is perpetually and permanently present, He can definitively declare, \u201cI will be with you\u201d (Ex. 3:12). God is not a deist\u2014a do-nothing deity who is retired from all activity. He did not \u201cwind up\u201d the world like a huge watch only to let it run on its own. God is sovereign over all creation and lovingly cares for all He has made.\n\nREAD:John 8:48-59\n\n48 Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?\n\n49 Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me.\n\n50 And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.\n\n51 Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.\n\n52 Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death.\n\n53 Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself?\n\n54 Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God:\n\n55 Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know him, and keep his saying.\n\n56 Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad.\n\n57 Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?\n\n58 Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am.\n\n59 Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by.\n\n©2015 The Daily Rant.

This is a policy, I don't know.\u201d \n\n   \nThe policy being Trump\u2019s order to ban immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim countries\u2014Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen\u2014for at least 90 days, and all refugees for at least 120 days. None are even the familial homeland of any of the terrorists who mounted major attack in America, including 9/11, San Bernardno and Orlando. \n\n   \nThe irony of this moment on Saturday became HUGE as Darweesh declared that he had seen America\u2019s true greatness firsthand in the small army of outraged lawyers and activists who mobilized on his behalf as word spread that he and a fellow Iraqi had been detained at JFK Airport even though they had valid visas. \n\n   \n\u201cThis is the humanity, this is the soul of America!\u201d exclaimed the Trump fan in giving thanks to those who had hurried to rescue him from Trump policy. \u201cThis is what pushed me to move, leave my country and come here.\u201d \n\n    \n Alex Brook Lynn  \n   \nDarweesh had been tearful when he first emerged from under the WELCOME TO NEW YORK sign that hangs over the arrivals portal in Terminal 4. He had placed his hands behind his back to show how he had been handcuffed. \n\n   \n\u201cWhat I do for this country? They put the cuffs on,\u201d Darweesh said to reporters. \u201cYou know how many soldiers I touch by this hand?\u201d \n\n   \nEven as he spoke, his story was spreading at the speed of social media to his native Iraq and everywhere else. \n\n   \n\u201cWorldwide,\u201d counter-terrorism cop on the scene later noted. \n\n   \nNo doubt the tale of Darweesh\u2019s Trumpian welcome to New York was of particular interest to people in Mosul, where American special forces are now urging the Iraqi army on in a grim and protected battle with ISIS. Darweesh is said by court papers filed Friday seeking his release to have served in Mosul and in Baghdad as an interpreter for the U.S. Army. \n\n   \n\u201cBetween March 20, 2003 and September 30, 2013, he was contracted by the U.S. government to work in a variety of positions that placed him in substantial risk of being targeted, attacked and killed by anti-American militias and insurgents,\u201d the papers say. \u201cMr. Darweesh was directly targeted twice for his association with the U.S. Armed Forces.\u201d \n\n    \nThank You! \n \nYou are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason \n    \nThe man who would later be detained at JFK Airport worked for the U.S. at Baghdad Airport between 2004 and 2005, and during that time Baghdad Police searched his house, saying they were looking for a terrorist. \n\n   \n\u201cThe Baghdad Police are widely known to be closely affiliated with anti-American militias,\u201d the papers say. \u201cShortly after this incident, two of Mr. Darweesh\u2019s colleagues were killed as soon as they arrived at work.\u201d \n\n   \nThe killing convinced Darweesh to move to Kirkuk. \n\n   \n\u201cIn the second instance, in July 2009, Mr. Darweesh was stopped at a market in Kirkuk where he was informed by a local shopkeeper that men were driving around in a BMW asking for him by name and the location of his house,\u201d the papers report.  \u201cThese men returned a second time the following week, and Mr. Darweesh had strong reasons to suspect that the men searching for him were terrorists.\u201d \n\n   \nDarweesh fled with his wife and three children to Erbil. \n\n   \n\u201cBased on these threats and his over ten years of service to the U.S. government, Mr. Darweesh applied for an Iraqi Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) status on or around October 1, 2014,\u201d the papers say, adding, \u201cCongress created the Iraqi and Afghan Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) programs to provide safety and refuge in the United States for Iraqis and Afghans who face or have faced serious threats on account of their faithful and valuable service to the United States.\u201d \n\n   \nMore than a year of paperwork and vetting ensued before he obtained the necessary certification that he had \u201cprovided faithful and valuable service to the United States\u201d and \u201chas experienced or is experiencing a serious threat.\u201d The visa was officially approved on January 26, 2015, but the process was not even halfway done. \n\n   \n\u201cIt took over two years for Mr. Darweesh\u2019s visa and visas for his family to be processed,\u201d the papers note. \u201cMr. Darweesh appeared for an in-person interview at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad on April 12, 2016 and went through administrative processing, including security background checks as well as medical exams.\u201d \n\n   \nOn January 20, 2017, Inauguration Day, the official approval was officially approved. He received the visa in Erbil on January 27, 2017. He immediately set off for America with his wife and three children, aged 20, 15 and 7. \n\n    \n Alex Brook Lynn  \n   \n\u201cBecause of the sensitive and dangerous nature of Mr. Darweesh\u2019s situation, the family immediately boarded a flight from Erbil to New York City, via Istanbul, and arrived in the United States on January 27, 2017, around 6:00 PM EST,\u201d the papers say. \n\n   \nThe family had tickets to fly on to Charlotte, North Carolina, but they were detained at JFK Airport by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers. Trump\u2019s executive order had gone into effect just 78 minutes before. \n\n   \n\u201cMr. Darweesh and his family waited to be processed by CBP for about an hour,\u201d the papers say. \u201cMr. Darweesh himself was moved into \u2018secondary screening.' The family waited for over an hour before a CBP officer and Mr. Darweesh emerged to return passports for every member of Mr. Darweesh\u2019s family except for Mr. Darweesh himself. Mr. Darweesh was then taken back into secondary screening.\u201d \n\n   \nDarweesh was handcuffed. He sat in a chair in a holding room while his family was allowed to pass under the WELCOME TO NEW YORK sign and continue on into the arrivals area. \n\n   \nWord spread and a team of lawyers who specialize in immigration and refugee work appeared at the terminal and sought his release. \n\n   \n\u201cWhen the attorneys asked \u2018Who is the person to talk to?\u2019 the CBP agents responded, \u201cMr. President. Call Mr. Trump,\u2019\u201d court papers report. \n\n   \nProtesters had begun to arrive when Darweesh was finally freed at midday Saturday. He will need more time in this country before he will be able to appreciate fully the ironies. He did discern one clear truth. \n\n   \n\u201cAmerica is freedom!\u201d he exulted. \u201cAmerica is freedom.\u201d \n\n   \nMeanwhile, the lawyers worked to free a second Iraqi who had been detained at the airport. Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi is 39. His wife, Duniyya Alshawi had worked for a time as an accountant with a U.S. contractor. \n\n   \n\u201cDue to the family\u2019s association with the U.S. military, insurgents thought that they were collaborators,\u201d court papers say. \u201cIn 2010, insurgents attempted to kidnap Ms. Alshawi\u2019s brother. A month later, an IED placed on Mr. Alshawi\u2019s sister-in-law\u2019s car detonated, killing her husband and severely injuring her and her daughter. \n\n   \nAlshawi and his wife also fled Baghdad for Erbil. She successfully applied for refugee status and settled in Houston, Texas with their son. The family then applied for and received a visa for Alshawi. \n\n   \n\u201cMr. Alshawi arrived in at John F. Kennedy airport in New York City on January 27, 2017 at approximately 8:22 PM EST,\u201d court papers say. \u201cUpon arrival at the gate, Mr. Alshawi was blocked on the aircraft by CBP.\u201d \n\n   \nThe CPB officers then escorted Alshawi off the plane and detained him.

When he's hurt he throws a lot more punches. He's got a lot of heart,\" Berchelt said. \"But I came here to win. I came here to show I have heart. I came here to be the champion.\" \n \nBerchelt, 25, improved to 31-1 with his 28th early stoppage and 10th consecutive victory while Vargas, 32, fell to 23-1 with two drawn. \n \n\"This is what I always wanted,\" Berchelt said. \"I'm young. I'm hungry. I wanted to be a world champion. Now I have the belt on my waist and it feels the best.\" \n \nJapan's Takashi Miura, who lost the title to Vargas 14 months ago, knocked out Mexico's Miguel Roman 53 seconds into the 12th round on the undercard at Indio, California, to become Berchelt's mandatory title challenger. \n \nBerchelt, fighting outside Mexico for only the second time, repeatedly connected with punishing left hooks in the second and third rounds. His hard rights to the head in the fourth again slowed Vargas, opening cuts over both eyes in the exchanges. \n \nGoing past the sixth round for the first time in his career, Berchelt kept up the intensity. Caiz and ringside doctor Paul Wallace checked Vargas in the ninth and 10th rounds and allowed him to continue. \n \nBlood began flowing freely from the gash over Vargas's swollen left eye in the ninth and by the 11th was more than the champion could overcome. \n \n\"The cut was a big problem. It wouldn't let me do what I wanted,\" Vargas said. \"I was never going to stop. I was always going to fight. I'm a warrior. I fight 'til the end. \n \n\"But it was just the blood. I couldn't see. I wasn't able to fight.\" \n \nMIURA\u2019S LATEST-ROUND KO \n \nMiura improved to 31-3 with two drawn by taking his 24th career knockout, his first knockout beyond the ninth round, while Roman fell to 56-12 with his 18-fight win streak snapped. \n \nMiura, 32, and Roman, 31, had fast-paced, hard-punching early rounds. Miura's left eye began swelling in the fourth round and both fighters landed punishing body blows. \n \nRoman connected with a punishing right to Miura's jaw in the sixth, setting up a flurry by the Mexican that weakened the former champion. \n \nThe Asian southpaw suffered a bloody lip but fired back in the seventh with renewed vigor, trading powerful punches. \n \nRoman suffered a cut over his left eye in the eighth on an accidental head-butt from Miura, who exchanged hard punches in the ninth and buckled the Mexican momentarily in the 10th. \n \nMiura knocked down Roman late in the 10th with a sledgehammer left hand to the body and dropped Roman again in the 11th with a flurry of body punches. \n \nEarly in the 12th round, Miura landed a left to the head that left Roman lying on the canvas and referee Tom Taylor counted him out.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: boxing news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Berchelt dethrones Vargas","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Southern Africa","countryCode":"ZA","country":"South Africa"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"SuperSport","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659065","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"161"},"name":"SuperSport","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Boxing","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.supersport.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://twitter.com/share"],"sequenceId":"695199616469","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:38:23Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:52:56Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://images.supersport.com/2017/1/Miguel-Berchelt-130312-Celebrates-G-80.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n\nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n\n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n\n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n\n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n\nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n\nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n\nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n\nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n\nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n\nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n\nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n\nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n\nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n\nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n\nReleased under special circumstances \n\nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n\nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n\n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n\nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n\nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n\nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n\nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n\n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n\n'The executive order is unlawful' \n\nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n\nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n\n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n\nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n\n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n\nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n\nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n\n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n\nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n\nLegality questioned \n\nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n\nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n\n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n\nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n\nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n\nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n\n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n\n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"DHS complies with judge to limit 'Muslim ban'","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"El Paso","zipCode":"80905","state":"Colorado","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Colorado Springs","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"KRDO.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169663107","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"18"},"name":"KRDO.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Politics","Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.krdo.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199616686","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:52:57Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The training curriculum was designed to help the farmers meet the common challenges they face in this part of Gedo. \n\nIn his 25 years in farming, Ibrahim suffered many frustrations. The maize never used to grow well, the tomatoes attracted worms, and the lemon trees turned black and did not produce fruit. \n\nExperts say the soil in this area has low levels of nutrients. There is also a high density of invasive shrubs (Prosopis juliflora) and other types of grass that hinder crop growth. Chemical fertilizers have to be bought from Mogadishu or Mandera in northeastern Kenya and cost $60 for a 25 kg bag. \n\nPeople in Warirley are agro-pastoralists so accessing manure from their animals is not a problem. But spreading the manure untreated only furthers the spread of weeds. \n\nIbrahim is a faithful practitioner of the methods he learned from the DRC training. He explained the process of preparing the manure he collects from his livestock. \n\n\u201cI put manure into sacks and put them inside a barrel half full of water, and cover the barrel so other particles do not get inside. For 20 days, I shake the barrel once a day. When the manure dissolves in the water so the water looks black, I remove the sacks, add an equal amount of water to the solution, and then apply the liquid in my field (...) I apply the manure easily to crops whilst I am ploughing and I apply it under every lemon tree.\u201d \nHe has stored his recent maize harvest to ensure his family has enough food to last through the current drought. The lemons were sold to companies in Mogadishu for $3,240. This allowed him to enroll three of his children in school. \n\nIbrahim says he does not worry about food any more, and is planning to increase his production even more in order to raise his nine member family\u2019s living standards. \n\nSince his agricultural production increased, he has bought 55 goats and cows. The animals feed on grass he planted in some parts of his field. He also bought an extra four hectares for $5,000 last June.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Agriculture news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Africa news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Somalia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"NO WORRIES ABOUT FOOD FOR SOMALI FARMERS TRAINED IN LIQUID MANURE PREPARATION","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Eastern Africa","countryCode":"SO","country":"Somalia"},"editorialRank":"5","name":"Hiiraan Online","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"566824059","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"73"},"name":"Hiiraan Online","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.hiiraan.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199626623","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:52:51Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

She has won 10 major titles since turning 30 and has made eight out of the last grand slam 10 finals. \n \nWilliams believes she is in the form of her life. \n \n\"I was thinking yesterday on the practice court, 'gosh I'm playing better than I have ever before I think',\" Williams said. \n \n\"I'm moving better, I've always been a fast mover but I stopped moving a bit in the middle of my career because I was like, I don't have to move so much. \n \n\"But I was like, 'man I'm hitting really well'. It feels good to be playing this well at the moment.\" \n \nBy her own high standards, 2016 represented a disappointing season for Williams. \n \nThe American only added a Wimbledon title to her tally and also surrendered the world number one spot to Angelique Kerber after a shock US Open defeat to Karolina Pliskova. \n \n\"Winning this one was very important,\" Williams' coach Patrick Mouratoglou said. \n \n\"I feel when you end the season with a loss, especially in a grand slam, you cannot feel the same way and cannot have a good feeling. \n \n\"She had confidence but not the same kind as when you win. That's why this one was very important for the rest of the season.\" \n \nWilliams has struggled at times with the weight of expectation, crumbling at the 2015 US Open when a calendar grand slam was in sight and then stumbling again there in September when on the brink of breaking Graf's record. \n \nShe has appeared far more relaxed in Melbourne, on and off court, with her new fiance Alexis Ohanian here supporting from her box throughout. \n \n\"I've been trying to live it for some time now, this tournament I was able to do it,\" Williams said. \n \n\"I was okay with not losing but I also knew I didn't have to win here to make my career. It settled with me this time. I don't know why I felt like that but I want to know because I want it again.\" \n \nSurpassing Graf's 22 major triumphs adds statistical weight to the now almost indisputable argument that Williams is the greatest female player of all time. \n \nShe could pass Court's mark at Wimbledon this summer, although 13 of the Australian's 24 successes came before the Open era, when grand slams were still not fully professional. \n \n\"Graf's record is more important because with all the respect for Margaret Court, it's another era,\" Mouratoglou said. \n \n\"The draws were like 16 players, they were not professionals. Of course the record is there and we definitely want to beat it but there is a professional era and the record was Steffi Graf. \n \n\"Serena was not motivated by 22, she was motivated by grand slams. That's her motivation. \n \n\"This won't change until one day she wakes up and is not motivated to win grand slams but for now she is, so that's enough. \n \n\"Is that day close? I don't think so. I am not in her head but I don't think so.\" \n \nWilliams did take some motivation from reclaiming her place at the top of the world rankings, which she will when the list refreshes on Monday. \n \nTo avoid adding any extra pressure, however, Mouratoglou told his charge at the start of the tournament that victory would not return her to number one. \n \n\"In the beginning of the tournament, I was like, 'if I win, will I be number one?'\" Williams said. \n \n\"Patrick said, 'no, no, no.' So I was like whatever. Then on the court when they were said, 'and number one', I was like, 'whoa, really'?\" \n \nWilliams later added: \"Kerber played unbelievable, she definitely deserved to have that position. I t didn't hurt or p*** me off, to me it just looked weird. I'd never felt like number two.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: tennis news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Serena Williams: I'm in the best form of my life after 23rd grand slam","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","county":"Durham","zipCode":"DL14","state":"England","countryCode":"GB","zipArea":"Wear Valley","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Wear Valley Advertiser","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"608095897","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Wear Valley Advertiser","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wearvalleyadvertiser.co.uk"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199634865","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:53:01Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 28 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Milwaukee","zipCode":"53201","state":"Wisconsin","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Milwaukee","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WISN Milwaukee","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169659888","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"504"},"name":"WISN Milwaukee","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wisn.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199635081","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:53:01Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

We did not get an opportunity to put Leicester under pressure. \n \n\"We didn't look after the ball in the contact area and Leicester did a brilliant job on us in that area. \n \n\"But in the last 20 minutes we showed what we can do when we get the breakdown right.

The Jefferson City station traces its start back to the family who began the News Tribune. \n \n\"Robert C. Goshorn, the father of longtime News Tribune Publisher Betty Weldon, is responsible for the station we know now,\" KWOS Chief Engineer Steve Morse said. \"There was no format. It was only on during the day. They signed on at 12:30 p.m. and went off at 5:30 p.m their first day on the air. They later went from 6 a.m. to sunset. The first license we found shows the Tribune as the owner. In their first year of operation, they lost $5,000. They were not selling lot of advertising, and back then, that was a lot of money. But they were able to survive.\" \n \nThe station stayed on until 10 p.m. starting in the late 1930s, and for many years, it was the only station on in Mid-Missouri until that hour. KWOS aired at 1310 KHz for a while on the AM dial, then went to 1340, and in 1941, it went to 1240. The station stayed there until 1999, when it went to its current home of 950, which is also simulcast now on 101.1 FM. \n \nThe station actually came on as a state-owned entity, and its call letters were WOS, which some said meant \"Watching Our State.\" \n \n\"The station was shut down for a time, and Mr. Goshorn decided the community needed a radio station,\" Morse said. \"Mr. Goshorn decided to have the call letters KWOS, which mean 'Keep Watching Our State.'\" \n \nSeveral well-known news people have worked at the station over the years. \n     \nWith a studio full of well-wishers, Warren Krech slides the knobs for the last time at the conclusion of his personal comments Friday morning, April 29, 2016. After 42 years behind the microphone on radio, the last 30 of those in Jefferson City, Krech broadcast for the last time on air. Several former on-air co-workers stopped by KWOS to say thank you for taking a chance on them and to wish him well in his retirement. Standing at left is John Marsh and in back is Hal Dulle. \n   \nWith a studio full of well-wishers, Warren Krech... \n \nPhoto by Julie Smith \n   \nDon Roberts, news director in the late 1960s until around 1980, had \"a big, unmistakable voice,\" current News Director John Marsh said. Roberts covered city politics as well as the state. \n \nTed Street was a longtime program director and was followed by Jack Renner, who was at the station in the 1960s and '70s. \n \n\"My first time on the air at KWOS was as a kid doing high school reports in 1972,\" Marsh said. \"The station then was located at the old bus station building that is now the News Tribune parking lot. I was shaking while I read, and Jack ran the control board.\" \n \nOther owners and general managers included William \"Buzzy\" Natsch, Johnny Muesseig and Bob Kolb. \n \nMorse said the newspaper created Capital Broadcasting in the 1940s and launched the second FM station in the state, 98.5 KWOS, in April 1948. It lasted about 10 years. \n \n\"KWOS played a huge role in getting what we now know as the St. Louis Cardinals radio network started,\" he said. \"The station was one of a four-station group that carried the Cards well before KMOX even thought about getting involved.\" \n \nThe station carried Cardinals games in Jefferson City from 1938-2006, when broadcasts were moved to KAT Country, 94.3 FM, run by KWOS's current owner, the Zimmer Radio Group . \n \nMarsh and Morse worked for the station when the studios were located next to the Missouri Bar on McCarty Street. The building is still standing and had been House Funeral Service before it was converted for use by the radio station. \n \n\"They still had a hand-cranked elevator that had been used to haul caskets in there,\" Marsh said. \"The record library was where the embalming area was.\" \n \n\"In the late '70s, I did an evening jock shift, and we carried the CBS Mystery Theater,\" Marsh continued. \"So one night I turned the lights out so the only lights on were on the control board. With this being an old funeral home, I'd been told you could see ghosts. This night, out of the corner of my eye, I saw something white go by. I peeked out of the studio and looked into the offices. Instead of a ghost, it was our sports guy, Bob Jackson, who had on a white dress shirt and was coming back in from a game. So that's the closest thing to a ghost story I have.\" \n \nMorse did morning shifts and recalled a memorable day when the phone company had work to do at the station. \n \n\"At the time, all audio came down through phone lines,\" he said. \"This morning, the audio cuts off, but the music stayed on. All of a sudden, we heard some cursing going over the air, and it was the engineer at our transmitter site, waiting on the phone company. So that went on the air, and there was no way we could cut it off. Some of the front office folks came running in, and I told them there we couldn't stop it. This went on for a few minutes, but it felt longer. Finally the phone company realized what was going on and made the switch. Our general manager was trying to get out to the transmitter to let our engineer know, but the switch happened while he was headed out there.\" \n \n\"As we look at the future, we're adapting with the changes brought about by social media,\" Marsh said. \"We're not just a radio station. We'll keep watching our state.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Radio industry news","group":"Media"},{"name":"Broadcasting industry news","group":"Media"}],"title":"Radio station marking 80th year","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Cole","zipCode":"65101","state":"Missouri","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Jefferson City","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Jefferson City News Tribune","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"174477660","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"461"},"name":"Jefferson City News Tribune","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.newstribune.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://kwos.com/","http://zimmercommunications.com/"],"sequenceId":"695199638653","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:53:03Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Arsenal made an approach for the player in the summer, but will try again at the end of the season. United are believed to be in pole position given their ability to pay higher wages, and his friendship with Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba . Griezmann would cost around £85 million. \nTweet \nPaper Round's view: Manchester United also had interest in Griezmann the season before last, so he has been a target for at least two years now. United have been mentioned as a destination for most of the season, and have the ability to spend money far easier than Arsenal do. While they also have Pogba, it might be that Champions League football is what makes the final decision on his next club. \n\nRead the full story \nKlopp on the ropes after Wolves defeat \nAfter a week that saw them lose 3-2 at home to Swansea , knocked out of the League Cup against Southampton and then the FA Cup with an embarrassing defeat to Wolves, the Star says that Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp is on the ropes, as he admits the defeat was his fault. There is now only the league to focus on, but their next match is against Chelsea . \nTweet \nPaper Round's view: The Anfield crowd - see Brendan Rodgers and Roy Hodgson - will turn on managers quicker than is generally believed. While Klopp still has Liverpool fans' support, their patience is not to be tested. Klopp urgently needs to fix out the mediocre squad and buy some competent defenders before the end of the transfer window, and get Sadio Mane back as quickly as possible.

He used his reach,\" Frampton said. \"I think he deserved it. I'm being honest. I think he deserved it, but it was a very good fight. No excuses.\" \n \nGARCIA KOS ZLATICANIN \n \nOn the same card, American Mikey Garcia won his third world title with a ruthless third-round knockout of World Boxing Council lightweight champion Dejan Zlaticanin of Montenegro. \n \nA right upper-cut followed by a monstrous overhand right from Garcia knocked Zlaticanin out cold at 2:21 of the third round. \n \nGarcia's in-ring celebrations gradually turned to expressions of concern as medical personnel worked for several minutes to revive Zlaticanin, who endured his first defeat in 23 fights. \n \n\"I'm glad my opponent is OK. We never wish that anything bad happens in the sport,\" said Garcia, a former featherweight and super featherweight titlist who improved to 36-0 with 30 knockouts. \n \nGarcia had used an effective jab to control the bout from the first round. \n \n\"I think it was a great performance,\" he said. \"I fought smart.

She obtained an immigrant visa in November on her son\u2019s petition. \n \nBahzad Honarjou, a 43-year-old network engineer, said he spoke twice to his mother by phone after her 9 a.m. arrival, but that they hadn\u2019t talked since courts stayed the executive order, meaning she should have been released. \n \nHundreds of protesters stood in the waiting area and chanted \u201cThis is what democracy looks like.\u201d \n \nImmigration agents were not being very communicative, Honarjou said. \n \n\u201cThey were like a machine when I talked to them today,\u201d he said. His mother only speaks a few words of English and a fellow passenger was translating for her from her native Farsi as no immigration agents spoke the language, he said. \n \nHassanpour was originally going to be deported on a Sunday flight, she informed her son the first time they spoke. \n \n\u201cShe was about to cry,\u201d he said. \u201cShe is not able to take (tolerate) a 20-hour flight back to Iran.\u201d \n \nHonarjou said he is a U.S. citizen, obtained entry in a lottery, and has been in the country for seven years. Why did he come? \n \n\u201cTo have a better life and to make more money,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, you know, for the freedom.\u201d \n \n___ \n \nSEATTLE \n \nAbout 1,000 protesters gathered at Seattle-Tacoma Airport, sitting down in the concourse with a large American flag reading \u201cWe are America.\u201d Aayah Khalaf, a Muslim American, was sitting at home watching the protest on television when she and her friend studying from Egypt decided to join the rally. It was her second time joining a protest. The first one was the Women\u2019s March. \u201cIt\u2019s not just against Muslims. It against environmental rights and human rights overall. I think everybody has to stand up against this,\u201d said Khalaf, 29. \n \n___ \n \nPORTLAND, OREGON \n \nA protest by several dozen people in and around Portland International Airport briefly disrupted light rail service at the airport. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports that the demonstrators carried signs and chanted \u201cSay it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here\u201d and \u201cNo ban no wall America is for us all.\u201d \n \n___ \n \nLOS ANGELES \n \nAbout 300 people expressed their displeasure with the ban at Los Angeles International Airport Saturday night. Protesters entered the airport\u2019s Tom Bradley International Terminal after holding a candlelight vigil. \n \nAvriel Epps held a candle and a large photo a drowned 3-year-old Syrian boy who washed up on a Turkish beach in 2015 and became a haunting symbol of the Syrian refugee crisis. \n \n___ \n \nSAN FRANCISCO \n \nHundreds of protesters blocked the street outside at San Francisco International Airport\u2019s international terminal to express their opposition to the barring of some people from Muslim-majority nations. \n \n___ \n \nSAN DIEGO \n \nAs motorists honked their support, demonstrators outside San Diego International Airport chanted \u201cNo hate, no fear, everyone is welcome here.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Airline industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Political unrest news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Protests erupt at airports following Trump travel ban","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Bartholomew","zipCode":"47203","state":"Indiana","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Columbus","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"1010 WCSI","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"541446766","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3"},"name":"1010 WCSI","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://1010wcsi.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199644944","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:53:07Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport on Friday night and was detained for about five hours.\n\nTrump's order signed on Friday upended the travel plans of people without U.S. citizenship who were arriving in the United States from those seven countries, including Syria, Iran and Sudan, causing confusion and sparking protests at airports as immigrants and refugees were stranded.\n\nElamin said she had been in Sudan for academic research and boarded a plane on Friday morning. After presenting her U.S. green card, a designation of legal permanent residence, at JFK, she said she was questioned, patted down and handcuffed.\n\n\"It was an uncomfortable pat down, they touched my breast area and my groin area,\" Elamin said in a phone interview. \"Then I got handcuffed and I just started crying.\"\n\nElamin said the handcuffs were soon removed and it appeared authorities were using them to escort people between areas of the airport. \n\nElamin was released, but she worried about leaving the country again and about her parents in Sudan, whom she hoped one day to help immigrate to America. \n\n\"It scares me that I'm not able to see them if I want to,\" said Elamin, who lives in New Jersey. \n\nTrump's executive order means legal permanent residents who have passports from the seven countries have to be cleared back into the United States on a case-by-case basis, a senior U.S. administration official told reporters.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security, which overseas entry at airports, in a statement later said it will \"treat all of those we encounter humanely and with professionalism.\" \n\nThe executive order also upended the plans of some people planning to leave the United States. \n\nShirana Navabha, 57, a U.S. citizen originally from Iran, said she was scheduled to fly to Iran on Sunday, but will not go after Tehran said it would stop U.S. citizens entering the country in retaliation to Trump's action.\n\n\"I told everybody that I'm coming, everyone was so excited and now I'm not going, it's just frustrating,\" Navabha, who lives in Dallas, said by phone. \n\n(Reporting by Alex Dobuzinskis in Los Angeles; Editing by Stephen Coates)","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sudan news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Africa news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"North Africa news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Education news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"'I got handcuffed and just started crying' - Sudanese student describes U.S. detention","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Southern Africa","countryCode":"ZA","country":"South Africa"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Sharenet","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169658161","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"Sharenet","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Business"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.sharenet.co.za"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199645954","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:53:10Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

We were hoping there would be a lot of people tonight and there was.\u201d \n \nWhen asked if there was any kind of rivalry between St. Pat\u2019s and Benicia (12-8) even though the two teams play in different leagues, Henderson went the opposite direction. \n \n\u201cWhat I see in this game is just another win added to our total for the season,\u201d Henderson said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I liked the most about it tonight.\u201d \n \nWhile the Bruins added another victory, Benicia had a difficult 24 hours in Vallejo, as the Panthers had lost a 17-point lead on Friday night at Vallejo High. Despite the loss, however, Benicia hung strong early in Saturday\u2019s contest as it trailed by only four points at 18-14 after the first quarter. \n \nIn the second quarter, however, St. Pat\u2019s started to break away. \n \nAlready up 26-21, the Bruins went on a 9-2 run to build the lead to 35-23. The run was sparked by a dunk from Henderson, a layup from BJ Standley and a layup by Henderson off an inbounds pass under the hoop. Henderson finished the game with 20 points and nine rebounds, while Standley had 17 points and six assists. \n \nSt. Pat\u2019s kept the foot on the gas pedal in the third quarter, jumping out to a 10-2 run to open the second half thanks to three layups in a row from Jordan Tolliver, one of them coming off a nice pass from Marquel Johnson, who finished with 12 points and five assists. \n \nThe lead was built up to 51-33 midway through the third quarter after Romeo Mays scored off a nice pass from Johnson and Standley scored following a steal of his own near midcourt. Mays, who scored nine points, was also a constant force in the paint with eight rebounds. \n \n\u201cHe was active tonight,\u201d St. Pat\u2019s head coach Derek Walker said about Mays. \u201cHe helped us a lot tonight with that.\u201d \n \nBenicia wouldn\u2019t quit, however, and made a last run in the fourth quarter to cut the lead thanks to a 10-2 run sparked by five points from Taj Toney and five more from Steve Urias. Urias\u2019 three-point play with 2:39 left in regulation made it 69-60. Urias led the Panthers with 14 points on the night, eight of them coming in the second half. Toney, Trey Pugh and Jon Lee all added 11 points. \n \n \nA 3-pointer from Pugh made it 71-63 with under two minutes to play, but it\u2019s as close as the Panthers would get, as they could not contain Henderson in the final quarter.

Where Trump has something to prove \u2013 be it the size of his fortune or the size of his crowds \u2013 Slim figures the less we know about him, his wealth, and his business dealings, the better. \n \nSlim complimented Trump as a formidable negotiator in his remarks Friday, but he also said Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d campaign will not succeed if Trump hopes to return \u201cto a glorious past of American industry that made them the world leader in the 20th century.\u201d \n  \nSlim, who thumbed through a well-worn copy of Trump\u2019s book  Great Again  during his press conference, could serve as a model for San Antonio\u2019s elected officeholders here and in Washington, as well as local business leaders. Few have spoken out since Trump signed executive orders to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, restrict immigration, send thousands more Border Patrol officers into action, and renegotiate or tear up the North American Free Trade Agreement. \n \nEven fewer have spoken publicly since Trump officials declared their intentions to impose a 20% import tax on all goods flowing from Mexico into the United States, a punitive move that could send Mexico\u2019s economy into recession, and harm the Texas economy with a sudden shrinkage in cross-border trade. \n \nThe Slim-Trump relationship has been a melodrama, but the way Slim has worked it offers some insight into how others might try to influence the course of events. \n \nSlim, a major player in the telecom and media world,  canceled a television deal with Trump after the then-presidential candidate\u2019s incendiary remarks about Mexican immigrants in June 2015. In 2016, Trump fired back, blaming Slim, a major shareholder in the New York Times , for the disclosure of damaging audiotapes that captured Trump boasting of his ability to sexually exploit young women. \n \nYet the two somehow ended up dining together at Mar-a-Lago , the president\u2019s Palm Beach, Fla. estate, in December after Trump defeated Hillary Clinton. The invitation demonstrated Slim\u2019s ability to find a connection with the President-elect, who afterwards described the evening as \u201ca lovely dinner with a wonderful man.\u201d \n \nFast forward to Friday and Slim\u2019s press conference: It seemingly was staged so Mexico\u2019s richest man could defend Mexican honor and President Enrique Peña Nieto, gently criticize Trump, and perhaps, lay the groundwork for some backroom diplomacy that could preserve important trade relations and cool populist tempers north of the border. \n \nTrump, said to be worth $4 billion or more, undoubtedly respects Slim and his fortune which is estimated to exceed $70 billion. San Antonio leaders can\u2019t match Slim\u2019s wealth, but they can draw two lessons from the Trump-Slim experience and other such relationships with Trump that veer from public confrontation to finding private common ground. \n \nOne lesson is that Trump rarely means exactly what he says. Reporters and others who take his statements literally miss what so many Trump supporters understand: it\u2019s the sentiment underlying his words that offers a more accurate barometer of his feelings and intentions. Two, Trump, like other individuals with bullying tendencies, respects strength in his adversaries. \n \nThat\u2019s why staying silent in the face of ill-conceived notions like slapping a 20% import tax on all goods crossing the border is a really bad strategy. A response that relies on data, forcefully presented, to refute or at least blunt Trump administration actions likely will prove more effective. \n \nWalking away from NAFTA would spell disaster for Mexico and it would inflict real damage on cities like San Antonio. Patiently renegotiating the treaty and bringing it into a new century could prove mutually beneficial and still give Trump the space to say he fulfilled his campaign promise. \n \nNo one really expects to return to a world where all consumer goods are \u201cMade in the USA\u201d anymore than anyone really believes Trump will resurrect the coal country economy. \n \nTrump\u2019s anti-Mexico rhetoric has been mostly words with few facts. San Antonio can play a vital role in bringing balance and decency to the national conversation  by injecting some real numbers on the U.S.-Mexico relation. \n \nNumbers don\u2019t tell the deeper story about our human connections to Mexico, but that can wait for later. What matters more now is preventing time-proven economic blunders that have been the hallmark of populists seeking strength at home by targeting outsiders. \n \nThe U.S.-Mexico relationship is a complex one and always will be, but it also is a mutually beneficial one that should be preserved and protected. That doesn\u2019t make for an explosive tweet or sensational headline, but it happens to be factual. No one knows it more than those who live and lead in San Antonio. \n  \nConsul General: San Antonio Knows the Value of the U.S.-Mexico Relationship","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Robert Rivard"},"topics":[{"name":"San Antonio news","group":"US regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Mexico news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Taking Our Cue from Carlos Slim: 'The Best Wall is Investment'","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Bexar","zipCode":"78205","state":"Texas","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"San Antonio","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Rivard Report","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"567584591","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"12"},"name":"Rivard Report","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://therivardreport.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://fortune.com/2015/06/30/carlos-slim-donald-trump/","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-dines-with-carlos-slim-as-relations-warm-with-mexican-leaders/2016/12/19/652ccf7c-c60f-11e6-bf4b-2c064d32a4bf_story.html?utm_term=.d2df1c0055e5"],"sequenceId":"695199657674","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:53:17Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

November's total of $718 million was up by $123 million compared with a year earlier.\n\nThe results reversed a mid-year slump in the state's stamp duty receipts.\n\nTurnover was very strong in the final quarter of the year. Stamp duty was paid on 21,239 residential transfers across NSW in December, which was 31 per cent higher than in July.\n\nThe average stamp duty received per transaction in December was $34,385 \u2013 around $2100 more than the corresponding month a year earlier.\n\nThe strong stamp duty figures suggest Sydney's property market defied predictions of a slow-down and picked up pace in late 2016.\n\nFigures released by the Domain Group last Tuesday showed Sydney's median house price jumped 4.7 per cent in last three months of the year to reach $1.124 million. The city's median unit prices rose nearly 3 per cent in the quarter to $711,256.\n\nDomain's measure of Sydney's median house price has risen by 69 per cent \u2013 or $450,000 \u2013 in the past four years.\n\nWhile the end-of-year surge in stamp duty will bolster the state's already healthy bottom line, the figures also underscore how difficult it will be for the new Premier, Gladys Berejiklian, to improve housing affordability.\n\nAt her first press conference as Premier last week Ms Berejiklian vowed to address the housing affordability crisis, declaring it \"the biggest issue people have across the state\".\n\nShe said specific policies to deal with this challenge would be outlined \"in the near future\".\n\nStamp duty revenue will get a further boost in coming months as a new surcharge on the stamp duty paid by foreign investors comes into effect. The surcharge was introduced in the June 2016 state budget but revenue from the new measure is not expected until early this year.\n\nSydney's four-year housing boom has helped deliver the state government a massive increase in the transfer duty levies on the transfer of property and other assets.\n\nIn 2011-12, just before the boom began, the government received $3.8 billion in transfer duty but that had swelled to nearly $9 billion by 2015-16.\n\nResidential stamp duty alone accounted for about 9 per cent of the state government's revenue last financial year.\n\nThe half-yearly review of the NSW budget, released last month, lifted the forecast for the state's budget surplus for this financial year by about $300 million to $4 billion.\n\nThe story Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Matt Wade"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2586","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Boorowa","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Boorowa News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"348368351","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2"},"name":"Boorowa News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.boorowanewsonline.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199660174","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:37Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:53:19Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/e3c18faa-fe37-48b4-bad2-520457875b09.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Shortly thereafter, he was drafted into the Army. After serving in the 82nd Airborne Division as a paratrooper, he went on to build a successful career in construction, starting his own business, Headley Construction, and settling his family in Newnan.  \n \nAt the age of 62, he retired from running Headley Construction, but continued as a real estate investor. Along the way, he got his private pilot\u2019s license and hiked the Appalachian Trail.  \n \nBy any criteria, Headley was extremely successful in life, despite getting kicked out of college. He didn\u2019t need a degree.  \n \nBut Headley decided he still wanted one, and a few years ago, he enrolled in the University of West Georgia. He\u2019s set to graduate in May, two weeks before his 82nd birthday.  \n \n\u201cI just hope I pass. It\u2019s tough for an 81-year-old guy to do all this,\u201d he said this week from Headley Construction\u2019s downtown Newnan office, located in an old cottonseed-oil plant. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me going to get any more degrees.\u201d \n \nFor Headley, and any other Georgia resident 65 and older, college tuition is free at any state school. Students are still responsible for their books and fees. \n \nWhen he started in 2014, the UWG newspaper did an article on him.  \n\u201cTheir purpose was to encourage older people to go back to school,\u201d Headley said.  \nA major goal of the university is attracting adults who have had some college to return to complete their degree. Administrators predict a large share of the students at the Newnan campus will be returning adults. \nHeadley isn\u2019t proud that he flunked out of Auburn, but he\u2019s not ashamed of it, either. \n \n \u201cI imagine a lot of other people flunked out, too,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been pretty well blessed, even so.\u201d \n \n\u201cI couldn\u2019t have done any better.\u201d \n \nBut every now and then, he\u2019d think about that degree he never got.  \n \nOne day several years ago he was sitting at home watching the news.  \n\u201cI said I\u2019m sitting here on my dead butt. I ought to get off of it and go get that degree.\u201d \n \nThat thought popped into his head several times.  \n\u201cI had failed at not getting a degree, just a degree on the wall.\u201d  \n \nWhen he gets it, Headley said he\u2019s not even going to hang it up in his office.  \n \n\u201cI just want the degree for me. I\u2019m not trying to show off. Not that it\u2019s anything to show off about.\u201d \n \nOnce the decision was made, he contacted Cathy Wright at the university\u2019s Newnan center.  \n \nHeadley is a history buff, so he initially thought of majoring in history. But when he found out a degree was offered in business real estate, he decided to go for that.  \n \n\u201cI\u2019ve got a lot of real estate,\u201d he said. \u201cI can study history any time.\u201d \n \nWhen he signed up, he thought he\u2019d get a some credit for running a business and owning and development real estate projects and maybe for some of his time in the Army. Nope.  \n \n\u201cThat didn\u2019t make a bit of difference to them,\u201d Headley said.  \nHe was able to transfer about 30 hours from Auburn.  \n \nHeadley has taken a mix of classes at the campus and online.  \n \nHe\u2019s been impressed with the school, and particularly with his classmates.  \n \n\u201cThey are the nicest, smartest young people that I\u2019ve ever known. A lot smarter and a lot more considerate than we were when I was that age,\u201d he said.  \nHe assessed the students as more focused and more agile.  \n \n\u201cI feel that the world is in good hands with our youth being bright, assertive, honest and hardworking. I feel better about our future,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re good people, and I feel good about our young people, about the millennials. \n \n\u201cI\u2019m an old fellow up there with all these kids. They have accepted me just as I am, just as a grandfather.\u201d \n \nWhen there\u2019s a group project, he and his classmates will often meet at his office, taking advantage of the office equipment.  \n \nThough he\u2019s got years of experience, Headley is learning a lot.  \n \n\u201cI\u2019m a better speller. I can comprehend more. My vocabulary has improved. My speech has improved. My overall knowledge has just really improved,\u201d he said. \u201cI can tell, and my wife, Anita, can tell, too.  \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s not what I\u2019ve done so much as how far I\u2019ve come,\u201d Headley said. \u201cAlso, this is the first time in my life that I\u2019ve ever been a good student.\u201d \n \nHis favorite thing about being a college student is learning and studying. The hardest part is dealing with the computer and online classes.  \n \nHeadley\u2019s used computers before, but he\u2019s never gotten into them. He\u2019s just used them to do what he needs to do. He\u2019s also figuring out complicated finance calculators. When he first went to college, they used slide rules. He likes the calculator better.  \n \nHeadley has a secret weapon, his secretary Alice Meyers. She helps him with the computer, prints out information for the calculator, puts together his notebooks and orders his books.  \n \n\u201cHaving a secretary is mighty handy going through school,\u201d Headley said with a smile.  \n \nHe asked one of his instructors, Susan Smith, if he could bring his secretary to her astronomy class.  \n\u201cI said, you realize I\u2019ve had a secretary for the last 60 years. She said no.\u201d \n \nHe was just teasing. Maybe. . . .  \n \nSmith, who taught astronomy at UWG\u2019s Newnan Center after retiring from Coweta County Schools, said she was surprised when she saw Headley on her class list.  \n\u201cHe talked with me about why he was back in school at this stage in his life. After a few classes, I saw that he meant business. He was committed to succeeding. He was not a science major but he was one of the best students in the class,\u201d Smith said.  \n \nHeadley was a model student, always early to class, with homework always correct and turned in on time, she said. \n \n\u201cAs time went by, I grew to have great admiration for his stick-to-itiveness.\u201d \n \nHeadley was asked what advice he\u2019d give to others who may have always wanted to go to, or finish, college, and are now over 65 and eligible for free tuition. Or others who may have always wanted to do something or learn something.  \n \n\u201cIf you\u2019ve done all you can \u2026 sit back and relax and die. If you\u2019re not satisfied, if you can do more, do it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there isn\u2019t anybody that ought to be satisfied. If you\u2019re satisfied with yourself, you need to rethink your self.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Real estate news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Education news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Headley returning to college, graduating, 60 years later","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Coweta","zipCode":"30263","state":"Georgia","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Newnan","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"The Times-Herald","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"192729622","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"349"},"name":"The Times-Herald","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.times-herald.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199667326","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:53:26Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Campbell was third with 113 points with Wheeler finishing in fourth place.

It\u2019s something we can look at as an alternative location.\u201d \n \nA recent traffic study revealed that the majority of drivers obey the posted 35 mph speed limit through downtown Newnan. \n \n\u201cThe general perception is that traffic is too fast through downtown from a pedestrian perspective,\u201d Phillips said. \n \nResults matched an earlier study, according to Public Works Director Michael Klahr. \n \n\u201cWe\u2019ve done two internal studies and determined 35 is an appropriate speed limit through there,\u201d he said. \n \nSmith disagreed. \n \n\u201cIt seems a lot faster when it\u2019s three feet from you,\u201d he said. \n \nIt\u2019s an ongoing issue that needs to be settled, Phillips said. \n \n\u201cWe either need to make something happen or live with this,\u201d he said. \n \nPeek said there\u2019s not much the GDOT can do when state routes run through downtown areas. \n \n\u201cWe\u2019re held to keeping the speed limit to the 85th percentile,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t just arbitrarily drop the speed limit.\u201d \n \nNo action was taken during the meeting. Only three members of the DDA board were present.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Preset signals, countdown clocks part of downtown traffic discussion","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Coweta","zipCode":"30263","state":"Georgia","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Newnan","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"The Times-Herald","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"192729622","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"349"},"name":"The Times-Herald","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.times-herald.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199668972","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:53:24Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It\u2019s so difficult to get into the United States.\u201d \n \nTheir journey from Pretoria, South Africa, to Newnan began in 2004 when Albertsons, a regional grocery store in Florida, began recruiting pharmacists to come to America. The family had spent the previous decade running its own pharmacy in South Africa. \n \nComing to America was something entirely new for the family that had no idea what awaited them. \n \n\u201cYou see America on the television and the movies, but you never really know what it\u2019s all about until you come,\u201d Jan Smit said. \u201cBut the people down here in the South are so warm and friendly \u2013 they welcomed us from the moment we arrived, and it really made it easy for us to get established.\u201d \n \nJan Smit eventually went to work for Rite Aid while Suzette worked for Jet Logistics in Atlanta. In 2008, their youngest son joined the Army and was deployed to Iraq for several tours before returning home. \n \nIn 2011, he sponsored his parents for a green card, and two years later, the family opened Health Mart Pharmacy on Baker Road. \n \nLocated directly across the street from the Health Mart is a CVS Pharmacy. This wasn\u2019t an oversight, but intentional, according to Jan Smit. \n \n\u201cWhen I was an apprentice in South Africa, a pharmacist once told me to open your store across the street from a very busy pharmacy,\u201d Jan Smit recalled. \u201cYou\u2019ll ultimately get not only the runoff, but also those who don\u2019t really care for that style of operation.\u201d \n \nSuzette Smit agreed, citing there are two different kinds of pharmacies \u2013 the big box, express, drive-thru kind and the smaller, family operated kind where customers become friends. \n \n\u201cWe only get the nice people in here,\u201d Suzette Smit joked. \u201cWhen it\u2019s a family-run business, it inevitably becomes an extension of your home, and that\u2019s how you interact with every person who comes through your door.\u201d \n \nJodi Morril is a regular customer who attests to the Smit family philosophy when it comes to business. \n \n\u201cThey take a simple visit to the pharmacy and turn it into a neighborly visit,\u201d she said. \u201cIn a world where big businesses rush you through the checkout line, this wonderful couple and especially, Miss Suzette, engage you in conversation, make lengthy calls to the insurance provider if there are any problems, and make you feel as if you\u2019ve gone to a neighbor's home for a visit.\u201d \n \nRunning the pharmacy is a full-time operation, but when the Smit family gets home, they spend their time connecting with family from across the globe. While their youngest son is a registered nurse at Tanner Hospital in Carrollton, their other two children are in New Zealand and South Africa. \n \nTheir Sundays are spent at church and then on Skype where they visit with their two grandchildren. Suzette Smit is the author of two novels and joined the Coweta Writers Group where she has immersed herself in the local writing scene. \n \n\u201cBecoming a citizen is a tremendous honor,\u201d Jan Smit said. \u201cWe\u2019re extremely proud to have achieved this accomplishment and to call Newnan home.\u201d \n \n**** \n \nClay Neely: clay@newnan.com, @clayneely","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"South Africa news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Smit family celebrates new citizenship","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Coweta","zipCode":"30263","state":"Georgia","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Newnan","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"The Times-Herald","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"192729622","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"349"},"name":"The Times-Herald","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.times-herald.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199669688","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:53:25Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Georgia has a strict three-tier system that separates producers, wholesalers and retailers.  \n \nUnder the bill, Georgia\u2019s small breweries could offer direct sales by the glass on premises, and even sell up to a case \u2013 or case equivalent \u2013 worth of beer \u201cto go\u201d to individuals. Breweries would be limited to direct-selling 3,000 barrels of beer per year. \n \nBreweries in the state, including Newnan\u2019s Abide Brewing, are hoping that the bill will pass. \n \nRight now, Abide doesn\u2019t bottle its beer, but the brewery is in the midst of a major expansion. \u201cIf the bill goes through, we will be pushing pretty hard to get into a package form,\u201d said Evan Scanlan, one of the brewery\u2019s three owners.  \n \nUnder the current scenario, breweries can sell tours \u2013 and give away servings of beer. With a standard tour, visitors get a souvenir glass and 36 ounces of beer, divided into six, six-ounce pours. State law allows tour packages to also include some to-go beer, in a sealed \u201cgrowler\u201d bottle, but Abide doesn\u2019t offer that.  \n \nAccording to co-owner Philip Leonard, the biggest advantage of the bill passing would be a greater potential for sales. It would allow Abide Brewery to sell directly to consumers, and would lift the mandate for all events to follow the pattern of the standard tour.  \n \n\u201cRight now, we sell something, then the distributor sells it, then the retailer,\u201d Leonard explained. \u201cThe passing of the law may allow us to recapture some of the profit.\u201d This would, in turn, allow Abide to expand the business.  \n \nLeonard added that the owners may even be able to host events at the brewery in which they could sell directly to the customers. Birthday parties, corporate retreats or meetings could be hosted at the brewery without the current restrictions.  \n \nThe brewery has 13 beers on tap, Scanlan said. There are five beers currently on the market and available in local restaurants. The other eight spots are filled by various new brews. \u201cWe do a bunch of test batching, to see what the public likes. They kind of have input of what might be coming out next or what people are liking the most.\u201d  \n \nAbide may brew just one barrel of a test brew, and never make it again. \n \nThe bill was introduced the day before \u201cGeorgia Beer Day,\u201d which was Saturday. Breweries all over the state, including Abide, held events and are working to advocate for passage of SB 85.  \n \nIn 2015, the \u201cBeer Jobs Bill\u201d originally allowed direct sales, but by the time it passed, it was considerably pared down. In the summer and fall of 2016, representatives from breweries and wholesalers met to work out a compromise, according to Travis Peterman of the Georgia Craft Brewers Guild.  \n \nSB 85 was introduced by Sen. Rick Jeffares, R-McDonough, chairman of the Senate Regulated Industries and Utilities Committee. \n \n\u201cWith suggestions championed by both brewers and wholesalers, Lt. Governor Casey Cagle, Speaker of the House David Ralston, R-Blue Ridge, House Regulated Industries Committee Chairman Howard Maxwell, R-Dallas, and Senator Jeffares have provided guidance to create this legislation. Their commitment to supporting the small businesses of Georgia shines through in SB 85,\u201d said Nancy Palmer, Executive Director of the Georgia Craft Brewers Guild. Palmer said the business leaders of Georgia Beer Wholesalers Association were also crucial in the process.  \n \nBeing able to have direct sales will make breweries more of an attraction or destination, and bring in tourism, Scanlan said. That\u2019s what\u2019s happening in North Carolina and other states. Scanlan said that breweries in North Carolina have seen tremendous growth. ","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Beverages industry news","group":"Industry"}],"title":"New bill may allow some direct beer sales from breweries","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Coweta","zipCode":"30263","state":"Georgia","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Newnan","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"The Times-Herald","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"192729622","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"349"},"name":"The Times-Herald","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.times-herald.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199669982","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:53:25Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Under the proposed new law, a person is incapable of agreeing to sex if they are asleep, unconscious or unlawfully detained; if they can't communicate owing to a physical disability; or if only a third person gives permission on their behalf. In recent days the Government has announced that it will legislate on sexual consent. Under the proposed new law, a person is incapable of agreeing to sex if they are asleep, unconscious or unlawfully detained; if they can't communicate owing to a physical disability; or if only a third person gives permission on their behalf. But the next circumstance - that a person is unable to consent to sex if they are intoxicated - should give pause for thought.\n\nFirst, let's be clear: rape is abhorrent and perpetrators should be dealt with using the full force of the law. But the recent rise of new-wave radical feminism - on university campuses and social media - is troubling, in particular, when it comes to sexual consent.\n\nMany within this movement insist that, when having sex, 'no means no' and 'yes means yes' and two civilised people would never stray outside those bounds. Originally created by UK police forces but largely circulated by the modern-day feminist movement, it explains how asking for sex should be treated in the exact same way as asking someone if they would like a cuppa. If you ask a person: \"Do you want a cup of tea?\" and they say \"Yes please, I would LOVE it\" then you know they want tea. \n\nBut if they say: \"No thank you\" then don't make them tea. At all. In the real world, there is rarely a moment where one person asks: \"Do you want to have sex?\" and the other responds with a definitive \"yes\". \n\nHow many people reading this article have long relied on non-verbal cues during sexual encounters? A smile, a certain look, time spent kissing with hands slowly moving lower, is usually enough to let intimacy unfold naturally. A woman saying: \"Yes! I want to have sex with you\" - especially on the first night - isn't part of the age-old art of seduction.\n\nAnd, whether we like it or not, we live in a world where women don't like to appear as though they pursue sex. They want to be desired by men, to feel they are being slowly seduced. Don't agree? Then ask yourself why more women don't carry condoms. For further evidence of female desire, just look at extreme examples of men leading the way in romantic literature. It is swamped with politically incorrect sexual fantasies of a woman being forcefully 'taken'.\n\nEverywhere from Ayn Rand's Fountainhead - when the macho architect Howard Roark first takes his love interest, the author describes how \"She fought like an animal but she made no sound... He had thrown her down on the bed... his hands moving all over her body... It could be the act of a lover or the act of a soldier violating an enemy woman\" (she promptly falls madly in love with him) - to Tom Wolfe's A Man in Full where a woman describes her very first night with her husband of 30 years. \n\nShe explains: \"Charlie practically raped her... [yet] she had a visceral memory of the most intense ecstasy of her life. It was so taboo even to intimate that you could be aroused by male physical power that she never said a word about it to anyone.\" Even modern-day movies such as Fifty Shades of Grey are awash with fantasies of just that: grey sexual encounters. There's a reason the sequel will be packed out with giggling women when it opens in theatres next month, just in time for St Valentine's Day.\n\nAlthough I am not saying women would ever want their 'forced' fantasies to happen in real life - unless it is a man they feel safe with and are sexually attracted to - what I am saying is that it points to women's complex underlying attitudes towards sex.\n\nWomen want to feel they can enjoy sex often without feeling they are leading the way. In real life, they can have a breathless or coy approach when agreeing to sex. It is rarely: \"Yes, let's do it.\" So try being a man initiating sex in that context. And that's even before we add alcohol into the mix. Then it becomes a minefield.\n\nSex is a delicate enough area that needs your full attention - especially the first time - to stop miscommunication and to ensure everyone is fully aware and happy with what is happening. Alcohol dramatically hinders this process.\n\nThis is even more pertinent when you consider how we are among the world's biggest drinkers and our dating scene largely revolves around alcohol. It used to be the case that men drank twice to 12 times the amount of the average woman but - partly as a result of the feminist movement - women now drink just as much as men. The Ladette culture that has prevailed since the 1990s has given rise to 'keeping up with the boys' and women are putting their safety at risk.\n\nAs a progressive society, men's binge drinking should have been tackled rather than allowing women to play 'catch up' and call it 'equality'.\n\nThese days we are not even allowed to challenge the rise of the female drinking culture for fear of being labelled - at best sexist - or, worse still, a rape apologist. So instead we change the law - in a way that protects women and puts the onus on men. In light of this law and our failure to tackle the issue of our binge drinking culture, women can now drink as much as they want, while men are expected to stay largely sober and on guard for fear they misread sexual signals. Is that realistic or even fair? \n\nWhat happens if a woman initially seems to be a willing participant in a sexual encounter but can't remember it the following day? But what if the guy is drunk too and also has vague, patchy memories of the night before she regrets it and cries foul?\n\nAs part of a radio documentary on sexual consent for my final year thesis I've sat with men who have experienced this kind of situation. They were shaken, confused and ashen-faced to think that someone could even consider them a rapist following a blurry encounter. \n\nThe idea that 'rape is rape' fails to take into account that physical force is very different to two people who misunderstand a situation - especially when intoxicated. Just don't be surprised if a case comes to court in the coming years and we are all forced to take a long hard look at sexual consent -in all its shades of grey.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Niamh HoranTwitterEmail"},"topics":[{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Niamh Horan: Count the shades of grey between seduction and violation","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"IE","country":"Ireland"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"Irish Independent","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169660181","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"290"},"name":"Irish Independent","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Miscellaneous"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://independent.ie"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.carsireland.ie/","http://www.carsireland.ie/index.php","http://www.carsireland.ie/car-dealers/","http://www.irishjobs.ie/?cid=Partner_INM_JobSearchBoxUrl","http://www.themeetingpoint.ie/?utm_source=independent&utm_campaign=navbar&utm_term=unknown","http://www.themeetingpoint.ie/mature-dating/?utm_source=independent&utm_campaign=navbar&utm_term=unknown","http://www.themeetingpoint.ie/gay-dating/?utm_source=independent&utm_campaign=navbar&utm_term=unknown","http://www.inotices.ie/","http://www.inotices.ie/death-notices","https://www.fitlive.ie/","https://www.fitlive.ie/events/","https://www.fitlive.ie/training/","https://www.hotelscombined.ie/?a_aid=143290&label=Hotels-tab","https://www.clickandgo.com/special-offers?utm_source=HolidayDeals&utm_medium=Content&utm_term=HolidayDeals&utm_content=HolidayDeals&utm_campaign=HolidayDeals%20Link","https://www.facebook.com/IndoStyle.ie","https://twitter.com/Indo_Style_","https://twitter.com/@niamhhoran","http://livefyre.com/","http://livefyre.com/?ref_noscript","https://www.facebook.com/IndoStyle.ie/?fref=ts","http://www.farmireland.ie/","http://www.inm.ie/contact/","http://www.inm.ie/"],"sequenceId":"695199670840","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T02:30:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:53:26Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://cdn-03.independent.ie/incoming/article30935167.ece/df193/AUTOCROP/w620h342/Niamh%20Horan.jpg"},{"url":"http://www.independent.ie/incoming/article30935167.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/Niamh%20Horan.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

But it\u2019s not like I missed shots that I wasn\u2019t going for. I went for those shots. It\u2019s a matter of inches. \n \n\u201cSome errors here or there can mean the difference between a break of serve or a hold.\u201d \n \nBut Serena, who came into the match with a 20-0 record after winning the first set in Grand Slam finals, proved too strong in the end, breaking serve just once in the seventh game to serve out the record-breaking victory, hitting a total of 27 winners to just 23 unforced. \n \nSerena improved her overall head-to-head against Venus to 17-11, and an impressive 7-2 in Grand Slam finals \u2013 the only two losses to big sister coming at the 2001 US Open and 2008 Wimbledon Championships, which was, incidentally, the last time the Williams sisters and Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal all met in the same major final. \n \nThe win was Serena\u2019s 316th at Grand Slam tournaments, improving on her already-record total, and returns her to No.1 in the world, usurping Angelique Kerber. \n \nAs for Venus, the result is still her best at a major tournament in seven years, and brings her back to within 200 points of returning to the top 10. \n \nIn the meantime, she was more than happy to give kudos to her younger sister after her historic achievement. \n \n\u201c[23], it\u2019s a great number,\u201d Venus said. \u201cI know she would like to have a little more. Who wouldn\u2019t? It was a great moment. I\u2019m very happy that she\u2019s been able to, you know, get to No.23 because there\u2019s 22 ahead of that that she also earned, and she earned it. \n \n\u201cIt was great to have an opportunity to play for the title. That\u2019s exactly where I want to be standing during these Grand Slams, is on finals day, having an opportunity. That\u2019s the highlight of all this, is to be in that moment.\u201d \n \n\u201cThere\u2019s no way I would be here at 23 without her,\u201d Serena Williams said of her sister. \u201cThere\u2019s no way I would be at one without her. She\u2019s the only reason that I\u2019m standing here today. She\u2019s the only reason that the Williams sisters exist.\u201d \n  Share this","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: tennis news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Serena Williams beats Venus to set slam record","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Western Africa","countryCode":"NG","country":"Nigeria"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"CitizenNG.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"533853821","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"9"},"name":"CitizenNG.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Sports"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://thecitizenng.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199672667","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T04:35:46Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:53:28Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}
