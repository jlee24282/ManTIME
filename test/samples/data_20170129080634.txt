And the Nigeria Basketball Federation, NBBF is one of the federations. \n \nUnlike many of the other federations, the NBBF faced a herculean task from the word go as some members of the Board pulled out of the election, protesting the exclusion of one of their members whom they believed was supposed to be on the Board. \n \nApart from withdrawing from the election, they took the NBBF to court. The court distraction notwithstanding however, the Board, in the face of poor funding, soldiered on with the purposeful leadership provided by its president, Tijjani Umar, an unassuming and workaholic gentleman who the aggrieved party and their leader misunderstood. \n \nApart from the law suit, different hurdles were placed on the way of the Board. These hurdles ranged from false stories planted in the media to disparage some of the members to gossips by the hate mongers to some of the federation\u2019s sponsors on alleged misapplication of the sponsorship money, all in the bid to make the sponsors stop funding the federations activities. \n \nApart from these disgruntled members and selfish stakeholders, their friends in the supervising ministry also made things difficult for the federation. Genuine approvals of funds for teams\u2019 participation in continental or world championships were either delayed or not given at all in some instances. \n \nUmar, not wanting to fail in the national assignment he chose to do on his own because of his genuine love and passion for the sport went out of his way to convince the Board members to make various sacrifices to ensure the activities were not halted. \n \nThese members, from the vice president, Muktar Khaleh to members like Agboola Pinheiro, Mustapha Suleiman, Felix Awogu, Olumide Oyedeji and yours sincerely never hesitated to support Umar because they knew he was a sincere and selfless leader. \n \nTo show that they were not running a cult, the Board extended its hand of fellowship to willing stakeholders who wanted to contribute their quota to help the course of the sport. That was how men like Ajibarede Bello, Scambo Morrison, Deji Jaiyeola, Lawal Garba, Kunle Raji and Gbade Latona, among others joined hands to reposition the sport. \n \nThis is not forgetting the contributions of the secretariat staff led by Patrick Okeke, the secretary general who has been reportedly redeployed to the head office of the sports ministry. With one mind, all these men, with other stakeholders like coaches, referees, match commissioners, sponsors, partners, contributors, the Media and even ex presidents of the NBBF supporting, the country recorded some milestones within the short tenure of the Board. \n \nApart from the fact that the Umar-led NBBF was able to return the country to age grade competitions using the right ages of players, as against the old practice, with the women and men\u2019s U-16 teams making appreciable impact on the their first year, the senior men\u2019s team, the D\u2019Tigers became African Champions, for the first time in 50 years, beating the \u2018Almighty\u2019 Angola to the crown and making a consecutive appearance at the Olympics. The senior women\u2019s team also showed promise in the continent and missed the Olympic ticket after a good fight at qualifying tournament in France. \n \nEfforts have been made to put structures on ground that will help the sport grow and also ensure that the NBBF rely less on the government for funds to sustain its programmes. That called for the bold move made to secure new sponsors and partners for the federation. \n \nEven the blind could attest to the remarkable achievements recorded so far and it is the belief of the outgoing Board that if the momentum is sustained, Nigeria basketball, like the FIBA Advisor who came visiting in late 2015, Lubomir Kotliba said, will be way ahead of Angola. \n \nAs the NBBF begins to round off its tenure therefore, it has decided to honour all those who contributed in one way or the other to the successes recorded thus far. So beginning from tomorrow in the Federal Capital, Abuja, series of events have been lined up to celebrate basketball. First is tomorrow\u2019s Annual General Meeting through which the NBBF intends to give stakeholders an account of its stewardship for 2016. \n \nTwenty fours later, there will also be an Awards Dinner to recognize, appreciate and honour deserving athletes, administrators, technical officials, sponsors, partners, contributors as well as the Media for their meritorious service and outstanding contribution to the development and growth of the game in Nigeria. \n \nIn all these, the NBBF is not trying to play an Agama lizard. Its efforts have already been commended by Nigerians. It is just putting it on record for posterity. To God alone be all the glory. \n \nThe post appeared first on Vanguard News . \n \nOriginal Article \n \nBasketball And The Umar Legacy \nBasketball And The Umar Legacy \nBasketball And The Umar Legacy \nBasketball And The Umar Legacy \nBasketball And The Umar Legacy \n Basketball And The Umar Legacy  Basketball And The Umar Legacy","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":""},"topics":[{"name":"Nigeria news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: basketball news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Basketball and the Umar legacy","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Western Africa","countryCode":"NG","country":"Nigeria"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Ondo State News Online","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"608959245","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Ondo State News Online","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://ondostatenews.online"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.vanguardngr.com/2017/01/basketball-umar-legacy/","http://www.vanguardngr.com/"],"sequenceId":"695193827651","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:39Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:11:13Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

But some people can kill when you snore around them. For instance, a 30- year \u2013 old commercial motorcyclist allegedly beat his wife to stupor for snoring recently. \n \nHowever, while snoring can result in conflict among family members and constitute a nuisance to frustrated bed partners, it is no longer something to ignore. This is because experts say people who snore risk heart diseases. They are also of the view that snoring is sometimes a warning sign that needs a doctor\u2019s evaluation on sleeping disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) or sleep-related breathing problems. Studies have shown that one in every four people snore. \n \nAccording to the President of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, Dr. M. Safwan Badr, snoring is like fever for a general internist and tells you something is going on, but doesn\u2019t tell you what.\u201d \n \nBadr explains that snoring occurs when a person\u2019s airway have narrowed, causing the air that passes through it as we breathe to vibrate the soft tissue of the throat. To him, snoring is not normal. \n \nWhat is snoring? \n \nSnoring happens when you can\u2019t move air freely through your nose and throat during sleep. \n \nA clinical pharmacist, Ada Aku, says snoring is partially obstructed breathing during sleep, causing a harsh, rough sound from the passage of air through the mouth, throat and nose. \n \nWhile we are asleep, turbulent airflow can cause the tissues of the palate (roof of the mouth) and throat to vibrate, giving rise to snoring. Essentially, snoring is a sound resulting from turbulent airflow that causes tissues to vibrate during sleep. \n \nAku states: \u201cIn some people, snoring is more serious and can be a health risk. Snoring may be associated with periods when the breathing stops completely for up to a minute. This problem is known as sleep apnoea and is due to collapse of the soft tissues of the throat during sleep. Snoring can prevent the sufferer as well as the bed partner from getting a good night\u2019s sleep. The annoying problem causes more stress usually for the people around the snorer, rather than the snorer. It may help to change the position of the sufferer. Sleeping on the back appears to be worse than sleeping on the side. \n \nStudies show that snoring is three times more common in overweight people. Unconfirmed report shows that approximately 20 percent of the population are habitual snorers and more men than women suffer from the problem. Snoring tends to increase from age 30 to 65, but thereafter it reduces. \n \n\u201cHowever, as much as they get teased, people who snore are aware and sometimes embarrassed of how big the issue is\u201d. \n \n\n \nLife experiences \n \n\u201cI never agreed I was inconveniencing my wife then until the unexpected happened,\u201d says Patrick. \n \nForty \u2013 two year-old Patrick was enjoying his quality of life, but was in desperate denial of the fact that he had snoring problem. Although he knew his wife was almost becoming miserable due to his snoring habit, little did he know that his persistent condition could put his general health at risk. Just like any other Nigerian, he lived in denial. \n \nPatrick\u2019s wife was convinced that her husband had something worse than snoring. \n \nAt a point, Patrick began to experience sleeplessness and this brought him to a breaking point. \n \nJust like a study has shown that the intensity of snoring increases as sleep apnea becomes more severe, Patrick was no longer comfortable with the development. \n \nWhile most people think of snoring as a minor annoyance, studies have shown that the disorder can be gravely hazardous to health. \n \nIt was at this point that Patrick began to seek medical assistance and his ENT specialist told him he was not only having OSA but also chronic snoring. Patrick also began to experience memory loss and frequent night time urination. \n \nLuckily, after series of treatment and diet guides recommended by his doctor, Patrick was able to overcome his snoring disorder. \n \nPatrick is one out of millions of people suffering from snoring and OSA, without knowing. \n \nAccording to experts, People who suffer from OSA repeatedly and unknowingly stop breathing during the night due to a complete or partial obstruction of their airway. It occurs when the jaw, throat, and tongue muscles relax, blocking the airway used to breathe. The resulting lack of oxygen lasts for a minute or longer, and can occur hundreds of times each night. \n \nWhy snoring should not be ignored \n \nIn a study entitled, \u2018Assessment of snoring and obstructive sleep apnoea, OSA, in a Nigerian university: Association with cardiovascular risk factors\u2019 carried out by Adeseye A. and colleagues, it was found that although snoring remains under-diagnosed in general population, it has significant morbidity and mortality risk factors with multiple effects on the cardiovascular system. \n \nThe study, which involved 206 workers of Ladoke Akintola University of Technology, LAUTECH, showed that snoring and high risk for sleep apnoea is common among Nigerians and are closely related to many conventional cardiovascular risk factors. The researchers recommended appropriate interventional strategies to reduce the burden of the increased morbidity and mortality associated with sleep apnoea in the population. \u201cSnoring and OSA are associated with many cardiovascular disorders including hypertension, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, stroke, erectile dysfunction and impaired glucose tolerance/diabetes mellitus. OSA and snoring have been shown to be highly prevalent among subjects with hypertension and heart failure. \n \nAlso in a report, a medical expert, Dr Juliette Katung, noted that alcohol consumption could cause snoring. Katung said poor \u2018muscle tone\u2019 in the throat and tongue could be one of the causes of snoring. Muscle tone is a condition of weak muscles, especially when ageing, as a result of alcohol consumption. \n \nAccording to her, poor muscle tone in the throat and mouth which can result from alcohol consumption as well as sleeping pills can cause snoring. \n \nShe explained that obstructed nasal airway which could be from an infection or tissue swelling from allergies could cause snoring, adding that, snoring could be prevented through adopting healthy lifestyles, including proper dieting, exercise, avoiding alcohol and establishing a good sleep pattern. \n \nCommon causes of snoring \n \nBeing overweight or out of shape: Fatty tissue and poor muscle tone contribute to snoring. Even if you\u2019re not overweight in general, carrying excess weight just around your neck or throat can cause snoring. Exercising and losing weight can sometimes be all it takes to end your snoring. \n \nAge: As you reach middle age and beyond, your throat becomes narrower, and the muscle tone in your throat decreases. \n \nThe way you\u2019re built: Men have narrower air passages than women and are more likely to snore. A narrow throat, a cleft palate, enlarged adenoids, and other physical attributes that contribute to snoring are often hereditary. Again, while you have no control over your build or gender, you can control your snoring with the right lifestyle changes, bedtime routines, and throat exercises. \n \nNasal and sinus problems: Blocked airway or a stuffy nose make inhalation difficult and create a vacuum in the throat, leading to snoring. \n \nAlcohol, smoking, and medications: Alcohol intake, smoking, and certain medications, such as tranquilizers can increase muscle relaxation leading to more snoring. \n \nSleep posture: Sleeping flat on your back causes the flesh of your throat to relax and block the airway. Changing your sleep position can help. \n \nHow to stop snoring \n \nHowever, the good news is that no matter the cause, there are solutions to relieve your snoring and help you and your loved one deal with complaints, resentments, and other relationship issues caused by your snoring. \n \nAccording to Katung, the condition could also be treated surgically and non-surgically as the case might be. \n \nChange your sleeping position: Lying on your back makes the base of your tongue and soft palate collapse to the back wall of your throat, causing those horrible vibrating sounds during sleep. Sleeping on your side may help prevent this. \n \nReduce your alcohol intake: Alcohol reduces the resting tone of the muscles in the back of your neck so usually, when you take alcohol at least four hours before you sleep, there are very high chances you will bellow horribly in your sleep. What to also note here is that people who do not snore normally, might actually snore if they go to bed right away. So keep the alcohol away. Avoid sleeping pills and sedatives because they relax the muscles in the throat and interfere with breathing. Talk to your doctor about any prescription medications you are taking, as some encourage a deeper level of sleep which can make snoring worse. \n \nWeight loss: This is not to say slim people do not snore too but if you ever snored before you added weight but now you snore, then you might want to consider losing weight. \n \nStay hydrated, shower before bed: Drink a lot of water; it is as simple as that. The secretions in your nose and soft palate become stickier if you are not well hydrated. Also, shower before you turn in for the night to stay fresh and do not forget to sleep on your side. Most importantly, try and get the adequate amount of sleep. \n \nInhale steam: Before you go to bed, place your head over a steam bowl, covering it with a towel to clear out and reduce swelling in your nasal passage. You can add a few drops of essential oil to open up your nostrils and relieve nasal congestion. \n \nElevate your head: When you go to sleep, try to elevate your head to take pressure off the airway to make breathing easier. Experts suggest raising the head of the bed by putting blocks under the bed posts. A simpler alternative is to prop your upper body with pillows to allow oxygen to go through your airways. \n \nQuit smoking : Quitting is easier said than done, but smoking irritates the membranes in the nose and throat which can block the airways and cause snoring. \n \nEstablish regular sleep patterns: Create a healthy bedtime ritual with your partner and stick to it. Hitting the sack in a routine way together can help you sleep better and often minimize snoring. \n \nBedtime remedies to help you stop snoring \n \nClear nasal passages: If you have a stuffy nose, rinse sinuses with saline before bed. \n \nKeep bedroom air moist. Dry air can irritate membranes in the nose and throat, so if swollen nasal tissues are the problem, a humidifier may help. \n \nChange your sleeping position: Elevating your head four inches may ease breathing and encourage your tongue and jaw to move forward. There are specially designed pillows available to help prevent snoring by making sure your neck muscles are not crimped. \n \nSleep on your side instead of your back. \n \nTry an anti-snoring mouth appliance: These devices often resemble an athlete\u2019s mouth guard and help open your airway by bringing your lower jaw and/or your tongue forward during sleep. \n \nDo throat exercises to prevent snoring. Repeat each vowel (a-e-i-o-u) out loud for three minutes a few times a day. Place the tip of your tongue behind your top front teeth. Slide your tongue backwards for three minutes a day. Consult your physician or an otolaryngologist (an ear, nose, and throat doctor or ENT) to recommend a medical device or surgical procedure such as: Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) among others. \n \nDiets: Experts recommend nutritious diet at all times. \n \nThe post appeared first on Vanguard News . \n \nOriginal Article \n \nFind Out Why Snoring Is As Bad As You Think \nFind Out Why Snoring Is As Bad As You Think \nFind Out Why Snoring Is As Bad As You Think \nFind Out Why Snoring Is As Bad As You Think \nFind Out Why Snoring Is As Bad As You Think \n Find Out Why Snoring Is As Bad As You Think  Find Out Why Snoring Is As Bad As You Think","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":""},"topics":[{"name":"Nigeria news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Find out why snoring is as bad as you think","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Western Africa","countryCode":"NG","country":"Nigeria"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Ondo State News Online","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"608959245","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Ondo State News Online","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://ondostatenews.online"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.vanguardngr.com/2017/01/find-snoring-bad-think/","http://www.vanguardngr.com/"],"sequenceId":"695193828299","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:35Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:11:13Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/snoring.png"}],"video":[]}}

The reasons were both poaching and accidental. \n \nOn Friday, January 27, a 20-year-old elephant died after coming into contact with an illegal electric fence around a field near Karnataka's Bandipur National Park. On January 25, a female elephant was killed due to electrocution in the forests of Odisha's Rourkela district. \n \n\"The elephant climbed a small Bandha to reach out to the leaves, and touched the loosely hanging wire. We had informed the electricity department. Wires often hang loose due to the long distance between the electric poles in forests,\" Rourkela District Forest Officer Sanjeet Kumar told IANS on telephone. \n \nElectrocution is a method in which a wired trap or fence, mostly powered by a high tension electric line passing nearby in the forests, is used to kill the animals, either for poaching or to protect fields from herbivores. The wires with electric current are either placed on the preferred routes of the animals or passed through the water bodies used by animals. \n \nWildlife experts say instances of electrocution are on the rise and despite the 2005 guidelines of the Supreme Court 's Central Empowered Committee (CEC) to the State Electricity Boards and Forest Departments to strengthened security to prevent poaching by electrocution, nothing much was done. \n \nAccording to Tito Joseph of the Wildlife Protection Society of India (WPSI), while every year at least 20 elephants die due to electrocution, at least 43 elephants were killed in 2016 in this manner. \n \n\"In 2011, at least 11 leopards died due to electrocution and at least 10 wild tigers were poached,\" Joseph told IANS. \n \nTwo leopards, one tigress and two sambar deer were also electrocuted between January 11 and 14 in different forest divisions of Maharashtra's Nagpur district. \n \nOn January 25, a sloth bear was found electrocuted with its claws harvested, in Amravati Forest Division of Maharashtra, an official told IANS. \n \n(Kushagra Dixit can be reached at kushagra.d@ians.in)","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Nature news","group":"Science"},{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Electrocution of wild animals increasing, experts raise concerns","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"ProKerala.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"261879685","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"ProKerala.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.prokerala.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695193829358","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:09:02Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:11:13Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

He did some shoveling outside his Williston home, and then went inside to take ibuprofen for a nagging pain in his arm. \n\nHalf an hour later, the pain was gone, and Boone was celebrating the holiday with his family. \n\nBut later that night, he woke up from an early evening nap in front of the television to raging pain in his arm, back and chest. \n\n\"I was hurting so bad I started breaking out in a sweat,\" Boone said. \"The chest pain was the worst it felt like somebody was sitting on me.\" \n\nSoon he was sick, and his wife called for an ambulance, which managed to make the trip to his subdivision on Harvest Hill Drive, but paramedics had to borrow Boone's snow-blower to clear a path to load him into the vehicle. \n\nThe weather that earlier had meant little more than a blustery white Christmas was now suddenly a terrifying barrier to the life-saving medical treatment that emergency room staff at CHI St. Alexius Health in Williston almost immediately knew Boone needed. \n\n\"We stabilized him as best we could, but at that time I realized our resources were exhausted and he would not survive if we didn't get him elsewhere,\" said Karen Johnson, a certified registered nurse anesthetist, who tended to Boone that night. \n\nThe 45-year-old was having a massive heart attack due to double blockages, and needed to be transported to Trinity Hospital in Minot for surgery. \n\nHigh winds were keeping a medical flight crew on the ground, and local ambulance drivers said the snow was piling up too high to make such a long trip possible. \n\nBy 1 a.m., after Boone's heart had stopped for a second time, Johnson made a call to Rick Sigvaldsen, Williston's Department of Transportation district maintenance supervisor. \n\nShe asked if a snowplow could escort an ambulance to Minot, and the response was immediate. \n\n\"Absolutely,\" he said. \n\nWith snowplow driver Ed Nelson clearing a path, an ambulance carrying Boone, a paramedic and members of the Valley Med-Flight crew made its way to Minot, where a cardiologist put a stent in Boone's heart. \n\nThe trip took four hours. \n\n\"There's absolutely no way we would have done it without the snowplow,\" Corey Johnson, a Williston paramedic who rode in the back with Boone, said. \n\nThe decision to call wasn't made easily, Johnson said, pointing out that she would not have asked others to travel in risky conditions if so much hadn't been at stake, the Williston Herald (http://bit.ly/2kjDsZD ) reports. \n\n\"I would never have considered calling anybody out into those conditions if it hadn't been to save someone's life,\" she said, adding that the response she got was not unexpected. \"I was relieved, but not truly surprised because of the nature of the people in this community.\" \n\nBoone, a Mississippi native, is back to work in the oil industry, and enjoying his first grandchild, who was born a month ago. The two met for the first time after Boone's discharge from the hospital. \n\n\"I can't thank them enough.

Senior Special Assistant, SSA, to President Muhammadu Buhari on Media and Publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu, in this interview, first wired on Channels Tv, explains that the outcome of the investigations, including the accidental air strikes on a civilian community in Borno State would be made public to forestall future occurrence.The interview was conducted before the President\u2019s vacation controversy. \n \nBy Levinus Nwabughiogu \n \nD o we have assurance from the Federal Government that the people who have fled their homes from Southern Kaduna can safely return? \n \nGovernment has intensified a lot of activities. As we speak now, there are ongoing efforts to establish two military battalions: one in Karsha and one in Zango-Kataf, and there is military surveillance undertaken by the air force. The army has moved and Mobile Police squadrons have been put in place. So, a lot of effort is being made. The humanitarian situation is also being looked at. The Federal Government, through NEMA, is working with Kaduna State Emergency Management Agency in order to bring relief to displaced persons. \n \nWhat was reported was that groups and public spirited individuals are the ones that give victims support in primary schools, there is no mention of NEMA. \n \nI can assure you that NEMA is doing quite a lot but that isn\u2019t to say that people should not help. This is Nigeria and this is how we have cared for one another in all crisis situations if you compare what is going in Southern Kaduna with what is going on in the North-East. A lot of humanitarian effort is being driven by communities. As a matter of fact, 80 percent of displaced persons are found in communities and are being accommodated by members of communities not in IDP camps. So, we have a way of caring for one another but I can assure that it was on the directive of the President that NEMA went to Southern Kaduna. \n \nIt is unclear whether or not the battalion has helped in getting those that perpetrate this evil. Once in a week now, we have had sporadic attacks even after security men had been deployed. \n \nThings are calming down. It would be an assumption to think that the crisis will just go away with the wave of the hand. It will take some time to get those that perpetrate the criminality but, by and large, the things put in place by the Federal Government are having an effect. \n \nMany people wanted security agents to go into the bush because they felt that was where the murderers were and they also felt it was difficult for them to go to their farm and they were saying that the bulk of the security men were always staying in town and on the road which wasn\u2019t where the attacks were. \n \nWell, again, we often make mistakes which is that we leave matters of security to the police and the army and there is enormous responsibility on us as members of our communities. Let me give an example, information just coming out of Borno is that the chairman of a certain local government has been found complicit in Boko Haram attacks and he is being shielded by community members. This is not how it should be because we as members of the community have our own duty; if we leave these things to the police, army, we don\u2019t have enough police men to put everywhere in this country. Yes, I believe there is a lot to be done but communities mustn\u2019t push their own responsibility to the police in this crisis. \n \nThese people have already been traumatized, most of the attacks have been on their farmers. In some instances, villages are entered and ransacked and people are killed or maimed as the case maybe. They rely on security agencies knowing that they are unarmed and most of the attackers come in fully armed and prepared to create maximum damage and the security agents aren\u2019t looking in the areas they want them to look. Do you still say that they are shying from their responsibility? \n \nTo be honest with you, we must begin to look beyond the police and the army in solving a crisis like the one in Southern Kaduna. See the communities where lives have been destroyed. Look at the interesting thing that has evolved out of Plateau State. Plateau was the epicenter of crisis for some time and the community seized these elements with both hands. Southern Kaduna hasn\u2019t been like this; a story was told of one Fulani man living in Southern Kaduna and was so trustful of his neighbour. The Fulani, being a Muslim and his neighbour, a Christian, left behind his child with this neighbour. The neighbour looked for a Muslim school for the child to be taught because his children don\u2019t go to that school. In fact, the Fulani man went and never really came back to that community but this Southern Kaduna man raised this child as a Muslim in the choice of his own parents until the young man graduated from the university before he reunited with his family. These are communities that have lived with one another for a long time. A lot has happened. So, many of the things that are going on there is a lot of criminality. There is a lot of injustice that needs to be corrected, politics is also coming in and, when politics and security mix, you have problems. \n \nWhat precisely is going on in Kaduna? \n \nWell, so many things have gone wrong including, as I said, the breakdown of society and that really has to be rebuilt. Security has been intensive there but, as I said earlier, that alone isn\u2019t going to solve the problem. Beyond this, I think there is also a lot to worry about, concerning politics and religiousity and even media coverage of the crisis in Southern Kaduna. I think it needs to be more enlightened, balanced and evenly handled. It is a crisis where communities are fighting one another and when you read media reports, it is just one side of the story of the victims that is being told. There are Muslims, there are Christians and they kill each other but people report like there is only one part of the community suffering all of this and that is the misinterpretation of the facts. Politics, like I said, has a role in all of these things. Don\u2019t forget that Southern Kaduna is the only PDP senatorial district in the entire North-West and that has implications for the way politics is run. There is a lot of interest; the PDP is interested and is assuming someone wants to use force to capture this place. The PDP, the media and everyone is throwing things into this thing. So, we have to de-escalate by ensuring balanced media reports, depoliticise the situation and sermornization of some of the religious leaders. We have seen lately, for instance, there have been this video going viral all over the country that people should be killed. \n \nWho is saying that? \n \nUnfortunately the video isn\u2019t branded, the name isn\u2019t there but it is very clear it is someone who kept asking for the killing and the be-heading. This country doesn\u2019t deserve this and I have the sense that this person has a lot of explanation to do. \n \nOn the point made by the Kaduna governor that the people were taking a revenge on 2011 elections crisis/compensation of victims \u2026 \n \nPeople talk about Fulani settlers, I don\u2019t know why anybody is called a settler in his own country but I just illustrated a story of a Fulani man who left his son with his neighbour. These are people who have lived in these places for generations herding their cattle and the so-called natives who believe they are the oldest in there as long history can remember call them settlers. I think the point the governor of Kaduna has tried to make all along is that this crisis is a long standing one and he mentioned that more than 10,000 lives have been lost and that the problem has continued to perpetuate itself because people are not being punished for their roles in previous crisis. We have had investigation upon investigation, report upon report to successive administrations in Kaduna. What can anybody do about it? Well, he says this time that it would be different, that people would be brought to trial and they are already making arrest and we hope that will help to stop the crisis. \n \nBut people believe that even if the crisis between communities, how come some communities seem better armed than others? Some people feel there is more to this than meets the eye and some people are alleging conspiracy theory and Southern Kaduna isn\u2019t the only ones having crisis. From Taraba to Yobe, you have pockets of crisis, even at some point, Nassarawa had to contend with a crisis of this nature. Do we have security intelligence mapping that says precisely what is going on and affecting these communities and this is the solution they are proposing? \n \nI can say that there is this massive conspiracy that you are leading to whether it is from home or abroad or whatever. One thing I know is that we have a problem because we have cattle herders who, by tradition, follow the green grass and, when they drive their cattle around looking for green grass, the cattle enter farmlands and eat crops and, when that happens, farmers fight back and, on the other hand also, you have cattle rustling which also has assumed a big dimension. Until recently nothing was done about it. So, when you snatch the cattle and you kill and eat up they will come back to take. \n \n[embedded content] \n \nAre you suggesting that farmers are also taking cattle? \n \nNumber of communities do this otherwise if there is no cattle rustling people won\u2019t be talking about it. This is why ongoing efforts seem to be like what you have in Benue coming out of Agatu last week, you have Nassarawa and Benue states coming together to carve out a terrain for cattle rearing. \n \nThe communities were resisting that move by the state government because they felt the wounds were just too fresh for them to forget in a hurry. \n \nWell, it isn\u2019t easy to suppress all of that but certainly that is the way to go. Even Anambra and Enugu and a number of states have seen solutions that are very bright that whenever a community steals cattle and they are able to trace, they are made to pay the cattle herders because they have stolen and, if the cattle rearers drive their cattle over their crops, they are also charged. So, there is a balance in the way it is done. \n \nBut in terms of the lives that have been lost\u2026 \n \nWell, lives have been lost and, like I said earlier, there is a conflict and these lives are lost on both sides and I think that media reports ought to be such that they reflect the losses on both sides otherwise we are not helping the crisis situation. \n \nInformation on the Southern Kaduna crisis the Catholic church has released indicates that over 808 lives have been lost as of the time they wrote their statement which the IG disputed but then we never got any figure from the authorities even though the governor of the state came out to say that since the crisis begin in Southern Kaduna over 20,000 lives have been lost. It is a huge number of people that lost their lives to this conflict that would have been resolved before now this something the federal government is giving serious thought to? \n \nIt is tragic and unfortunate that this happened. But I must say that people don\u2019t help situations like this when they become inflamed and people argue about figures they can hardly justify. \n \nOn the number of deaths \n \nWell, I can\u2019t account for all the bodies. But I think the escalation of the crisis in Southern Kaduna reached the highest point around Christmas. I am not talking about the recent Christmas and this is where all these numbers are coming from. You will recall that the president instructed the Inspector General of Police to go to the place and the IG asked his men on ground to give him the number of those that they could see were killed and they gave him 16 names. So, we have to be careful with numbers and if you ask me who do I believe, I would rather believe the IG than believe someone whose numbers are not structured and accounted for in full in the sense that we can see names and all of that. Of course no one is pleased about the losses. \n \nOf course no one is pleased but if we were to start counting from August when we heard the first attacks in Godogodo down to December, are you saying that the figures are exaggerated and the IG only came back with 16 names? \n \nThe thing is maybe we ask the police to update their own number, go back to the period you just mentioned and then give us their own number and let\u2019s see what it looks like. 808 is alarming and I hope it isn\u2019t up to that and I am persuaded in my mind that the number could be much lower. \n \nOr much higher? \n \nI doubt that. \n \nWhy do you doubt that? \n \nBecause we need to have a sincere explanation to where are they coming from; all of them and when we have a situation like this, who buries the corpse? It is usually the local authority and when they give numbers, we have no other person to believe. Dealing with Borno for instance you see conflicting numbers coming from the air force and the state. \n \nThe rising security situation nationwide and preparedness of security agencies to tackle it. \n \nTo be fair to our law enforcement, I am sorry that all these things are happening and you know the strategy the police has used for a while: when families whose members are kidnapped s say stay away, they stay away especially during the period of negotiation. The family is always given the priority but check the records; in more than 90 percent of kidnapping without payment of ransom and release of the victims, the police are able to catch the kidnappers. As we speak now, I know that the police has in custody not less than 800 suspected kidnappers. So, the system is working perhaps. It isn\u2019t like most people want it but are we able to apprehend them as they do these things? I think it is something that the police should be commended for doing. \n \nOn the air force accidental bombing in Rann, Borno State. \n \nIt is tragic as the president said and it is unfortunate and this shouldn\u2019t have happened and I hope the investigation will uncover why this has happened so that we ensure in the future that it doesn\u2019t happen. This is the first time we are having this kind of incident; it is tragic and unfortunate and we will live to regret it but such accident also happens in war situations. In Iraq, in Syria, in Afghanistan; there have always been civilian causalities, collateral damages and again they may not be up to the number we just had in Borno which again is shocking. But we wait for the panel of investigation to conclude but I don\u2019t think it is the norm in military history anywhere that compensations are paid to civilian causalities in war situations. I have my doubts. \n \nIf we feel sorry enough that these people were supposed to be receiving protection in their communities because it is an unofficial camp put together by the communities themselves and over 50 of them, I want to be very careful with figures, at the last time we heard, over 100 people lost their lives. As a matter of fact it is more than that as we speak. \n \nWhat numbers do you have? \n \nBy Saturday they were talking about 236 people. \n \nThat is a lot of people. \n \nYes, as I said it is very tragic and unfortunate but it didn\u2019t just happen because credible intelligence had been received. Boko Haram fighters had moved and had been picked by the system; satellite and all of that and they had gone to that community and when air raids were planned, the Boko Haram elements pulled out and you see that two days after that incident they came back again with the hope that they could hide and we deployed the military at the scene again. \n \nThe military said they are going to do an investigative hearing on this, do you think that it is going to be public? \n \nI don\u2019t know how they are going to do it but I know as many as 4 investigations are ongoing currently. \n \nWill the findings be made public? \n \nThe government is an accountable government. It has no reason to keep it away from the public. Would there be public hearings like the ones in the parliament? Well, I don\u2019t know that but I think that this is so painful. \n \nIf you are talking about precedence in that regard, at least we have the precedence in Israel where there are public hearings in the military and this is because the military is funded by tax payers\u2019 money. We are talking about an entire community, over 200 people which yourself have admitted, that is a lot of number which is something Nigerians should be concerned about and the military has to be open about. \n \nWe hope also that if there is blame, punishment should be dished out. Would there be compensation? We hope that when they come up with their recommendations, you are asking for precedent to be set if they are able to persuade the Nigerian government. \n \nIf there is none at all in the world, then the Federal Government can set precedence? \n \nWell, someone needs to make that suggestion first. \n \nWe don\u2019t even know if we have heard that over 200 people have been killed in any story before in all of the situations we have heard outside the country \n \nWhy has it been difficult for instance for the president to pay a visit to any of the places that are having these crisis?: Southern Kaduna, Borno. Yes, he has visited many of the fronts but the communities themselves, we haven\u2019t seen the president go there to pay sympathy visit. \n \nIt depends on what you want. If I come from any of these communities which have been given a battalion of the military or a squadron of mobile policemen around me and the president comes in and goes out, I am not saying that the president don\u2019t feel this, he is a father, he is a grandfather, he has family and he has his heart on all of this matter, what happens is that when he is represented by competent elements around him, they report to him about things that need to be done and I think that people should decide what they themselves want. We have had government that played on rhetorics most of the time and gave us that as substitute of action. The president will rather speak through his action than being sentimental about some of these things. \n \nThe post appeared first on Vanguard News . \n \nOriginal Article \n \nSOUTHERN KADUNA: Twisted Reports, Desperate Politics, Hate Preaching Fuel Killings \u2013 Garba Shehu \nSOUTHERN KADUNA: Twisted Reports, Desperate Politics, Hate Preaching Fuel Killings \u2013 Garba Shehu \nSOUTHERN KADUNA: Twisted Reports, Desperate Politics, Hate Preaching Fuel Killings \u2013 Garba Shehu \nSOUTHERN KADUNA: Twisted Reports, Desperate Politics, Hate Preaching Fuel Killings \u2013 Garba Shehu \nSOUTHERN KADUNA: Twisted Reports, Desperate Politics, Hate Preaching Fuel Killings \u2013 Garba Shehu \n SOUTHERN KADUNA: Twisted Reports, Desperate Politics, Hate Preaching Fuel Killings \u2013 Garba Shehu  SOUTHERN KADUNA: Twisted Reports, Desperate Politics, Hate Preaching Fuel Killings \u2013 Garba Shehu","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":""},"topics":[{"name":"Nigeria news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"SOUTHERN KADUNA: Twisted reports, desperate politics, hate preaching fuel killings \u2013 Garba Shehu","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Western Africa","countryCode":"NG","country":"Nigeria"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Ondo State News Online","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"608959245","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Ondo State News Online","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://ondostatenews.online"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.vanguardngr.com/2017/01/southern-kaduna-twisted-reports-desperate-politics-hate-preaching-fuel-killings-garba-shehu/","http://www.vanguardngr.com/"],"sequenceId":"695193831768","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:36Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:11:14Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

In this interview, Agan speaks on the challenges facing teaching hospitals in the country. \n \nYou have been in office for about five years. We know that as an administrator you must have challenges, one of which is the issue of staff salary. How have you have been coping? \n \nThe truth of the matter is that the UCTH does not owe staff salary. In October, November and December 2016, we had a shortfall which was a national challenge. In fact, the first two hospitals to be affected were the Federal Teaching Hospital, Irua and the Federal Medical Centre, Yenogoa. \n \nYou are also aware that at the beginning of last year, the Federal Government reduced personnel allocation to Ministries, Departments and Agencies ,MDAs, by about 10 per cent and most of us who knew this told our staff that we were going to have shortfall and that they may not receive October salary. Some of them thought we were unserious. I was even blackmailed that I put their money in MMM, and I don\u2019t know what MMM means. I won\u2019t do that, you don\u2019t touch people\u2019s money as they have wives and husbands who depend on them. \n \nLuckily, the Federal Government corrected the shortfall because money was sourced and paid to all MDAs that had shortfall, including teaching hospitals. So when people say we ate their money, going around blackmailing us that we put funds in MMM, I look at them and laugh because there is no truth in it. UCTH and most teaching hospitals across the country are not owing staff salary. \n \nWhat about salary and promotion arrears in the university teaching hospital system? \n \nPromotion arrears in the teaching hospital system date back to 2013 when IPPIS came in. The Federal Government has not been paying promotion arrears since 2013. In 2013, they made part, payment, promotion arrears for 2014 to 2016 have not been paid. Even the promotion that was done in 2016 in most teaching hospitals, including Calabar, the report has not come out from the Federal Ministry of Health. The implication is that we depend on our supervisory ministry, and if money is not given to you, how do you pay? For now, 2014, 2015, 2016 and part of 2013 promotion arrears have not been paid. Government has calculated it, it is in the budget office and all that is needed is for the Federal Minister of Finance to give cash \u2013backing. The government is doing their best to ensure that civil servants in the health sector do not suffer unnecessarily because it is their right not a privilege. \nProfessor Thomas Agan \n \nOutside salary arrears and promotion, what of the area training of doctors- what has your administration been doing about it in terms of sponsorship? \n \nWhen you talk of sponsorship, there hasn\u2019t been budgetary provision for sponsorship. At a time we were paying sponsorship from personnel allocation but we were stopped. For instance, if I am given N6 million to manage this teaching hospital- this overhead is supposed to take care of diesel supply- a truck load of diesel of 40,000 liters is how much? It is almost N12 million. Then you talk of other things. You need to buy stationery, you need to do repairs, you need to maintain, and you need to do all kinds of things. The overhead cannot carry the head. So for now, we owe resident doctors sponsorship allowance and we are appealing to them to exercise patience, by God\u2019s grace, government will take into consideration some of these things. Some of these things are things that if we look critically inwards, we can resolve. \n \nRecently, you tried to do away with outsourced services in UCTH. Was it an internal decision or the decision came the Federal Ministry of Health? \n \nThe decision to outsource services is a government decision- some of the services being rendered by staff were outsourced. The staff affected include security personnel, cleaners, laundry. The implication is that a contractor will now bid and then recruit people to come and do those jobs. Unfortunately, something went wrong and since 2009 till date government has not been funding it. So, there no budgetary provision for outsourced services. We were funding from internally generated revenue. \n \nBetween 2009 and 2012, we were paying from personnel. In 2012, ICPC invited some of us and gave us stern warning over it and even wrote to us that we were liable to be jailed if we pay that way. It came to a point where we were asked to pay from capital allocation and as the budget is coming out it is expunged. So, we are owing part of 2013, 2014 and 2015. As I am talking, many of them have taken us to court while some have assaulted us physically, and some have even gone as far as assaulting our family members. \n \nAs of November 2016, we are owing about N229 million to outsourced companies. As Chairman of the Committee of CMDs, I have written to the Minister of Finance to authorize the payment because it is their right, not a privilege. \n \nLet\u2019s talk about infrastructural development in UCTH. Could you let us know how far it has been in terms electricity, the state of the theatre, the toilets and bathrooms? \n \nWhen you talk about infrastructural development, it has been very slow because of the dwindling economy. Recession is affecting everything in this country. I can tell you that from when I took over in 2011, we had capital budget of about N600 million, out of which only 52 per cent was released. In 2012, we had about N400 million, out of this only 48 per cent was released. In 2013, out of about N400, only 38 per cent was released. So it has continued to dwindle. \n \nThis hospital was constructed in 1977 and, somewhere along the line, it was abandoned and then hoodlums removed the glasses, the roof and everything. Well, we have moved in but it is not possible do what we should do. We couldn\u2019t develop because you can give what you don\u2019t have. \n \nBesides infrastructure, electricity bill is one of our greatest challenges. In fact, we pay almost N6m monthly. And in the absence of public power supply, the generators are functioning very well. We have a 515 KVA generator mounted inside the laboratory and it can supply electricity to the entire hospital. It is just that I don\u2019t like them to do that because it can break down easily. We also have a 500 KVA generator mounted at the theatre which supplies light to the theatre and some parts of the hospital. Recently we contemplated acquiring a 200 KVA generator only for the radiology department because the equipment there are very sensitive- they cannot withstand public power supply. Due to this off and one, the equipment there break down easily, so we are working on that and we will get it soon. \n \nLet me take you back to some of the issues patients have been complaining about. One is the issue of drugs revolving in the hospital. How functional has that scheme been? \n \nYou know too well that when the Federal Government introduced the Treasury Single Account (TSA), every money generated, whether it is from drug revolving fund or from anywhere, must go to the TSA. There is nothing special about TSA, so any money that is going there is utilized. Secondly, if you generate N5, 000 and you are looking for N10, 000, from which subhead do you get that money? If the pharmacy generates N5, 000 and they are looking for N10, 000, where do you get the money from? The drug suppliers claim that the hospital is owing them, the hospital cannot owe you. Suppliers are being paid, not that they are not being paid. Sometimes I hear stories outside and they gets me very offended- that because they are owing GRF, who is owing GRF? Is it the teaching hospital or government? We are paying and we will continue to pay, anybody who is being owed will be paid fully. I have vowed that this 2017 I want to clear as much as possible all debts owed to some of these people so that I will have peace. When I am leaving, I leave in peace. \n \nLet me take you back to the issue of the Committee of CMDs. Doctors allege that the committee is responsible for the crisis in hospitals. What crisis are they talking about? \n \nThe crisis the doctors keep raising is that the CMDs don\u2019t cooperate with them, they don\u2019t discuss with them. Every staff is staff and as a chief executive, you don\u2019t just come and open the books and announce on television and radio that government has sent you money for this or that. It is administratively wrong. Sometimes people have to know the basics, it is not everything you analyse to staff. Worse still, people who need positions are the people who instigate crisis in hospitals. \n \nThey are not only instigating resident doctors, they are instigating other staff. They blackmail you; write petitions to EFCC, ICPC, police headquarters, media, every nook and cranny of the world. I have told doctors nationwide that I am ready to solve their problems as long as they are ready to stop striking unnecessarily. I will join the Federal Government to solve their problems which are very minor as far as I am concerned. Abroad you pay school fees to be trained as a resident doctor. In Nigeria government pays you and trains you. As far as I am concerned, it is a privilege and not a right because they are paid salary. \n \nThe Minister issued a directive on the detention of patients following inability to pay hospitals bills. As the Chairman of the Committee of CMDs, what is your response? \n \nThe truth of the matter is that people are not ready to pay; it is not that there is no money to pay. Nigerians want to be treated free, not that they don\u2019t have the money. Now we insist that anybody that comes must pay deposit unless the person comes unconscious, and they are paying. Nobody should deceive you that they don\u2019t have money; they will tell the public that they are being detained but they are not being detained by anybody. \n \nThe post appeared first on Vanguard News . \n \nOriginal Article \n \nI Was Blackmailed For Allegedly Putting UCTH Funds In MMM\u2014 Prof. Agan, CMD \nI Was Blackmailed For Allegedly Putting UCTH Funds In MMM\u2014 Prof. Agan, CMD \nI Was Blackmailed For Allegedly Putting UCTH Funds In MMM\u2014 Prof. Agan, CMD \nI Was Blackmailed For Allegedly Putting UCTH Funds In MMM\u2014 Prof. Agan, CMD \nI Was Blackmailed For Allegedly Putting UCTH Funds In MMM\u2014 Prof. Agan, CMD \n I Was Blackmailed For Allegedly Putting UCTH Funds In MMM\u2014 Prof. Agan, CMD  I Was Blackmailed For Allegedly Putting UCTH Funds In MMM\u2014 Prof. Agan, CMD","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":""},"topics":[{"name":"Nigeria news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Sponsorship news","group":"Business"}],"title":"I was blackmailed for allegedly putting UCTH funds in MMM\u2014 Prof. Agan, CMD","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Western Africa","countryCode":"NG","country":"Nigeria"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Ondo State News Online","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"608959245","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Ondo State News Online","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://ondostatenews.online"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.vanguardngr.com/2017/01/blackmailed-allegedly-putting-ucth-funds-mmm-prof-agan-cmd/","http://www.vanguardngr.com/"],"sequenceId":"695193831941","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:37Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:11:14Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://d19lga30codh7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Pro-Thomas-Agan.png"}],"video":[]}}

What do you have to say about that? \n \nIgbo President is possible in 2019 but not through APC or PDP. APC will like President Buhari to continue for second term and PDP has zoned the presidency to the North. The only chance for the Igbo is to form a formidable political party together with other notable Nigerians which will present an Igbo man as their presidential candidate. \n \nWith hard work and good reason presented to other Nigerians, it will work. Nigerians are changing everyday by day with their thinking cap, and sure that ordinary Nigerians will not continue to support marginalisation. Obasanjo\u2019s support for the Igbos is highly welcomed but for now you can see that he is no more in power to make it happen, it is left for the Igbos to work hard towards that direction. Lastly, the better option for all Nigerians is for Buhari to implement the 2014 National Conference recommendations for equitable Nigeria. \n \nSome Igbo called for support for Gen Muhammadu Buhari (rtd) during his campaign and they said it was for the good of the Igbos. Do you think that the government of Buhari will benefit the Igbos? \n \nI am aware that some individuals in the South East called for Igbo support for Buhari prior to the 2015 elections. There was even a blame game against the Igbos for putting their eggs in one basket. It is too early to judge Buhari or know his mindset on Igbos, however time will tell. President Jonathan lost the election and Igbos feel bad but we lost nothing because we gained the brotherhood of the South South. When Emeka Odumegwu Ojukwu was alive, he visited the Alafin of Oyo and the Ooni of Ife to extend hand shake across the Niger. \n \nHis action was misunderstood, but he explained that if there was an understanding between the South East and South West, it was the beginning of political wisdom. He also explained that the personalities he went to visit in the West were the greater authorities he had to meet to forge a political understanding. However after the Igbos had tried in the First Republic and other periods in the political history of Nigeria, they had a change of mind. \n \nThe Igbos reasoned they had supported the North and the West in the past, and that partnership failed. The Igbos even reasoned that since Ojukwu\u2019s idea of a handshake across the Niger did not work, a new political partnership was necessary. More recently, the South South, South East and South West Assembly was formed aimed at securing support from these zones for Jonathan and also in case an Igbo man decides to contest the presidential election in future. \n \nMeetings were held in Enugu, Asaba and some other places. Ekwueme, Chief ABC Nwosu, Chief Chukwuemeka Ezeife and a host of others attended some of the meetings. Also Ohanaeze Ndigbo\u2019s call for support for Goodluck Jonathan was done after wide consultations from traditional rulers and important personalities. However we will still enter into political understanding with the Middle Belt and the North after wide discussions. \nCalista Nkiru Adimachukwu \n \nWe will let everyone know the reasons while the South East will vie for president and expect wide support from other zones. Nevertheless, after we try all these things and they fail, the solution lies in the implementation of the report of the 2014 National Confab. If there is any Igbo personality that is begging for recognition and position from the government of Buhari, that person is insulting the Igbos. What we expect from those people is for them to tell Gen. Mohammadu Buhari point blank to implement the reports of the National Constitutional Conference of 2014. \n \nYou have emphasized the report of the National Conference. Do you think it remains the solution to the agitations of the Igbos? \n \nBefore the National Conference, slots were given to political parties. However APC did not send representatives and they made no contributions. All the geo-political zones sent delegates and appreciated that conference as well as saw its relevance. They finally came out with a masterpiece and powerful document on how Nigeria can live together peacefully. Till now, APC has said nothing about that constitutional conference and it remains suspicious. So if any person starts asking questions about the reasons the Igbos supported President Goodluck Jonathan, that person is not a student of history. Ndigbo supported Jonathan mainly because of that conference. Therefore any Igbo personality that meets Buhari should urge him to implement the report of the National Conference for equitable Nigeria. When the dust settles down, Ohanaeze Ndigbo will go and meet Buhari with a powerful delegation to discuss a way forward and also about the report of the National Conference. \n \nDo Igbos have any regret? \n \nYes, the Igbos have three regrets. The first is the non-implementation of the Aburi Accord. The second is that the Igbos have not gotten any meaningful gain after their foremost contributions to Nigeria\u2019s independence. The third regret is that the East and West delayed Nigeria\u2019s independence for the North to meet up with the pace of independence. It was because of this that Whitehall imposed federalism on Nigeria. Sadly, our sacrifice is not appreciated. \n \nWhat are Ohanaeze Ndigbo doing on this ongoing IPOB crisis. (Struggle for Biafra)? \n \nFirst of all, I would like to draw you back to my interview in Vanguard newspaper on may 24, 2015 with the headline \u201cIgbos case on National Conference report for Buhari\u201d \u2014 Ohanaeze National Women Leader. Our regrets as a region in Nigeria\u201d. \n \nI granted that interview before President Buhari was sworn in on may 29, 2015. My reason for granting that interview was for him to know the position of Ndigbo for equitable Union government. \n \nWhen he assumed office and started making appointments. He was supposed to treat all Nigerians fairly according to the oath of office he took, so when he started making lopsided appointments, sidetracking one of the major bloc that contributed more than any region in Nigeria to give Nigeria the fastest independence. That was what provoked the youths to agitate for Biafra, because they feel that they don\u2019t have any future in one Nigeria. I am again pleading to Mr President as a mother to immediately start the process of implementing the 2014 national conference report for equitable Nigeria, where everyone would have a sense of belonging without fear or favour. I also use this opportunity to plead with Mr President to grant Nnamdi Kanu unconditional release because he has done nothing to warrant his continuous incarceration. I am urging Vanguard newspaper to republish my may 24,2015 interview for Nigerian\u2019s perusal because it is still in tune with current reality. \n \nWhat do you think/comment on this Patience Jonathan\u2019s issue with EFCC? \n \nI am not against President Buhari\u2019s war against corruption through EFCC but first of all the war should be fought with sincerity in all ramifications. \n \nIf left to me to advise, the president should start the anti-corruption crusade from members of his party to prove to the world that he is sincere in what he is doing, not only fighting the opposition. In my own humble opinion it is a clear cut agenda to bulldoze the opposition. \n \nAs for Jonathan\u2019s wife, I am not against the EFCC probing her but they should beam their search lights to former first ladies from Northern Nigeria extraction to prove to the world that they are not just out to fight Jonathan\u2019s family who made sure that there was a peaceful transition to the present administration which was acclaimed world wide. \n \nWhat is your view on current recession under the watch of the APC leading government? \n \nWhen APC as a political party were campaigning to be voted into power, they knew very well that Nigeria economy had a problem, so they came up with the change agenda, that if voted into power they would restore the economy, that was the reason Nigerians voted for them. \n \nWhen they assumed office they started blame game and that blame game has continued till today, pretending they didn\u2019t know there was a problem before they took office, instead of doing the needful of restoring the economy. Based on that, foreign investors started pulling out their money back to their country and that is why we are in this present recession. But all hope is not lost because Nigeria have potentials to be great again even more than before within 10 years. \n \nI could remember that after the Nagasaki and Hiroshima atomic bombing of second world War in Japan, they cut themselves out of the world for 20 years and looked inwardly on how to bounce back. Look at their economic position in the world affairs now. Nigeria\u2019s case is a matter of 10 years, that is why I am pleading to Mr President to do the needful so that we can have the \n \nconducive environment to move the Nigeria economy forward. \n \nYour take on Yoruba supporting secret trial for Nnamdi Kanu? \n \nThe Yoruba\u2019s are intelligent people. I do not think that it is the collective decision of the Yoruba\u2019s to back the secret trial of Nnamdi Kanu. So it is only the personal opinion of the individual saying it. \n \nWhat do you have to say concerning the capture of Sambisa forest by the Nigeria military? \n \nOur president Muhammadu Buhari should be congratulated for that. But the Federal Government has to do more to ensure that the Chibok girls are rescued and Shekau captured. \n \nOn Ibori\u2019s release from UK prison? \n \nWhat do you want me to say on that. The london court has released him, so he should enjoy his freedom. \n \n2017 FG budget as it concerns Ndigbo? \n \nWe have our representatives in the Senate and House of Representatives. It is their duty to scrutinize the budget and highlight if it is favourable to us or not. If it is not favourable to Igbos, it is also their duty to find a remedy. That is one of the reasons we voted them there. \n \nThe post appeared first on Vanguard News . \n \nOriginal Article \n \nIgbo Presidency: Don\u2019t Rely On Obasanjo\u2019s Support- Adimachukwu, Ohanaeze Women Leader \nIgbo Presidency: Don\u2019t Rely On Obasanjo\u2019s Support- Adimachukwu, Ohanaeze Women Leader \nIgbo Presidency: Don\u2019t Rely On Obasanjo\u2019s Support- Adimachukwu, Ohanaeze Women Leader \nIgbo Presidency: Don\u2019t Rely On Obasanjo\u2019s Support- Adimachukwu, Ohanaeze Women Leader \nIgbo Presidency: Don\u2019t Rely On Obasanjo\u2019s Support- Adimachukwu, Ohanaeze Women Leader \n Igbo Presidency: Don\u2019t Rely On Obasanjo\u2019s Support- Adimachukwu, Ohanaeze Women Leader  Igbo Presidency: Don\u2019t Rely On Obasanjo\u2019s Support- Adimachukwu, Ohanaeze Women Leader","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":""},"topics":[{"name":"Nigeria news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Africa news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Igbo presidency: Don\u2019t rely on Obasanjo\u2019s support- Adimachukwu, Ohanaeze women leader","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Western Africa","countryCode":"NG","country":"Nigeria"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Ondo State News Online","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"608959245","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Ondo State News Online","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://ondostatenews.online"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.vanguardngr.com/2017/01/igbo-presidency-dont-rely-obasanjos-support-adimachukwu-ohanaeze-women-leader/","http://www.vanguardngr.com/"],"sequenceId":"695193833209","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:35Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:11:14Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Adimachukwu-Ohanaeze.png"}],"video":[]}}

It is commonly caused by anxiety. It is a strange way indeed, but it is perhaps one of the most common ways that both children and adults do when they feel tension. \n \nMany have the urge to stop this habit, but it is just something that we cannot completely get rid of especially that this usually happens unknowingly when your mind is puzzled by anxiety. It is not entirely clear why nail biting occurs but it\u2019s considered an impulse control problem as well as a habit. Some people believe that most likely nail biting is instinctual, left over from our time as primates, and that when we\u2019re stressed these instincts come out against our will. Biting your nails is just one of many habits that the body seems to do when it\u2019s stressed. Some people pick at skin, while others pull out hair (this is known as trichotillomania). Different effects to different people. \n  \nEffect of Nail biting \n  \nHow to Control Nail Biting \n \nThere are two ways on how to stop this. If this has become a habit, then the cure would be to cut the habit. You may not be able to stop it overnight but at least cut it gradually. If this is the way how you react when experiencing anxiety, then the cure would be being aware and control your anxiety. In this case, if you are aware that you are stressed, keep in mind that you have a target to do which getting rid of nail biting. You can do this by avoiding to touch any part of your face when stressed. \n \nHere are a couple of ways to stop biting your nails: \n \n1.) Place a Nail Polish On Your Nails \n \nNail polish has a distinct taste where it will stop you from biting your nails. Yes, I heard this question. What if you\u2019re a guy? There are clear nail polishes that you can use. Don\u2019t worry, you\u2019re only doing this while the nail habit is still there. Stop doing it when you\u2019re confident enough that you can control it. \n  \nRed Nail Polish \n  \n2.) Replacement Habit \n \nLeave a stress ball in your table. In this case, when you are stressed, keep pumping the stress ball in order to keep your hand busy and avoid putting your fingers in your mouth. Not only that stress ball helps with nail biting, it also releases stress by pumping it. \n  \nStress Ball In Hand \n  \n3.) Share Your Plan to Your Family / Friends \n \nLet you family and friends about your plan of getting rid of nail biting so the moment they see you doing that, they will act as your police in committing this nail crime. \n  \nHaring To Family And Friends \n  \n4.) Set Reminders \n \nOf course, if you\u2019re often reminded of something then there would be lesser chance that you\u2019ll forget it. Place reminders, on your computers, tables, car, or phones to remind you to stop nail biting. For instance, set you phone and computer wall paper with something that symbolizes nail biting. \n  \nReminder \n  \n5.) Give Your Mouth a Work When Stressed \n \nNail biting often happens when we are stressed and we\u2019re unknowingly doing it to our surprise. Chew a gum whenever you feel stressed. You wouldn\u2019t be able to chew a gum while biting your nails. \n  \nChew A Gum \n  \nHope our advices helps!","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":""},"topics":[],"title":"Nail Biting: Causes and How To Stop","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Western Asia","countryCode":"AE","country":"United Arab Emirates"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Emaratiya","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"498653193","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Emaratiya","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Lifestyle"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://emaratiya.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695193833992","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:31:10Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:11:15Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://emaratiya.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Stress-In-Hand-300x197.jpg"},{"url":"http://emaratiya.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Nail-biting-300x199.jpg"},{"url":"http://emaratiya.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Red-Nail-Polish-300x169.jpg"},{"url":"http://emaratiya.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Haring-To-Family-And-Friends-300x199.jpg"},{"url":"http://emaratiya.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Chew-A-Gum-300x169.jpg"},{"url":"http://emaratiya.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Reminder-300x300.jpg"},{"url":"http://emaratiya.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Nail-Biting-Cover-300x150.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

The Aussies think it's great because it's a win win for them.\"\n\nCahill said there was little compassion in the Australian policy, which sent back everyone no matter what their offence.\n\n\"It might be one thing when you've got someone that has committed an armed robbery sitting in jail. It's different when you've got someone who has lived their whole life there and been convicted of a relatively minor offence.\"\n\nTony Touri, 48, landed in Christchurch before Christmas, after stints in jail and an Australian immigration detention centre.\n\nHe left behind his family, a $2000-a-week job and the kickboxing club where he helped train youth.\n\nTouri saw Christchurch as a fresh start with labouring opportunities and a place free from old North Island gang connections.\n\n\"It turned my life upside down. When I arrived here, I felt like an alien.\"\n\nCahill said it had been well proven through released prisoners, that if supports were not in place, the risk of reoffending was greater.\n\n\"These people are sort of similar but there isn't the same support available to follow up with them all the time, so it doesn't surprise me we're getting that 30 per cent reoffending,\" he said.\n\nThe Canterbury branch of Pars has found growing demand for their support service.\n\n\"We could have one in a month.

This institution is that special place where the best talent in the military may engage in fertile intellectual exchange with some of the brightest in our civilian institutions and from other nations. The laymen often mistakenly view the military as an inflexible, often unthinking collective. This is a distorted view of the military. \n \nSome of the best minds in our nation are found in the military. No military can be successful over the long-term unless it has the intellectual agility to adopt its doctrines and practices to the challenges of a dynamic and chaotic world as we have today. Like any large organization, a military overly resistant to change will find itself on the wrong end of history. It will not answer the questions an incessantly changing environment places before it. \n \nThe Nigerian military was established to respond to challenges resident in Third Generation or Trinitarian Warfare. The genesis of standard military philosophy can be traced to the works of classical and neo-classical theorists and practitioners such as Sun Tzu, Jomini (Joe-me-knee), Clausewitz (Clau sah vits), Alfred Mahan, Giulio Douhet (Do-hay), JFC Fuller and Basil Liddell Hart. \n \nToday, much of the world\u2019s military challenges have little to do with the confrontation of standing army against standing army. You now must adapt your concepts and your very institution to Fourth Generation or Non-trinitarian Warfare. Here, you deal with the intersection of ideology, politics and highly weaponized non-state actors whose membership, tactics and aims are fluid and inconstant. \n \nIn the space of the last ten years, the Nigerian military has had to face violent militants in the tropical Niger Delta, then turn to battle wicked Boko Haram in the Sahelian Northern Nigeria. The principles of Jomini and Clausewitz have to be materially reinterpreted to apply to these battles. Yet these conflicts are of a different nature than what these 19th century thinkers encountered, but these modern conflicts are as brutal, and strategically important to the state as traditional warfare. This modern version is even more difficult to master and to win due to the fluid, almost clandestine nature of the adversary. Today, you battle not against standing armies; but against vanishing ghosts. \n \nI commend the Nigerian military for what it has achieved against Boko Haram. You have battled and bested this evil enterprise. This vile force has been reduced to where it no longer poses a strategic threat. You have done as well as a military can in putting down this amorphous danger. The nation thanks you. I must say here, however, that we cannot lower our guard. \n \nWe have learned cardinal lessons from the Boko Haram crisis. First, we must govern justly and for the benefit of the people to prevent the recurrence of violent extremism in the future. \n \nWidespread poverty caused by an unjust allocation of income, wealth and resources provides fertile ground for extremist ideologies, that run contrary to the inclusive democracy we seek to perfect. \n \nProtracted years of gross mis-governance are a down payment on the rise of extremism. \n \nSecond, the armed forces may contain violent outbreaks but they cannot fully resolve strife originating from a nation\u2019s political and social imbalances. Some type of political resolution is needed. \n \nThe military is hamstrung because it must restrain operations in order to protect the civilian population, which is the prime duty of the military. A paradox of fourth generation warfare becomes apparent. The duty to protect the state is rendered more complex because of the restraint that must be exercised in combating domestic insurgencies. However, engaging in less discrete operations may be easier done but this always proves counterproductive in the end because of the risk of alienating the local population. \n \nThird, the longer an unfair political economic situation goes unattended, the more extreme become the views of the disaffected. The more difficult a political situation becomes, once the situation degrades into violent insurgency. There is little room to find a political solution and almost no mutual trust to attempt to locate that finite space. As a result, the nation is compelled to resort to force, to resolve non-military contradictions. This means the more the military has to expend itself in a contest of diminishing military returns. The more time that passes, the more the military is degraded. A conventional military is not structured to be on perpetual war footing. More resources have to be spent to prevent the military from diminishing its current state of readiness. \n \nThe insurgency becomes institutionalized with each passing year. Insurgent ideology gives way to institutional inertia. Insurgency becomes something its members do simply because they have been doing it. It is no longer a means to an end; the insurgency becomes the end in itself. \n \nEnough of my layman\u2019s attempt at military theorizing for the moment. Yet, what I have said underscores a crucial point. The civilian and military worlds do not occupy distinct universes. They are but different points along the spectrum of collective human endeavor. For a nation at our stage of evolution, any politician who cares about internal security must be somewhat versed in military concepts and strategy. Any military officer who cares about the future progress of the nation must be conversant with the different political and economic themes contesting to govern the moment. \n \nI was asked to speak about Strategic Leadership: My Experiences. I shall do so. But, since I am not in uniform, permit me a touch of insubordination. I have slightly amended my message to be \u201cStrategic Leadership: My Personal Theory and Practice.\u201d \n \nMY THEORY OF STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP \n \nExcellent strategic political leadership is based on commitment to a political vision. A leader must have a coherent objective in mind. Strategy and tactics are then fashioned to work toward that vision. \n \nThis is an essential consideration. There cannot be strategic leadership without a conscious objective. Political leadership in Nigeria generally has fallen short in this regard. Leadership has been short-sighted and fixed on narrow, immediate objectives. Because of this, leadership has been more transactional than strategic in nature. It has been more focused on the retention of power and control than on the substantive results and long-term consequences of its policies and actions. \nAPC leader, Bola Tinubu \n \nThis state of affairs results in a cruel paradox. Fixation on the details of numerous transactions produces a mirage of control and order over every event and episode. However, when all the pieces are brought together, they give a picture of disorder and even chaos. Excessive control over individual parts comes at the sacrifice of harmony of the whole. The parts do not fit well together because they were not created as a unified whole. \n \nThings become as confusing as a labyrinth, with many entrances but no exits. It is as if we take 20 authors asking each to write a separate chapter of a book, without coordinating with each other. In this way, we protect ourselves from the writers plotting against us. While that objective is achieved, there is little chance that the book will be a coherent tale when we tack the chapters together. Each section will be fine in isolation. When read together, they constitute nothing more than literary confusion, intelligent babble. The totality of the work becomes less than the sum of its parts. So much energy expended towards almost no discernible purpose, except to control the process no matter how dysfunctional the outcome. \n \nThis is the bane of our political economy. We have so much talent in the nation but it has not been engaged and engineered to function in unison. Fiscal policy does not mesh with monetary policy. Trade policy undermined industrial policy, thus ease of doing business is inhibited. Overseas peacekeeping missions do not always harmonize with core foreign policy interests. \n \nNo national system is perfect. In each, exist some contradictions. This is but evidence of the imperfection of human nature itself. However, a nation in progress seeks to minimize, not harvest additional contradictions, otherwise its leadership strategy is doomed to fail. \n \nThese dilemmas arise in governance because there is no accepted overarching vision or strategy to achieve that vision. In the absence of these essentials that give definition to inputs and outcomes, coherence gives way to happenstance. Unaided by a greater purpose, governance and its institutions become ends in themselves. Their primary aim will be to exist, not to achieve. Leaders likewise become imbued with the same blindness. They occupy power because power needs to be occupied. \n \nI was fortunate to recognize early in my political life that a true political leader distinguishes himself by marrying principled vision with practical strategy. In combination, these things show you the way home and how to get there. Just as importantly, they help you determine what not to do or where to avoid as a good compass keeps you from going south when your destination lies north. \n \nDeveloping vision and strategy are easily said but hard to attain. Thought, diligent planning and constant reflection are needed. \n \nPresident Dwight Eisenhower once said: \u201cIn preparing for battle, I have always found plans are useless but planning is indispensable.\u201d The deeper meaning of this statement is priceless. \n \nYou may set forth intelligently crafted plans. Once the complex enterprise begins, war or politics, unforeseen events and untold chance stirs the dust and changes things so quickly that the strict letter of our plans loses utility. \n \nAny general or leader who stubbornly adheres to preconceived notions has written his own tombstone: here lies a leader who defeated himself. \n \nNo matter the beauty of your intellectual constructs, they cannot subdue reality; they must adapt to it. The plan can be a prison but the planning is essential. It conditions the mind to keep an eye on the objective so that you may adapt to changing conditions without losing sight of the prize. \n \nAt this juncture, I am reminded of the tale of a farmer and his son. The farmer\u2019s corn fields were plagued by ravening birds. Saving the harvest clearly became his objective. His strategy was to have his son gather stones, early every day, then toss them at the crows to scare them off. This went on daily for several months. \n \nOne day, the crows did not come. The boy spotted the birds in the adjacent fields of his father\u2019s worst enemy. Conditioned to bothering the crows, the boy hauled rocks to the other man\u2019s field so that he may pelt the crows. While the boy was gone, wild pigs came and trampled the much of the cornstalks. \n \nThe father spotted the boy and scream for him to come home. The boy came running. The father asked why was he being so disobedient. The boy was perplexed, saying you wanted me to chase the crows away. \n \nThe father answered: \u201cNo.\u201d I wanted you to protect our corn. While here, the birds were our enemy. Not here, they are just birds. When they are in that man\u2019s field, they are even my friends. \n \n\u201cMy son, you forgot the purpose of what you were doing. So you set yourself elsewhere and left the field unattended to bother birds that were doing us no harm. By your mistake, you just undid all the toil of these months and you put the harvest at risk.\u201d \n \nMy constant vision has been the transformation of this nation into a robust decentralized democracy with a diverse industrial base, to provide sufficient jobs to a growing urban population; and a sufficient agricultural base, to achieve food security and provide a decent livelihood to the rural population. \n \nWe have made some progress toward this vision. But we have a long way to go. I want to sketch out the journey thus far and offer my thoughts on how the future might unfold. \n \nSTRATEGIC LEADERSHIP  IN PRACTICE \n \nWHERE HAVE WE BEEN? \n \nDuring the 1980\u2019s and 1990\u2019s, a progressive politician like me was at extreme odds with the military. This opposition was not against the military as the military. It was against military governance. Military governance was diametrically opposed to the democratic Nigeria I envisioned. \n \nThe permanent aim was to attain democratic governance. During this period, the strategic objective had to be the exit of the military from power. Tactics would be devised to meet the moment. The tactics ranged from cooperation with the military during the SDP/NRC aborted transition to outright protests at home and seeking international condemnation of the succeeding military regime when it sought to perpetuate itself in power. \n \nWhen that regime became increasingly brutal, tactics changed. Some of us were arrested and detained; some of us went into exile. We could not contest muscle for muscle against the regime. Instead, we engineered a strategic retreat to be outside the regime\u2019s strong reach. From this distance, we still did an effective job canvassing the nation and international community to support democracy and freedom. Our words were akin to long range artillery or air power. The military controlled the ground but we held supremacy in the air waves. We were winning the battle for the hearts and minds of people. \n \nPlease take note here. My opposition was based on the fact that the hierarchical and centralized command inherent to military institutions was ill suited for democratic governance. While individual military officers may transform into successful democratic leaders, the institution as a whole constituted a brake on democracy. \n \nWe worked to ease the military from the political arena. There would be no recrimination or backlash against the institution. Once the military was out of politics, my opposition to the military ended. \n \nOthers in the pro-democracy struggle embraced a more hardline position. Some wanted the military to be put in the docks. They wanted to weaken it as national institution. In my estimation, they gave more weight to temporary strategy than the overall objective. \n \nThey had fought against military rule so long that they came to believe the goal was to defeat the military. No. The deeper truth was the return to democratic governance. Ending institutional military control of politics was merely the way to reach that end. \n \nFortunately, our less combative approach won the day. The military exited governance but was not persecuted. It returned to being the strong unifying national institution it has always been. \n \nImagine if those who advocated a punitive approach had won the day. The military would have been greatly weakened. Such a broken outfit would not have summoned the leadership and dedication necessary to tackle both the Niger Delta militancy and Boko Haram\u2019s terror. \n \nThis is an important lesson. Narrow focus and the unwitting conflation of strategy with ultimate objective can be dangerous in the affairs of a nation. \n \nCivilian Rule Came. I was elected governor of Lagos in the AD (Alliance for Democracy), which came to be the pre-eminent party in the Southwest. The PDP controlled the federal government and most states. Quickly, it revealed itself to be a party of authoritarian excess. It boasted it would rule the country for 60 years. Just as quickly I came to the realization that continuation of PDP national leadership might be the death knell of my dream of a democratic Nigeria. As a democrat, I understood equal competition meant that my party could lose a free and fair elections. I was and remain ready to take a fair loss. Yet, I was and remain unprepared to see victory stolen from the rightful winner and to see any party install itself in near perpetuity, notwithstanding the expressed will of the people. \n \nMy strategic goal became the defeat of the PDP at the national level during this period. When the 2003 election came, the PDP dangled an alliance before the AD. The proposal was that if we supported the PDP at the presidential level the PDP would not oppose us at the state level. Because of my strategic perspective and the previous legal confrontations I had with the federal government due to its overreach, I rejected the proposal. It sounded too easy to be good. Sadly, some of my colleagues lost sight of the long-term objective; they were enticed to chase after short-term promises. Those promises were hollow. My friends chased themselves into a corner. Their non-opposition to the PDP at the presidential level would be repaid with deception. The PDP outflanked them in the gubernatorial race. \n \nLagos was to be the only state with an AD governor. From this setback and crippled position, we began the long journey that would reduce the PDP\u2019s boast of ruling for 60 years to just 16. \n \nWHERE WE ARE NOW \n \nLeading into the 2015 election season, progressive politicians throughout Nigeria and across party lines recognized the nation was in deep trouble. Corruption was rampant. The Boko Haram menace growing. The economy was unbalanced and government policy was not providing the right growth catalysts despite favorable oil prices. PDP governance had overstayed its welcome. The people were ready for change. And we must develop the strategic leadership and determination to achieve the change. \n \nStanding as separate parties, we could not best the PDP. We had tried that path; it led to defeat in 2011. A strategic rethink was needed. \n \nTo attain the goal of ousting the PDP and placing Nigeria on the road to progressive governance, the strategic linchpin would be the merger of opposition parties. \n \nTime is inadequate to recount the complex journey toward the merger. My firm position was that only a merger would work. Anything short of that would disintegrate due to a combination of PDP enticement and the internal pressures arising from the strong identification of many politicians with their legacy parties. An ad-hoc alliance would be put asunder by these factors. \n \nOur push for a merger of the old parties into a new entity carried the day. We would join hands to form a collective identity. The CPC and my party, ACN, ANPP a long with progressive elements of the APGA formed the party. Key elements of the PDP would later join. For this amalgamation to work, it had to be more than an anti-PDP gathering. It had to present a genuine, positive message that spoke to people\u2019s hopes and aspirations. \n \nWe developed the theme of change as our strategic message. The broom became an apt party symbol. We would sweep out the old, sweep in the new and work hard towards prosperity for our country. \n \nWe fashioned a tripartite campaign message and strategy message. Security, Economy and Corruption. We would drive these three messages home as if with military artillery. However, we have only our leadership and strategic hammer. \n \nStill all of this would have been to no avail without the right candidate. Given his stature and reputation for integrity, honest dealing and patriotic commitment, there really was no other candidate to have carried the day, than then General Muhammadu Buhari. \n \nYet, even with such a figure as our candidate, we foresaw the need to construct a public relations strategy to counter false accusations of religious intolerance and parochialism that would be hurled at him. We did this with great success because we prepared for these attacks beforehand. \n \nWe established other democratic and leadership strategies for our success, details of which time would not permit me to reveal here. We did not have the vast war chest of the PDP. Our efforts had to be sharper and more compelling. We accomplished this task. \n \nWe did not win the election by accident. I had studied the resulting and voting patterns of all the prior elections since 1999. Our team did an honest assessment and detailed assessment of our strengths and weaknesses and those of our opponents. \n \nTo win, we knew the votes we needed and identified the likely places and demographic constituencies from which the bulk of those votes must come. We did not waste time chasing votes we would not get. We concentrated on our strengths and the other side\u2019s weaknesses, realising that our defence must be as tight as if we are inside the War College here in Abuja. \n \nThe other factor is one that is little spoken of. Our early insistence on biometric voter registration and the use of the card reader on voting day were of strategic importance as it is essential to safeguarding the integrity of the electoral process. In past elections, PDP vote padding had been massive in certain areas. We had to curtail this malpractice to achieve the objective of making the election as fair as possible, allowing us a chance to win. \n \nThe card reader minimized the rigger\u2019s ability to steal the election. Before its use, results could be written without regard to the number of actual people who cast ballots. In a polling booth where 50 people actually showed up to vote, the rigger could falsify figures and claim that 500 votes were cast. With the card reader, the rigger could steal no more than 50 votes. The tallies could not be inflated beyond the number of actual voters. \n \nUpon these strategic pillars, we built historic victory. For the first time in the nation\u2019s history, incumbent president and party lost the national election. This historic transition further cemented our democratic evolving tradition and structures, advancing us closer to the overarching vision that guides my political actions. \n \nCompleting a personal transition, General Buhari would become President Buhari. And former President Goodluck Jonathan would become a stateman, winning worldwide commendation for conceding defeat, even before the final results were announced. \n \nWHERE WE ARE GOING \n \nIn relative short order, the Buhari administration has done what the prior government seem unable to do. With the courage and dedication of the military, Boko Haram has been subdued. Also, notable and significant progress is being made against corruption. Press freedoms and civil liberties are protected, putting to lie those who cried that President Buhari would not respect democracy and rule of law. \n \nTo move closer to the overarching vision I outlined, we now have to shift primary focus to the economic front. \n \nThe decline of high oil prices threatens to be a long-term phenomenon. It placed the nation in recession last year and revealed the structural weaknesses of our national economy. \n \nStrategic objectives during this period of economic uncertainty must be to re-engineer the economy bottom up, diversify the economic base, strengthen our industrial base, modernize infrastructure, enhance agriculture, and provide employment. And of course, ease of doing business must not be overlooked in order to attract foreign investment. \n \nThe lower oil prices also reduced hard currency earnings. This undermined the naira, causing a steep rise in the cost of imports. The higher prices have suppressed aggregate demand, causing a decline in business activity. \n \nThe challenge before us is a difficult but not impossible one. If we stick to the progressive beliefs of the APC, we shall overcome these difficulties to place the economy on surer permanent footing. \n \nGovernment has shown its commitment to these ideals via its budget for this year and by the strong help it is giving state governments to meet their budgetary requirements. The unprecedented stipend program for the poorest highlights the government\u2019s concern for those who have been left unattended by the dynamics of the marketplace. \n \nAchieve the desired economic restructuring will require a change in economic mindset and strategy. We must avoid the nostrums of mainstream orthodoxy that say government deficits are always bad. In the situation we face, deficit spending is essential to bolster aggregate demand and direct funds to projects that build infrastructure and bolster employment. \n \nWe must better harmonize monetary policy with fiscal policy. It undercuts our goals if monetary policy is unduly tight at a time fiscal policy begets deficit spending. \n \nWe must also realign trade policy with our need to create a meaningful industrial base and more potent agricultural sector. We can no longer allow cheap imports to preclude the development of industries and sectors strategic to our enduring economic future. \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nMy public life spans over three decades.

Mr Modi comes here (to Punjab) and says he is against corruption and is fighting against corruption.\" And on the other, Punjab remains the most corrupt state under the Badals, said the Congress vice-president. \n\n\"In India, maximum corruption takes place in one state. And if there is any symbol of this corruption, it is Sukhbir Singh Badal,\" Mr Gandhi said launching a sharp attack Punjab CM Prakash Singh Badal's son. \n\nHe went on to say that the ruling Badals had \"plundered\" the state for their own interests. \"They have ruined the state by controlling everything here. The youth is unemployed while the industry is in shambles.\" \n\nHe promised that if the Congress forms the government in Punjab, then the regime led by Amarinder Singh, will bring a tough law to tackle the drug problem. \n\nRahul also said that Congress has always stood for and will always stand for the welfare of the poor, downtrodden, Dalits, small farmers, labourers and other weaker sections and appealed to the public to give the party a chance to serve them in Punjab. \n\nHe also talked about the problems faced by the common people in the wake of demonetisation. \n\nNotably, Jalalabad Assembly constituency is witnessing a high-profile contest this time, with two MP of rival parties throwing their hat in the ring to take on Sukhbir Badal. While Congress has fielded its Ludhiana MP Ravneet Singh Bittu to take on Sukhbir Badal, AAP has fielded its Sangrur MP Bhagwant Mann from the seat. \n\nMr Gandhi began his Punjab tour yesterday by addressing a rally at Majitha, from where Cabinet Minister and Punjab Deputy CM Sukhbir Badal's brother-in-law, Bikram Singh Majithia is seeking re-election for third term. Apart from the Badals and PM Modi, he also took potshots at Aam Aadmi Party's Arvind Kejriwal. Referring to the Delhi Chief Minister, Mr Gandhi said \"Punjab goes not need a \"dictator\".","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Indian subcontinent news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Afghanistan news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Punjab elections 2017: Rahul Gandhi calls Badal 'corrupt', attacks PM Modi","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Udayavani","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169732468","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Udayavani","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.udayavani.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695193835105","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:11:16Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Timmons took a young team that had struggled the year before and helped shape them into winners, as the Sandies had to go a full three games to win each of their first four playoff series, then swept Midland Lee in the regional finals to make the state tournament. Although Amarillo High lost to San Antonio Johnson 2-1 in the state semifinals, it concluded the school\u2019s most successful season in over six decades, and with several players coming back, a return trip is possible, especially since the Sandies have dropped to Class 5A. \n \nQuotable: \u201cI\u2019ve said a lot about these young men in our program and they all competed well and expected something of themselves,\u201d Timmons said. \u201cDuring the course of the season the kids played well togetyher and the end result was an incredible year. Really, it was all about the kids and not about the coaches.\u201d \n \n\u2014 Lee Passmore \n \nBasketball \n \nSteve Jackson, head boys basketball coach, Tascosa \n \nWhy Honored: Jackson, a Tascosa graduate who also played at West Texas A&M, led his alma mater to one of its best seasons in school history in 2016. The Rebels set a school record by winning their first 31 games of the season and easily rolling to the District 2-6A championship and a No. 3 state ranking. Tascosa reached the regional quarterfinals for the first time since 1994, as Quinn Taylor and Darreus Brown combined to score almost a 40 points a game. Jackson also worked in several role players who contributed to the historic season as the Rebels played almost four months straight before finally losing a game. \n \nQuotable: \u201cIt\u2019s a testament to the kids and the coaches on the staff,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cI don\u2019t win this award if the kids don\u2019t give it their all. The biggest pride I take in it is how the community all got together behind us.\u201d \n \n\u2014 Lee Passmore \n \nCross Country \n \nRebekah James, head girls cross country coach, Randall \n \nWhy Honored: James is the first-ever cross country coach honored with cross country added this year to the list of yearly sports honored by the Panhandle Sports Hall of Fame. And what a year James had leading Randall High to the Texas UIL Class 5A state girls cross country title. Randall used a \u201cpack\u201d running philosophy and the strategy paid off with the Lady Raiders beating Prosper by four points (68 to 72). Leading the way for Randall were senior leader Karyss Betzen in 11th place overall at state, sophomore Daphne Pate in 12th place overall and freshman Hanna Moreno in 13th place. \n \nQuotable: \u201cI\u2019m pleased to the Panhandle Sports hall of fame finally honor cross country as a sport,\u201d James said. \u201cThere have been so many deserving coaches before and I hope to represent all of those coaches with this great honor. I think we were picked to finish third at state but the girls ran the race we planned starting out behind Prosper and passing them on the third mile. Karyss is so competitive and was our leader. She would do anything for our the team over individual accomplishments.\u201d \n \n- Lance Lahnert \n \nFootball \n \nChris Koetting, head football coach, Canadian \n \nWhy Honored: Canadian entered the 2016 season as the two-time defending Class 2A Division I state football champions and riding 31-game winning streak. But a jump in class to 3A and the loss of several key players off those two state title teams left the Wildcats with many question marks. Canadian opened a pedestrian 1-2 losing the season opener to 4A Bushland. But when all was said and done Koetting guided the Wildcats to a 12-3 record and a state semifinal finish losing to eventual state champion Gunter. In seven seasons as the Canadian head football coach Koetting has compiled an 86-13 record. \n \nQuotable: \u201cI don\u2019t deserve this honor as its our players and our incredible assistant coaches who really do the work,\u201d Koetting said. \u201cWe did have some question marks coming but we also had four or five really good players back and I was proud of our players for not paying attention to what was being said either way about us. These guys showed up every day with good attitudes and worked hard trying to imporve. It was one of the most enjoyable years I\u2019ve had coaching and I\u2019m just as proud of this team as the last two state championship teams.\u201d \n \n- Lance Lahnert \n \nGolf \n \nBarry Stevens, head boys golf coach, Happy \n \nWhy Honored: When you are the first sport to bring home a state championship to your school, that\u2019s a big deal. That\u2019s what Stevens accomplished in guiding Happy High \u2014 with one senior on the team \u2014 to the Class 1A state boys golf championship. And this was one wasn\u2019t even close with Happy winning by 51 strokes over Douglass in the 36-hole state tournament. Happy sent the message on day one this was its year jumping out to a 22-stroke lead. Junior Mitchell Downing led the way finishing state runner-up, while junior Sterling White was third. Other team members were Zack Flatt, Trevor Phillips and Karson Bryan. \n \nQuotable: \u201cThis is a great honor because there are a lot of great coaches out there doing great things,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cI have a special bond with these guys because I was their kindergarten P.E. teacher my first year at Happy. The driving force behind it all was Mitchell who had this dream in eighth grade. They all worked hard for this for three years.\u201d \n \n- Lance Lahnert \n \nSoccer \n \nMark Smith, head girls soccer coach, Caprock \n \nWhy Honored: Smith is the Panhandle Sports Hall of Fame Soccer Coach of the Year after leading the Lady Longhorns to the 2016 District 3-5A title and to the third round of the playoffs. The Lady Longhorns finished the season 17-6-2. \n \nQuotable: \u201cIt\u2019s an honor to be nominated as the soccer Coach of the Year. I believe this award is a team achievement. The girls bought into the system that I brought and became very successful with it. I have two awesome assistant coaches (Heath McLaughlin and Abbee Jefferies) that have helped me along the way. This award is the exclamation point on an amazing season for the Caprock soccer program.\u201d \n \n\u2014 Colby Gordon \n \nSoftball \n \nKevin Blaskowski, head softball coach, West Texas A&M \n \nWhy Honored: Blaskowski led his Lady Buffs to another banner year in 2016. WT finished the season with an astounding 59-5 overall record, claiming their third straight Lone Star Conference title with a 30-2 mark. The Lady Buffs made it back to the NCAA Division II Softball College World Series for the second time in three years, finishing No. 5 in the final polls. \n \nBlaskowski earned LSC and South Central Regional Coach of the Year honors. In 11 seasons at WT, Blaskowski has built the Lady Buff softball program into a perennial power with a 424-235 mark. Over 24 total seasons as a head coach, Blaskowski is 776-512. It\u2019s Blaskowski\u2019s second time to win this award. \n \nQuotable: \u201cIt\u2019s an honor to be recognized as the Panhandle Softball Coach of the Year. The 2016 seasons was a very special year. My assistants and our student-athletes put a lot of work into being one of the best in program history. Their efforts made it possible for me to receive this honor.\u201d \n \n\u2014 Kale Steed \n \nTennis \n \nDarby Norman, head tennis coach, Randall High \n \nWhy Honored: Veteran tennis coach Norman led Randall to its best-ever finish in team tennis history reaching the finals of the Region I-5A tournament. Randall fell just short of the schools\u2019 first state tourney appearance losing to Grapevine 10-9 in a marathon regional finals. Randall was unstoppable in district going through undefeated, reached a top 10 ranking and finished the year with a 23-2 record. Norman was named the Class 5A tennis coach of the year by the UIL tennis coaches. \n \nQuotable: \u201cI told our team this is the type of season you will never forget and still be talking about 20 years from now among each other,\u201d Norman said. \u201cI enjoyed this season so much and am so proud of our players the way they trusted each other and believed in each other. It was just a special season. I appreciate this great honor but honors aren\u2019t why I do this job. This award is a testament to our kids and program.\u201d \n \n_ Lance Lahnert \n \nTrack and Field \n \nDarren Flowers, head track and field coach, West Texas A&M \n \nWhy Honored: Flowers led the WT program to new heights during the 2016 spring athletic season. The Lady Buffs track and field program won their third-consecutive Lone Star Conference indoor title. \n \nThe Lady Buffs had a historic outdoor season as they reached as high as No. 3 in the weekly USTFCCCA rankings before winning their first-ever outdoor team title and finishing fourth at the NCAA Championships. The Buffs had a historic NCAA meet finishing eighth which included Duke Kicinski winning WT\u2019s first individual national title after a huge personal-best in the discus competition. This is Flower\u2019s second time to earn this prestigious honor. \n \nQuotable: \u201cIt\u2019s a really great honor. It\u2019s great that our program is getting recognized by the community. Our athletes have put in great effrot for their success. I feel like since I\u2019ve gotten here things have gotten better. Our support from our administration and students are tremendous. It makes it easier to bring in great athletes.\u201d \n \n\u2014 Kale Steed \n \nVolleyball \n \nJaNeen Eudy, head volleyball coach, Bushland \n \nWhy Honored: Eudy led the Lady Falcons to another state title in the fall in her fifth year of leading the program. \n \nBushland finished the season an astounding 43-3, winning Class 4A, compiling a perfect district record and its three losses coming to schools in larger classifications. \n \nEudy earned Class 4A Coach of the Year honors from multiple organizations. \n \nQuotable: \u201cIt\u2019s so humbling because there\u2019s so many good coaches out there. It\u2019s kind of icing on the cake for an incredible season with an incredible group of girls. I feel like it gave a lot of legitimacy to our program. We won Class 2A in 2013, then we jumped two classes and it took two years to win Class 4. Winning state was so good for the girls, the school and the community, and such a good reward for their hard work. This honor is a nice big reward. I\u2019m so appreciative and can\u2019t thank them enough.\u201d \n \n\u2014 Colby Gordon \n \nWrestling \n \nDavid Quirino, head wrestling coach, Randall \n \nWhy Honored: Quirino guided the Randall boys to third place at the state tournament last year and had three individual state champions. \n \nQuotable: \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty neat honor. I\u2019m excited and humbled about it. You work hard as a coach, then you get that letter saying you\u2019re Panhandle Sports Hall of Fame Coach of the Year and read it three or four times before it sinks in. All the work you\u2019ve put in, it\u2019s nice to get something like that to tell you you\u2019re doing a good job. It\u2019s great to be recognized for your efforts, but it\u2019s the kids and the assistant coaches who really put in a lot of work. I\u2019m thankful. My assistant coaches are really hard workers.

He did some shoveling outside his Williston home, and then went inside to take ibuprofen for a nagging pain in his arm. \n\nHalf an hour later, the pain was gone, and Boone was celebrating the holiday with his family. \n\nBut later that night, he woke up from an early evening nap in front of the television to raging pain in his arm, back and chest. \n\n\"I was hurting so bad I started breaking out in a sweat,\" Boone said. \"The chest pain was the worst it felt like somebody was sitting on me.\" \n\nSoon he was sick, and his wife called for an ambulance, which managed to make the trip to his subdivision on Harvest Hill Drive, but paramedics had to borrow Boone's snow-blower to clear a path to load him into the vehicle. \n\nThe weather that earlier had meant little more than a blustery white Christmas was now suddenly a terrifying barrier to the life-saving medical treatment that emergency room staff at CHI St. Alexius Health in Williston almost immediately knew Boone needed. \n\n\"We stabilized him as best we could, but at that time I realized our resources were exhausted and he would not survive if we didn't get him elsewhere,\" said Karen Johnson, a certified registered nurse anesthetist, who tended to Boone that night. \n\nThe 45-year-old was having a massive heart attack due to double blockages, and needed to be transported to Trinity Hospital in Minot for surgery. \n\nHigh winds were keeping a medical flight crew on the ground, and local ambulance drivers said the snow was piling up too high to make such a long trip possible. \n\nBy 1 a.m., after Boone's heart had stopped for a second time, Johnson made a call to Rick Sigvaldsen, Williston's Department of Transportation district maintenance supervisor. \n\nShe asked if a snowplow could escort an ambulance to Minot, and the response was immediate. \n\n\"Absolutely,\" he said. \n\nWith snowplow driver Ed Nelson clearing a path, an ambulance carrying Boone, a paramedic and members of the Valley Med-Flight crew made its way to Minot, where a cardiologist put a stent in Boone's heart. \n\nThe trip took four hours. \n\n\"There's absolutely no way we would have done it without the snowplow,\" Corey Johnson, a Williston paramedic who rode in the back with Boone, said. \n\nThe decision to call wasn't made easily, Johnson said, pointing out that she would not have asked others to travel in risky conditions if so much hadn't been at stake, the Williston Herald (http://bit.ly/2kjDsZD ) reports. \n\n\"I would never have considered calling anybody out into those conditions if it hadn't been to save someone's life,\" she said, adding that the response she got was not unexpected. \"I was relieved, but not truly surprised because of the nature of the people in this community.\" \n\nBoone, a Mississippi native, is back to work in the oil industry, and enjoying his first grandchild, who was born a month ago. The two met for the first time after Boone's discharge from the hospital. \n\n\"I can't thank them enough. If it was not for them I wouldn't be here today \u2014 the snow plow driver played just as much a part as the doctors,\" he said. \n\n--- \n\nInformation from: Williston Herald, http://www.willistonherald.com \n\nAn AP Member Exchange shared by the Williston Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Elizabeth HackenburgThe Williston Herald"},"topics":[{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Man suffering a massive heart attack saved by snowplow","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Centre","zipCode":"16823","state":"Pennsylvania","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Bellefonte","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Centre Daily Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657424","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"756"},"name":"Centre Daily Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Health","Lifestyle","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.centredaily.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://bit.ly/2kjDsZD","http://www.willistonherald.com/"],"sequenceId":"695193839455","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:11:19Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

President Yahya Jammeh had spurned all entreaties to quit the office he had held for 22 years. The end however came with the December 1, 2016 vote. The people of The Gambia had had enough of Jammeh, obviously, and they expressed that in very clear terms by voting him out. \n \nBut he refused to respect the will of the people, as he had indicated when he initially conceded defeat. In several trips to the capital, Banjul, efforts by the ECOWAS leaders led by President Muhammad Buhari to get Jammeh to read the writing on the wall were futile. \n \nWhat is the post on The Gambian wall? It\u2019s that the end of Jammeh\u2019s dictatorship has come. Outside The Gambia, I mean across Africa, the end of dictatorship had long come. The days of sit-tight leaders had long been numbered. \n \nFor dictators across Africa, the party is over. Jammeh\u2019s endgame theatrics are part of what have given vent to the common characterisation of Africa as a backward continent and why a world leader with a penchant for unguarded utterances would even dare suggest that Africa needs to be re-colonised. \n \nIn the case of The Gambia, there was some redemption though. The last-minute intervention by Guinean President Alfa Conde and Mauritania\u2019s President Mohammed Ould Abdel Aziz was to pay off in the end. \n \nThe two leaders had been in Banjul since Friday last week, trying to persuade Jammeh to drop his hardline posture that could only end in perdition as the ECOWAS troops were literally next door. He caved in, perhaps as a result of pressure from the two leaders. But the problem was how to take the dictator out. \n \nNow, President Conde, a personal friend of Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, had flown into Banjul in the Falcon jet leased by the All Progressives Congress (APC) National Leader and the plane was still in the former\u2019s possession. \n \nOn learning that the chartered plane was going to be used to ferry Jammeh out of Banjul to Conakry, Guinea, Asiwaju Tinubu\u2019s only condition as reported by some national newspapers was that he had no objection if such would facilitate Jammeh\u2019s quick exit, resolve the building political crisis, lead to the restoration of democracy to the land and the return of President Adama Barrow to The Gambia to assume his mandate. \n \nTo him, this was the demand of President Muhammad Buhari-led ECOWAS mediation efforts and this demand was irreducible. Satisfied, the plane was good to go. \n \nBut there was this tricky problem as I learnt: the plane would fly over Senegal\u2019s air space enroute to Guinea and the Senegalese authorities wanted to know the identities of those on board. They particularly wanted to know if Jammeh was inside the plane and whether he was proceeding on exile. \n \nThe fears were instantly doused by President Conde who reportedly said the airlift of Jammeh was in deference to the demand of the ECOWAS leaders. Only five persons were said to be aboard the jet as it left Banjul. They were President Conde, Jammeh, his wife Zainab, mother, and son Mohammed. There were reports that Jammeh, his mum and wife wore mournful look as they were being driven out of the State House and taken out of the country. \n \nThey were expectedly sad throughout the journey, an outcome that would have been avoided if Jammeh had acted honourably and quit the stage with dignity after ruling for all of 22 years. Jammeh may have indeed written his epitaph: here lies a leader who refused to heed the demand of his people to quit the stage. \n \nThe report in an online platform that the jet was used to ferry Jammeh\u2019s loot put at $11 million is mere fallacy. That can only exist in the warped imagination of the publishers of that online platform. It\u2019s a typification of the lazy journalism that dots the media landscape. It is what we call agbeleko, conjuring of news, in the newsroom. \n \nOnce the writer saw in the news that a spokesman of the Adama Barrow government had alleged that some $11 million was taken out of the coffers, he went to work. SaharaReporters concluded that the chartered plane must have taken out the reportedly missing money, without any investigation. If they had done so, they would have known that the money in question was allegedly taken out of that country in tranches. \n \nAlso, they forgot \u2013 or chose to ignore \u2013 that there was also another plane, a cargo plane, said to have ferried some state-of-the-art vehicles and choice items for Jammeh. \n \nHow looted monies would be loaded on a plane that was in the full glare of the international media without attracting serious suspicion is strange to me. The attention of the international media, security forces and The Gambian people was on the plane once it emerged that it would fly Jammeh out into exile. \n \nI first saw the full length photograph of the chartered plane in a BBC report on the night of Saturday, January 21 when Jammeh was ferried out. Other reports also used the photograph of the plane. \n \nIn allowing the chartered plane to be used, Asiwaju Tinubu has undoubtedly helped in advancing the cause of democracy in The Gambia. By allowing the plane to ferry out Jammeh, he helped bring to fruition the demand of the ECOWAS leaders. \n \nAnd, of course, his gesture helped pave the way for Adama Barrow to return home and assume office, in line with the December 1, 2016 mandate given him by the Gambian people. Such actions should attract nothing but commendation for Asiwaju Tinubu. SaharaReporters should bury its head in shame for the baseless insinuations and puerile conclusions they have drawn. \n \n*Rahman is Special Adviser on Media to Asiwaju Tinubu. \n \nThe post appeared first on Vanguard News . \n \nOriginal Article \n \nJammeh, Conde And The Chartered Plane \nJammeh, Conde And The Chartered Plane \nJammeh, Conde And The Chartered Plane \nJammeh, Conde And The Chartered Plane \nJammeh, Conde And The Chartered Plane \n Jammeh, Conde And The Chartered Plane  Jammeh, Conde And The Chartered Plane","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":""},"topics":[{"name":"Gambia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Jammeh, Conde and The Chartered Plane","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Western Africa","countryCode":"NG","country":"Nigeria"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Ondo State News Online","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"608959245","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Ondo State News Online","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://ondostatenews.online"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.vanguardngr.com/2017/01/jammeh-conde-chartered-plane/","http://www.vanguardngr.com/"],"sequenceId":"695193843950","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:39Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:11:16Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

If the state has to re-route the road, the cost could rise to $15 million. \n \nAll because of a pesky hole in the ground. \n \n\u201cOn both sides of the highway, you got big cracks,\u201d Paul Weatherby, manager of the Middle Pecos Groundwater Conservation District, said in June as he pointed out odd ripples along Farm-to-Market Road 1053. \u201cSee how deep that ditch is right now?\u201d \n \nIn either 1950 or 1951 \u2014 the records aren\u2019t clear \u2014 somebody bore a well 2,800 feet into the West Texas earth. No one\u2019s quite sure who did the drilling, but state records say that G.C. Holladay last owned the well. A 2010 obituary describes a G.C. Holladay Jr. \u2014 apparently the same man \u2014 as a farmer, army veteran and \u201cavid outdoorsman\u201d who lived for 60 years in Imperial before dying at 83. Two phone listings for his wife were disconnected. \n \nWeatherby and Ty Edwards, the district\u2019s assistant general manager, believe the Holladay hole was among dozens that oilmen drilled in this corner of the Permian Basin in the early-to-mid 1900s, hunting for black gold. \n \nThese gushed something else. \n \n\u201cThey hit that damn water, and they just left,\u201d Edwards said. \n \nFarmers and ranchers like Holladay ultimately tapped these wells for irrigation and drilled others of their own. But when the farmland stopped producing decades ago, they walked away.  \n \nFor years, the wells sat unplugged and unnoticed. But Mother Nature and geology can do strange things to these spaces. Cement casing and steel piping crack and corrode over time, and water can rise and migrate through the cracks. \n \nAround the late 1980s, some of the corroded wells around Imperial (population 278) started spewing smelly, brackish San Andres aquifer water that had mixed with salts and other minerals on its way to the surface. \n \nOver several years, the Holladay hole swamped the surrounding land, including a piece of FM 1053, a two-lane road that stretches nearly 60 miles across parts of Pecos, Crane and Ector counties. Beginning around 2004, the area began sinking as the water percolated back underground and ate away at underground salt formations. \n \nHad its waters not flooded the road, the Holladay hole might be just another forgotten West Texas well that no one is willing to pay to plug. The Texas Railroad Commission, the state\u2019s petroleum regulator, is responsible for plugging thousands of abandoned oil wells \u2014 a growing list that\u2019s spurring groundwater pollution fears \u2014 but no state agency is charged with sealing water wells. \n \nBecause this well threatened a state-maintained road, the Texas Department of Transportation stepped forward to plug it. In late 2008, the agency found a contractor who agreed to do it for about $125,000, said Mark Cross, an agency spokesman. The cost soared to $315,000 by the time the work was finished three months later (a local water district and development council chipped in a small amount for the bill). \n \nBut by all accounts, the contractor botched the job. It plugged the well only at the top rather than cementing all the way down. This stopped the flow above ground but allowed the brackish water to continue mixing and mingling below. \n \nThings got worse quickly. The well and the surrounding ground has sunk nearly 40 feet since the plugging. The land along FM 1053 is dropping three-fourths of an inch every month, and the road is shifting west toward the well, Cross said. The depression caused by the well now measures 1,400 feet across. \n \nAll of this has meant pricey roadwork. \n \nOver the past decade, the transportation agency has twice raised the road, at a cost of $500,000. And in December, it shelled out $500,000 more to fix a mile-long stretch near the well. Now, the agency is considering rerouting the road to avoid the sinking ground altogether. That could cost between $10 million and $15 million \u2014 maybe more, and it wouldn\u2019t be easy. \n \n\u201cThe are many obstacles to avoid, Cross said: \u201cOil and gas wells, multiple other artesian wells, and other utilities.\u201d \n \nBut will the land here ever stop sinking? That\u2019s what Gil Van Deventer, an Odessa-based hydrologist who has looked at the phenomenon from the surface, is wondering. \n \nAbout about an hour\u2019s drive north, the Wink Sinks \u2014 chasms of fascination and fear between the towns of Kermit and Wink \u2014 gulped huge chunks of land atop the Hendrick oilfield.  Wink Sink No. 1 \u2014 more than a football field across and 100 feet deep after it collapsed \u2014 turned 36 years old last June. Its more massive cousin to the south, Wink Sink No.2, swallowed a water well, pipelines and surrounding desert back in 2002. \n \nVan Deventer sees similar conditions forming at the Holladay hole and a nearby abandoned well that has spewed a putrid body of water dubbed Boehmer Lake. \n \n\u201cI think there\u2019s going to be more sinkholes in our future,\u201d he said. \n \nCross said his agency\u2019s experts don\u2019t believe this area will see a \"catastrophic\u201d \n \nfailure like near Wink, \u201cbut they have no idea how deep this subsidence will continue to go.\u201d \n \nOr how much it will cost.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Tax news","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"West Texas\u2019 abandoned water well sinks land, sucks tax dollars","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Midland","zipCode":"79701","state":"Texas","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Midland","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"MRT.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"587764453","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"MRT.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Business","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.mrt.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.mrt.com/business/oil/article/West-Texas-abandoned-water-well-sinks-land-10892051.php#photo-11040667","http://www.mrt.com/business/oil/article/West-Texas-abandoned-water-well-sinks-land-10892051.php#photo-11040669"],"sequenceId":"695193847131","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:11:17Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

As her death is coming few months after the death of Professor Isidore Okpewho and Elechi Amadi last year. Buchi Emecheta, whose works included The Joys of Motherhood, Second-Class Citizen and The Bride Price, died at her home in London at the age of 72. \n \nEmecheta who was born in Lagos on 21 July 1944,published more than 20 books throughout her career but her magnum opus was \u2018The Joys Of Motherhood \n \nShe was known for championing women and girls in her writing, though famously rejected description as a feminist. \u201cI work toward the liberation of women but I\u2019m not feminist. I\u2019m just a woman,\u201d she said. \n \nThe topics she covered in her writing included child marriage, life as a single mother, abuse of women and racism in the UK and elsewhere. \n \n\u201cBlack women all over the world should re-unite and re-examine the way history has portrayed us,\u201d she said. \n \nIn his reaction, Delta State Governor, Senator Ifeanyi Okowa, who expressed sadness over the death of Nigeria\u2019s literary amazon, described her passage as a monumental loss to the country and the literary world. \n \nIn a tribute by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Charles Aniagwu, on Thursday in Asaba, Okowa, extolled the immense contributions of the late writer to the growth and development of literature in Nigeria, Africa and beyond. \n \nThe Governor noted that the literary works of Emecheta promoted Delta State, Nigeria and Africa, hence she will be celebrated by lovers of literature all over the world. \n \nOkowa described Emecheta, winner of the 1979 New Statesman, Jock Campbell Award for The Slave Girl, 2005 Order of the British Empire OBE, as a consummate patriot, a great literary icon and a teacher par excellence, whose literary theme centred mostly on child slavery, motherhood, female independence and freedom through education. \n\u2022 Late Buchi Emecheta with one of her novels \n \nHe said \u201cOn behalf of the government and people of Delta State, I commiserate with the Emecheta family of Ibusa and the entire literary world over the demise of the late cerebral writer of \u2018Second-Class Citizen\u2019 fame\u201d, adding that the state has lost a great woman who was once described as the most successful black woman novelist living in Britain. \n \nWhile noting that she would be missed by all and sundry whose lives she affected in many ways with her literary arsenal, Okowa urged all who mourn the demise of the late Buchi Emecheta to take solace in the fact that she remains alive through her literary works. \n \nHe prayed God to grant her immediate family the strength to bear the irreparable loss, pointing out that her numerous achievements in the literary world would always be remembered. \n \nThe president of the Association of Nigerian Authors, Denja Abdullahi, said: \u201cWe have lost a rare gem in this field. Her works would forever live to speak for her. \n \n\u201cIt is a sad loss to our circle. She was known for championing the female gender and we would forever miss her.\u201d \n \nNnedi Okorafor: Her work is one of the reasons I started writing. \n \nRenowned author and teacher, Prof Akachi Ezeigbo said Africa has lost a very great literary figure. \u201cI just heard about it this morning. It is painful, Africa has lost a very literary figure. A very prominent writer which distinguished her self in writing. She is a woman of letters, a vibrant Christian, we are very proud of her and her works. Her works were widely read and most of us were influenced by her writing. Most women all over the world focused on her and her works. May her soul rest in peace.\u201d \n \nAward winning novelist, former Vanguard\u2019s Art Editor and Chair of the Etisalat Prize for Literature competition, Helon Habila said, \u201cIt\u2019s a tragic loss. She was a supportive, positive role model. Her personal story of overcoming adversity and abuse to become the writer she was is inspiring not just to women but to all of us. We thank her for her books.\u201d \n \nOn his part Lagos ANA president Femi Onileagbon described her death as a great loss. \u201cIt was quite shocking, sometimes you just believe that great writers don\u2019t die, they should live on and on. But that is not to be. \n \nI have a lot of respect for her and the likes of Prof Akachi Ezeigbo in the way they handled feminism. She fought for women and their position in the society. It is a great loss and in the next ANA reading in February, we will look at how she treated the theme love in her books.\u201d \n \nLagos-born Emecheta had moved to the UK in 1960, working as a librarian and becoming a student at London University, where she read sociology. She later worked as a community worker in London for several years. She left her husband when he refused to read her first novel and burnt the manuscript, a World Service series on women writers reported. \n \nThe book, In the Ditch, was eventually published in 1972. That and Second-Class Citizen, which followed in 1974, were fictionalised portraits of a young Nigerian woman struggling to bring up children in London. \n \nLater, she wrote about civil conflict in Nigeria and the experience of motherhood in a changing Ibo society. \n \nAn assessment of her writing, published by the British Council, says: \u201cThe female protagonists of Emecheta\u2019s fiction challenge the masculinist assumption that they should be defined as domestic properties whose value resides in their ability to bear children and in their willingness to remain confined at home.\u201d \n \nShe won the Jock Campbell Award from the New Statesman in 1979, and was on Granta magazine\u2019s 1983 list of \u201cBest of the Young British Novelists\u201d. In September 2004, she appeared in the historic \u201cA Great Day in London\u201d photograph taken at the British Library, featuring 50 Black and Asian writers who have made major contributions to contemporary British literature.

The Aussies think it's great because it's a win win for them.\" \n \nCahill said there was little compassion in the Australian policy, which sent back everyone no matter what their offence. \n \n\"It might be one thing when you've got someone that has committed an armed robbery sitting in jail. It's different when you've got someone who has lived their whole life there and been convicted of a relatively minor offence.\" \n \nTony Touri, 48, landed in Christchurch before Christmas, after stints in jail and an Australian immigration detention centre. \n   \nHe left behind his family, a $2000-a-week job and the kickboxing club where he helped train youth. \n \nTouri saw Christchurch as a fresh start with labouring opportunities and a place free from old North Island gang connections. \n \n\"It turned my life upside down. When I arrived here, I felt like an alien.\" \n \nCahill said it had been well proven through released prisoners, that if supports were not in place, the risk of reoffending was greater. \n \n\"These people are sort of similar but there isn't the same support available to follow up with them all the time, so it doesn't surprise me we're getting that 30 per cent reoffending,\" he said. \n \nThe Canterbury branch of Pars has found growing demand for their support service. \n \n\"We could have one in a month. We could get roughly one a week, then two in one week,\" Murphy said. \n \nIn 2014, Pars settled just three people in Christchurch. That figure rose to 15 in 2015 and to 51 in 2016. \n \nFive women were among the group that had arrived since 2014. \n \nCounties Manukau District has the highest population of deportees, with 118 residing in the area.  \n \nAuckland City has attracted 89, while 69 people are listed in Canterbury.  \n \nWellington has 52 returning offenders and 51 are in the Waitemata District. \n \nCorrections deputy national commissioner Rachel Leota\u200b said the provision of effective reintegration services for returning offenders was important because many did not have strong links to New Zealand.  \n \nCorrections budgeted $300,000 a year for five years for providers such as Pars to help returning offenders settle back into life in New Zealand.  \n \nPrior to entering a contract with the Corrections in 2016, Pars received $77,000 from the Christchurch City Council to support deportees. \n \nCahill said before an information sharing agreement with Australian authorities was signed in September 2015, police were lucky to get a few hours notice of new arrivals.  \n \n\"Whereas now we are able to prepare a little and have staff meet them.\" \n \nHigh-risk offenders are visited by police 48 hours after arrival. \n \n\"It's good in theory but there simply aren't the resources to do that. And there are no controls,\" Cahill said. \n \nHe said in some cases in Auckland, returning offenders had checked out of supported living arrangements or motels before police arrived for their checkup.  \n \n\"They're not breaking the law per se when they do that, because a lot of them aren't under any restrictions. They're just into the wind.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"EMILY SPINK"},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"New Zealand news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Global news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Dozens of Australian deportees are being sent to NZ on a weekly basis","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"NZ","country":"New Zealand"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"The Press NZ","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"189987471","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1076"},"name":"The Press NZ","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard","National","Geographic"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.stuff.co.nz"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695193848966","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:07:10Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:11:21Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

More than ever, it seems that no matter which political party people identify with, there is an abundance of controversy and unrest. \n \nAs a military family, we have lived in six different states over the last 20 years. We have friends in each of those states \u2013 Washington, Alaska, Michigan, Indiana, California and North Carolina. We also have many friends who are stationed in numerous other states around the country. \n \nMany of our friends are fellow Coast Guard families, and others are locals from the different areas where we have been stationed. These people have diverse backgrounds and a wide range of opinions and beliefs \u2013 especially when it comes to politics. \n \nI know people who attended the Presidential Inauguration. I know people who attended Women\u2019s Marches. I know a military spouse who attended the inauguration as a journalist and covered the event for a military publication. I also know people who were involved in events related to the inauguration, and who attended in military uniform, as part of their job. \n \nMilitary members are entitled to their own personal opinions and beliefs, but when it comes down to it, they ultimately work for president of the United States. He is their boss. As the Commander in Chief, President Trump is the top civilian and military authority in the nation.. \n \nAll members of the Armed Services, from the newest recruits to the most senior officers, work for the president. The highest ranking officers from each of the military branches report directly to the president, including the Commandant of the Coast Guard, Adm. Paul Zukunft. During the inauguration ceremony Zukunft was seated near other Service Chiefs behind the former presidents and their spouses, including Bill and Hillary Clinton. \n \nMany people watched the inauguration and related events with a special interest in seeing the involvement of their friends, relatives, co-workers and neighbors \u2013 those in uniform. Military families move around the country often, and live within communities with vastly varying political climates. Like many people, I appreciate the diverse opinions we are exposed to, but do not enjoy the intense controversy. \n \nAs a journalist, I embrace freedom of speech, and the press, and encourage people to get their information from reputable media outlets. Much of what is posted on social media is not based on hard facts from identifiable sources, and that misinformation can lead to unnecessary conflict. \n \nI have seen enough negativity \u2013 especially on social media, to last a lifetime. Whether people support our country\u2019s new president or not, I think we all need to work together to find positive solutions to problems, and respectful ways to address the issues we are passionate about. \n \nIn some ways, I wish we could go back to a time when people didn\u2019t feel the need to share every opinion about every situation with everyone they meet. My grandmother used to say there are two things you should never discuss with people you don\u2019t know very well \u2013 religion and politics. I can only imagine what she would have to say about the things people are posting on social media. \n \nKristi Langenbacher is a Coast Guard spouse and writes about military family life.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Opinions still spewing on both sides after election","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Pasquotank","zipCode":"27907","state":"North Carolina","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Elizabeth City","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Daily Advance","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169738201","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"82"},"name":"Daily Advance","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.dailyadvance.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695193851689","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:11:23Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The Fortus 400mc 3D printer allows users to manufacture parts in-house using multiple production-grade thermoplastics. \n \nBryan Derr is the production controller and contract program manager for the CAD/CAM shop in the IOD, said the technology has been around for a while, \n \n\u201cWe started looking at 3D printers about 12 years ago, but we never really thought of it in a production aspect,\u201d Derr said. \n \nWhen the first 3D printer came to ALC, there were just two people working with it. Today, six people are qualified to use the current machine, acquired about three years ago. \n \nThe original idea was to use the machine to create prototypes for testing, which would save time and money. Once the Coast Guard approved the design of a plastic prototype, the part could then be made out of other materials, such as metal or fiberglass. Recently the division began also producing parts that could be used in their current form. Production began with simple components and progressed to more complex designs. \n \nNow the division is using the technology for the design and production of components, as well as manufacturing specialized tooling needed for the Aviation Logistics Center\u2019s systems overhaul process for all of the Coast Guard\u2019s aircraft. \n \nThe IOD members work closely with the product line managers and engineers from ALC to develop non-structural aircraft components. Those components range from satellite phone mounts, to circuit breaker panels for all aircraft in the Coast Guard aviation fleet. \n \nThere are a handful of components that are re-ordered multiple times for production, and Derr said the demand for production continues to increase. Some products can be used in plastic form, instead of metal, such as seat rails for aircraft armrests and vent covers for the interior of an aircraft. \n \nAs the aircraft continue to age, the need for replacement components will also increase. \n \n\u201cThe demand and cost to support these aircraft is going to continue to grow,\u201d Derr said. \n \nIOD members use computer-aided design, which replaces manual drafting with an automated process. They utilize SolidWorks, a program also used at the Coast Guard Academy to teach engineering students about the computer-aided design. \n \nThe technology is continually changing, said Derr, who also spent five years teaching in the Engineering Technology Program at the College of the Albemarle\u2019s Regional Aviation and Technical Training Center in Barco. Three of his former students who graduated from the COA program are now working in the Industrial Operations Division. \n \nJosh Baker is one of those graduates and works as drafter and programmer in engineering support in IOD. Baker graduated from COA last year with an Associate of Arts degree in applied science for mechanical engineering and began working on base about five months ago. \n \n\u201cA lot of what we do is reverse engineering, really,\u201d Baker said. \u201cWe are often presented with a known part, and tasked with figuring out how to make it and creating plans to do so.\u201d \n \nDerek Blackford, also a drafter and programmer in engineering support for IOD, said the technology saves the division time. \n \n\u201cWe can stock the printer with two canisters of plastic and it can print for the entire weekend,\u201d Blackford said. \n \nIt also saves the Coast Guard money, he said, noting that a part that might cost more than $300 if made of metal, including costs for the milling machine and manual labor, might cost only $5 if made out plastic in the machine. \n \n\u201cWe\u2019re interested in anything we can do to save money and time and test ahead of time,\u201d Blackford said. \n \nDivision members create plastic prototypes, which are tested and approved, then manufactured from metal or other materials. \n \n\u201cIf someone brings us a part and asks us to make drawings and the prototype, we have the technology to do that,\u201d Blackford said. \n \nDerr said the technology helps from a logistics standpoint, in that components can be made much faster in the machine, and printing components also saves space. Because the machine can create parts as they are needed, it\u2019s not necessary to have as much warehouse space for storing parts for future use, he said. \n \nIOD members are routinely seeking out new training and collaboration, Derr said. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s such a new and emergent technology, and it\u2019s developing rapidly,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of formal analysis and specifications within the military aviation community.\u201d \n \nMembers of IOD periodically meet with others utilizing the emergent technologies, including Navy personnel in Virginia, for think-tank sessions to share information, thoughts and ideas about the new technology. \n \n\u201cWhen we meet with them I get the sense that they are very impressed with the fact that we are able to produce what we do,\u201d said Derr, a native of Elizabeth City whose father served in the Coast Guard for 32 years. \n \n\u201cMy long-term goal is to continue to be at the forefront of this rapidly developing technology and ensure that we continue to lead the way in how it can be integrated into the Coast Guard\u2019s primary mission capabilities by constantly pushing the boundaries of what the technology has to offer,\u201d he said. \n \nPHOTOS \n \nPhoto by Kristi Langenbacher \n \nJosh Baker removes a component from the 3D printer in the Industrial Operations Division of the Aviation Logistics Center in Elizabeth City.

Marilyn van Dijk, a veterinary assistant, kept treats in Meyer's hands or in front of the dog at all times. \n\nHe'd forget that he had a bum leg, put his paw down and reach around for the treat. \n\nMeyer, keeping hold on Tigger via a harness, cooed in the dog's ear: \"I've got you. I've got you.\" \n\nAnd then Tigger relaxed. He'd move his front paws forward as if on automatic pilot. Walk, walk, walk. \n\nMeyer moved up the speed on the treadmill, and Tigger walked, walked, walked some more, as if he's been doing it his entire young life. \n\nExcept he hasn't. \n\nTigger has never walked or run on four legs like most canines. \n\nHe has jumped like a kangaroo on his hind two legs or inched forward on his belly. But he has never kept up with his foster parents' other dogs because his front two legs were congenitally deformed by a defect called ectrodactyly, or split hand or lobster claw. \n\nThese days, Meyer has him on the underwater treadmill and doing planks on a large plastic peanut to help develop callouses on the limb and strengthen his core to protect his other limbs. He hopes to introduce the dog to cavalletti exercises (small jumps) soon to help him further strengthen his muscles and improve his balance. \n\n\"He's been compensating his whole life, so we take this slow,\" Meyer said. \n\nTigger weighs slightly more than his optimal weight of 55 pounds, said his surgeon, Dr. Jennifer Warnock. The physical therapy sessions may help with that. \n\nDr. Warnock hopes to perform the second repair surgery on Tigger's other front leg at the end of March. But Good and her partner, Troy Riggs, have some fundraising to do first. When the Statesman Journal first broke Tigger's story last summer and it spread across the country through the USA Today Network and The Huffington Post, more than $17,000 was raised in a few weeks. \n\nMore than $10,000 was spent on Tigger's first surgery, ICU stay, bandaging needs, and his medication. At least $2,000 or $3,000 still needs to be raised to pay for this next round of surgery, which will repair the second front limb and fuse one portion of the other newly fashioned leg. Dr. Warnock expects Tigger's condition to regress a bit as he recovers from the second surgery, but she's cautiously optimistic the dog could be walking on both front legs by summer. \n\nTigger may or may not need prosthetics. His X-rays currently show bone fusion, which is excellent, Warnock said. If his therapy continues to help him develop callouses where he never had them before, she believes the prognosis to be very good. \n\n\"We want to get him functioning without pain,\" Warnock said. \"I want him jumping on the couch, something most dogs take for granted. But Tigger does not.\" \n\nNow about those treats ...","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"CAROL MCALICE CURRIEStatesman Journal"},"topics":[{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Tigger starts water therapy as leg improves","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Centre","zipCode":"16823","state":"Pennsylvania","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Bellefonte","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Centre Daily Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657424","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"756"},"name":"Centre Daily Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Health","Lifestyle","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.centredaily.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://stjr.nl/2iLOWc1"],"sequenceId":"695193855057","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:06:04Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:11:26Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport, their lawyers and two U.S. representatives accompanying them tried to cross into a secure area \u2013 and were stopped themselves. \n \n\u201cStep back! Step back!\u201d the agents shouted at them. \n \nA few minutes later, Heidi Nassauer, chief of passenger operations for U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) at the airport, was called over. \n \nRepresentatives Jerrold Nadler and Nydia Velazquez, both Democrats from New York, wanted clarification on whether an immigration ban issued on Friday by President Donald Trump prevented the Iraqis from consulting with attorneys. \n \nNassauer had no clear answer. \n \n\u201cWe are as much in the dark as everybody else,\u201d said the border protection official at one of the largest U.S. airports. \n \nThe tense exchange, witnessed by Reuters, was representative of the confusion at airports across the United States and others overseas after Trump abruptly halted immigration from seven majority-Muslim countries and temporarily put a stop to the entry of refugees. \n \nThroughout much of Saturday, government officials and security workers were left to guess who from those countries could enter the United States legally and who could not. \n \nThe day ended with a federal judge issuing an emergency stay that temporarily allowed stranded travelers with valid visas to remain in the United States. The American Civil Liberties Union, which sought the stay, said it would help 100 to 200 people with visas or refugee status who found themselves detained in transit or at U.S. airports. \n \nRECKLESS \n \nEarlier on Saturday, the Trump administration said it would have been \u201creckless\u201d to brief government agencies and airports more broadly in advance of launching the security measures, which it says are aimed at preventing attacks from foreign groups. \n \nBut career officials in the Homeland Security and State departments told Reuters the administration failed to appreciate the complexity of enforcing the order consistently or the need to prepare agencies and airlines. \n \nAffected travelers had varying experiences at different airports, according to nearly 200 accounts gathered by the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA). \n \nMany holding visas told the association they were allowed into the country without a problem despite Trump\u2019s executive order banning them. \n \nBut some lawful permanent residents \u2013 those with so-called green cards \u2013 were turned away despite guidance to airlines from the CBP that they should be allowed to travel. \n \nAt about 10 p.m. on Friday in Seattle, some eight hours after Trump signed the executive order, an Iranian with dual Canadian citizenship from Vancouver was sent back to Canada, the traveler reported to AILA. A half hour later in New York City, an Iranian arrived at JFK and entered the United States on a valid visa without any problems, according to AILA. \n \nA senior administration official said Trump\u2019s order \u2013 aimed at citizens of Iran, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen \u2013 needed to be implemented urgently to protect Americans. \n \n\u201cThere\u2019s a very strong nexus between our immigration and visa programs and terrorist plots and extremist networks inside the United States,\u201d the official told reporters in a briefing. \u201cIt would be reckless and irresponsible to \u2026 broadcast to the entire world the exact security measures you\u2019re going to take.\u201d \n \nKey figures at the Department of Homeland Security were informed, the official said, declining to elaborate. \n \n\u201cI\u2019m not at liberty to reveal exactly who was briefed and who wasn\u2019t briefed, but everyone that needed to be briefed was briefed,\u201d the official said. \n \nOUT OF THE LOOP \n \nAt the State Department, one of the main agencies dealing with visas and immigration, most officials first heard of the executive order on immigration through the media, according to two department officials. \n \nWhile some offices were aware an executive order was coming, there was no official communication or consultation from the White House, they said. \n \n\u201cWas there any inter-agency coordination or consultation? No,\u201d said one senior official, speaking on condition of anonymity. \n \nImmigration enforcement is among the federal government\u2019s most complex endeavors, involving seven agencies from the U.S. Coast Guard and CBP to the State and Justice Departments. \n \nTwo senior officials in the Department of Homeland Security said on Saturday that they had not heard of any officials in the relevant agencies \u2013 or the congressional committees and subcommittees that oversee them \u2013 who had been consulted by anyone who helped draft the president\u2019s order. \n \n\u201cIf the result is confusion and inconsistency, the responsibility all lies at one address,\u201d said one of the officials, referring to the White House. \n \nThe official, like others, requested anonymity to discuss Trump\u2019s order. \n \nAnother Homeland Security official told Reuters that the White House worked on the executive orders with \u201climited department participation.\u201d \n \n\u201cIt has been a challenge but folks are working through it,\u201d the official said. \n \nCHAOS AT AIRPORTS \n \nOne of the Iraqis detained at JFK was Hameed Khalid Darweesh, a 53-year-old Kurd who had worked as a U.S. Army translator in Iraq and had been threatened there for helping the Americans. \n \nVisas for him and his family were finally issued on Jan. 20, according to a lawsuit filed on behalf of Darweesh and another Iraqi, who had also worked with U.S. military. But as soon as he landed at JFK, he was detained by CBP officers and barred from contacting his attorneys. \n \nWhen his attorneys, from the International Refugee Assistance Project, asked the CBP officers whom they could contact, the agents responded, \u201cMr. President. Call Mr. Trump,\u201d according to the lawsuit. \n \nEventually, Darweesh was allowed to leave and met the lawmakers and his lawyers, clutching his passport and weeping with joy. The other Iraqi who was detained, Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, was also allowed to enter the country. \n \nBut dozens of others were less fortunate. \n \nConflicting media and government reports caused confusion for airlines struggling to deal with the order. \n \nCBP informed air carriers about the executive order in a conference call late on Friday, said a person familiar with the agency\u2019s communications. CBP then sent written guidance before noon on Saturday saying that green card holders were \u201cnot included\u201d in the ban and could continue to travel to the United States. The source said airlines were allowing travelers with green cards on flights until told otherwise. \n \nThe Trump administration official later told reporters that U.S. green card holders traveling outside the United States need to check with a U.S. consulate to see whether they can return. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s being cleared on a case-by-case basis,\u201d the official said. \n \nThe green card issue has left immigration attorneys confused about how to advise their clients. Attorney David Leopold, from Cleveland, Ohio, said he is erring on the side of caution, advising his clients to stay in the United States to avoid being stranded abroad. \n \nThat can create some agonizing dilemmas. \n \n\u201cA Syrian doctor who has a dying mother in Europe cannot go visit her not knowing that he will be able to get back into the United States,\u201d Leopold said. \n \n(Additional reporting by John Walcott, Jeff Mason, Mica Rosenberg, Lesley Wroughton, Jeffrey Dastin, Yara Bayoumy and Yeganeh Torbati; Writing by Brian Thevenot; Editing by Kieran Murray and Bill Rigby)","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Airline industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"How Trump\u2019s abrupt immigration ban sowed confusion at airports, agencies","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"SRN News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"556442915","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"SRN News","dataFormat":"audio","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.srnnews.com/"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695193855842","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:47:13Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:11:25Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.srnnews.com/media/2017/01/1485673519293960E64jpEPyy.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Instead, less than two weeks into the 60-day session, they have introduced 10 cannabis bills \u2013 including legalizing recreational pot, expanding the list of qualifying conditions for medical marijuana, and establishing an excise tax on the sale of the drug and sending all revenues to Medicaid funds. \nTo paraphrase a well-worn idiom, all that activity amounts to lawmakers plucking their buds before they\u2019re mature. \n \nIn 2007, when the Legislature passed the Lynn and Erin Compassionate Use Act legalizing medical marijuana for chronic and terminal illnesses (which the Journal supported), lawmakers did not have the brain studies that document the long-term damage the drug can cause and they did not make any provisions for driving under its influence. They just knew New Mexicans dealing with debilitating diseases, such as HIV-AIDS, cancer and multiple sclerosis, deserved relief from their nausea and pain. But, today, seven qualifying conditions have morphed into more than 20, 182 patients into 33,000-plus and \u201cnonprofit producers\u201d into those that offer online deals and a multimillion-dollar pot farm. \n \nAnd still the state Legislature is looking at growing the pot business irrespective of consequences. \n  \n \nContinue reading \n    \nIt is time to take a breath, and look at the medical research and law enforcement outcomes, and remember that, under current state law, officers have discretion on citing and, if they do, possession is just a petty misdemeanor that carries a possible penalty of up to 15 days in jail and fines up to $100. \n \nA new report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine examined 17 years of research and found strong evidence pot increases the risk of schizophrenia and other causes of psychosis, worsens respiratory symptoms, induces frequent episodes of chronic bronchitis and may increase heart attacks. It said there is not enough research to conclude whether it is effective for treating cancers, irritable bowel syndrome, epilepsy, Parkinson\u2019s or helping people beat addictions. And a 2014 published study based on research conducted in part at the Mind Research Network at the University of New Mexico found chronic marijuana use causes significant abnormalities in brain function and structure, and may lower IQ. \n \nMeanwhile, a 2016 AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety analysis found that, in Washington state, 17 percent of drivers involved in fatal crashes two years after marijuana was legalized had THC, the component that creates the high, in their system. And a New York University professor specializing in issues involving drugs and criminal policy says studies show using marijuana and driving roughly doubles the risk of a crash. \n \nFor years, Rep. William Rehm, R-Albuquerque, has introduced a bill targeting \u201cdrugged driving,\u201d but fellow lawmakers have had little appetite to address the issue. Meanwhile real-life cases here include no charges being filed against a driver who smoked pot, dropped ecstasy, then ran over and killed a teen, and one who shot up heroin, ran over a man changing a tire and killed him. \n \nRehm\u2019s latest version would set presumptive drugged-driving blood concentration levels for marijuana, cocaine, heroin, amphetamine and methamphetamine. And, as is the law in Colorado, it would make it illegal to drive with a THC level higher than 5 nanograms per milliliter of blood. \n \nOther lawmakers have expressed concern that THC stays in a person\u2019s system much longer than the high it induces. The AAA Foundation agrees and says, rather than setting legal limits for THC, police should train officers as drug recognition experts. It\u2019s a debate worth having but, in a state with a terrible substance abuse problem \u2013 eighth in the nation for drug overdose deaths in 2015, 157 of 398 traffic deaths last year attributed to alcohol \u2013 laws should make the state safer, not more dangerous. \n \n(There\u2019s also the very real problem in a state with 6 percent unemployment that employers already don\u2019t hire and can, and do, fire employees for using what is still an illegal substance under federal law, even if the employee has a medical prescription card.) \n \nIn 2014, Rehm said it was important to look at new studies that show \u201cbrain damage as a result of smoking marijuana,\u201d as well as consider that \u201cNew Mexico\u2019s DWI problem does not need to be increased.\u201d It was true then and it is true now. Lawmakers searching for a new revenue stream to help fill the looming nine-figure deficit \u2013 supporters claim taxing marijuana could generate $20 million to $60 million annually \u2013 need to consider the negative medical effects of marijuana use and the state\u2019s continual struggle with impaired driving. \n \nThis editorial first appeared in the Albuquerque Journal.

Historical Marker Number: 200. \n  \nDate established: 2006 in Easton. \n \n\nLocation: Route 112, near Hummingbird Lane and Tunnel Brook Road. \n \n\nWhat the sign says: \u201cIn this area of Easton (formerly part of Landaff and before that, Lincoln), the settlement of Wildwood once stood. At the turn of the 20th century Wildwood was a center for the \u2018slash and run\u2019 logging of Mt. Moosilauke. The Village included a school, a post office, several sawmills, a boardinghouse and a few homes. West of here was a dam used in the spring drives that moved logs down the Wild Ammonoosuc River, from the mountains to southern New England mills. The last log drive on the river occurred in 1911. From 1933 to 1937, the first CCC camp authorized in NH was located at Wildwood.\u201d \n \nThe back story: In the 19th and early 20th centuries, Wildwood was one of many logging villages that were scattered throughout the White Mountains region. From there, loggers stripped much of the forest from the northern flanks of Mount Moosilauke. \n \n\nAt a ceremony in June 2006 to dedicate the marker, local and state officials were joined at the site of the lost village by Eunice Woods, who sponsored the marker. Woods spent her childhood summers in the old schoolhouse in Wildwood, which her grandfather purchased in 1927 as a summer vacation home.  \n \nWoods, 84 at the time of the dedication, spoke at length about Wildwood and told stories of her family\u2019s experience at the settlement. She recalled the woodsmen, who in their youth drove logs down the Wild Ammonoosuc to the Connecticut River, and in later years frequented her grandfather\u2019s general store where they regaled listeners with tales of adventure and hardship on the river. \n \n\nThe N.H. Division of Historical Resources called Woods perhaps the last living person to remember the settlement and the last link to its activity and the stories passed along to her by Wildwood\u2019s old timers. \n \nIn 1933, Wildwood also became the site of the first Civilian Conservation Corps camp to be established in New Hampshire. The CCC was a Depression-era public work relief program that operated from 1933 to 1942 in the United States \nSource: N.H.

Sullivan Arena. \n\nThe victory marks the fifth straight for the Marauders, who improve to 7-3. The Pioneers drop to 1-8-1. \n\n\"We played Trinity a couple of weeks ago (a 3-1 triumph) and they came out in the second period of that game and pinned our ears back,\" said Hanover head coach Dick Dodds. \"We talked today about not letting that happen again. Once they start to get momentum, it is hard to get it back. I think our kids are excited about what is going on here right now. We just want to try and keep it going.\" \n\nUnlike the first period, in which it took the Marauders nearly the entire 15 minutes to register their first goal despite dominating the action, Hanover came out for the second with a take-no-prisoners attitude. Just 25 seconds in, senior forward Jake Acker, left all by his lonesome, buried a hard wrist shot from the right circle past Ethan Messner to make it 2-0. The Marauders soon pushed the advantage to three goals. Owen Stadheim, taking a lead pass from David Lehmann, skated in alone on Messner. Dangling the puck on his stick, the freshman went backhand to forehand before going five-hole on Messner. \n\n\"I didn't think we had the passion today,\" Trinity head coach Mike Connell said. \"I thought we were sluggish. I thought Hanover did what they wanted to and we allowed it a little bit. We need to do a better job being prepared. We gave them too much time to move the puck. Against a team like Hanover you need to be into it the moment the puck drops all the way to the end.\" \n\nTrinity did begin to show signs of life late in the period. Senior Tyler Chipman cut past a Hanover defender coming down the left side. Maintaining control of the puck, Chipman went high on Hanover goalie Gabe Loud to put his team on the board with under three minutes remaining. But the Pioneers did little following the score, as at times they stood around puck watching instead of attacking. \n\nTrinity came away fortunate only to be down just 1-0 after the opening stanza. Much of that had to do with some solid goaltending of Messner. As Hanover controlled the majority of the play inside offensive zone, Messner, a sophomore, held his ground between the pipes, turning aside 18 shots of the Marauders' 19 shots. For the game, Hanover finished with 41 attempts on net while the Pioneers mustered 14. \n\nThe only goal in the frame came by way of a penalty shot awarded to Lehmann. The junior scored at 14:34. \n\n\"We were getting shots and cycling the puck well,\" said Acker, who also added an assist. \"We didn't really get the scoring chances until the end of the period when we got the penalty shot. But we knew it would come so we just stuck to our game plan. Eventually it came.\" \n\n.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"NHIAA Boys' Hockey Hanover boys' hockey overpowers Trinity","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Hillsborough","zipCode":"03108","state":"New Hampshire","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Manchester","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Union Leader","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169681010","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2"},"name":"Union Leader","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.unionleader.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.unionleader.com/storyimage/UL/20170129/NEWS16/170129198/AR/0/AR-170129198.jpg?q=80","http://www.unionleader.com/storyimage/UL/20170129/NEWS16/170129198/EP/1/1/EP-170129198.jpg?q=99"],"sequenceId":"695193861115","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:52:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:11:30Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It could not put a stop to its losing streak, however. \n\nTwo third-period goals carried No. 19 Providence College to a 3-2 victory over the Wildcats in front of a crowd of 6,204. \n\nThe triumph marked Providence's fifth straight and its second consecutive series sweep. The Wildcats (11-11-4, 6-5-3 Hockey East) have lost three straight and have not won since their 5-3 home win over Northeastern Jan. 12. \n\nFriars freshman forward Brandon Duhaime broke a 1-1 tie 4:50 into the third period when he scored on a low shot from the slot. Teammate Bryan Lemos' backdoor goal with 6:16 remaining to give the Friars (14-8-4, 6-6-2 Hockey East) a 3-1 advantage. \n\nWildcats junior goaltender Danny Tirone made 44 saves in defeat. \n\nTyler Kelleher's power-play goal with 1:44 remaining in the second period ended UNH's recent scoreless stretch and knotted the score at 1-1. The Wildcats senior forward put home a backdoor goal off a cross-ice feed from Michael McNicholas. \n\nKelleher's tally was UNH's first since Patrick Grasso's power-play goal 4:51 into the second period of the team's 2-2 tie at No. 15 Notre Dame on Jan. 20. \n\nGrasso capped the Wildcats' scoring when he scored from the slot with 40 seconds remaining. His goal could have tied the game if teammate Matt Dawson's goal was not waved off less than two minutes earlier. \n\nDawson nearly cut Providence's lead to 3-2 with 1:58 left. The sophomore defenseman's shot from the high slot went by Providence goaltender Hayden Hawkey (21 saves). After the review, the referees disallowed the goal due to contact with the goalie in the crease. \n\nProvidence junior forward Brian Pinho's scored on a one-timer off a feed from Josh Monk 9:27 into the middle frame to open the game's scoring. \n\nThe Wildcats nearly grabbed a 1-0 lead 2:42 into the second period. Junior forward Jason Salvaggio's shot from the right circle trickled through Hawkey's legs but the goaltender located and covered the puck before it crossed the goal line. \n\nUNH played without Salvaggio for 10 minutes in the third period after he received a misconduct penalty 5:43 into the frame. \n\nahall@unionleader.com \n\n.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Providence news","group":"US regional"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Hockey East Providence knocks off UNH","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Hillsborough","zipCode":"03108","state":"New Hampshire","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Manchester","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Union Leader","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169681010","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2"},"name":"Union Leader","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.unionleader.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.unionleader.com/storyimage/UL/20170129/SPORTS22/170129199/AR/0/AR-170129199.jpg?q=80","http://www.unionleader.com/storyimage/UL/20170129/SPORTS22/170129199/EP/1/1/EP-170129199.jpg?q=99","http://www.unionleader.com/storyimage/UL/20170129/SPORTS22/170129199/EP/1/2/EP-170129199.jpg?q=99"],"sequenceId":"695193861283","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:45:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:11:30Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Having fished these places during the open water seasons, I know the shorelines and bottoms pretty well and the chances of catching a huge trophy fish. \nClosest for me is Great East Lake in the Milton Mills area of New Hampshire and Shapley Mills in Maine. This lake contains an interesting mix of both warm and cold water species and the fishing rules are under the special border waters regulations that seem to be a bit more liberal than the non-border waters. \n\nWhat first drew me to ice fish Great East Lake was that its robust population of lake trout, or togue, which most Mainers call them. To fish for any good population of lake trout through the ice or otherwise else meant quite a few more miles to either Merrymeeting Lake or the huge Lake Winnipesaukee. Both of these lakes had drawbacks, so it was Great East we'd head for. \n\nThe lake isn't teeming with lakers but we've seldom been skunked when ice fishing there. And there was also always a chance at hooking one of their huge brown trout that patrol both deep and just under the ice, and would make the cover of most fishing mags for size and beauty. \n\nThe lakers generally run right around the keeper size limit, so we seldom went home without a fish or two for our efforts. The big waters with fewer but larger fish made Great East an interesting and profitable way to spend a day on the ice. \n\nRecent efforts there have turned up some good crappie fishing, as have several other smaller lakes that are in the same watershed as Great East. \n\nOne of them, Horn Pond, has a direct channel that connects it to Great East and has one heck of a good crappie population. Crappies are one fish that we'd never pass up, both for catching and for eating. \n\nAnd, ice fishing the Great East Lake watershed gives an easy way to move your gear to other good locations. While that is no guarantee you'll bring home the bacon, there's a darn good chance you will not have an empty creel! \n\nGoing in the opposite direction and heading north toward the waters in and above the White Mountains, fishing Moore Reservoir for both pike and huge brown and rainbow trout is another almost guarantee of bringing home some good eating fish. \n\nThere are parts of the Commerford Dam tailwaters that often don't ice over, but fishing them that time of year is fraught with dangers. Icy splashover along the shorelines is very slippery and, when out on the ice pack, you have to drill sample holes before setting gear as the currents can undercut the ice cover and make a very chancy place to drop your bait! \n\nBut the pike can be plentiful and huge and in this particular water the Dickster caught and released the largest brown trout of his life, even larger than some of those Lake Ontario browns we've caught, and we caught it on the simplest fishing gear - light line and sinker and nightcrawler! \n\nSo if you get bored fishing some of the hard-fished and crowded ice of some local ponds or lakes, try fishing a border pond. It's a fresh experience and one that will stretch out your wings for better things! \n\nDrop us an email at DoDuckInn@aol.com and get out there and get you some. \n\nDick Pinney 's column appears weekly in the New Hampshire Sunday News.

Marjorie Porter , D-Hillsborough, the assistant Democratic floor leader, raised an objection to comments made earlier in the session by Rep. Kurt Wuelper, R-Stratham, which she called \"offensive not only to me but to many other members of this body, including our naturalized citizens.\" \n\nWuelper was speaking for the majority against HB 206, a bill establishing a special marriage officiant license that would authorize any individual to perform a single, specified marriage. \n\n\"This is something that recognizes people are being more creative in the ways they are getting married,\" said State Rep. Renny Cushing , D-Hampton, using examples of a \"special uncle\" or \"best buddy from the service\" as possible officiants. \n\nThat best buddy or special uncle would have to apply for a one-time license from the Secretary of State to conduct the wedding, and turn that license in to the town clerk along with the marriage license after the ceremony. \n\nIn explaining committee opposition to the measure (which failed 204-158), Wuelper cited the concern of town clerks, who worried about getting the proper paperwork. \n\n\"The question we thought was, well, what if anybody could do it (emphasis on ANYBODY). What if someone from, I don't know, Oregon or Bothwasswana (Botswana) or Zambia could come and perform a ceremony? What's the chances we could have more problems and the marriage not be officially recognized?\" \n\nPorter alluded to \"this time of powerful rhetoric\" in reacting to Wuelper's presentation. \n\n\"For four terms now I have served in this honorable House, and I have always been proud of our decorum,\" she said. \"However, today during one of the floor speeches, I heard words and tone of voice that was offensive not only to me but to many other members of the body, including our naturalized citizens who are here as part of our House.\" \n\nIronically, Wuelper's comments came as \"Welcoming New Hampshire\" was setting up for its State House Day and luncheon for lawmakers in the State House cafeteria. The event focused around the work the organization is doing for the immigrant community in the state. \n\nSpeaker Shawn Jasper , R-Hudson, said Porter's points were \"well taken\" and he apologized to the House. He said he missed that portion of Wuelper's remarks because he was being distracted by another House member at the time. \n\n\"We have to be mindful of what we say and how we say it,\" Jasper said. \n\nAccording to Porter, it was not only what Wuelper said but how he said it. You can watch the video of the session on the State House website and come to your own conclusions, but she characterized his tone as uncharacteristically \"scornful and arrogant\" for the House. \n\n\"The Speaker apologized and I accepted his apology,\" she said. \n\nPorter said she was motivated to speak up by recent events. \n\n\"I think when we're seeing things like the signs that were posted in Manchester recently, and the things that have been happening at Jewish community centers around the country, and seeing racial slurs and ethnic slurs tweeted out or said out loud, we have to speak up.\" \n\nWuelper said at first he didn't even know Porter was alluding to his remarks. \n\n\"When I heard her say that, I had no idea what she was talking about,\" he said. \"I was just thinking of places that are far away. It has nothing to do with anyone.\" \n\nWhen asked about the Speaker's apology, Wuelper said, \"I'm not sure his apology was for what I said, as much as it was for his not noticing it,\" which the Speaker's office confirmed. \n\nEdelblut hearing set \n\nThe Executive Council has set the date for its public hearing on the nomination of Frank Edelblut to be the next commissioner of education. \n\nEdelblut, the second-place finisher in the GOP primary for governor, is likely to face some tough questioning from Democrats who have already raised concerns about his lack of experience in education administration. \n\nHe has the support of conservative organizations such as Americans for Prosperity and Cornerstone Action. \n\nThe hearing is scheduled for 1 p.m. on Tuesday, Jan. 31, in the Executive Council chambers at the State House. \n\nMore on marijuana \n\nWhile most of the debate in the Legislature on marijuana up to this point has focused on expanding the state's therapeutic cannabis law, measures that call for legalization or decriminalization will be up for debate on Wednesday, Feb. 1. \n\nHB 215, creating a study commission to consider legalization and regulation of adult use, will be heard at 10 a.m. by the House Ways and Means Committee. \n\nHB 640, which calls for decriminalizing possession of one ounce or less and reducing the penalty from a misdemeanor to a violation punishable by fines ranging from $100 to $350, will be heard by the House Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee in Representatives Hall at 1 p.m., along with HB 656. \n\nHB 656 also calls for legalization and regulation, but includes home cultivation of six plants, with 70 percent of tax revenues dedicated to property tax relief, and 30 percent to the Alcohol Abuse Prevention and Treatment Fund (which is also used for drug abuse treatment). \n\n. \nSaying 'no' to home rule \nOpponents of high-voltage transmission lines such as the Northern Pass or the Seacoast Reliability Project were dealt a setback in the Legislature on Wednesday, as the Committee on Municipal and County Government voted unanimously to kill HB 145, a bill to give cities and towns authority over utility line expansion projects. \n\nIt would have prohibited high voltage transmission lines from being located in any municipality without a vote of approval by the municipality. \n\nThe vote to recommend killing the bill was unanimous, according to Jim Belanger, R-Hollis. \n\n\"It provides one town veto power over what the two towns on either side of it want,\" he said. \"Also, it establishes home rule, and New Hampshire is not a home rule state.\" \n\nCities and towns in New Hampshire have no power other than what is granted by the state Legislature through \"enabling\" legislation. \n\ndsolomon@unionleader.com \n..","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Dave Solomon's State House Dome Offense taken by rep. over wedding talk","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Hillsborough","zipCode":"03108","state":"New Hampshire","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Manchester","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Union Leader","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169681010","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2"},"name":"Union Leader","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.unionleader.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.unionleader.com/storyimage/UL/20170129/NEWS0604/170129217/EP/1/1/EP-170129217.jpg?q=99","https://goo.gl/rnuUXO"],"sequenceId":"695193862217","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T02:14:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:11:32Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Avocados could be a lot more expensive next year, if President Trump gets his way. \n\nPress Secretary Sean Spicer last week threw out a half-baked plan to impose a 20 percent tariff on all goods imported from Mexico to the United States to help pay for a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border. \n\nSpicer was just spit-balling with the press about ways the Trump administration could follow through on his empty campaign promise to \"make Mexico pay\" for the wall. That's a reckless way to make policy, and the 20 percent tariff should never make it to Congress, much less into law. \n\nSuch a ludicrous idea would in fact make Americans pay for the wall, in several ways. \n\nTrump does not practice the \"Buy American\" ideas he touted in his inaugural, outsourcing production of his signature clothing line and importing foreign workers to staff his swanky resorts. \n\nBut even if he weren't a hypocrite, he would still be wrong. \n\nTrump's outdated ideas of trade were debunked centuries ago by Adam Smith, and countless economists since. Trade barriers don't just protect domestic industries from foreign competition. They protect them from the choices of American consumers, millions of individuals making billions of decisions to buy better, cheaper products. \n\nThe USDA reports that nearly half of the fruits and vegetables imported into the U.S. come from Mexico. With a high tariff, some consumers would pay more for Mexican produce. Some agricultural production could shift back to the U.S., again at higher prices. And some would move to other foreign countries. \n\nWe could be gobbling Guatemalan guacamole next year as we watch Tom Brady play in his eighth Super Bowl. \n\nPunitive tariffs like the one Spicer suggested are a terrible idea. They punish American consumers, distort the free market, and imperil millions of American jobs that rely on trade. \n\n.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Tax news","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Mexico news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"A crack in the wall Tariff idea is terrible","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Hillsborough","zipCode":"03108","state":"New Hampshire","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Manchester","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Union Leader","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169681010","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2"},"name":"Union Leader","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.unionleader.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.unionleader.com/storyimage/UL/20170129/OPINION01/170129224/AR/0/AR-170129224.jpg?q=80"],"sequenceId":"695193862603","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T01:33:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:11:32Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

WICKHAM \nNew Hampshire Sunday News \n \nA killer's aliases The man who was Denise Beaudin's boyfriend when she disappeared in 1981 went by many different names in different places, authorities say: \nRobert T. Evans: New Hampshire,1977-1981 \n\nCurtis Mayo Kimball: Los Alamitos and Cypress, Calif., 1984-1986 \n\nGordon Curtis Jenson: Santa Cruz County, Calif.,1986 \n\nGerald E. Mockerman: Franklin County, Idaho, and San Luis Obispo, Calif., 1987 \n\nLawrence William Vanner: Richmond, Calif., 2001-2002 \n\nEvans died of natural causes in prison in California in 2010. \n \n\nWhen police in Contra Costa County, Calif., questioned the man calling himself Lawrence William Vanner about his missing girlfriend, he insisted she was fine and was in Oregon. \n\nBut detectives noticed he spoke of her in the past tense. \n\nIt was September of 2002 and friends and relatives of Eunsoon Jun, a petite, dark-haired woman who had moved to California from Korea, were worried. No one had seen or heard from her in months, according to a 2002 affidavit by a California homicide detective. \n\nEunsoon met Larry Vanner when he answered her ad for a handyman, a cousin told an NBC reporter. He moved in with her, and the two later held a commitment ceremony in a friend's backyard. \n\nBut according to the affidavit, Eunsoon had told a close friend they had argued over finances and about having children: She wanted them; Larry did not. \n\nAfter Eunsoon disappeared, Vanner told some friends that she had gone to Virginia to take care of her mother; he told others she was in Oregon, working on a cabin they were building there. \n\nLater, Vanner told investigators that Eunsoon didn't want to be found, but that she was alive and in Oregon. \n\nWhen they ran his fingerprints, they learned that Vanner was Curtis Mayo Kimball, who was wanted for skipping parole 12 years earlier. \n\nA pre-sentence probation report revealed that Kimball had been arrested in 1989 for child abandonment and molestation. \n\nKimball had been living in a trailer park in Scotts Valley, Calif., in 1986 under the name Gordon Curtis Jenson. With him was a 4- or 5-year-old girl named Lisa. \n\nA neighboring couple had gotten friendly with Jenson and his little girl. When the neighbor mentioned that her daughter was having trouble conceiving, she was shocked when Jenson suggested she could adopt Lisa, according to the report. \n\nJenson gave the child to them for a two week \"trial period.\" \n\n\"Jenson said Lisa's mother had been killed in a traffic accident in Texas, but he told other people that Lisa's mother (his wife) was killed in a robbery in Texas,\" the report stated. \n\nThe woman's daughter and her husband wanted to keep the child and contacted a lawyer, who advised them to get Lisa's birth certificate and her mother's death certificate. \n\nBut Jenson had fled, leaving Lisa behind. \n\nLisa was placed in a foster home and later adopted by a police officer. \n\nAfter Kimball was arrested in California in 1989, he pleaded guilty to the child abandonment charge. The molestation charges were dismissed because Lisa's adoptive parents did not want her to have to testify in court, according to the court documents. \n\nKimball went to jail and was paroled in 1990. He fled the next day and spent 12 years as a fugitive, until he surfaced in Contra Costa County as Larry Vanner. \n\n\"The authorities were never able to determine whether or not Lisa was Jenson's biological daughter, and there was suspicion that she may have been kidnapped but that was never proven either. To (this) day that information is not known,\" the probation report concluded. \n\nPolice searched Eunsoon Jun's home on Sept. 26, 2002. In a dirt basement, they found a pile of clean kitty litter. \n\nAn investigator noticed some tools near the pile - a saw, an axe and a meat cleaver - that appeared to have hair on them. \n\nThen they saw a woman's sandal sticking out of the pile. \n\nInvestigators had found Eunsoon Jun. \n\nVanner - the man who called himself Bob Evans when he lived in Manchester, N.H., in the late 1970s and early 1980s - was convicted of her murder in 2003 and sentenced to 15 years to life in prison. \n\nHe died in prison on Dec. 28, 2010, having never disclosed who the child Lisa was and where she was from. \n\n.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Finding the Allenstown killer Calif. case shows killer's lies","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Hillsborough","zipCode":"03108","state":"New Hampshire","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Manchester","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Union Leader","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169681010","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2"},"name":"Union Leader","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.unionleader.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695193863253","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T03:08:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:11:32Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

In a few hours, he would be sworn in as America's 45th President. But as the hours ticked away, his mood remained grim. \n\nSome people knew what was bothering him - Hillary Clinton had beaten Trump in the popular vote - but they could not believe that Trump was seriously bothered by it. They were wrong. \n\nAs he stood atop the dramatic stone steps on the west side of the U.S. Capitol, cameras transmitted his expression around the world. There was no smile on his face. He looked troubled, sullen and ill-tempered. \n\nThe headlines of the nation's media were extraordinarily candid about what was troubling Trump: He believed there had been massive voter fraud by people who had sneaked in to the United States illegally and voted for Clinton. \n\nTheir headlines were brutal: \n\n\"Trump Repeats Lie About Popular Vote in Meeting With Lawmakers,\" said The New York Times. \n\n\"Trump believes millions voted illegally ... but provides no proof,\" said CNN. \n\n\"Trump's False Claim,\" headlined \"NBC Nightly News.\" \n\nNor did many members of Trump's party back up his claims.

Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said: \"To continue to suggest that the 2016 election was conducted in a fashion that millions of people voted illegally undermines faith in our democracy.\" \n\nHe continued: \"It's not coming from a candidate for the office. It's coming from the man who holds the office. So I am begging the President, 'Share with us the information you have about this, or please stop saying it.'\" \n\nJesse Jackson was also troubled. The result was not what he had been expecting. \"I was surprised at the count and had a down feeling,\" Jackson told me. \"But in a struggle, you drown when you stop kicking.\" \n\nJackson continued, \"The victory can be legal but without moral legitimacy.\" To Jackson, the problem with the vote was not that undocumented people voted but that the votes of minorities here legally, especially black people, were suppressed. \n\n\"The presidential campaign had been very unusually violent,\" Jackson said. \"It was a divisive campaign full of race targeting. People in Mexico were going to be stopped by a wall; Muslims were going to be kept from coming in; there was a whole campaign saying Barack (Obama) had not been born here. \n\n\"And this was the atmosphere we had to campaign in. The Republicans tipped their lances in the air and cried 'voter fraud, voter fraud.' But every legitimate study found there has been not vote fraud but vote suppression. \n\n\"Precincts were moved so people didn't know where to vote. Sunday voting was ended in some places, as was early voting and campus voting.\" \n\n\"The black vote was being driven down and the white vote driven up. The Electoral College was based on people being counted but not allowed to vote.\" \n\nJackson is historically correct. The Electoral College was created not to preserve the power of small states or to protect the presidency from a populace too uneducated to choose a President. \n\nThe creation of the Electoral College by James Madison, a slave owner and shrewd politician, was all about preserving the power of slavery. \n\nIn a one-person, one-vote system, the North would outnumber the South in voting because though the slaves would count as part of the South's population (three-fifths of each slave to be counted as one person), no slaves would be allowed to vote. This nullified that voting power of the 500,000 or so slaves in the South. \n\nAfter slavery was abolished, Jim Crow laws were passed by state legislatures to keep blacks from voting. \"The same Confederates who had fought to deny blacks the vote immediately went into voter suppression,\" Jackson said. \n\n\"Today the ultimate scheme is voter suppression. That is the signal being given to Southern governors.\" \n\nJackson, not a close friend of Clinton's, believes she ran the right campaign but had no chance of winning. \"Only by the archaic system of the Electoral College was she denied the presidency,\" he said. \"It is a system based on slavery. It is legal, but it is morally illegitimate.\" \n\nJackson did not go to the inauguration, but he did go to the enormous Women's March on Washington the next day. \"It reminded me so much of the '63 march,\" Jackson said. That's quite a compliment, considering the 1963 March on Washington featured Martin Luther King Jr.'s famous \"I Have a Dream\" speech. \n\n\"We were down, but there was a sense we were going up,\" Jackson said of this year's march. \"There was a sense of joy. \n\n\"People found common ground. Trump can either look at those crowds with contempt and fear or he can look with hope.\" \n\nIn 1941, Franklin D. Roosevelt met with A. Philip Randolph (a labor and civil rights leader), and Randolph gave FDR 10 demands to end segregation. \n\nRoosevelt read them and said: \"I agree with everything you said. Now go out and make me do it.\" \n\nThe story may be partially myth, but Randolph achieved much of his agenda. Today, Jackson wants Trump to look at the vote of 2016 and see the evil of voter suppression and what could be achieved by ending it. \n\n. \n\"The Women's March was an opportunity,\" Jackson said, \"not a threat.\" \nRoger Simon is Politico's chief political columnist. \n..","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Black interest news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"ROGER SIMON Jesse Jackson 'You drown when you stop kicking'","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Hillsborough","zipCode":"03108","state":"New Hampshire","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Manchester","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Union Leader","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169681010","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2"},"name":"Union Leader","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.unionleader.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.unionleader.com/storyimage/UL/20170129/OPINION02/170129219/EP/1/1/EP-170129219.jpg?q=99"],"sequenceId":"695193863550","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T02:14:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:11:32Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

WILL \n \n\nIN 2013, a college student assigned to research a deadly substance sought help via Twitter: \"I can't find the chemical and physical properties of sarin gas someone please help me.\" An expert at a security consulting firm tried to be helpful, telling her that sarin is not gas. She replied, \"yes the (expletive) it is a gas you ignorant (expletive). sarin is a liquid & can evaporate ... shut the (expletive) up.\" \n\nTom Nichols, professor at the U.S. Naval War College and the Harvard Extension School, writing in The Chronicle Review, says such a \"storm of outraged ego\" is an increasingly common phenomenon among students who, having been taught to regard themselves as peers of their teachers, \"take correction as an insult.\" Nichols relates this to myriad intellectual viruses thriving in academia. Carried by undereducated graduates, these viruses infect the nation's civic culture. \n\nSoon the results include the presidential megaphone being used to amplify facially preposterous assertions, e.g., that upward of 5 million illegal votes were cast in 2016. A presidential minion thinks this assertion is justified because it is the President's \"long-standing belief.\" \n\n\"College, in an earlier time,\" Nichols writes, \"was supposed to be an uncomfortable experience because growth is always a challenge,\" replacing youthful simplicities with adult complexities. Today, college involves the \"pampering of students as customers,\" particularly by grade inflation in a context of declining academic rigor: A recent study showed \"A\" to be the most commonly awarded grade, 30 percent more frequent than in 1960. And a 2011 University of Chicago study found that 45 percent of students said that in the previous semester none of their courses required more than 20 pages of writing and 32 percent had no class that required more than 40 pages of reading in a week. \n\n\"Unearned praise and hollow successes,\" Nichols says, \"build a fragile arrogance in students that can lead them to lash out at the first teacher or employer who dispels that illusion, a habit that carries over into a resistance to believe anything inconvenient or challenging in adulthood.\" A habit no doubt intensified when adults in high places speak breezily of \"alternative facts.\" \n\n\"Rather than disabuse students of their intellectual solipsism,\" Nichols says, \"the modern university reinforces it,\" producing students given to \"taking offense at everything while believing anything.\" Many colleges and universities, competing for tuition dollars \"too often drawn thoughtlessly from an inexhaustible well of loans,\" market a \"college experience\" rather than an education. The experience \"turns into five and, increasingly, six (years).\" Nichols notes that \"the fragility of 21st century students\" results from \"the swaddling environment of the modern university\" that \"infantilizes students\" who demand \"trigger warnings\" and \"safe spaces.\" \n\nMuch attention has been given to the non-college-educated voters who rallied to Trump. Insufficient attention is given to the role of the college miseducated. They, too, are complicit in our current condition because they emerged from their expensive \"college experiences\" neither disposed nor able to conduct civil, informed arguments. They are thus disarmed when confronted by political people who consider evidence, data and reasoning to be mere conveniences and optional. \n\nFor all the talk in high places about emancipating the many from \"the elites,\" political philosopher Walter Berns was right: The question always is not whether elites will govern but which elites will. And a republic's challenge is to increase the likelihood that the many will consent to governance by worthy elites. So, how is our republic doing? \n\nWhat is most alarming about the President and his accomplices in the dissemination of factoids is not that they do not know this or that. And it is not that they do not know what they do not know. Rather, it is that they do not know what it is to know something. \n\nThe republican form of government rests on representation: The people do not decide issues, they decide who will decide. Who, that is, will conduct the deliberations that \"refine and enlarge\" public opinion (Madison, Federalist 10). This system of filtration is vitiated by a plebiscitary presidency, the occupant of which claims a direct, unmediated, almost mystical connection with \"the people.\" \n\nSoon, presidential enablers, when challenged about their employer's promiscuous use of \"alternative facts,\" will routinely use last week's \"justification\" of the illegal voting factoid: It is the President's \"long-standing belief,\" so there. In his intellectual solipsism, he, too, takes correction as an insult. He resembles many of his cultured despisers in the academy more than he or they realize. \n\nGeorge Will's email address is georgewill@washpost.com. \n\n.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"George F.

The building was designed by Edward L. Tilton of New York and Edgar A. P. Newcomb of Honolulu, and dedicated on November 18, 1914, to the memory of Elenora Blood Carpenter , the late wife of Frank Pierce Carpenter , president of the Amoskeag Paper Mill. \n\nThe city's main library, now entering its 103rd year of service to Queen City residents, has been closed to the public since Jan. 16 while crews installed new flooring throughout all public areas on the 1st and 2nd floors of the structure, and new tiling put down in the Rotunda. \n\nManchester City Library Director Denise M. van Zanten reports the building will reopen to patrons on Monday, after crews finished work on the main floor last Thursday, and put all pieces of furniture back where they belong on Friday. \n\n\"We will have to restrict access to the second floor and the Rotunda at first,\" said van Zanten. \"The new tile in the Rotunda requires the grout to set until Wednesday, so we don't have any staining or damage to the installation.\" \n\nAccording to van Zanten, work on the second floor will be completed later this week. \n\n\"Library staff will have access to retrieve materials as needed for patrons from the Art and New Hampshire Rooms\" while work continues, she said. \n\nAs is sometimes the case with projects involving historic buildings, the renovation work uncovered a surprise equal to the twists appearing on the pages of the many mysteries stacked on its shelves. \n\n\"One big surprise was finding original marble in the microfilm corner of the building,\" said van Zanten. \"While tearing up the old carpeting in the Microfilm Reading Room workers made a very pleasant discovery. After the old carpet was removed and then a layer of battleship linoleum gone, workers discovered that the original marble flooring was still there, hidden away for ages and waiting to be enjoyed again.\" \n\nWhy would someone cover marble flooring? The best guess, said van Zanten, is to reduce noise levels. \n\n\"Back in the day, libraries were expected to be very quiet,\" she said. \n\nThe marble flooring is going to be cleaned, restored and \"brought back to its original glory,\" said van Zanten. \n\nAccording to van Zanten, flooring contractors worked with her to address areas of the building that had subfloor issues such as soft spots and holes, which led to them skim coat over a concrete sub base to create a clean and solid, level floor to install new carpet tiles over. \n\n\"The Rotunda lost its 1980s terracotta look with new ceramic tiles installed in a color tone more historically accurate,\" said van Zanten. \"A new pattern was put together by Tarra Caikauskas of the Facilities Division. The new pattern is a compilation of other patterns found in the original marble floors in the building.\" \n\nWork was also done to upgrade the electric service in the building and replace circuit breakers, \"one of which was original,\" according to van Zanten. Staff also completed a full inventory of the main library's children's collection, and are working on a project to digitize photos with the Manchester Historic Association. \n\nAn added bonus of the work at the Carpenter Library, said van Zanten, is the number of patrons who visited the West Manchester Branch Library, and saw the restoration work done there last year. \n\n\"The usage of the branch has been impressive during the two weeks the main library has been closed, and we are glad patrons have been able to see all the improvements there,\" said van Zanten. \"We look forward to the public's reaction when we reopen the main library.\" \n\n- - - - - \n\nCity school board members voted last week to ask Supt. of Schools Dr. Bolgen Vargas to send letters to state legislators in Concord expressing support for three bills that have been introduced in the current legislative session. \n\nThe bills are: \n\nHB 155-FN: Relative to funding for kindergarten programs - This bill increases funding for pupils attending full - day kindergarten programs; \n\nHB 339: Relative to reimbursement of transportation costs for students attending a career and technical education. This bill, filed by State Rep. and Ward 9 alderman Barbara Shaw , amends the definition of \"sending district\" to allow reimbursement for the cost of a student attending a career and technical education program in the school district in which the student resides; \n\nand HB 525-FN: Relative to stabilization grants for education. This bill removes the annual 4 percent reduction in stabilization grants made to certain municipalities and provides that the stabilization grant to a municipality in fiscal year 2018 shall be the same as in fiscal year 2017. \n\n- - - - - \n\nCity Police Chief Nick Willard recently welcomed members of the O'Neil family to view the bail commissioner's room at police headquarters, which was dedicated to Denis \"Denny\" O'Neil last April in honor of his 45 years of service to the department. Family members were unable to make the trip last spring, but on Dec. 30 Alderman At Large Dan O'Neil accompanied his Uncle Denis, as well as many other family members including Denis' children, grandchildren, nieces and nephews. \n\n. \nO'Neil started in 1971 under Chief J ohn A. Stips , who served from 1969-1974, and retired under Chief Willard in 2016. \nHe worked in three different police stations under eight different chiefs of police - Stips, Chief Thomas J. King (1975-1990), Chief Louis J. Craig (1990-1994), Chief Peter R. Favreau (1994-1996), Mark L. Driscol l (1996-2003), Chief John A. Jaskolka (2003-2008), Chief David J.

Her decision comes as DCYF is under intense scrutiny in the Legislature and in the courts. \n\nThe agency is facing lawsuits over its handling of abuse cases; an outside review was ordered after two children under DCYF supervision died at the hands of abusive parents; a legislative Commission to Review Child Abuse Fatalities has been holding hearings for the past year; and the Legislature just appointed a joint House-Senate Task Force to recommend funding and legislation to address the situation. \n\nHer replacement is going to be walking into one of the toughest jobs in state government. \n\n\"We've always had to operate within the allocation that we had,\" she said of limited state resources, \"and one of the things we became pretty good at was managing with the resources we had. Some would say what we managed to do was create workarounds.\" \n\nBut those \"workarounds\" began to falter in 2014, the year 3-year-old Brielle Gage of Nashua was beaten to death by her mother, now serving 45 years to life in prison, despite DCYF involvement. \n\nWhat we've seen over the past three years is that the combination of turnover in staff, increased numbers of protective reports, increased numbers of cases, and the opioid crisis, created this perfect storm of how are we going to manage this,\" she said in an interview with reporters after leaving a meeting of the child abuse fatalities commission on Friday. \n\n\"The conversations within DCYF about what we needed to do in order to begin to shift things started in the beginning of 2015,\" she said. \n\nGov. Maggie Hassan ordered the outside evaluation in the fall of 2015, which resulted in a highly critical report released at the end of 2016, citing the fact that too many abuse cases are deemed unfounded by DCYF, and too few abusive parents are brought into Family Court. \n\nJudge's testimony \n\nJudge Edward Gordon of the Franklin District Court testified before the commission on Friday that he was somewhat baffled by the fact that so few cases are brought to his court, where he said DCYF prevails 90 to 95 percent of the time. \n\n\"With regard to the perception that DCYF isn't going to succeed (in court), frankly I'm not very enthusiastic about that,\" he said. \"I don't think there's any judge out there discouraging DCYF from bringing cases into court.\" \n\nGordon said courts are starting to see more cases. \n\n\"Up until a year ago, it just kept getting slower and slower, and we couldn't figure out why,\" he said, \"but last year, for whatever reason, whether it's the scrutiny or something else, the number of cases in my court doubled.\" \n\nBartlett attributed the failure of the agency to prosecute more cases, with 85 percent of reports deemed \"unfounded,\" to the fact that funding levels for the agency have not been adjusted to reflect the new realities. \n\n\"As the report indicated, we are immediately responding to safety issues, in determining if a child is in imminent danger,\" she said. \"But because our resources preclude us from doing the comprehensive assessments that enable us to really dig into what's happening with that family, in order for us to ascertain what actions should be taken, you don't move forward on those.\" \n\nThe results can sometimes be tragic. \n\n\"What ends up happening is you get multiple reports on the same family until we say we've got to take action,\" said Bartlett. \"With additional resources, you can do those comprehensive assessments, determine the services that are needed and make a determination about bringing them forward in court.\" \n\nPush to be proactive \n\nJudge Gordon urged the DCYF to become more proactive and not wait until cases reach a crisis level, but Bartlett said the agency is basically in a triage situation, dealing with the most severe cases first, with few resources left for anything else. \n\n\"The fact that we don't have the fiscal resources (money) to offer voluntary services has impacted our ability to serve families and bring them forward,\" she said. \"Up until 2011, when we were able to offer voluntary services, about 10 percent of our cases did not involve a finding or court.\" \n\nWhen asked why the department did not press for additional funding sooner, Bartlett quoted DHHS Commissioner Jeffrey Meyers, who became head of Health and Human Services in January 2016. \n\n\"I really don't want to go back to the past and what happened with past administrations,\" she said. \n\nGordon agreed with much of Bartlett's assessment in his testimony. \n\n\"Frankly I'm not sure legislative reform is necessary,\" he said. \"I think the underlying issues are staffing and the opportunity to investigate and follow up with families for intervention.\" \n\n. \nBartlett said of the 942 children currently in foster care, parental substance abuse is involved in 50 percent of the cases, if not more. \nDespite the challenges, the outgoing DCYF director says she is proud of the agency and its staff. \n\n\"I've been with DCYF for 28 and a half years,\" she said. \"I wouldn't have stayed if I didn't feel over the years that we have made a difference.\" \n\ndsolomon@unionleader.com \n..","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"DCYF chief laments 'perfect storm,' explosion of NH cases","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Hillsborough","zipCode":"03108","state":"New Hampshire","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Manchester","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Union Leader","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169681010","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2"},"name":"Union Leader","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.unionleader.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695193864618","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T02:44:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:11:32Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Manchester's Paige Capistran was also in on the act for the Huskies, as the starting defenseman helped blank the Wildcats (11-14-1, 9-8-1 WHEA), who failed to convert despite getting off 29 shots. \n\nSalve Regina 4, New England College 2: In Henniker, the Pilgrims (5-13-1, 3-8 NEHC) traded a pair of goals with the Seahawks before Salve Regina went for two unanswered goals to seal their win. Rachel Vigliano scored both of NEC's goals. \n\nColgate 6, Dartmouth 1: In Hanover, Kennedy Ottenbreit's seventh goal of the season was the lone bright spot for the Big Green (5-17-0, 3-13-0 ECAC). Ottenbreit's tally was sandwiched between a pair three-goal stretches for Colgate. \n\nSt. Anselm 3, Connecticut College 1: In Manchester, Kaitlyn Spillane found the net twice in a one-minute span early in the second period to cap the scoring and the win for the Hawks (15-2-2). Kaley Campbell scored a first-period goal for St. Anselm while goalie Maddie Scavotto stopped 16 shots. \n\nMen's basketball \n\nUMBC 105, UNH 103 (2OT): In Baltimore, Tanner Leissner's career-high 36 points was not enough to get the Wildcats (14-8, 5-3 AE) past the Retrievers. UNH led 92-89 in the first extra period before UMBC's Will Darley hit a game-tying trey at the buzzer to force a second overtime. An 11-4 UMBC run over the final three minutes of the second overtime sunk UNH, which got double-doubles from Iba Camara (24 points, 14 rebounds) and Jaleen Smith (21 points, 10 assists). \n\nSNHU 79, Pace 67: In Pleasantville, N.Y., Amherst's Devin Gilligan was at it again for the Penmen with a game-high 25 points. SNHU (15-4, 11-3 NE-10) got its first lead of the night four minutes into the second half before later going on a 12-3 run that broke the game open. Chris Walters added 20 points for the Penmen, including 15 in the second half. \n\nSt. Anselm 88, New Haven 57: In Manchester, the Hawks (12-6, 8-6 NE-10) ran out to a 22-point lead at halftime and never looked back. Ball movement aided St. Anselm's cause, as the Hawks accrued 23 assists while dropping 32 field goals. Tim Guers scored a game-high 31 points and Taylor Fortin put together a double-double with 22 points and 11 helpers. Londonderry's Cody Ball pitched in seven points for St. Anselm. \n\nCornell 75, Dartmouth 62: At Ithaca, N.Y., Dartmouth's Evan Boudreaux led both teams with 23 points and 14 rebounds, but the Big Red had four players in double figures. \n\nKeene State 85, UMass Boston 80: In Boston, the Owls overcame an eight-point deficit with five minutes to play to force overtime, where their defense helped hold off the Beacons.

Jason Jones registered 22 points and 21 rebounds for NEC. \n\nHusson 98, Colby-Sawyer 90: In Bangor, Maine, Manchester's Jourdain Bell erupted for a career-high 34 points, but it wasn't enough for the Chargers. Franklin's Dana Bean offered up 16 points behind Bell for Colby-Sawyer (8-11, 5-7 NAC), which trailed by double digits much of the contest. \n\nDaniel Webster 63, Regis 59: In Weston, Mass., Jared Harrington, Angelo Adon and Antwaun Boyd combined for 39 points in the win for the Eagles 11-7, 5-4 NECC). Daniel Webster led by 15 at halftime and shot 62 percent from 3-point range for the game compared to Regis' six percent. \n\nLe Moyne 69, Franklin Pierce 57: In Rindge, the Ravens shot just 35 percent from the field and never led after losing a two-point lead halfway through the first half. Matt Banton (17 points) and Donte Gittens (13 points) led Franklin Pierce (10-10, 7-7 NE-10) in scoring. \n\nWomen's basketball \n\nUNH 60, UMBC 50: In Durham, a 17-2 fourth-quarter spurt highlighted the comeback for the Wildcats, who trailed 37-32 after three quarters. Kat Fogarty's double-double (12 points, 11 rebounds) pushed UNH (18-3, 8-0 AE) to its 12th straight victory. Carlie Pogue added 16 points for the UNH and Londoderry's Aliza Simpson dropped a trio of 3-pointers. \n\nSt. Anselm 62, New Haven 59 (OT): In Manchester, Candace Andrews' layup and ensuing free throw with 11 seconds left in overtime were the difference for the Hawks (13-7). Neither team held a lead of more than eight points throughout the contest. Andrews scored a game-high 21 points to lead the Hawks while Bedford's Ali Glennon added 11 points and Durham's Sara Messler pulled down 12 rebounds. \n\nSNHU 63, Pace 55: In Pleasantville, N.Y., Sara Ryan and Kylie Lorenzen dropped 13 points apiece to help the Penmen (9-12, 4-10 NE-10) end a four-game losing skid. A pair of 7-0 runs in the third and fourth quarter, respectively, helped SNHU breakaway. \n\n. \nDartmouth 84, Cornell 74: At Hanover, Fannie Szabo led all scorers with 23 points as the Big Green took an 18-point lead at halftime and notched their first Ivy League win of the season. \nAndi Norman scored 14 points and Olivia Smith added 12 for the Big Green. Megan Leduc led Cornell with 19. \n\nKeene State 66, UMass Boston 55: In Boston, the difference for the Owls (12-7, 6-3 LEC) came from a 10-0 run in the second quarter, giving them an early 15-point edge. Stephanie D'Annolfo's double-double (14 points, 11 rebounds) led Keene State, which also got 11 points from Hudson's Sandi Purcell. \n\nNew England College 62, Maine Maritime 60: In Castine, Maine, Utshana Durham finished a layup as time expired to send the Pilgrims home a winner. Rene Hudson dropped a team-high 20 points for NEC (15-4, 9-3 NAC) while Durham collected 11. \n\nHusson 90, Colby-Sawyer 71: In Bangor, Maine, the Chargers (13-6, 8-4 NAC) lost a lead midway through the first quarter and never recovered. Colby-Sawyer picked up a game-high 27 points from Amanda Calvo. \n\nRegis 102, Daniel Webster 47: In Weston, Mass., the Eagles were outscored 58-17 in the second half. Escarlin Renoso's 16 points led the Daniel Webster (6-12, 4-7 NECC). \n\nLe Moyne 64, Franklin Pierce 56: In Rindge, Le Moyne's 20-10 fourth quarter sunk the Ravens (2-17, 0-14 NE-10). Mikayla Deguire posted 23 points and 10 rebounds in the loss. \n\nMen's hockey \n\nUMass Boston 3, Daniel Webster 0: In Nashua, Daniel Webster goalie Anthony D'Urso set a program record with 71 saves for the Eagles (1-18-1) in the loss. \n\nDartmouth 4, Cornell 2: At Ithaca, N.Y., Alex Jasiek scored two third-period power play goals 62 seconds apart to lead the Big Green. Troy Crema added an empty-netter, and Cam Roth scored for Dartmouth (8-11-3, 5-8-2 ECAC). \n\nMatt Nuttle and Matt Buckles scored first-period goals for Cornell. \n..","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Education news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"NH College Roundup NH trio leads Northeastern over Wildcats","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Hillsborough","zipCode":"03108","state":"New Hampshire","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Manchester","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Union Leader","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169681010","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2"},"name":"Union Leader","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.unionleader.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695193865236","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:55:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:11:32Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

After graduating from the University of Rhode Island in May, he would pursue his master's degree and use his final year of athletic eligibility at Division III Plymouth State University. \n\nThen, the NCAA messed up those plans last week by voting against a proposal that would have allowed students in Caparell's situation to transfer and participate in athletics at any Division III institution. \n\nCaparell's next move is still to be determined. \n\n\"I was really banking on that Division III rule going through,\" he said. \"I was 100 percent going to go to Plymouth. That would have been ideal. I went up there a couple times to visit. It has a good MBA program. affordable and it was close to home. \n\n\"Now I'm kind of starting over again. I'll have to do a little more research and send out film to other schools.\" \n\nCaparell had a rocky career at URI, which changed head coaches after his redshirt freshman season. His best year came in 2014, when he appeared in 10 games and made six starts at quarterback. \n\nCaparell holds the NHIAA record for career passing yards (5,389). He tossed 50 touchdown passes at Bedford, and finished his high school career with 1,222 yards rushing and 23 rushing TDs. \n\nHe said he will likely start contacting Northeast-10 schools to see if there's a good fit. St. Anselm's is not an option because it does not offer a master's program. He said there's no chance he'll return to URI. \n\n\"No. I already got my release,\" he said. \"I have no interest in staying here. I'd like to stay close to home, and I want to go someplace where I can play.\" \n\nMen's basketball \n\nSalem resident Matt Vartanian , a freshman on the Wentworth Institute of Technology men's basketball team, was named the Commonwealth Coast Conference Rookie of the Week for games played from Jan. 16-22. \n\nVartanian averaged 16.5 points, 5.5 rebounds, and 2.5 assists per game while shooting 66.7 percent (14-for-21) from the floor to help the Leopards go 2-0 during the week. Vartanian scored 12 points and finished with three assists in an 86-78 victory at Gordon, and then scored 21 points (on 8-for-11 shooting) and grabbed 10 rebounds in a 71-55 win over Nichols. \n\nThrough 17 games (14 starts) Vartanian was averaging 11.4 points, 6.6 rebounds, and 1.6 assists per game, and was shooting 59.4 percent from the floor. \n\nSwimming and diving \n\nWindham's Connor Hopkins made the Northeast-10 Honor Roll after he won two events and picked up five top-three finishes for St. Michael's College last weekend. He won the 100 free (50.91), anchored the third-place 200 medley relay (1:48.21) and nabbed fifth in the 200 free (1:57.66) during a 154-65 loss to Bentley on Saturday. Hopkins won the 50 free (22.77), was second in the 100 back (57.95) by 0.19 seconds, and led off for the runner-up 400 medley relay (3:52.50) during a 135-65 setback against St. Rose on Sunday. \n\nHopkins is tied for the men's team lead with 10 combined victories and is second in solo wins (seven), trailing the leader by one. \n\nFootball \n\nSophomore running back Mitch Banuskevich (Milford), sophomore running back Tucker Burt (Loudon), freshman wide receiver Mike Collins (Bedford), freshman linebacker D.J.

WICKHAM \nNew Hampshire Sunday News \n  The first barrel was found at Bear Brook State Park in Allenstown in 1985 containing victim number 1, an unidentified woman age 23 to 33, and a female child age 5 to 11, who were related. (NH State Police)   Photos of Bob Evans and Denise Beaudin, pregnant with her daughter, Dawn, in Manchester, circa 1981. (Allenstown Police Department)   Photos of Bob Evans and Denise Beaudin, pregnant with her daughter, Dawn, in Manchester, circa 1981. (Allenstown Police Department) \nA killer's aliases The man who was Denise Beaudin's boyfriend when she disappeared in 1981 went by many different names in different places, authorities say: \nRobert T. Evans: New Hampshire,1977-1981 \n\nCurtis Mayo Kimball: Los Alamitos and Cypress, Calif., 1984-1986 \n\nGordon Curtis Jenson: Santa Cruz County, Calif.,1986 \n\nGerald E. Mockerman: Franklin County, Idaho, and San Luis Obispo, Calif., 1987 \n\nLawrence William Vanner: Richmond, Calif., 2001-2002 \n\nEvans died of natural causes in prison in California in 2010. \n \n\nFour victims, three of them little girls, thrown away like garbage, their bodies wrapped in plastic trash bags, bound with electrical wiring and stuffed in barrels. \n\nFour people with no one to mourn them. \n\nLast week, authorities moved closer to solving a mystery that had confounded them for decades. They now believe a man who killed a California woman in 2002 was responsible for the Allenstown murders - and the likely murder of Denise Beaudin, a 23-year-old Goffstown woman missing since 1981. \n\nStill, so many questions remain unanswered. \n\n What happened to Denise? She left Manchester with her 6-month-old baby Dawn and a man calling himself Bob Evans - the man police now believe was a serial killer.  Where did Evans go between 1981 and 1984, when he showed up in California with Beaudin's daughter, calling her Lisa?  Where was Evans - aka Curtis Kimball, Gordon Jenson (or Jensen), Larry Vanner and Gerald Mockerman - between 1990, when he fled parole in California, and 2002, when he reappeared in the Golden State and went to prison for murdering his girlfriend?  Who - and where - is the mother of his child? The remains of a little girl, believed to be 2-to-4 years old, were found with those of a younger girl in a barrel in Allenstown in 2000. DNA testing proved Evans was her father. Officials fear her mother may be one of his victims too.  Who is the father of the other two children found in Allenstown?  How many victims are there - and where?  \nSenior Assistant Attorney General Jeffery Strelzin last week said police usually start with a victim and look for the murderer. Here, police believe they have their man but the identity of his victims remains illusive. \nAuthorities said they hope to learn more about Evans' whereabouts and activities during that 12-year gap between 1990 and 2002. They know he stole a car in Idaho in 1988, and have cited 11 other states and Quebec, Canada, as other places Evans may have been in the 1970s and 1980s. \n\nBut Detective Sgt. Michael Kokoski of the New Hampshire State Police cold case unit said he's also concerned about where Evans was - and what he did - before he arrived in Manchester in the late 1970s. \n\nEvans would have been in his early to mid-30s back then, and Kokoski said those years are when killers are most likely to commit their crimes. \"The bottom line is, with somebody who has potentially traveled this extensively, really nothing is off the table in terms of the possibilities of where he's been or what he's done.\" \n\nKokoski said it's gratifying to have at least some answers in a case that has vexed officials for decades. But he said there's a lot of work yet to be done, to really solve the case. \n\nCarol Schweitzer of the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children said she's more optimistic than ever that the Allenstown victims will be identified, with the public's help. \"It's just a matter of time,\" she said. \n\nNo bit of information is too minor to report. \"The smallest thing could really help blow this thing wide open.\" \n\nSomeone out there knew this woman, these children, Schweitzer said. The girls had fathers; the adult woman had parents, other relatives. \n\nThey must have gone to doctors, dentists, school. \"I think there are people who remember her, that miss them,\" she said. \"I think we just haven't found them yet. They haven't been able to connect this story to their circumstances and what could have happened to their missing loved ones.\" \n\nKokoski said state police have received about two dozen tips since last Thursday's news conference. \n\nFor those who have worked on the Allenstown case for years, justice means finding the identity of the victims. \n\nShaun Mulholland is town manager in Allenstown; until 2013, he was the town's police chief. He said the inability to identify the woman and children whose bodies were disposed of in barrels has been an \"immense frustration\" all these years. \n\n\"Finding out the identities of the victims is critical,\" Mulholland said. \n\nSchweitzer agreed. \"You had an offender that killed four people, put them in barrels, put them in the woods, hoping that they were never going to be found,\" she said. \"Well, they were. \n\n\"They were found; they were not forgotten.\" \n\nAnd Kokoski vowed, \"This case will not be closed until we know who these victims are and until we're confident we don't have any others out there.\" \n\nswickham@unionleader.com \n.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"NH investigators pledge to identify Bob Evans' victims","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Hillsborough","zipCode":"03108","state":"New Hampshire","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Manchester","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Union Leader","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169681010","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2"},"name":"Union Leader","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.unionleader.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.unionleader.com/storyimage/UL/20170129/NEWS03/170129202/AR/0/AR-170129202.jpg?q=80","http://www.unionleader.com/storyimage/UL/20170129/NEWS03/170129202/EP/1/1/EP-170129202.jpg?q=99","http://www.unionleader.com/storyimage/UL/20170129/NEWS03/170129202/EP/1/2/EP-170129202.jpg?q=99","http://www.unionleader.com/storyimage/UL/20170129/NEWS03/170129202/EP/1/3/EP-170129202.jpg?q=99"],"sequenceId":"695193868620","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:24:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:11:31Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

They're really good role models.\" \n\nSix members of the U.S. Ski Team's Europa Cup men's group raced in both last weekend's events and the UNH carnival. They also trained on the Taft slope Thursday, preparing for their next race circuit, a series of NorAm races in Colorado, which includes some speed events. \n\n\"Thursday's training was absolutely phenomenal,\" said Chad Wolk, assistant coach for the U.S. Ski Team group. \"We had a 12-gate Super-G on Taft, and the guys took eight or nine runs in an hour and a half.\" \n\nThe Mittersill venue has been a cooperative effort between the Franconia club and partner Holderness School, the state-owned ski area at Cannon, and the U.S. Ski and Snowboard Association (USSA). Mittersill was designated a USSA training site in 2015. \n\nBaron's Run, part of the original Mittersill Ski Area, which opened in 1945 and closed in the 1980s, was widened and graded, with snowmaking added. The trail is designed as a giant slalom and Super-G course. The Taft Training Slope, which is wide enough to accommodate multiple training courses simultaneously, and adjacent Valar T-bar were opened this season. \n\n\"Baron's is a really cool hill. It definitely has a European feel,\" said Wolk. \"It's got enough of a pitch and is long enough that you can be creative with the set (of a course). It has some tactical challenges in the middle, then a long flat at the bottom. It penalizes if you do make mistakes.\" \n\nFunding for the $4 million project came from the USSA Facilities Foundation, a federal Northern Borders Regional Commission Development Grant, the Kelly Brush Foundation, the Macomber Family Foundation, and more than 500 distinct gifts from individuals and families. \n\n\"The smaller need that the Mittersill Project originally hoped to address was the lack of appropriate terrain on which to train giant slalom (at Cannon),\" said FSC President Christina Valar Breen. \"Little did we know that our hopes for a partially dedicated training hill would produce world-class results. FSC now has venues commensurate with the quality of its development program, and the East has a new alpine ski racing resource, right in the heart of New England.\" \n\nUNH will host the NCAA finals at Mittersill in March, with the men's and women's giant slalom slated to be held on Baron's Run March 8 and the slalom on Taft March 10. \n\nLast weekend's races were the first held on Mittersill in several decades, and the local ski racing world is excited about the prospects for the future - both for the chance to see great racing and for the training opportunities it opens for young ski racers in the region. \n\n\"We are so lucky to have this venue in our backyard,\" said Ivar Dahl, snow sports director for Holderness School, and a former Franconia Ski Club racer and longtime coach. \"Mittersill brings a wider variety of terrain, ample room, the ability to run full length GS. variability, and more interaction with coaches, teammates, and visitors. It's the ultimate playground for alpine ski racers.\" \n\nIt's not just the coaches who are excited about the opportunities Mittersill presents; the club kids who are there on the hill training alongside collegiate racers and U.S. Ski Team members - and watching them ski - are liking the new normal. \n\n\"The other day, we trained next to UNH kids, and I've seen some U.S. Ski Team racers warming up,\" said Nolan Sweeney, age 13, who lives in Littleton and trains with the FSC Academy. \"The hill is really great. You know it's a good hill with the U.S. Ski Team is training here.\" \n\nIt seems likely those U.S. Ski Team racers will continue showing up at Mittersill when they're in the area. \n\n\"Everything we've seen here has been positive,\" said Wolk. \"People are excited to have racing here. Everyone in the East should come here and train.\" \n\n.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Mittersill garners raves after first races","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Hillsborough","zipCode":"03108","state":"New Hampshire","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Manchester","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Union Leader","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169681010","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2"},"name":"Union Leader","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.unionleader.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.unionleader.com/storyimage/UL/20170129/SPORTS12/170129203/AR/0/AR-170129203.jpg?q=80"],"sequenceId":"695193868817","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:07:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:11:31Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

They solved the 2011 murder of 11-year-old Celina Cass, made numerous drug busts and helped capture a man who shot two Manchester police officers. \n\nOn Friday, more than 400 people gathered at New Hampshire Police Standards and Training Council to honor them. \n\nTrooper Nicholas Levesque, a four-year veteran, received three awards: The Director's Award, for making 245 arrests last year, 90 of them related to drugs; a Medal of Service for his efforts in arresting a man charged with shooting those Manchester police officers, and a commendation for his efforts in the Drug Monitor Initiative. \n\nLevesque and Trooper First Class Francesco Campo were working a construction detail on Interstate 93 in Manchester on May 13, 2016, when they heard the call that an officer had been shot. \n\nThe two troopers arrived on scene, working with Manchester police officers to secure the area and track down the shooter. Levesque saw the suspect, later identified as Ian MacPherson, 32, of Manchester, who by then allegedly had shot a second officer. MacPherson ignored Levesque, who shot at him, but missed. \n\nCampo, who also received the Medal of Meritorious Service, and Levesque followed MacPherson to woods where he ran. A Massachusetts State Police helicopter flushed him out and MacPherson was arrested. He is charged with two counts of attempted murder and first degree assault. \n\nLevesque said the two officers who were shot, Ryan Hardy and Matt O'Connor, are good friends of his. They met while attending The Academy at the New Hampshire Police Standards and Training Council. \n\nLevesque said he was just happy he could do his job every day and \"work with the troopers that I do.\" \n\nTrooper Jonathan D. Minnich received a Lifesaving Award. He had tried to contact a man to return property to him. When, after several days, the man didn't call back, on May 3, 2016, Minnich went to his home where he found him on a floor, unable to move because of a medical issue. \n\nWithout Minnich stopping by the man's home, \"the individual certainly would have died,\" Col. Christopher Wagner said. \n\nAuxiliary Trooper Charles West received the Director's Award and the Lt. James J. Geraghty Investigative Award. Geraghty, who died in 2014, was with the major crimes unit for eight years. \n\nCass went missing on July 26, 2011, and her body was found five days later in the Connecticut River, a short distance from her West Stewartstown home. \n\nNo one was arrested until nearly five years later and after West pored over evidence, including hundreds of interviews, resulting in the arrest of Celina's stepfather, Wendell Noyes, on June 20, 2016. \n\nLifesaving Awards were given to Trooper Bryan C. Tracy , who went 100 yards into a river to rescue a woman trying to drown herself; Troopers Mark Dore, Geoffrey Rogan and Jacob Wood saved a man on Sept. 11, 2016, who was dangling from a bridge after he ran from them following a police chase on the Everett Turnpike; Lt. Joseph Ebert, Sgt. John Hennessey, Trooper First Class Brian Gacek and troopers Jeffrey Costa and John Forbes saved the life of a woman as she tried to jump off the bridge spanning the Piscataqua River at the Maine/New Hampshire border. \n\n.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"State troopers cited, honored for life-saving work","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Hillsborough","zipCode":"03108","state":"New Hampshire","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Manchester","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Union Leader","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169681010","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2"},"name":"Union Leader","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.unionleader.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.unionleader.com/storyimage/UL/20170129/NEWS07/170129207/AR/0/AR-170129207.jpg?q=80"],"sequenceId":"695193868992","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T04:33:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:11:31Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The vote cleared a required, two-thirds threshold. \n \nSteve Stepanek of Amherst, co-chairman of President Trump\u2019s New Hampshire campaign, capped off this push of the state GOP leadership to join Democrats that, for more than a decade, have paid Chairman Raymond Buckley of Manchester a six-figure, annual salary. \n \n\n\u201cIt is a long time coming. We need to be competitive,\u201d Stepanek said during debate at Pinkerton Academy\u2019s Stockbridge Theatre. \n \n\n\u201cWe have got to compensate people if we are going to have a person working 60, 70 hours a week making sure we are red from top to bottom.\u201d \n \n\nBut Jeff Chidester, a conservative activist from Portsmouth, said the provision was far too open-ended. \n \n\n\u201cDoes anybody know what this position is going to get paid? Is there going to be a commission?\u201d Chidester asked rhetorically. \n \n\n\u201cI am not opposed to paying for this position; I am opposed to the fact that it is not being clearly defined.\u201d \n \n\nSupporters said pay should be performance-based and tied to reaching fund-raising goals but Forrester said she has no preconceived ideas on it. \n \n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t expect that big of a vote,\u201d Forrester said. \n \n\n\u201cIt goes to the Executive Committee that gets to decide as it sees fit. This is a conversation we need to have.\u201d \n \n\nMeanwhile, departing Chairwoman Jennifer Horn of Nashua made news by calling for the state GOP to fulfill \u201ctwo promises:\u201d To reaffirm its opposition to all abortions and to end the state party platform being against same-sex marriage. \n \n\n\u201cWe must put an end to be a party that actively works to deny rights to a small group of people based on who we are,\u201d Horn said. \n \n\n\u201cWe are the party of equal rights for all, so let\u2019s remove the language that is against the right for all people to marry.\u201d \n \n\nHer emotional plea was met with only a few dozen among the 368 committee members standing up to applaud while there was a smattering of boos. \n \n\nOutgoing Vice Chairman Matt Mayberry of Dover made his own plea for gays and veterans to get more support from the state GOP. \n \n\n\u201cI am talking to the person who is gay who thinks because they are gay they don\u2019t belong to the GOP. You are wrong,\u201d said Mayberry, an Air Force veteran. \u201cI am one of those veterans who thought about committing suicide. The letters were written; because of strong friends and my faith, I came to understand that I was loved.\u201d \nStepanek did not believe the GOP would soon change its platform plank on gay marriage. \n \n\n\u201cI respect Jennifer and congratulate her on doing a fine job. Those are her personal views and only the entire state committee gets to decide what goes in or out of the platform,\u201d Stepanek said. \n \n\nGov. Chris Sununu bristled at House Democratic Leader Steve Shurtleff\u2019s prediction earlier in the week that the House would kill Right to Work after Senate passage of it last week. \n \n\n\u201cOne of the first pieces of big legislation and we are going to let the Democrats dictate what we do?

But it shouldn't erase the troubling memory of one major element of Trump's inaugural address. \n\nThe foreign policy section has received far less attention than so revolutionary a declaration deserved. It radically redefined the American national interest as understood since World War II. \n\nTrump outlined a world in which foreign relations are collapsed into a zero-sum game. They gain, we lose. As in: \"For many decades, we've enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry; subsidized the armies of other countries\" while depleting our own. And most provocatively this: \"The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed all across the world.\" \n\nJFK's inaugural pledged to support any friend and oppose any foe to assure the success of liberty. Note that Trump makes no distinction between friend and foe (and no reference to liberty). They're all out to use, exploit and surpass us. \n\nNo more, declared Trump: \"From this day forward, it's going to be only America First.\" \n\nImagine how this resonates abroad. \"America First\" was the name of the organization led by Charles Lindbergh that bitterly fought FDR before U.S. entry into World War II - right through the Battle of Britain - to keep America neutral between Churchill's Britain and Hitler's Reich. \n\nNot that Trump was consciously imitating Lindbergh. I doubt he was even aware of the reference. He just liked the phrase. But I can assure you that in London and in every world capital they are aware of the antecedent and the intimations of a new American isolationism. Trump gave them good reason to think so, going on to note \"the right of all nations to put their own interests first.\" America included. \n\nSome claim that putting America first is a reassertion of American exceptionalism. On the contrary, it is the antithesis. It makes America no different from all the other countries that define themselves by a particularist blood-and-soil nationalism. What made America exceptional, unique in the world, was defining its own national interest beyond its narrow economic and security needs to encompass the safety and prosperity of a vast array of allies. A free world marked by open trade and mutual defense was President Truman's vision, shared by every President since. \n\nUntil now. \n\nSome have argued that Trump is just dangling a bargaining chip to negotiate better terms of trade or alliance. Or that Trump's views are so changeable and unstable - telling European newspapers two weeks ago that NATO is obsolete and then saying \"NATO is very important to me\" - that this is just another unmoored entry on a ledger of confusion. \n\nBut both claims are demonstrably wrong. An inaugural address is no off-the-cuff riff. These words are the product of at least three weeks of deliberate crafting for an address that Trump said would express his philosophy. Moreover, to remove any ambiguity, Trump prefaced his \"America first\" proclamation with: \"From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land.\" \n\nTrump's vision misunderstands the logic underlying the far larger, far-reaching view of Truman. The Marshall Plan sure took wealth away from the American middle class and distributed it abroad. But for a reason. Altruism, in part. But mostly to stabilize Western Europe as a bulwark against an existential global enemy. \n\nWe carried many free riders throughout the Cold War. The burden was heavy. But this was not a mindless act of charity; it was an exercise in enlightened self-interest. After all, it was indeed better to subsidize foreign armies - German, South Korean, Turkish and dozens of others - and have them stand with us, rather than stationing even more American troops everywhere around the world at greater risk of both blood and treasure. \n\nWe are embarking upon insularity and smallness. Nor is this just theory. Trump's long-promised but nonetheless abrupt withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership is the momentous first fruit of his foreign policy doctrine. Last year the prime minister of Singapore told John McCain that if we pulled out of TPP \"you'll be finished in Asia.\" He knows the region. \n\nFor 70 years, we sustained an international system of open commerce and democratic alliances that has enabled America and the West to grow and thrive. Global leadership is what made America great. We abandon it at our peril. \n\nCharles Krauthammer's email address is letters@charleskrauthammer.com. \n\n.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Charles Krauthammer Trump's foreign policy revolution","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Hillsborough","zipCode":"03108","state":"New Hampshire","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Manchester","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Union Leader","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169681010","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2"},"name":"Union Leader","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.unionleader.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.unionleader.com/storyimage/UL/20170129/OPINION02/170129218/AR/0/AR-170129218.jpg?q=80","http://www.unionleader.com/storyimage/UL/20170129/OPINION02/170129218/EP/1/1/EP-170129218.jpg?q=99"],"sequenceId":"695193870315","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T02:14:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:11:31Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Offensively challenged Exeter, meanwhile, had scored more than three goals once this season. \n\nSo Bedford's 7-0 triumph at the Rinks at Exeter should have surprised no one. \n\nBedford led 2-0 after one period and 6-0 entering the third.

I'm very happy.\" \n\nSenior forward Griffin Gagne, senior forward Jay Roberto and junior forward Colin Voloshin each scored twice for the Bulldogs. Jake Rioux collected Bedford's other goals. \n\nThe Bulldogs (11-0-1) scored two power-play goals, and twice while they were short-handed. Junior Frederick Veloshin made 18 saves to help Bedford earn its sixth shutout of the season. \n\n\"We couldn't play them five on five, nevermind five on four,\" Exeter coach Jim Tufts said. \"That's a good hockey team.

That is one of my roles, to come out aggressive and take wickets. \n \n\"I will do that the same as I have been all summer in Australia.\" \n \nSame, though, is not a word the Australian team will be using much as they look back on their previous two matches at Eden Park ahead of game one there on Monday. \n \nThey were rolled for 151 in that 2015 encounter before succumbing for four runs less in a 159-run hammering almost a year ago. \n \nStarc says Australia have learned their lesson about being lured in by the famously small boundaries, mostly down the ground, at the largely rugby-based venue. \n \n\"We've spoken about giving ourselves more time. \n \n\"The smaller boundaries are in the back of your mind but you always have more time than you think, especially in 50-over cricket where you don't have to score 300 in the first 40 overs. \n \n\"For here, where it might swing and nip a little bit, you can give yourself a chance to get in, see some balls and take the chance [to be aggressive] at the back end.\" \n \nMaking that adjustment, for the Australian batsmen and bowlers, will be key if they are to retain the silverware, but it won't be easy. \n \nStarc admitted they had not seen much swing or seam in their 4-1 ODI series victory over Pakistan during the past couple of weeks, matches also played on significantly bigger grounds than they would encounter in New Zealand. \n \nAnd while the reminder he did not have to bowl to Brendon McCullum was greeted with a wide smile, Starc said they were wary of a Black Caps batting line-up that was particularly dangerous in their own conditions. \n \n ","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"CLAY WILSON"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: cricket news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Australian pace spearhead Mitchell Starc ready for extra responsibility in Chappell-Hadlee series with captaincy duo absent","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"NZ","country":"New Zealand"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Dominion Post","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169672420","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1076"},"name":"Dominion Post","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Cricket","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://stuff.co.nz"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695193872753","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:38:37Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:11:36Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

\nAlphabet Inc.\u2018s Google asked staffers who may be affected by a new executive order on immigration to return to the U.S. quickly, joining a growing number of technology executives voicing concerns over restrictions that could interfere with how they do business. \n \nGoogle Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai slammed President Donald Trump\u2019s move in a note to employees Friday, telling them that more than 100 company staff are affected by the order. Microsoft Corp. said it\u2019s in touch with 76 staffers from the seven countries identified in the executive order. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s painful to see the personal cost of this executive order on our colleagues,\u201d Pichai wrote in the memo, a copy of which was obtained by Bloomberg News. \u201cWe\u2019ve always made our view on immigration issues known publicly and will continue to do so.\u201d \n \nThe comments underscore a growing rift between the Trump administration and several large U.S. technology companies, which include many immigrants in their ranks and have lobbied for fewer immigration restrictions. Facebook Inc. CEO Mark Zuckerberg voiced concern over the policy on Friday, and Airbnb Inc. CEO Brian Chesky said Saturday in a tweet that \u201cclosing doors further divides\u201d people. Twitter Inc. CEO Jack Dorsey said in a tweet Saturday the order\u2019s \u201chumanitarian and economic impact is real and upsetting.\u201d \n \nUber Technologies Inc. CEO Travis Kalanick said Saturday that he plans to outline his misgivings about the order at the first meeting of the Trump administration\u2019s business advisory group next Friday in Washington. \n \n- - - \n \nUber has about a dozen staffers affected by the order, as well as a number of drivers, Kalanik said in an emailed statement. \n \n\u201cThis order has far broader implications as it also affects thousands of drivers who use Uber and come from the listed countries, many of whom take long breaks to go back home to see their extended family. These drivers currently outside of the U.S. will not be able to get back into the country for 90 days,\u201d he said. He said his company was working out a plan to compensate those drivers stranded abroad. \n \nTrump signed the executive order on Friday prohibiting entry by people from seven majority-Muslim nations for 90 days. Citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Sudan, Somalia, Syria and Yemen would be banned from entering the U.S. for the period, while the government determines what information it needs to safely admit visitors. \n \nSome visa and green-card holders were blocked from boarding flights to the U.S. after the order was issued and several people were being detained at U.S. airports when they arrived, the New York Times reported. The Department of Homeland Security issued a directive on Friday afternoon ordering the Customs and Border Control agency to enforce the order immediately. \n \n- - - \n \n\u201cWe\u2019re concerned about the impact of this order and any proposals that could impose restrictions on Googlers and their families, or that create barriers to bringing great talent to the U.S.,\u201d a Google spokeswoman said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to make our views on these issues known to leaders in Washington and elsewhere.\u201d \n \nSome Google employees were traveling abroad and were trying to get back to the U.S. before the order took effect. The company asked them to reach out to Google\u2019s security, travel, and immigration teams for assistance, according to a person familiar with the situation. The person asked not to be identified talking about internal company communications. \n \nGoogle declined to say Saturday whether any employees were detained or blocked from boarding flights. \n \nRushing Home \n \nThe employees in question normally work in the U.S. but just happened to be abroad either on work assignments or vacations. One employee rushed back from a trip to New Zealand to make it into the U.S. before the order was signed, Google\u2019s Pichai wrote in his memo. \n \n\u201cWe are advising our clients from those seven countries who have green cards or any type of H-1B visa not to travel outside the U.S.,\u201d said Ava Benach, a partner at immigration law firm Benach Collopy LLP, while noting that the order takes effect immediately. \n \n\u201cNo one is really sure whether a green card holder from these seven countries can return to the U.S. now. It\u2019s fairly clear that an H-1B visa holder can\u2019t,\u201d Benach said. The H-1B lets U.S. companies employ graduate-level workers from other countries in technical occupations such as technology, engineering and science. \n \n\u201cIf anyone in these situations has the misfortune to have gone abroad recently, it\u2019s a treacherous moment, possibly for green card holders too,\u201d Benach said. \n \nOther technology companies are likely in a similar situation, she added. \n \n- - - \n \nMicrosoft Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith said Saturday in a memo to staff that the company is working with affected personnel and that it supports immigration policies that \u201cprotect the public without sacrificing people\u2019s freedom of expression or religion.\u201d \n \nMicrosoft also affirms \u201cthe importance of protecting legitimate and law-abiding refugees whose very lives may be at stake in immigration proceedings,\u201d Smith wrote. \n \nThe company included language in a securities filing on Thursday on the issue, cautioning investors that immigration restrictions \u201cmay inhibit our ability to adequately staff our research and development efforts.\u201d \n \nFacebook\u2019s Zuckerberg said Friday that he was \u201cconcerned\u201d by Trump\u2019s recent moves to restrict immigration. \n \nTesla Motors Inc. CEO Elon Musk said on Twitter Saturday that a blanket entry ban \u201cis not the best way to address the country\u2019s challenges. Many people negatively affected by this policy are strong supporters of the U.S. They\u2019ve done right, not wrong and don\u2019t deserve to be rejected.\u201d \n \n- - - \n \nWith assistance from Caroline Chen. \n \ngoogle-1stld-writethru \n \nKeywords","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Tech latest","group":"Technology"},{"name":"Google news","group":"Companies"},{"name":"Cyberculture news","group":"Internet"},{"name":"Facebook news","group":"Internet"},{"name":"Social networks news","group":"Internet"},{"name":"Internet latest","group":"Internet"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Google, Facebook show dismay on Trump immigration order","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Weber","zipCode":"84412","state":"Utah","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Ogden","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Standard Examiner","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169696683","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1829"},"name":"Standard Examiner","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Business","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://standard.net"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695193874537","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:11:34Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Anything above 720 is considered prime.\" \n\nBellwether Community Credit Union on Friday launched a series of video, handouts and infographics aimed at young adults 18 to 30. The free online education program is available to members and nonmembers at bccu.org/adulting . \n\n\"The idea behind this is to be fun and clever,\" said Mike L'Ecuyer, president and CEO of Bellwether, which has three locations and about 34,000 members. \"I think people in general, and especially young people, are not as prepared as I know their financial institutions would like,\" \n\nWhile many millennials want to know about handling their finances, \"these kids are, in some cases, defenseless in the world of capitalism,\" he said. \n\nBellwether spent about $31,000 in the past six months on millennial-oriented efforts. \n\nOnly 24 percent of millennials demonstrated basic financial knowledge, according to a study by the George Washington Global Financial Literacy Excellence Center in Washington. \n\nMore than half were concerned about their ability to repay their student debt, and nearly 30 percent were overdrawing their checking accounts, according to the study. \n\nCitizens Bank, the state's largest bank, also is trying to help millennials, building a website for student loan awareness, studentloanawareness.com . \n\n\"It's interactive; it includes video,\" said Joe Carelli, president of Citizens Bank for New Hampshire and Vermont. \n\nCitizens, which operates 72 branches in New Hampshire, offers a program to consolidate student loans into one loan carrying a lower interest rate and monthly payments, he said. \n\n(New Hampshire had the highest average college student debt for the Class of 2015, $36,101.) \n\nA Citizens Bank survey showed 80 percent of millennials worried about their ability to pay back their student loans. \n\nStudent loans, jobs and house purchases are three issues on the minds of many millennials. \n\n\"My generation is notorious for hopping jobs,\" said Chris Steele, a millennial who lives and works in Manchester. \n\nSteele, an economist with ITR Economics, offered advice on businesses retaining millennials in a tight job market. \n\n\"Make my standard of life better while I'm working for you,\" Steele told a chamber of commerce luncheon in Bedford last week. \"You don't want to just throw money at us, especially because if you all do it, I know I can get the same treatment from another employer.\" \n\nMoney isn't solely the answer. \n\n\"Millennials are very well motivated and more so than previous generations by nonmonetary compensation. Again. I'm talking things like flexible hours, maybe let me take this tie off when I come in to work, maybe let me wear sneakers if that's acceptable,\" he said. \"Find ways to increase the compensation without actually writing a check.

In addition, I want to develop students\u2019 abilities and boost their confidence.\u201d \n \nHis unpleasant experiences became the spark that motivated him to create the campaign which targets physical and cyber bullying. \n \nIt was launched in 2013 when Yazan was in 8th grade. He praised the support provided by his friends and teachers. \n \nThere are three key elements. \n \nAt the school level, Yazan raised awareness about the types of bullying. He made videos, distributed brochures and conducted plays from 2013 until 2015. \n \nHe expanded it to inter-school level with projects held at places such as Al Najah Private School and International Community School , with presentations given to grades 1 to 6. \n \nThe campaign then spread globally on social media. \n \n\u201cI\u2019m taking advantage of Instagram and Facebook to raise awareness at the international level,\u201d he said. \n \n\u201cIn fact, I\u2019m assigning ambassadors in different parts of the world. I also assigned them from schools in the UAE .\u201d \n \nOne of the biggest problems in tackling bullying is that many children do not speak up about the abuse they suffer, he said. \n \n\u201cThe victims simply keep the problem to themselves, allowing the bully to influence and negatively affect other students and the cycle goes on,\u201d he said. \n \n\u201cIn fact, one of the targets of the presentations is to make students speak up. They shouldn\u2019t fear those bullies. Those bullies are actually scared, that\u2019s why they threaten the students.\u201d \n \nConstant bullying can have significant impact on a child\u2019s self-confidence and self-esteem. \n \nThe campaign has helped to give confidence to many children, Yazan said. \n \n\u201cWe have had students who didn\u2019t like to present and get engaged in the class because their classmates used to tease them,\u201d he said. \n \nSchools did not take bullying seriously but that is changing as online bullying has increased in recent years and now tougher rules are in place in many schools , he said. \n \n\u201cIn fact, there are serious consequences if someone bullies a student even outside the school such as online sites. Cyber bullying, unfortunately, makes bullying easier as users can be anonymous on certain sites.\u201d \n \nSchools should focus on raising awareness of the damage a bully can do rather than simply sending them home for a couple of days. \n \nSally Faisal, a biology teacher at Abu Dhabi International School taught Yazan at Grade 8 and has seen the impact his campaign has made. \n \n\u201cEven though he was bullied he was strong enough to do something about it and help other children in a similar situation,\u201d she said. \n \n\u201cI saw how he gave courage to other children to speak about their experiences in front of the school and how touching that was. \n \n\u201cEvery pupil was listening to what these children were saying and I think many more understand how damaging bullying can be.\u201d \n \n© The National \n Jan 2","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Education news","group":"Society"},{"name":"United Arab Emirates news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Dubai news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Dubai teen\u2019s Bullying Is Not Okay campaign tells victims to speak up","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Western Asia","countryCode":"AE","country":"United Arab Emirates"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Edarabia","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"570095715","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2"},"name":"Edarabia","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society","Education"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.edarabia.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://twitter.com/edarabia"],"sequenceId":"695193875793","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:11:36Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

I learn a lot from my classmates \u2013 they come from around the world, from different backgrounds and have different interests. \n \nNevertheless, we all agree on our global responsibility in making our governments work better and making this world a better place.\u201d \n \nThe group comprises students from 18 countries and the initiative covers an annual full fellowship for 10 students from any Arab states to pursue graduate studies at HKS. \n \nIraqi Hamada Zahawi was grateful for the eye-opening trip and felt proud to be affiliated with such a transformation. \n \n\u201cAs part of the UAE trek I was truly excited to discover the incredible wealth of cultural, political and economic innovation taking place, from heritage museums to thriving accelerators, award-winning government agencies to Mars space dreams,\u201d she said. \n \n\u201cWhat was truly astounding is how the UAE is setting global benchmarks in all sectors and exceeding them year after year.\u201d \n \nFor Abdi Ismail, the trip to the UAE was incredible. \n \n\u201cThe main highlight for me was all about seeing Emiratis sharing their country\u2019s essence with great hospitality and generosity,\u201d said the Somalian. \n \nClaudia Ng, who is from Hong Kong and speaks nine languages, aspires to work for a multilateral organisation focusing on development, with an interest in the Middle East. \n \n\u201cI am very grateful for this opportunity to learn about the successes of public-sector innovation from high-level government officials in the UAE,\u201d she said. \n \n\u201cI intend to draw upon them in my future career as a model for innovation and development for the rest of the region.\u201d \n \nRuba Al Hassan, a senior ­adviser at the UAE Embassy in Washington and leader of the delegation, said the programme was about building bridges with different countries. \n \n\u201cBut we also want our own government to benefit,\u201d she said. \n \n\u201cIf they have a policy issue it\u2019s remarkable to have a handpicked group of people with an interest in the region to be available to you. \n \n\u201cYou also have people who had complete misconceptions about what this part of the world is about and they saw the reality.\u201d \n \nThe exchange of knowledge and education, she said, was ­vital in fighting terrorism, ­violence and extremism. \u201cIt\u2019s critical we get to know other cultures and to understand that we all have shared values. \n \n\u201cEducation is the core and key to fighting extremism.\u201d \n \n© The National \n Jan 2","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Education news","group":"Society"},{"name":"United Arab Emirates news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Harvard students\u2019 visit to UAE focuses on government innovation","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Western Asia","countryCode":"AE","country":"United Arab Emirates"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Edarabia","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"570095715","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2"},"name":"Edarabia","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society","Education"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.edarabia.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://twitter.com/edarabia"],"sequenceId":"695193877315","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:11:36Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

And those of us at the beginning of his college days saw that a young college Ryan was a lot like a young pro Tom Brady . \n\nDo the right things. Say the right things. I nicknamed the kid Senator Ryan the first time we met him. It's easy to see either him or Brady running for office some day. \n\nBC players were long tutored on dealing with the press by SIDs Chris Cameron and the late (and sorely missed) Dick Kelley . Ryan didn't need much tutoring. He always got it, on and off the field. \n\nJust like Brady. \n\n\"Tom's had an unbelievable year, played extremely well and extremely efficient,\" Ryan said the other day. \"A lot of touchdowns, very few turnovers. He's just been playing really good football. He's been that way for a long time. He's been consistent throughout his career. He's such a great player, such a great competitor. \n\n\"He's been a friend for a long time; I've gotten to know him since I've been in the league, and certainly he's a good person and a good guy to talk to.\" \n\nSo they talk? \n\n\"For sure, back and forth during the season, letting him know he's doing a good job,\" Ryan said. \"I see the highlights, and I think it's the same for him. That's the fraternity at the quarterback position. You get to know guys playing against them . and he's one of the good guys, and a really good person.\" \n\nMVPs super drought \n\nRyan the regular season MVP? Brady? \n\nCredit to friend Ken Powtak for pointing out an NFL MVP hasn't won a Super Bowl since Kurt Warner back in 1999. \n\nThere have been 11 players who have done it, including five between the 1993 and '99 seasons. But none since Warner. \n\nOne of them was Washington kicker Mark Moseley , who pulled it off in the strike-shortened 1982 season. A kicker! \n\nSunday leftovers \n\nLogan Ryan was wearing a throwback Houston Astros jersey after the AFC title game. Which one? Nolan Ryan 's No. 34 of course. \n\nIf you missed Martellus Bennett 's words about getting to the Super Bowl, here's a rewind. \n\n\"Honestly, over the years I never really felt like the Super Bowl was a possibility,\" he said. \"I was talking to my wife this morning. I'm like, 'I don't really know how to feel about going into this game.' I always dreamed about going to the Super Bowl but it never really felt like an attainable goal in the past because we lost so many games (with the Cowboys, Giants and Bears) and we were never really in position. \n\n\"You're just hopeful to go to the playoffs. So this is very special. It's a dream come true.\" \n\nStars in Cleveland \n\nKudos go out to my pal Paul Hoynes of Cleveland.com for breaking the news his town and the Indians will host the 2019 All-Star Game. \n\nThen, in a follow-up story, Hoynsie looked back at the 1997 game, also hosted by Cleveland, and noted there were 16 future Hall of Famers - 14 players and managers Joe Torre and Bobby Cox - in the game. \n\nKen Griffey Jr. , Cal Ripken Jr. , Pudge Rodriguez , Roberto Alomar , Frank Thomas , Randy Johnson , Craig Biggio , Tony Gwynn , Mike Piazza , Jeff Bagwell , Greg Maddux , Barry Larkin , Tom Glavine and Pedro Martinez were the players. \n\nThe American League won the game on a home run by the Indians' Sandy Alomar Jr . \n\nSpeaking of the Indians, Hoynsie Facebooked: \"Indians will unveil statues of Hall of Famers Frank Robinson (May 27) and Lou Boudreau (Aug.5) at Progressive Field this season.\" \n\nHere's a tidbit from column friend Jimmy Murphy , who tweeted, \"The last time the @NHL #NHLAllStar game was in #LA, #Patriots won the Super Bowl!\" \n\nHappy to have spent the last two days in New York City, my hometown, attending a baseball official scorers' meeting. It's an annual event where our group gets together, shares war stories and goes over tricky plays that take place throughout the previous year. \n\nIt's still January, but baseball really is just around the corner. \n\nSide note: I interrupted the meeting a few times wondering why there were no David Ortiz tributes. I was having withdrawal. \n\nWork to do \n\nThe Bruins hit the break having apparently calmed the waters around Claude Julien with two wins at home. They visit Tampa Bay Tuesday to start the \"second half.\" \n\nAsked if this was a perfect time for a break, Tuukka Rask , who needed the rest as much as anyone (nine straight games, 15 of the last 16) but went to the All-Star Game - the weekend right out of hell for the goalies, said: \n\n\"Absolutely. I think somebody mentioned that we have played the most games in the league and it definitely feels that way. We've played every other night, it feels like forever, so I think it's a well- deserved break and we can start it with the right mindset after winning two games so we have to enjoy this break and when we're going to Tampa, just be ready to play because the points are going to be even more important after this.\" \n\nThe Bruins start play Tuesday as a playoff team, but here's how tenuous things are: \n\nNew Jersey is the only team in the Eastern Conference not at NHL .500 and the Devils fell just under Thursday. Carolina, Buffalo, Detroit and Jersey are all tied for last, seven points behind the Bruins, Carolina and Buffalo with four games apiece in hand, Detroit three and the Devils two. \n\n. \nThe schedule loaded the Bruins down, but when you have to play a lot of games, you better win more of them than you lose. The B's haven't done that, going, 25-21-6 (over NHL .500 but 25-27 in wins and losses). \nRask was also asked if Thursday marked his first game with new goalie pads. \n\nHe said: \"It was! You noticed my tight (butt) there? No issues, I had practiced with them a couple times so they're good, they're comfortable. I don't see any real difference. Good eyes Fluto ( Shinzawa of the Globe).\" \n\nExpansion talk \n\nIf you want to learn everything you can about NHL expansion, dating 50 years back when the league doubled from six to 12 teams, pick up the Hockey News expansion issue. \n\nGreat anecdotes (we always love Seals/Golden Seals stuff) and even Matt Larkin 's mock draft, this one having the Bruins losing young goalie Malcolm Subban to the Vegas Golden Knights. \n\nAnother mock I saw had Colin Miller going. An earlier one had Jimmy Hayes , but he has fallen so far off the radar even an expansion team won't take him. \n\nIn a year of NHL milestones, San Jose GM Doug Wilson on Thursday became the fourth in league history to play 1,000 games and serve a thousand as a general manager, and the first not named Robert. \n\nThe other three? Bob Gainey , Bobby Clarke and Bob Pulford . \n\nFinally, this has nothing to do with sports, but RIP Mary Tyler Moore . You had an effect on anyone who watched you turn the world on with your smile. Truly one of a kind. \n\nMike Shalin covers Boston pro sports for the New Hampshire Union Leader and Sunday News.

They sort of have to because of his size. Harvey is 6-foot-8. \n\nEarlier this week at school, there was a rare sight, as someone else dwarfed Harvey. Mamadou Ndiaye, who's 7-6, crossed paths with Harvey. They gave each other a fist bump before Ndiaye ducked under the doorway into Ocean View's gym. \n \n\"I've met him before at a UC Irvine game,\" Harvey said of Ndiaye, who played for the Anteaters for three seasons before he declared in April for the NBA Draft. \"I doubt that he remembers me.\" \n\nWhile Ndiaye might not know who Harvey is, Harvey is making a name for himself in his junior season at Ocean View. Just as Ndiaye came on to the scene in Huntington Beach as a junior five seasons ago, when he played for Brethren Christian, Harvey is the city's next big man controlling the paint. \n \nHarvey is not scoring as Ndiaye did, but he is rebounding and blocking shots at the same rate as the Senegal native. Harvey is averaging 14.5 points, 10.3 rebounds and 5.1 blocks per game. The rebounds rank second in Orange County and the blocks No. 1. \n\nTwice this season Harvey has finished with a triple-double, doing it the hard way by swatting 10 or more shots. Harvey is performing at a high level, and what is remarkable is the 200-pound center has bounced back from a left patella tendon injury that knocked him out last season. \n\nThis week marked an important one for Harvey. Around this time a year ago, his sophomore season ended. Four games into Golden West League play, Harvey went down. \n\n\"My patella ripped off the bone. My knee flexed too hard, and the bone was weakened from previous injuries,\" Harvey said. \"I was just grabbing a [defensive] rebound. I feel it pop and I fell back. I couldn't get up. \n\n\"I just thought that my kneecap dislocated, until I got to the hospital and they took X-rays. I thought I was going to be back in time for [the] CIF [Southern Section Division 3A playoffs]. When [the doctor] started talking to me about surgery plans that same night, at that point, I'm just thinking about next year.\" \n\nSeven months are how many Harvey said it took him to start playing again on the court. At the end of August, he said he took part in a three-on-three pick-up game at Ocean View with one of his coaches, Roger Holmes, and a few other guys. \n\n\"I was a little nervous,\" Harvey said, \"but once I started to get going, I just couldn't wait to play five-on-five. I waited a couple of weeks before I did that.\" \n\nThree months after playing for the first time since his surgery, in his third game with the Seahawks, Harvey produced a triple-double. And he didn't even know it. \n\nHis friend and teammate, Kamani Slusher, told him that he pulled it off. Harvey finished with 12 points, 21 rebounds and 10 blocks in Ocean View's 62-30 win against Los Angeles Center for Enriched Studies in a pool-play game during the school's Jim Harris Memorial Tournament of Champions on Nov. 29. \n\n\"We saw each other in class and [Slusher] let me know, saying, 'Man! You got a triple-double! How are you feeling?'\" said Harvey, adding that he was feeling pretty good. \"Then I hear it in the announcements [at school], in third period. They were like reading off the stat lines, and they said, 'Mehkel Harvey with a triple-double.' [My classmates] were just like, 'Mehkel, that's crazy!'\" \n\nSeventeen days later, in a 68-50 pool-play win over Western at the Loatella Tournament at Loara High, Harvey got his second triple-double, 18 points, 11 rebounds and 12 blocks. There would be no announcement at school because there was no school the next day, the contest was on a Friday. \n\nThis Friday, Harvey came close to another triple-double. He had 17 points, 16 rebounds and seven blocks, helping the Seahawks win at Loara, 72-62, to improve to 6-0 in league. \n\nOcean View has won its last 21 games in league, and it should claim its third straight title, second going undefeated. The crown Harvey and the Seahawks, who are 17-6 overall and ranked No. 12 in the CIF Southern Section Division 3AA poll, want to make a run at is the one they fell short of reaching last season. \n\nWithout Harvey, Ocean View made the quarterfinals, losing at home to top-seeded Rancho Mirage, 90-62. Many didn't expect the Seahawks to advance that far, but they went into Servite in the second round and won, 56-53. \n\nThat victory stands out to Harvey as his favorite athletic moment, and to Coach Tim Walsh that says a lot about Harvey. \n\n\"He didn't even play in that game. That's the kind of kid he is, a really good kid,\" Walsh said of the soft-spoken Harvey, who turned 16 in August. \"He has no idea how good he could be. He's not even close to his potential. He has to keep growing. He's kind of grown into his body a little bit. His offensive improvement is going to continue.\" \n\nMehkel Harvey \n\nBorn: Aug. 1, 2000 \n\nHometown: Huntington Beach \n\nHeight: 6-foot-8 \n\nWeight: 200 pounds \n\nSport: Basketball \n\nYear: Junior \n\nCoaches: Tim Walsh, Roger Holmes \n\nFavorite food: Pasta \n\nFavorite movie: \"Inception\" \n\nFavorite athletic moment: \"Beating Servite last year in [the second round of the] CIF [Southern Section Division 3A playoffs].\" \n\nWeek in review: Harvey led the Seahawks to three wins last week, averaging 13.3 points, 10.3 rebounds, 4.6 blocks and two steals per game.　　　　　　","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Daily Pilot High School Male Athlete of the Week: Ocean View's next big thing, Harvey","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"Los Angeles Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169587902","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"22602"},"name":"Los Angeles Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.latimes.com","publisher":"Tribune Company"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695193888542","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:11:44Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Jackson was excited to speak about her late father, Kenneth A. Walker, Friday night when the Hall of Fame in his name was unveiled in Concordia's gym. \n \n\"Our university is becoming a grown-up,\" said Jackson, a Newport Beach resident, who played volleyball at Newport Christian, Huntington Beach High and Concordia. \"And with that some things need to happen and one of those things is creating a professional, athletic look to our facilities. I think this is a major start to that.\" \n\nJackson's father, who lived in Huntington Beach, died two years ago. He played basketball at USC and enjoyed watching his children and grandchildren play in their activities. Brothers Phil Walker played water polo and Jim Walker played tennis. Jackson's sister, Paige, who died while Jackson was a student-athlete at Concordia, competed in tennis and was a cheerleader. \n \nJackson is now Concordia's dean for equity diversity and inclusion. \n\n\"Amazing,\" Jackson said of the unveiling event, which included a gathering of family, friends, coaches and Hall of Fame inductees. \"This went better than it ever could. My dad would be really proud.\" \n\nThe Kenneth A. Walker Athletic Hall of Fame at Concordia University, designed by alumna and former Eagles soccer player Amanda Koman of the Temeka group, features a prominent timeline on the wall next to a trophy case. \n\nThis year's Hall of Fame inductees Alexsondra Peters (swimming) and the 2011 CUI baseball team played a big part to the success seen in that timeline. Concordia has had a Hall of Fame for its past athletes, but now has a physical area to honor them. \n\nPeters was named NAIA National Swimmer of the Year in 2011 when she was a three-time national champion.

OCC has now won four straight against the Roadrunners, outscoring them, 52-2, during that streak. \n\n\"I think we have a good ballclub that is going to swing it,\" said OCC Coach John Altobelli, in his 25th season. \"It was good to see guys come off the bench and take quality at-bats. They are making things tough for me about decisions on our lineup for next game.\" \n\nAltobelli said Robeniol, a left-hander who was 3-2 with a 7.09 earned-run average at Oregon in 2016, when he struck out 21 in 26 2/3 innings, faced the minimum and did not give up a hit the first three innings Saturday. \n\nHe allowed two singles in the fourth and another single in the fifth, but did not allow a runner past second base. He walked one and hit a batter. \n\n\"I thought Robeniol kind of set the tone with really good pitching,\" Altobelli said. \"He threw a lot of strikes and set the table for our hitters to be able to loosen up and get the bats going.\" \n\nMoniot, who hit .168 with five home runs and 18 RBIs in 53 games at Oregon, yanked his first OCC homer inside the foul pole in right field to break a scoreless tie. His bloop double to left with the bases loaded gave OCC a 10-0 lead in the fifth, the first of two innings in which the Pirates batted around. \n\nSophomore first baseman Eric Wagaman, sophomore right fielder John Balliet and Powers, who was two for two off the bench, all had doubles for OCC, which produced more than 17 hits only once last season (18). \n\nThe Pirates scored in six straight innings, posting six runs in the fifth and four in the seventh. \n\nOCC ended a streak of 11 straight games with an error to close last season, when it missed the playoffs for the first time since 2006. The Pirates had only eight errorless games during an 18-18 campaign in 2016. \n\nJake Scott, Michael Odgers, Alex Lopez, Jacob Doty, Chris Ceballos and Ramiro Velasco also produced hits for OCC, which visits Southwestern in Chula Vista on Tuesday. \n\nFreshman Jacob Higareda also impressed in relief for the Pirates, striking out all three hitters he faced looking in the eighth inning. \n\nNONCONFERENCE \n\nOrange Coast 17, Desert 1 \n\nSCORE BY INNINGS \n\nCOD 000 001 000 \u2013 1 6 5 \n\nOCC 002 261 42x \u2013 17 17 0 \n\nMeza, Carlisle (5), Torres (5), Owen (6), Bidon (7) and Tanaka; Robeniol, Moore (6), Higareda (8), Tomazin (9) and Teel, Caballos (6).

But he'll put weight on his recovering right leg for just about any amount of animal edible.\n\nSo that's what his rehabilitation specialist, certified veterinary technician Dave Meyer, was using at Oregon State University's College of Veterinary Medicine to help Tigger develop new muscle memory on his front limb.\n\nIt worked like a charm.\n\nWith crumbling pieces of smelly treats in hand, Meyer helped Tigger achieve his personal best time of 8 minutes learning how to walk in an underwater treadmill housed in the large-animal wing of the veterinary medical school in Corvallis.\n\n\"Not bad for a dog who doesn't like baths,\" said his foster mom, Eve Good, as she watched Tigger first drink the water from the donated underwater treadmill and then reluctantly put his recovering paw in it. Marilyn van Dijk, a veterinary assistant, kept treats in Meyer's hands or in front of the dog at all times.\n\nHe'd forget that he had a bum leg, put his paw down and reach around for the treat.\n\nMeyer, keeping hold on Tigger via a harness, cooed in the dog's ear: \"I've got you. I've got you.\"\n\nAnd then Tigger relaxed. He'd move his front paws forward as if on automatic pilot. Walk, walk, walk.\n\nMeyer moved up the speed on the treadmill, and Tigger walked, walked, walked some more, as if he's been doing it his entire young life.\n\nExcept he hasn't.\n\nTigger has never walked or run on four legs like most canines.\n\nHe has jumped like a kangaroo on his hind two legs or inched forward on his belly. But he has never kept up with his foster parents' other dogs because his front two legs were congenitally deformed by a defect called ectrodactyly, or split hand or lobster claw.\n\nThese days, Meyer has him on the underwater treadmill and doing planks on a large plastic peanut to help develop callouses on the limb and strengthen his core to protect his other limbs. He hopes to introduce the dog to cavalletti exercises (small jumps) soon to help him further strengthen his muscles and improve his balance.\n\n\"He's been compensating his whole life, so we take this slow,\" Meyer said.\n\nTigger weighs slightly more than his optimal weight of 55 pounds, said his surgeon, Dr. Jennifer Warnock. The physical therapy sessions may help with that.\n\nDr. Warnock hopes to perform the second repair surgery on Tigger's other front leg at the end of March. But Good and her partner, Troy Riggs, have some fundraising to do first. When the Statesman Journal first broke Tigger's story last summer and it spread across the country through the USA Today Network and The Huffington Post, more than $17,000 was raised in a few weeks.\n\nMore than $10,000 was spent on Tigger's first surgery, ICU stay, bandaging needs, and his medication. At least $2,000 or $3,000 still needs to be raised to pay for this next round of surgery, which will repair the second front limb and fuse one portion of the other newly fashioned leg. Dr. Warnock expects Tigger's condition to regress a bit as he recovers from the second surgery, but she's cautiously optimistic the dog could be walking on both front legs by summer.\n\nTigger may or may not need prosthetics. His X-rays currently show bone fusion, which is excellent, Warnock said. If his therapy continues to help him develop callouses where he never had them before, she believes the prognosis to be very good.\n\n\"We want to get him functioning without pain,\" Warnock said. \"I want him jumping on the couch, something most dogs take for granted. But Tigger does not.\"\n\nNow about those treats ...\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Statesman Journal, http://www.statesmanjournal.com","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Carol Mcalice Currie"},"topics":[],"title":"Will doggie paddle for treats: That's Tigger's motto these days","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Lane","zipCode":"97408","state":"Oregon","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Eugene","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Register-Guard","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169668374","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4312"},"name":"Register-Guard","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Health","Lifestyle","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.registerguard.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://stjr.nl/2iLOWc1%29.%3C/p","http://www.statesmanjournal.com%3C/p","http://stjr.nl/2iLOWc1","http://www.statesmanjournal.com/"],"sequenceId":"695193906994","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:11:50Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://registerguard.com/apple-touch-icon-144x144-precomposed.png"}],"video":[]}}

But Smith has agreed to talk because she will, she says, use any platform to express her view that Islam is an ideology of violence, intolerance and sexism.\n\nSmith received relatively little attention during the last federal election as a NSW Senate candidate for the Australian Liberty Alliance, the political offshoot of the Q Society, which describes itself as \"Australia's leading Islam-critical movement\".\n\n(\"Q Society supports an integrated multi-ethnic Australia and rejects racism, which the Oxford dictionary defines as: 'Belief in the superiority of a particular race.' Since Islam is not a race or ethnicity, being critical of Islam is not racist,\" its website explains.)\n\nBut she is likely to receive far more press in the coming weeks as the co-defendant in a defamation action being brought by the businessman Mohammed El-Mouelhy, who was the subject of a critical video produced by the Q Society and presented by Smith.\n\nAlready Smith and the Q Society, also named in the suit, have rallied an impressive line-up of public supporters, including Coalition right-wingers Cory Bernardi, George Christensen and the former MP Ross Cameron, who are among a handful of public figures set to address fundraisers to be held in Sydney and Melbourne on February 9 and 10.\n\nWe sit and both reach for our phones to turn on recording apps. Smith has already explained that she wants her own record of our conversation. The tension dissipates \u2013 a little \u2013 when a sky-blue ute throbs past us and Smith laughs and points out the personalised number plate, \"TRUMP1\". Later she will tell me that she rejects the suggestion she is right wing, rather, she says she a part of the silent majority of mainstream conservatives whose voices are now being heard due to victories of Donald Trump and the Brexit campaign.\n\nSmith says she never intended to pursue politics. She has always been happiest as a wife and mother. \"I love being my husband's wife,\" she says to emphasise the point.\n\nAs it was, a confluence of events brought her to her mission. In 2000 Smith and her husband Greg, a tradesman, sought out volunteer work in Mali and there met the Assemblies of God missionary Faouzi Arzouni, whom she describes as a Muslim apostate who became a friend and mentor.\n\nTwo years later the couple went on another trip, a 10-day visit to refugee camps of the displaced of what is now known as the Maluku sectarian conflict in Indonesia, during which Christian and Muslim communities fell into violent political and ethnic conflict. Smith recalls sitting in refugee camps hearing terrible stories of violence perpetrated by Muslims.\n\nIn 2009 Smith's husband took her to a talk being given by the Q Society's Mark Durie, an Anglican vicar. During that lecture Durie said that his wife would not buy certain supermarket products because they had been certified as halal.\n\nSmith was intrigued and began her own investigations on the internet, learning that many brands are halal-certified, and that a portion of the fees paid for such certification is donated to Muslim charities. In other countries, Smith contends, those charities have directed funds towards groups with terrorist links. Her online investigation became a website, Halal Choices, a campaign and, with the support of Bernardi and Christensen, a parliamentary inquiry into \"third party\" food certification. Finally it became a political ambit, with Smith running for the ALA in a campaign launched by the anti-Islamic immigration Dutch MP Geert Wilders.\n\n\"There is no question of our country being Islamified. Now, this reply constituted a historical error as soon as it was uttered,\" Wilders once told Dutch parliament.\n\n\"I can report that they have had enough of burkas, headscarves, the ritual slaughter of animals, so\u2011called honour revenge, blaring minarets, female circumcision, hymen restoration operations, abuse of homosexuals, Turkish and Arabic on the buses and trains as well as on town hall leaflets, halal meat at grocery shops and department stores, Sharia exams, the Finance Minister's Sharia mortgages, and the enormous over-representation of Muslims in the area of crime, including Moroccan street terrorists,\" Wilders said.\n\nSmith says she does not believe there is an imminent threat of adopting Sharia law, but is concerned about what she calls \"creeping sharia\".\n\n\"We are being encouraged very strongly to tolerate sharia finance, halal certification, the hijab,\" she says.\n\n\"Sharia is definitely present in Australia \u2026 I believe there are honour killings and it is all reported under domestic violence or another name,\" she says. As evidence she says she has close friends who are pastors who work in churches who have provided sanctuary to victims.\n\nBut Smith's concerns are broader than creeping sharia. During the US election she was horrified by Hillary Clinton's support for abortion rights. She opposes political correctness, Safe Schools and big government regulations imposed upon farmers by distant bureaucrats.\n\n\"I pretty much oppose everything the Greens stand for,\" she says.\n\nShe was also appalled by the Liberal Party's abandonment of Tony Abbott for Malcolm Turnbull.\n\nThis broader political outlook, and Smith's articulate direct manner, has led some observers to speculate that she is a potential leader for a new conservative movement, one energised by the international populist surge.\n\nShe is, says John Adams, a former Coalition adviser who has written about the need for more intellectual depth in the new conservative movement, a more capable and charismatic messenger than, say, Pauline Hanson. (\"I think Pauline has a lot of good sentiment, I am not sure about the ability,\" says Smith of Hanson.)\n\nIn the months since the campaign Smith has kept in touch with supporters via videos on her Facebook page. In them she is relentlessly bright and articulate, upbeat about Christmas and Australia Day, though scandalised by the recent billboard that showed a pair of little girls celebrating in a hijab and cheerily opposed to the \"threat\" of multiculturalism. She denies ever having had media training, though confesses that she is constantly asked if she has.\n\nAsked if she plans to run for office again Smith says she cannot answer the question as her entire focus is directed towards the defamation action and her family.\n\n\"People say this is sexist, well I am sexist, I love being a wife and mother, that is the best I have ever done in my life\u2026 I love being my husband's wife.\"\n\nIn the next breath she adds that she and her husband have made the decision to use any platform to put forward their message.\n\n\"I want to be able to look my children in the eye and say I did everything I could to stand for what is right.\" The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Nick O&#39;Malley"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Religion news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Islam-critical Kirralie Smith seen as potential libertarian leader","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2567","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Narellan","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Wollondilly Advertiser","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"346769048","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Wollondilly Advertiser","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wollondillyadvertiser.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695193907373","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:50:27Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:11:50Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/157221b2-f74a-469e-b91c-c9863ca767f7.jpg/r3_0_725_408_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

People who work with sex offenders said those arrested might have not complied because of personal factors or state registration requirements. \n \nLast year, 79 people were arrested for failing to register as sex offenders in Midland County, according to the sheriff\u2019s office. That number topped figures in 2015 \u2014 when there were 53 arrests for the offense \u2014 and 2014, when there were 37 arrests. \n \nSara Bustilloz, spokeswoman for the city of Midland, said MPD has been diligent about holding sex offenders accountable for registration. She also said the department has recently reached out to other area offices for help. \n \n\u201cOver the past years, instead of placing all the burden on ourselves, we can communicate,\u201d Bustilloz said. \u201cWe talk to parole or probation officers if they hear something about a sex offender changing addresses. We interact with them to see if they\u2019re moving.\u201d \n \nTexas law requires sex offenders to register while on probation or parole. During this time period, a child safety zone perimeter prevents those registered from living within 500 or 1,000 feet of schools and parks. The city of Midland doesn\u2019t have an ordinance that restricts residency after probation or parole, Bustilloz said. \n \nState law requires many sex offenders to provide updated personal information to law enforcement agencies for the rest of their lives. They also have to check in annually or quarterly, depending on the severity of their offenses. Failure to meet the registration requirements results in a felony charge. \n \nAllen Bell, director of adult probation for Midland County, said his department reviews probation conditions with sex offenders. He said they face more than two dozen conditions that others on probation don\u2019t have. \n \n\u201cWe peel all that apart in excruciating detail,\u201d Bell said. \u201cWe go over what that condition means and how we\u2019re going to enforce that condition.\u201d \n \nWith sex offenders, the probation department focuses half of its efforts on enforcement while the other half goes to treatment. \n \n\u201cWe contract with a therapist to make sure they go there,\u201d Bell said. \u201cThey\u2019re getting to the root of the problem to make sure they don\u2019t offend again.\u201d \n \nBill Magee, a psychotherapist who counsels convicted sex offenders in the area, said they have ways of justifying their actions and often struggle with responsibility. He said those factors could have influenced recent arrest numbers. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s relative to several things,\u201d Magee said. \u201cThe values, thoughts and beliefs individuals convey is the primary one. The second is the economy has gone down in 2015 and 2016. Things like that are becoming paramount in their minds, and they let their responsibilities slip.\u201d \n \nThe Texas Department of Public Safety informs residents about sex offenders living in the state through a registry that includes names, physical descriptions, birth dates and addresses. MPD has a liaison working with the DPS to update public information about sex offenders in the city, Bustilloz said. \n \nRecently, sex offenders have been required to provide additional information to law enforcement officials. Mary Sue Molnar, executive director of the nonprofit Texas Voices for Reason and Justice, said the requirements constitute a burden that can lead to arrests throughout the state. \n \n\u201cLaws have evolved so much throughout the years for people who are sex offenders,\u201d Molnar said. \u201cIt\u2019s grueling. A lot of violations of these laws are technical offenses \u2014 they don\u2019t let them know seven days before they intend to move or seven days after they move. If they don\u2019t register a change in their vehicle or social media site, it can amount to a failure to comply.\u201d \n \nAs people move into the city, Bustilloz said the MPD has considered ways to track newcomers who should be registering as sex offenders. \n \n\u201cThe number of arrests for failing to register \u2014 it\u2019s not necessarily due to an increase in the population,\u201d Bustilloz said. \u201cObviously, we have more people needing to register if they\u2019re moving to Midland from a different town. People moving to Midland need to register within seven days.\u201d \n \nThe county\u2019s population rose 17.7 percent from 2010 to 2015, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates. On Friday, 451 people on the DPS registry lived in Midland County. \n \nMagee has seen an uptick in clients over the years. When he started working in the area in 1994, he had 30 clients; now he has more than 150 clients, Magee said. He thinks the number of people on the registry in Midland-Odessa will keep growing. \n \n\u201cSex offenses continue to happen every year,\u201d Magee said. \u201cPeople come out of prison, and the numbers increase every year. Some people should go off of the paper, but they mess up. Some people who get out are truly changed and enter the treatment program and are truly successful.\u201d \n \nStill, Magee said there are hurdles for people who have been convicted of sex offenses. He said some of his local clients experienced challenges with finding or maintaining employment or housing. \n \nStatewide, Molnar thinks the failure to find hosing is most directly related to arrests. She said it\u2019s often difficult for people on the registry to settle outside child safety zones during probation or parole periods. Even after that period, she said sex offenders have to fight negative public perceptions about them. \n \n\u201cThe majority of apartment complexes\u2019 property management companies won\u2019t let anybody with a sex offense live there,\u201d Molnar said. \u201cIf they\u2019re renting from an individual, they do a background check. Whether they\u2019re on parole or probation or not, housing is difficult.\u201d \n \nTo combat the issue, Texas Voices for Reason and Justice tries to convince state legislators that registration should end when sex offenders complete probation or parole. \n \n\u201cOne thing we focus on is we would like to see at some point a reduction in the public registry,\u201d Molnar said. \u201cMost require registry for life without removal from the registry. We would like to see it go down.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"San Antonio news","group":"US regional"},{"name":"Crime and punishment news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Arrests increase for failing to register as sex offenders","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Bexar","zipCode":"78205","state":"Texas","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"San Antonio","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"MySanAntonio","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169687373","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2"},"name":"MySanAntonio","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard","Local","Geographic"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.mysanantonio.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695193911729","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:11:54Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Penn State (12-10 overall, 4-5 Big Ten) is making progress and it faced a unique test on the way to the win on Saturday. After getting out to a lead that grew to as much as 21 points, the lead was cut to just 3 in the final minutes. The adversity allowed Chambers\u2019 squad to learn how to weather a late-game comeback attempt after holding a large lead for much of the game. \n \nPenn State made its first seven shots. Shep Garner hit an elbow jumper and two three-pointers while Josh Reaves had a dunk off a steal and a layup to get the Lions an early 12-6 lead. Lamar Stevens banked a shot off the backboard and Tony Carr added a layup before the first Penn State shot failed to go through the hoop. \n \nAfter the first miss, a solid jump shot by Stevens that rimmed out, Payton Banks hit a three-pointer on the next trip down the court. Shep Garner missed a three-point shot on the next possession but Mike Watkins grabbed the offensive rebound and put it back in for a 21-13 Penn State lead at the under 12-minute timeout. It was as fast of an offensive start as the young Lions have had this season, 9 of 11 from the field as a team. \n \nPenn State stretched the first-half lead out to as much as 14 before the Illini began to fight back. The gap was cut to 8 but on the next trip down the court, Shep Garner hit a three. After a defensive stop, Banks hit a pair of free throws and then a three-pointer to get the lead back out to 16 with less than three minutes left in the first half. Mike Watkins dunked an offensive rebound to continue the run and took a behind-the-back pass from Terrence Samuel for another dunk and a 20-point Penn State lead. \n \nTony Carr hit a layup to keep the lead at 20 going into the half, 45-25. It was the best offensive half of basketball for Pat Chambers\u2019 team in recent memory. Penn State committed only 5 fouls as a team and no player had more than one heading into the second half. \n \nThe second half started in a similar fashion. Shep Garner found Watkins for another dunk , it would not be his last dunk of the game. After the teams went back and forth with a 20 point spread between the teams for a few minutes, Illinois chipped into the lead. A 9-0 run cut the lead to 52-40 with just over 11 minutes to play before Tony Carr answered with a runner in the lane with the shot clock running out to end the rally. \n \nIllinois went on an 8-0 run a few minutes later, cutting the lead to 57-51 with 5:38 left in the game. It was a very challenging stretch for the young Lion team. The defense faltered as a unit, allowing open shots and clear driving lanes to the hoop. Pat Chambers called a timeout to allow his team to regroup. Tony Carr hit a left-handed shot in the lane to break the streak once again. \n \nWith the lead cut to 3, under three minutes to play, Payton Banks hit a critical three-pointer. Illinois answered with a long-ball of their own by Coleman-Lands and the game was 65-62 with 1:38 remaining on the game clock. \n \nJosh Reaves made a steal to get the Lions the ball following a Mike Watkins missed dunk. After a missed three-pointer by Banks, Reaves got the offensive rebound, passed to Garner, who was fouled. Garner hit the front and back end of the one-and-one free throws to give PSU a lead of 67-62 with 33.3 seconds left in the game. \n \nIllinois cut the lead to 67-64 with 9 seconds left in the game. A flagrant foul was called on the next play, giving PSU two free throws and the ball. That and two more free throws from Josh Reaves with 2 seconds left iced the game for the Lions, 71-67. \n   Four Factors  Team  Total Possessions  PPP  eFG%  OReb%  TO%  FT Rate  Team  Total Possessions  PPP  eFG%  OReb%  TO%  FT Rate  Penn State  66  1.07  57.5%  20.0%  18.1%  26.4%  Illinois  -  1.01  47.7%  40.50%  19.6%  12.3%   \nThe Lions were very efficient on the offensive end early in the game and after having a bit of a lull in the middle of the second half, the team got back on track. Outside of a few uncharacteristic plays, the team was able to keep turnovers under control. Reaves alone had 5 of the team\u2019s 12 giveaways, mostly trying to force a play. After lean years in the recent past where the team was looking for a third consistent scorer, PSU had five players contribute 8 or more points. That was with Lamar Stevens having a tough night, shooting 1-7 for just 3 points, including a miss on the front end of a 1 and 1 late in the game. \n Player of the Game  \nShep Garner - (18 pts, 3 rebs, 1 asst. 4-9 from 3-point range.) Garner played a solid game from beginning to end. He got off to a hot, 3 for 3 start from behind the arc which gave the Lions a great deal of confidence. While he did the bulk of his scoring early on, his presence on the court was what the team needs out of the junior leader. \n  Random Observations  Julian Moore is finally showing noticeable improvement on the court. Moore\u2019s statistics are not gaudy, nor is his play above average or even average for a Big Ten low-post player. That aside, he has been able to play relatively productive minutes, giving Mike Watkins a chance to rest and avoid foul trouble. He played 17 minutes and had 5 rebounds and one assist. He did not attempt a shot, but the point is that he is giving the team minutes. Just a few games ago, Moore was still struggling to play without being the weakest link; a clear target for the other team to exploit. He is now able to hold his own, while it may not fill out a box score, the minutes he plays allows Watkins to stay fresh.  Shep Garner could help the team a great deal if he is able to spot up and hit open three-point shots. Garner started 3 for 3, which gave he and the team a great deal of swagger in the early-going. It also opened up lanes to the hoop and mid-range shots for his teammates. He has shown flashes in the past few games of having a little more comfort within the role that he has this season. If he and Banks can provide relatively reliable support from long-range, it could open up the rest of the PSU offense.  The late-game runs that Illinois was able to put together were a great test for the Penn State team. While it would have been nice for the group to hold a 20-point lead for the entire game, it allowed the young Lions to work through the process of holding a large lead. The team has to learn all facets of winning. From behind, ugly, and when it gets out to a huge lead. This game will serve a purpose later this year and in future seasons.  There is a lot of basketball to be played, but as of the end of the game, Penn State is currently ahead of 6 teams in the conference standings. That\u2019s not bad considering the murderer\u2019s row of opponents the team has faced recently. While it is unlikely that the Lions will climb to the top of the standings, it may be able to hold a friendly position in the Big Ten tournament. A first round win coupled with another win in the conference tourney could get the team to the NIT with just a .500 finish in the conference regular season play the rest of the way.   Up Next  \nThe Lions will travel to Bloomington, Indiana for a Wednesday game with Indiana. Tip-off is at 6:30 p.m. and the game will be televised on the Big Ten Network. The Hoosiers won in State College 78-75 with a three pointer at the final buzzer.

I was their chaplain, providing moral support through counseling, encouragement and a calming presence. Best of all, I got to deliver the launch prayers for the Space Shuttle. \n \nOne morning in 2000, I drove to the Cape to bring a prayer for the launch crew. The weather was Florida-gorgeous, and from previous conversations with the engineers, I was expecting to hear \u201cgo for ignition.\u201d \n \nHowever, when I arrived, a bleary-eyed meteorologist whispered some insider\u2019s intel. \n \n\u201cBad weather will likely scrub our launch,\u201d the lieutenant said. \n \n\"What!\u201d \n \n\"The weather is great here, but,\" she said, pointing to a Doppler radar screen \"Spain has thunderstorms.\" \n \nMy crumpled face incited more schooling from the lieutenant.  \n \n\"If the mission is aborted after launch, the Shuttle will need a place to land, right?\u201d \n \nI nodded. \n \n\u201cIn that case, we\u2019d have to abort the mission and send the Shuttle to Moron Air Base in Spain. Unfortunately, Spain is having monstrous thunderstorms today.\u201d \n \nI stood dumbstruck with irony that a weather problem hundreds of miles in the distance could scrub our launch under such beautiful skies. \n \n\"All we can do is focus on our weather here. We let the folks downrange worry about their weather.\u201d \n \nThe lieutenant\u2019s guidance to take care of business first in your own backyard was echoed last week by one of my readers in tiny Walterboro, S.C. \n \nHer name is Leslie Montroy. Montroy is a 62-year-old grandmother working at a recycling plant. More importantly, we share the same awesomely cute grandsons. \n \n\u201cIn this present climate of political upheaval and discourse, I\u2019ve been feeling helpless and small. Yet, what can I do?\u201d Montroy confessed. \u201cI can\u2019t change the presidency or march in a protest. \n \n\u201cThen it occurred to me,\u201d she added. \u201cWhat am I passionate about? What is important to me?\u201d \n \nI listened fixedly as she told me how she\u2019s always been passionate to help the elderly in a local Meals-on-Wheels program. She shared her passion with her co-worker, Robert Cooper, and they drafted an idea. \n \nTogether, they started imagining what it might be like to organize the numerous churches in Walterboro to bring companionship to the elderly. \n \n\u201cWhat if 31 churches in town would send a team out each day to visit the elderly shut-ins? Just visit these people and become a listening friend.\u201d \n \n\u201cThirty-one days, 31 flavors of churches,\u201d I suggested. \n \n\u201cYes,\u201d she said with a dutiful chuckle. \u201cI don\u2019t know how or if it\u2019ll work yet, but I\u2019m trying to find one thing, one problem, or adventure I can become passionate about in my community. If everyone would find a passion for helping in their own backyard, then just maybe we wouldn\u2019t feel so helpless.\u201d \n \nMontroy calls this passion to help, \u201cbeing strong where you are.\u201d \n \n\u201cWe need to imagine our efforts are like dropping a pebble in a still pond,\u201d she explained. \u201cWhen the ripples advance from our efforts, it might become a chain reaction of passion. We help the elderly and maybe that helps us all. \n \n\u201cThere\u2019s been lots of bad lately that has caused some bad chain reaction,\u201d Montroy reflected. \u201cWhy can\u2019t a good cause ignite a chain reaction too? \n \n\u201cI just don\u2019t think it takes that much to stop feeling helpless.\u201d \n \nMontroy\u2019s right. We can\u2019t control the weather downrange from us. If we turn our focus toward our own backyard, we might just ignite hope and launch the dreams of the next generation \u2014 and our shared grandkids. \n \nMakes sense to me.

He alleged that the Liberals wanted to wrest police from Mr Grant, a senior Nationals MP. \n \n\"The Nationals wanted police, the right wing faction of the Liberals wanted police,\" he said. \"So she split it in two.\" \n \n\"It's the police who keep us safe from terrorism,\" Mr Foley said. \n \n\"The police commissioner now has to report to two people.

They estimated that the cost of these price rises to the NHS in England was around £380m a year - which only included community-based prescribing, not hospital prescribing.\n\nRationing\n\nDrugs start off being on-patent, and their high prices allow pharmaceutical companies to profit from their investments in research and development.\n\nAfter patents have expired and generic versions are sold, the theory is that drug prices should fall close to the cost of production.\n\nHowever, because of high drug prices, the NHS is often not able to approve some new cancer drugs for use.\n\nNew treatments then have to be rationed.\n\nDr Andrew Hill, senior research fellow in pharmacology and therapeutics at the University of Liverpool, and Melissa Barber from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, collected prices on medicines available on the NHS for their presentation at the cancer conference.\n\nThey discovered that busulfan, which is used to treat leukaemia, cost 21p per tablet in 2011 and £2.61 in 2016.\n\nTamoxifen, used to treat breast cancer, cost 10p per tablet in 2011 and £1.21 in 2016.\n\nOf 89 cancer medicines looked at in the analysis, 21 showed price rises from 2011 to 2016 - with 17 of those classified as generic.\n\nFourteen generic cancer drugs showed price rises of more than 100%.\n\nAnd compared with prices for the same drugs in India, the UK drugs were roughly 20 times more expensive.\n\n'Worrying'\n\nDr Hill said he was surprised to find several companies had consistently raised the prices of cancer treatment.\n\n\"We have found that some companies take over the supply of some generic cancer medicines and then raise the price progressively,\" he said.\n\nHe said this was \"worrying\", particularly when the Cancer Drugs Fund is under pressure from high prices.\n\nBut Warwick Smith, director-general of the British Generic Manufacturers Association, said the actual prices paid by hospitals were usually much lower than the list prices.\n\nHe said the tendered price paid by hospitals for tamoxifen 10mg tablets is £4.85 for a pack of 30, or 16p per tablet. \n\n'Significant savings'\n\n\"Generic competition in the oncology market has produced very significant savings for the NHS and generated access for patients to medicines such as tamoxifen which can be used to reduce the risk of breast cancer and not just to treat it.\n\n\"In the case of generic medicines used in hospitals, it is important to distinguish between the actual price paid by trusts and the much higher list prices often quoted.\"\n\nThe Health Services Medical Supplies (Costs) Bill, currently going through Parliament, is designed to allow the NHS to regulate prices in the future.\n\nAs a result of the bill, companies found to be raising prices with no clear justification will be referred to the Competition and Markets Authority, and could face fines.\n\nThere is a similar situation in other European countries. \n\nIn Spain and Italy, failure to accept the high prices demanded for some generic treatments has led to warnings from companies that they could stop their supply.\n\n\"At a time when cancer patients are living longer and better lives due to effective treatments, this situation is particularly worrying,\" Dr Hill said.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Pharma industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Cancer news","group":"Science"},{"name":"Medical news","group":"Science"},{"name":"NHS news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Cancer drugs price rise 'costing NHS millions'","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"GB","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"BBC","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169587494","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1920"},"name":"BBC","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/","publisher":"British Broadcasting Corporation"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695193926101","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:47:33Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:11:58Z","media":{"logo":[{"url":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/2015/newsspec_10857/bbc_news_logo.png?cb=1"}],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/1012A/production/_93843856_m6250404-tamoxifen_tablets_with_plastic_container-spl.jpg"},{"url":"http://c.files.bbci.co.uk/1012A/production/_93843856_m6250404-tamoxifen_tablets_with_plastic_container-spl.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

The reasons were both poaching and accidental. \n \nOn Friday, January 27, a 20-year-old elephant died after coming into contact with an illegal electric fence around a field near Karnataka's Bandipur National Park. On January 25, a female elephant was killed due to electrocution in the forests of Odisha's Rourkela district. \n \n\"The elephant climbed a small Bandha to reach out to the leaves, and touched the loosely hanging wire. We had informed the electricity department. Wires often hang loose due to the long distance between the electric poles in forests,\" Rourkela District Forest Officer Sanjeet Kumar told IANS on telephone. \n \nElectrocution is a method in which a wired trap or fence, mostly powered by a high tension electric line passing nearby in the forests, is used to kill the animals, either for poaching or to protect fields from herbivores. The wires with electric current are either placed on the preferred routes of the animals or passed through the water bodies used by animals. \n \nWildlife experts say instances of electrocution are on the rise and despite the 2005 guidelines of the Supreme Court's Central Empowered Committee (CEC) to the State Electricity Boards and Forest Departments to strengthened security to prevent poaching by electrocution, nothing much was done. \n \nAccording to Tito Joseph of the Wildlife Protection Society of India (WPSI), while every year at least 20 elephants die due to electrocution, at least 43 elephants were killed in 2016 in this manner. \n \n\"In 2011, at least 11 leopards died due to electrocution and at least 10 wild tigers were poached,\" Joseph told IANS. \n \nTwo leopards, one tigress and two sambar deer were also electrocuted between January 11 and 14 in different forest divisions of Maharashtra's Nagpur district. \n \nOn January 25, a sloth bear was found electrocuted with its claws harvested, in Amravati Forest Division of Maharashtra, an official told IANS.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Nature news","group":"Science"},{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Electrocution of wild animals increasing, experts raise concerns","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Daijiworldcom","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169676647","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"5"},"name":"Daijiworldcom","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard","Global","Geographic"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.daijiworld.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695193926583","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:11:58Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

In the fall of each year, I go to the NCHA Futurity not only to compete at times, but also to be a student of the industry. I watch the horses being shown and check the bloodlines to see what is the most popular and what crosses are preforming the best. During the sales, I look at every horse to determine attitude, conformation and the positive traits of each individual. Studying trends annually keeps me up to speed on which sires are most prolific and which dams have the bloodlines to reproduce successfully. I spend plenty of time talking to fellow trainers. They give me an inside perspective on which horses are easy to train, have the right attitude and the greatest athleticism. I want to know which ones they get excited about riding. These horses make our job easier and a lot more fun! \n\nProbably the most exciting part of my trip is scouting for the next great sire coming down the pike. Undoubtedly, this new up-and-coming sire will have finally gotten to breed quality mares in adequate numbers to produce something special. Sorting out whether they are a fluke or the real deal takes a keen eye. \n\nA key to finding the right horse to breed to is to identify the optimum characteristics and suitable conformation that fits events you wish to compete in. Good conformation to me means soundness and structure to ensure longevity in their career. I try to always watch the horses\u2019 movement to look for something special in their step or any things that are problematic. If I decide to purchase any horses while I am at the sales, I enlist the help of an expert veterinarian that understands the rigors of my event. \n\nWith all of this knowledge and continuing education, breeding is still a tossup. I watch the same mare with great conformation and impeccable breeding and a huge performance record year after year having different caliber foals. Even breeding to the same sire on multiple years, you are never going to have an exact duplicate. I try to breed my mare to a sire that has the capabilities and characteristics you want and a proven track record. What\u2019s interesting about sires is some can go along as young sires and not produce much but become very potent as a sire later in their years. \n\nFor my mare, I want her to be impeccably bred on both sides. The black type that is referred to at major sales means that the mare has been a producer or she has parents that are producers on both sides. However, there are many winners that don\u2019t produce and some producers that never won. This adds to the guessing game. \n\nOne thing that is not logical to me is when somebody buys a mare to breed that has conformation faults, a bad attitude, soundness problems or has an unpopular pedigree. Usually these issues will carry over to the foal and the breeder will probably get exactly what they already have or more often even worse. \n\nHorses are a huge expenditure! If you look at a tabulation of your expenses, you probably think 1) your house, 2) your car, maybe then 3) your horses when you consider all of the paraphernalia and constant care needed to show or keep them going. It\u2019s risky business in breeding; consider the financial requirements seriously before going down that path. \n\nWith all of this said, one of the greatest joys of my horsemanship career was watching a foal be born out of one of the mares I won on and loved. There is nothing like the hopes and dreams that are all tied up into one big bouncing bundle of bucking excitement that you see running in the pasture. Then if your dreams come true you may raise the most outstanding horse you\u2019ve ever had. It can become an addiction! \n\nSometimes the foals turned out great and sometimes not, but it didn\u2019t matter. The moment was so special. The time you spend with them and the relationship you have is like raising a child; it adds to why we breed horses. It\u2019s not all about how much they are worth or if they become a champion. It\u2019s a good part of life. \n\nIn summation, if you\u2019ve really thought about it and realize the expense and risk involved, breed your mare. Be sure that overall it\u2019s for that special excitement of actually seeing what your personal crystal ball sought. The more logical you are and educated, the better chance you\u2019ll have of having an enjoyable breeding experience. As a professional, I have always searched for that dream cross that would raise the extra special performance horse that would not only win, but would never be sold and become part of our family and our life and fulfill those childlike dreams.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: horse racing news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Breeding Your Next Champion By Al Dunning","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Bridle & Bit","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"217927682","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Bridle & Bit","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Sports","HorseRacing"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bridleandbit.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695193946110","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:12:06Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Trump imposed a temporary ban on all refugees and an indefinite one on Syrian refugees; he also imposed 90-day restriction on travellers from seven predominantly Muslim countries.\n\nMost of the inquiries she received, Taub said, were from Middle East refugees in Ottawa concerned that the new measures would close an important door for their relatives.\n\nFor years, refugees in Ottawa have been meeting relatives at the Canada-U.S. border, Taub said. The family members enter the U.S. on visitor visas; they're then allowed to make a refugee claim on this side of the border based on the Canada-U.S. safe third country agreement. The circuitous route was often used because many people from the Middle East found it easier to obtain visas to the U.S.\n\n\"Now they don't know how to get them to Canada,\" she said. \"That was the easiest route: It used to be very easy for Middle East refugees to get visas to go the United States, then come to the Canadian border.\"\n\nAnother local immigration and refugee lawyer, Negar Achtari, said she received panicked calls Saturday from people living in the U.S. on green cards. One Iranian-born woman, she said, was torn between visiting her sick mother and risking the life she had built in the U.S. during the past 19 years.\n\n\"She said, 'It's a very sad day when I have to make a choice between my ailing mother and my life in the United States,'\" Achtari said. \"Unfortunately, if she leaves, she won't be able to come back even with a green card that means they're effectively a permanent resident. It really is outrageous.\"\n\nIt remains unclear, Achtari said, how the new restrictions will affect Canadians who hold dual citizenship from one of the seven countries that Trump has targeted: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Yemen, Sudan, Libya and Somalia.\n\n\"Casting such a wide net, I think it's going to divide people,\" she said. \"I think it will embolden those who have an anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim view.\"\n\nLate Saturday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s director of communications, Kate Purchase, said on Twitter that U.S. National Security Advisor Michael T. Flynn has \u201cconfirmed Canadians, including dual citizens, will not be affected\u201d by Trump\u2019s executive order.\n\nJulie Taub said the local fallout from Trump's immigration restrictions may take time to unfold. But it's likely, she said, that more refugees will land here, and more will attempt to cross the border illegally into the U.S. from Canada.\n\nOttawa immigration lawyer Hadi Hakimi said many of the people he spoke to Saturday were upset and confused by Trump's edict. \"I personally think this decision will not serve any security purpose,\" Hakimi said. \"Banning people based on country of birth, religion, nationality, it's ridiculous.\"\n\nThe Afghan-born Hakimi said he spoke Saturday with one man, a dual U.S.-Iranian citizen, who was concerned he might not be able to return to the U.S. if he travelled to Iran.\n\nUnder one interpretation of Trump's new order, tens of thousands of Canadians with dual citizenship from one of the seven countries face a 90-day travel ban.\n\nTransport Minister Marc Garneau said on Twitter late Saturday that the Canadian government was seeking more information from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Department of Transportation: \"We are in contact with U.S. DHS and U.S. DOT to get more clarity on the impacts of the restrictions on travels. We will be providing further information to Canadians as it is available.\"\n\nIt's possible that Immigration Minister Ahmed Hussen will fall under the temporary ban if he's not travelling on a diplomatic passport. Hussen, who was appointed to cabinet earlier this month, was born in Somalia and came to Canada as a refugee.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Canada news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Refugees to Canada hit by ban","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","zipCode":"K9J","state":"Ontario","countryCode":"CA","zipArea":"Peterborough South","country":"Canada"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Peterborough Examiner","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169673474","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"209"},"name":"Peterborough Examiner","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["National","Geographic","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.thepeterboroughexaminer.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695193958917","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:12:16Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://storage.thepeterboroughexaminer.com/v1/dynamic_resize/sws_path/suns-prod-images/1297321452805_ORIGINAL.jpg?quality=80&size=320x&stmp=1349399126172"}],"video":[]}}

There's a very strong nexus between our immigration and visa programs and terrorist plots and extremist networks inside the United States,\" the official continued. \"Look at the recent, high-profile attacks that have occurred inside the country -- an immigration nexus is not at all uncommon. I won't go through the list of them all now. One obvious example would be Tashfeen Malik and the San Bernadino incident with the K1 visa.\" \n\nA K1 visa is a non-immigrant visa issued to the foreign-citizen fiance of a US citizen. Tashfeen Malik was from a family of wealthy landowners in Pakistan and later moved to Saudi Arabia with her immediate family. Her husband, Syed Rizwan Farook, was a US citizen. \n\nPakistan and Saudi Arabia, however, are not on the list of countries subject to the new ban. \n\nThe administration is facing criticism from leaders in the U.S. and around the world for taking steps their critics say are unconstitutional and anti-American. \n\nThe second mention of San Bernardino came when the official was trying to explain why there was no grace period before the executive order went into effect, to help ease implementation. \n\n\"Imagine if this had been an executive order that had been contemplated the day before the San Bernardino shooter entered the United States?\" the official asked. \"Would have delaying its implementation served the best interests of the country? The reality is we don't know who the next individual is who will exploit our immigration programs successfully. If you choose that something is necessary to do for the sake of national security, it should be done immediately.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Inland Empire news","group":"US regional"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Trump official incorrectly justifies travel ban","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Santa Barbara","zipCode":"93109","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Santa Barbara","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"KEYT3","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169681321","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"188"},"name":"KEYT3","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Politics","Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.keyt.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695193961204","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:12:17Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

He did some shoveling outside his Williston home, and then went inside to take ibuprofen for a nagging pain in his arm. \n\nHalf an hour later, the pain was gone, and Boone was celebrating the holiday with his family. \n\nBut later that night, he woke up from an early evening nap in front of the television to raging pain in his arm, back and chest. \n\n\"I was hurting so bad I started breaking out in a sweat,\" Boone said. \"The chest pain was the worst it felt like somebody was sitting on me.\" \n\nSoon he was sick, and his wife called for an ambulance, which managed to make the trip to his subdivision on Harvest Hill Drive, but paramedics had to borrow Boone's snow-blower to clear a path to load him into the vehicle. \n\nThe weather that earlier had meant little more than a blustery white Christmas was now suddenly a terrifying barrier to the life-saving medical treatment that emergency room staff at CHI St. Alexius Health in Williston almost immediately knew Boone needed. \n\n\"We stabilized him as best we could, but at that time I realized our resources were exhausted and he would not survive if we didn't get him elsewhere,\" said Karen Johnson, a certified registered nurse anesthetist, who tended to Boone that night. \n\nThe 45-year-old was having a massive heart attack due to double blockages, and needed to be transported to Trinity Hospital in Minot for surgery. \n\nHigh winds were keeping a medical flight crew on the ground, and local ambulance drivers said the snow was piling up too high to make such a long trip possible. \n\nBy 1 a.m., after Boone's heart had stopped for a second time, Johnson made a call to Rick Sigvaldsen, Williston's Department of Transportation district maintenance supervisor. \n\nShe asked if a snowplow could escort an ambulance to Minot, and the response was immediate. \n\n\"Absolutely,\" he said. \n\nWith snowplow driver Ed Nelson clearing a path, an ambulance carrying Boone, a paramedic and members of the Valley Med-Flight crew made its way to Minot, where a cardiologist put a stent in Boone's heart. \n\nThe trip took four hours. \n\n\"There's absolutely no way we would have done it without the snowplow,\" Corey Johnson, a Williston paramedic who rode in the back with Boone, said. \n\nThe decision to call wasn't made easily, Johnson said, pointing out that she would not have asked others to travel in risky conditions if so much hadn't been at stake, the Williston Herald (http://bit.ly/2kjDsZD ) reports. \n\n\"I would never have considered calling anybody out into those conditions if it hadn't been to save someone's life,\" she said, adding that the response she got was not unexpected. \"I was relieved, but not truly surprised because of the nature of the people in this community.\" \n\nBoone, a Mississippi native, is back to work in the oil industry, and enjoying his first grandchild, who was born a month ago. The two met for the first time after Boone's discharge from the hospital. \n\n\"I can't thank them enough. If it was not for them I wouldn't be here today \u2014 the snow plow driver played just as much a part as the doctors,\" he said. \n\n--- \n\nInformation from: Williston Herald, http://www.willistonherald.com \n\nAn AP Member Exchange shared by the Williston Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Elizabeth HackenburgThe Williston Herald"},"topics":[],"title":"Man suffering a massive heart attack saved by snowplow","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Bibb","zipCode":"31201","state":"Georgia","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Macon","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Macon Telegraph","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659292","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"56"},"name":"Macon Telegraph","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.macon.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://bit.ly/2kjDsZD","http://www.willistonherald.com/"],"sequenceId":"695193963410","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:12:18Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The reasons were both poaching and accidental.\n\nOn Friday, January 27, a 20-year-old elephant died after coming into contact with an illegal electric fence around a field near Karnataka's Bandipur National Park. On January 25, a female elephant was killed due to electrocution in the forests of Odisha's Rourkela district.\n\n\"The elephant climbed a small Bandha to reach out to the leaves, and touched the loosely hanging wire. We had informed the electricity department. Wires often hang loose due to the long distance between the electric poles in forests,\" Rourkela District Forest Officer Sanjeet Kumar told IANS on telephone.\n\nElectrocution is a method in which a wired trap or fence, mostly powered by a high tension electric line passing nearby in the forests, is used to kill the animals, either for poaching or to protect fields from herbivores. The wires with electric current are either placed on the preferred routes of the animals or passed through the water bodies used by animals.\n\nWildlife experts say instances of electrocution are on the rise and despite the 2005 guidelines of the Supreme Court's Central Empowered Committee (CEC) to the State Electricity Boards and Forest Departments to strengthened security to prevent poaching by electrocution, nothing much was done.\n\nAccording to Tito Joseph of the Wildlife Protection Society of India (WPSI), while every year at least 20 elephants die due to electrocution, at least 43 elephants were killed in 2016 in this manner.\n\n\"In 2011, at least 11 leopards died due to electrocution and at least 10 wild tigers were poached,\" Joseph told IANS.\n\nTwo leopards, one tigress and two sambar deer were also electrocuted between January 11 and 14 in different forest divisions of Maharashtra's Nagpur district.\n\nOn January 25, a sloth bear was found electrocuted with its claws harvested, in Amravati Forest Division of Maharashtra, an official told IANS.\n\n(Kushagra Dixit can be reached at kushagra.d@ians.in)\n\n--IANS\n\nkd/vm/tb/sac","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"IANS India Private Limited"},"topics":[{"name":"Nature news","group":"Science"},{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Electrocution of wild animals increasing, experts raise concerns","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Yahoo!

Tom Udall, the Democratic dean of New Mexico\u2019s delegation, once again holds the ace card among his colleagues \u2013 a seat on the Senate Appropriations Committee. \n \nThis powerful perch gives Udall a chance to influence all federal spending bills. It\u2019s particularly important for New Mexico, whose economy is so heavily reliant on federal assistance. \n  \n \nContinue reading \n    \nUdall has also ascended to the top-ranking Democratic spot on the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, another important assignment for the state given New Mexico\u2019s abundance of Native American tribes. \n \nThe senator from Santa Fe will be busy: He also has seats on the Senate Foreign Relations, Commerce and Rules Committees. \n \nSen. Martin Heinrich, also a Democrat, will continue to carve out a national security niche with assignments to both Senate Intelligence and Armed Services Committees. \n \nThe Intel Committee post gives Heinrich a powerful voice on high-profile national matters, such as domestic surveillance and torture, while the Armed Services seat ensures an ability to look out for New Mexico\u2019s four military bases. \n \nHeinrich will also serve as the top Democrat on the joint House-Senate Economic Committee, which focuses on U.S. employment, production and purchasing power. \n \nOn the House side, Rep. Steve Pearce \u2013 the delegation\u2019s lone Republican \u2013 has re-joined the Natural Resources Committee, giving him a stronger voice on federal land use and endangered species issues so often contentious in New Mexico. \n \nPearce also retains his post on the Financial Services Committee, where he will chair a new subcommittee aimed at breaking up terrorist financing networks. \n \nRep. Michelle Lujan Grisham, an Albuquerque Democrat, will remain on the House Agriculture and Budget committees. \n  \n \nContinue reading \n    \nThe agriculture post gives Lujan Grisham, who has announced a run for governor in 2018, a platform on issues important to New Mexico\u2019s many farming communities. The Budget Committee sets spending guidelines for Congress as it develops specific appropriations bills. \n \nLujan Grisham has also been elected as chairwoman of Congressional Hispanic Congress. That gives her a big megaphone on issues affecting Hispanics in the U.S. \n \nFinally, Rep. Ben Ray Luján, D-N.M., has retained his seat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, one of the most high-profile congressional panels working on a wide array of issues affecting the American economy. \n \nLuján was also re-elected by his fellow Democrats as chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, an important political post that puts him in charge of his party\u2019s congressional races nationwide. \n \n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \n \nHeinrich, who is seeking re-election in 2018, recently felt compelled to explain to constituents a late-night vote he took on drug prices early in the new Congress. \n \nThe New Mexico Democrat was among 13 Democratic senators who cast a vote early this month against paving the way to lower prescription drug prices in the U.S. by importing drugs from Canada. The measure, sponsored by Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, failed narrowly. \n \nHeinrich\u2019s vote was part of series of procedural votes related to the repeal of Obamacare. Heinrich supports Obamacare and does not want to repeal it. \n  \n \nContinue reading \n    \nCritics of the Democratic senators noted that they had received big bucks from the pharmaceutical industry \u2013 in Heinrich\u2019s case, $150,500 between 2011 and 2016. \n \nHeinrich and other Democratic senators voting against the move to open the U.S. market to Canadian pharmaceuticals said they were concerned about unsafe and unregulated drugs flooding the U.S. market. \n \n\u201cDespite what some have claimed, I have challenged PhRMA (the drug industry) on their top legislative priority and was an original cosponsor of the Medicare Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Act, which sought to allow the federal government to use its purchasing power to drive a hard bargain with manufacturers and negotiate lower prescription drug prices,\u201d Heinrich wrote on his Facebook page in response to the criticism. \u201cOn the importation vote, the promise of being able to access cheaper prescription drugs is obviously a goal I have long shared, but so is ensuring the integrity of those drugs.\u201d \n \nEmail: mcoleman@abqjournal.com.

Regarded as the only acrobatic company of its kind, the nearly 20 total performers offered audiences everything from traditional Chinese dance to breathtaking balancing acts and awe-inspiring stunts. \n \nThe team included groups of both men and women performing in a variety of acts designed to entertain an audience of all ages. Children stood with mouths agape watching seemingly impossible tumbling acts, contortionists, and balancing acts reminiscent of the offerings of Cirque du Soleil. Audience members awarded performers with a standing ovation following the show. \n \nThere is more to come at the Nixon Centre this year, including the \u201cMasters of Soul\u201d on Feb. 4 beginning at 7 p.m. A celebration of the early \u201860s popular motown musicians, the performance will feature hits by The Temptations, Gladys Knight & The Pips, Marvin Gaye, The Four Tops, The Supremes and James Brown. \n \nAlso in February, the Nixon Centre will offer a theatre production of \u201cThe Grapes of Wrath,\u201d performed by the National Players. Tickets are available now for these acts, and can be purchased online at www.thenixoncentre.net. A calendar of events including school performances is also available on the website.

That is one of my roles, to come out aggressive and take wickets. \n \n\"I will do that the same as I have been all summer in Australia.\" \n \nSame, though, is not a word the Australian team will be using much as they look back on their previous two matches at Eden Park ahead of game one there on Monday. \n \nThey were rolled for 151 in that 2015 encounter before succumbing for four runs less in a 159-run hammering almost a year ago. \n \nStarc says Australia have learned their lesson about being lured in by the famously small boundaries, mostly down the ground, at the largely rugby-based venue. \n \n\"We've spoken about giving ourselves more time. \n \n\"The smaller boundaries are in the back of your mind but you always have more time than you think, especially in 50-over cricket where you don't have to score 300 in the first 40 overs. \n \n\"For here, where it might swing and nip a little bit, you can give yourself a chance to get in, see some balls and take the chance [to be aggressive] at the back end.\" \n \nMaking that adjustment, for the Australian batsmen and bowlers, will be key if they are to retain the silverware, but it won't be easy. \n \nStarc admitted they had not seen much swing or seam in their 4-1 ODI series victory over Pakistan during the past couple of weeks, matches also played on significantly bigger grounds than they would encounter in New Zealand. \n \nAnd while the reminder he did not have to bowl to Brendon McCullum was greeted with a wide smile, Starc said they were wary of a Black Caps batting line-up that was particularly dangerous in their own conditions. \n \n ","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"CLAY WILSON"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: cricket news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Standout Starc ready to step up","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"NZ","country":"New Zealand"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Dominion Post","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169672420","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1076"},"name":"Dominion Post","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Cricket","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://stuff.co.nz"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695193988936","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:12:26Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It also covered anyone with an approved refugee application.\n\nIt was unclear how quickly the order might affect people in detention.\n\nUnder Trump's order, it had appeared that an untold number of foreign-born U.S. residents now traveling outside the U.S. could be stuck overseas for at least 90 days even though they held permanent residency \"green cards\" or other visas. However, an official with the Department of Homeland Security said Saturday night that no green-card holders from the seven countries cited in Trump's order had been prevented from entering the U.S.\n\nSome foreign nationals who were allowed to board flights before the order was signed Friday had been detained at U.S. airports, told they were no longer welcome. The DHS official who briefed reporters by phone said 109 people who were in transit on airplanes had been denied entry and 173 had not been allowed to get on their planes overseas.\n\nTrump billed his sweeping executive order as a necessary step to stop \"radical Islamic terrorists\" from coming to the U.S. Included is a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen and a 120-day suspension of the U.S. refugee program.\n\nTrump's order singled out Syrians for the most aggressive ban, indefinitely blocking entry for anyone from that country, including those fleeing civil war.\n\nThe directive did not do anything to prevent attacks from homegrown extremists who were already in America, a primary concern of federal law enforcement officials. It also omitted Saudi Arabia, home to most of the Sept. 11 hijackers.\n\nAs a candidate Trump pledged to temporarily ban Muslims from coming to the U.S., then said he would implement \"extreme vetting\" for people from countries with significant terror concerns.\n\nTrump told reporters Saturday the order is \"not a Muslim ban.\"\n\n\"It's working out very nicely,\" Trump said of the implementation of his order. \"We're going to have a very, very strict ban, and we're going to have extreme vetting, which we should have had in this country for many years.\"\n\nThe order sparked protests at several of the nation's international airports, including New York's Kennedy and Chicago's O'Hare and facilities in Minneapolis and Dallas-Forth Worth. In San Francisco, hundreds blocked the street outside the arrival area of the international terminal. Several dozen demonstrated at the airport in Portland, Oregon, briefly disrupting light rail service while hoisting signs that read \"Portland Coffee Is From Yemen\" and chanting anti-Trump slogans. Among the dozens showing support for refugees at Denver's airport were those who sang \"refugees are welcome here.\"\n\nU.S. lawmakers and officials around the globe also criticized the move. Sen. Ben Sasse, a Nebraska Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said while Trump is right to focus on border security, the order is \"too broad.\"\n\n\"If we send a signal to the Middle East that the U.S. sees all Muslims as jihadis, the terrorist recruiters win by telling kids that America is banning Muslims and that this is America versus one religion,\" Sasse said. \"Our generational fight against jihadism requires wisdom.\"\n\nIn Tehran, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said Iran would stop issuing new visas to U.S. citizens in response to Trump's ban, but that anyone already with a visa to Iran wouldn't be turned away.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau took to Twitter Saturday afternoon to say that refugees were welcome in Canada, \"regardless of your faith.\"\n\nTwo of the first people blocked from entering the United States were Iraqis with links to the U.S. military.\n\nHameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi were detained by immigration officials after landing at New York's Kennedy airport Friday night. Both had been released by Saturday night after their lawyers intervened.\n\nDarweesh had worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Army when it invaded Iraq in 2003 and later worked as a contract engineer. In their court filing, his lawyers said Alshawai's wife had worked for a U.S. security contractor in Iraq. Members of her family had been killed by insurgents because of their association with the U.S. military.\n\nThe government can exempt foreign nationals from the ban if their entry is deemed in the national interest. But it was not immediately clear how that exemption might be applied.\n\nDiplomats from the seven countries singled out by Trump's order would still be allowed into the U.S.\n\nThose already in the U.S. with a visa or green card would be allowed to stay, according to the official, who wasn't authorized to publicly discuss the details of how Trump's order was being put in place and spoke only on condition of anonymity.\n\nTrump's order also directed U.S. officials to review information as needed to fully vet foreigners asking to come to the U.S. and draft a list of countries that don't provide that information. That left open the possibility that citizens of other countries could also face a travel ban.\n\nThe U.S. may still admit refugees on a case-by-case basis during the freeze, and the government would continue to process requests from people claiming religious persecution, \"provided that the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual's country.\"\n\nThe Council on American-Islamic Relations said it would challenge the constitutionality of Trump's order.\n\n\"There is no evidence that refugees -- the most thoroughly vetted of all people entering our nation -- are a threat to national security,\" said Lena F. Masri, the group's national litigation director. \"This is an order that is based on bigotry, not reality.\"\n\nJohn Cohen, a former Department of Homeland Security counterterrorism official who worked under Democratic and Republican administrations, said the order didn't address America's \"primary terrorism-related threat\" -- people already in the U.S. who become inspired by what they see on the internet.\n\nTrump's order drew support from some Republican lawmakers who have urged more security measures for the refugee vetting program, particularly for those from Syria.\n\n\"We are a compassionate nation and a country of immigrants. But as we know, terrorists are dead set on using our immigration and refugee programs as a Trojan Horse to attack us,\" House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul said in a statement Friday. \"With the stroke of a pen, he is doing more to shut down terrorist pathways into this country than the last administration did in eight years.\"\n\nIt is unclear how many people would be immediately impacted by the nonrefugee travel ban. According to the statistics maintained by the Homeland Security Department, about 17,000 students from the seven designated countries were allowed into the U.S. for the 2015-16 school year. In 2015 more than 86,000 people from those countries arrived in the U.S. on other, non-immigrant visas and more than 52,000 others became legal permanent residents.\n\nLast year, the U.S. resettled 85,000 people displaced by war, political oppression, hunger and religious prejudice, including more than 12,000 Syrians. Before leaving office, President Barack Obama announced that the U.S. would accept 110,000 refugees in the coming year, but Trump's order cut that by more than half to 50,000.\n\nNo refugees were in the air when the travel ban was signed Friday, but about 350 people were in transit in Nairobi, Kenya, and were now stuck there, said Melanie Nezer, vice president of policy and advocacy for HIAS, a refugee resettlement aid agency. She said several hundred more people who were booked on U.S.-bound flights in the next week were now stranded around the globe.\n\n\"This in effect could be a permanent ban,\" she said. \"Many of these people may never be able to come.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"ALICIA A.

Horror? Yes. Shock? No. In fact, sadly, \"situation normal\". \n \nCanberra's residential rental market problems are chronic. They are not a temporary phenomenon. And they mostly affect the poor. That's because the most acute shortages are at the bottom end of the market. Our comparatively high median rents are a reflection of not just high average incomes but also the inadequate stock of cheaper housing. \n \nPublic housing initiatives can help but are expensive and have not filled the gap left by a lack of private investment. \n \nThe ACT government could improve matters by releasing more land and by re-jigging its land tax scales to encourage more private investment in low cost housing. State Governments have generally avoided directly taxing lower cost rental accommodation. The ACT Government has not. If anything, it's done the very opposite. \n \nOur land tax scales encourage investors to put their money into something other than affordable housing. And that \"something else\" can include higher-end, more tax-effective properties. That's one reason why Canberra has an inadequate housing stock and why there's nowhere near enough housing to provide for those who need it most. \n \nBob Bennett, Wanniassa \n \nFencing off rights \n \nThe architectural detail of the proposed fence to prevent public access to the Parliament House bifurcated grassed roof is not the issue (\"Architects back down over Parliament fence\", Jan. 26, p. 11). Transcending that are the underlying semiotics of the original design, which the people have embraced and made their own. Ways of making the building secure must be found that do not take away that moral right of the people. \n \nJack Kershaw, Kambah \n \nSolar benefits limited \n \nPeter Hannam (\"Soaring power bills driving move to solar\", January 24, p.5) suggests soaring electricity prices are prompting more people to consider adding PV solar and batteries. \n \nMaybe the mathematically challenged might. \n \nIt would take about 30 or 60 years to break even (there are a lot of unknowns and variables). The batteries are likely to last around eight years depending on quality and cycling and the inverter for the PV Solar is likely to need replacement about the same time. \n \nPV Solar degrades with time, its output decreases due to circuit problems, etc, and may have to be replaced or just discarded earlier than planned. \n \nMost people forget that they require frequent cleaning for maintaining full output. They are awkwardly placed for cleaning. \n \nSuch systems are for feel-good value, one-upsmanship on the neighbours, bragging ability but certainly not for economic benefit. \n \nJohn McKerral, Batemans Bay \n \nOlder revolutionaries \n \nI read on these pages that most of the letter writers are old folk. \n \nPossibly because retirees have the time to spare or, maybe, just nothing better to do. \n \nIt may be because, after over half a century, they've developed some strong beliefs. \n \nIt may also be because in their twilight years they don't care any more if they're vilified and castigated, mocked, derided, spat upon, or hassled by local traders. \n \nThey don't need to keep their heads down and compete for a job. Few with a baby in their arms are likely to lead a revolution. Possibly the Nobel poet laureate can come back and recite, with guitar accompaniment: \n \n\"Come young men and women/ Throughout the land \n \nAnd don't criticise/ What you cannot embrace \n \nYour dads and your mothers/Are beyond your young cares \n \nYour young fears do not affect them/ Please get out of the way if you're frightened to help \n \nFor they fear not the costs of resistance. \n \nGary J. Wilson, Macgregor \n \nTop TPP explanation \n \nÇongratulations to Patricia Ranald (\"Time for progressive trade action\", January 25, p.19), a clear explanation of what is wrong with the TPP and a policy outline for the Government and the Opposition to take forward that will benefit all Australians and the peoples of our trading partners. \n \nDavid Groube, Guerilla Bay, NSW \n \nTrump's 'America first' stand could be something to fear \n \nIt is most doubtful that Donald Trump knows or understands much history, but surely his speech writers do. Trump's repeated use of the phrase \"American first\" channelled unsavoury and shameful echoes from the 1930s. The America Firsters, whose figurehead was the aviation hero Charles Lindbergh, were a mixed lot that included genuine old-school pacifists as well as crypto-fascist admirers of Nazism like Lindbergh himself. \n \nPart of the movement was strongly anti-Semitic and generally intolerant of non-Christian \"foreigners\". America Firsters believed that America could turn its back on the world and live in splendid isolation, protected by distance and two oceans. This idea was shown to be dangerously deluded when World War II began. In today's interconnected world, the idea of isolationism is absurd and even more dangerous. We now live in an age of intercontinental ballistic missiles and international inter-dependence that makes such a concept ridiculous. \n \nThe thought the US now has a president who aspires to isolationism and appeasement of Russian aggression is cause for great concern, if not alarm. \n \nSteve Ellis, Hackett \n \nBillionaire Kelcy Warren (\"Oil industry eyes big gains from Trump\", January 26, p24) says, \"My God, this is going to be refreshing\" in relation to Trump's decision to revisit the Texas oilman's stalled Dakota pipeline project. \n \nAnother \"alternative fact\" I think. Mr Warren surely means \"rewarding\" \u2013 for him at least. \n \nEric Hunter, Cook \n \nThe first week of the Trump administration suggests that political satirists should seek another line of work for the next four years. \n \nThe week started with the White House Press Secretary channelling Groucho Marx in suggesting that reporters should believe him rather than the evidence of their own eyes. \n \nThis was followed by a senior administration adviser suggesting without any apparent moral concern that falsehoods could be redescribed as \"alternative facts\". \n \nNow the President has signed a proclamation declaring January 20, 2017, as a \"National Day of Patriotic Devotion\". \n \nThe President, consciously or not, seems to have channelled the North Korean leader Kim Jon-un, who has used this phrase frequently. \n \nI have to commend Paul McGeough for his measured attempt to provide an informed and balanced assessment of US politics and government. \n \nDoug Hynd, Stirling \n \nFormer Australian ambassador to the US, Michael Thawley, advises unhappy opponents of Donald Trump to take a Bex and have a good lie down. In the interests of his health, distraught Washington correspondent Paul McGeough would be well advised to heed this advice. \n \nH. Ronald, Jerrabomberra, NSW \n \nFull marks to Paul McGeough for his article (\"Trump declares he's smart\", January 23, p.6). \n \nHe clearly exposed Trump's mendacity, racist attitudes, misogyny, duplicity and other vices. \n \nOne can only wonder at the mentality of the voters who ignored these shortcomings and voted for such an individual. \n \nSimilarly one can only condemn potential voters who failed to vote in anticipation of an inevitable Clinton victory. \n \nThey effectively handed the Presidency to Trump, supposedly aided as he was by Russian interference in the election. \n \nTrump talks about serving an eight year term. I predict he will only last a year or so as dissident Republicans, angered by Trump's departure from the party's core conservative values will surely side with the Democrats to impeach him. \n \nA. Biela, Gordon \n \nStar Bucks trashed, litter bins set on fire, Trump supporters assaulted, a limo torched and Madonna threatens to blow up the White House. Just another day in the peaceful Democrat protests. Sorry Paul McElligott (letters, January 26), your dummy spitting mates are dime a dozen losers. \n \nMark Sproat, Lyons \n \nYour Wilcox cartoon (Comment, January 23, p.13) nails it. A small book, On Bullshit, originally published in 1986 by Professor Harry Frankfurt of Princeton University, is becoming required reading in the United States. \n \nAccording to Professor Frankfurt, the bullshit artist \"does not care whether the things he says describe reality correctly. He just picks them out, or makes them up, to suit his purpose\". \n \nConsidering the then candidate Trump in May last year, Professor Frankfurt said: \"It is disturbing to find an important political figure who indulges freely both in lies and in bullshit\". \n \nBullshit is not the same as lying. Liars have to know what the truth is so they can depart from it. Bullshitters have no such constraint. \n \nDavid Stephens, Bruce \n \nYes, it is true. Mr Trump is well on his way to making America grate or great? If so, he might do well to remember the only war his great America won by itself was its Civil War. And what is so great about a nation that elects a blustering bully whose business acumen has been sustained on corporate insolvencies and fire sales in which other people have borne the suffering and the little people are to be denied basic health care and education. But then sometimes democracy speaks with a forked tongue \u2013 just see our own leaders! \n \nJames Grenfell, Spence \n \nMyGov brings shame \n \nHaving moved house I tried to log onto MyGov to change address details for Medicare etc. Part of the logon is to create an account. This involved MyGov sending me a logon code. \n \nWell after two attempts and four days I am still waiting for the code. \n \nAs someone with 30 plus years in the IT industry it is obvious that the site applications are poor and that it has woefully inadequate infrastructure. \n \nThe Prime Minister continually talks about innovation and smart working and yet his Government presents us with this rubbish. He should be ashamed. \n \nJim Willis, Mollymook, NSW \n TO THE POINT  \nBILLBOARD THREAT \n \nSo sad Andrew Barr, taxing air space and endangering Canberra's beautiful billboard-free environment. As Ogden Nash wrote, \"I think that I shall never see a billboard lovely as a tree. Perhaps, unless the billboards fall, I'll never see a tree at all\". \n \nRoz Lambert, Belconnen \n \nPlease Canberra, remember that you will be entrusted as the capital city of the Republic of Australia. The nation expects that at least one city should maintain some standard of visual literacy \u2014 so no advertising billboards. \n \nRonald Elliott, Sandringham, Vic \n \nNILE TRUMPED \n \nSo, NSW Christian Democrat Party MLC Fred Nile was denied entry to the United States after offering advice to President Trump (\"Fred Nile denied visa for Donald Trump inauguration, deemed a 'security threat',\" Canberratimes.com.au, January 25). Trumped by a bigger bigot. \n \nJohn Richardson, Wallagoot, NSW \n \nREPLACE TOP COP \n \nCan't Victorian Police Commissioner Graham Ashton be replaced by someone with a bit of empathy and common sense?

Cooke, (letters, January 26), you must be a very special customer if you received your Medicare refund in two weeks. My husband and I waited over six weeks for our refunds. All in the name of progress, I don't think so. \n \nPauline Vincent, Wanniassa \n \nUNITED IRELAND \n \nThe UK Supreme Court has ruled Brexit must be approved by the English Parliament but not Northern Ireland's Assembly.

Even though spoilers have not been as plentiful as in the past, there is some new information that is being released. Recently, Norman Reedus teased that fans might see Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) show a little fear. The actor also hinted that Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln), Daryl Dixon, and the other Alexandrians will work to bring Negan down a notch. \n \nTWD spoilers are ahead. Do not continue reading unless you want to know what to expect when the show returns to AMC. \n Norman Reedus on Rick Grimes, Daryl Dixon, and Negan in \u2018The Walking Dead\u2019 [Image by Gene Page/AMC]  \nFor a long time, fans were wondering when Negan would make his introduction on The Walking Dead . He is a huge character in Robert Kirkman\u2019s comic books and as one fan explained in a Google Plus community, Negan would make the Governor look like Prince Charming. The day of Negan\u2019s big arrival finally came, which was on the Season 6 finale of TWD . Months later, when Season 7 premiered, viewers finally found out who Negan killed: Abraham Ford (Michael Cudlitz) and Glenn Rhee (Steven Yeun). \n \nThe first half of Season 7 had Rick so traumatized by Negan\u2019s brutality and twisted mind games that he tried to be a loyal servant. He went to great lengths to scavenge for Negan and the Saviors, even putting his own life in danger. However, during the midseason finale of The Walking Dead , Rick Grimes finally realized that Alexandria could no longer live under Negan\u2019s thumb. \n \nFans are wondering what is going to happen in the second half of Season 7 as Alexandria plans to take down Negan. In a promo clip, Rick Grimes and Daryl Dixon realize that they need more people on their side. They will work to recruit other communities, such as Hilltop Colony and The Kingdom. The battle will definitely be a bloodbath and many lives will be lost. It is only reasonable to assume that a few fan favorite characters on The Walking Dead may die during the war. \n  \n Read this: #TWD is back on February 12. \n \nA photo posted by The Walking Dead (@amcthewalkingdead) on Jan 22, 2017 at 2:42pm PST \n  \nRecently, Norman Reedus spoke to Entertainment Weekly about The Walking Dead  Season 7 and what fans can expect. He teased that viewers may see some fear in Negan\u2019s eyes. He knows that Rick, Daryl, and the others are not the typical survivors. However, the villain may have underestimated Alexandria, just like Rick underestimated Negan. Reedus also hinted that Negan may be brought down from his apocalyptic pedestal. \n \n\u201cI think you\u2019re going to start to see a little fear in that bad guy\u2019s eyes. He\u2019s been walking tall long enough wielding his little toy bat around. Time to bring that guy down a notch.\u201d \n \nEarlier this season, Michonne (Danai Gurira) discovered just how many of the Saviors there are. They just aren\u2019t located at the Sanctuary either. Negan\u2019s men probably are in the hundreds and are everywhere. This is one reason why Rick and his group need more people willing to fight. Even though he will go to Ezekiel (Khary Payton) and Gregory (Xander Berkeley), there will also be other communities seen when TWD returns. \n \nIt isn\u2019t clear just how many communities will join Rick\u2019s cause, but Oceanside might be one of them. As fans recall, they told Tara (Alanna Masterson) about how the Saviors killed all the men and boys in their group. It forced them to abandon their post-apocalyptic home and create a new community. It is the reason they live in seclusion and why they are so paranoid when someone new sneaks in. It was confirmed that Oceanside has \u201cunfinished business\u201d and will be seen in the second half of Season 7. \n  \n Daryl is ready to fight back. Join him on February 12. #TWD \n \nA photo posted by The Walking Dead (@amcthewalkingdead) on Jan 17, 2017 at 6:01pm PST \n  \nAnother new community to expect in The Walking Dead doesn\u2019t exactly have a name, but they seem to live in a junkyard. One sneak peek photo from EW shows Rick speaking with a mystery woman while others watch. What is interesting is that Grimes doesn\u2019t have his gun on him. The woman Rick is talking to has her back to the camera, so it is unclear what she might be thinking. However, the people in the background seem to be listening carefully, thinking hard, and don\u2019t appear to be angry. Their arms are down and resting at their sides, so they aren\u2019t preparing to attack Rick. Perhaps he encounters this new group and is asking for help defeating Negan? They seem to be quite creative by using the junkyard to their advantage, so they could be a valuable ally. \n \nWhat do you think of what Norman Reedus had to say about Negan? Do you expect the TWD villain to show a little fear in the second half of Season 7? How will Oceanside and the junkyard factor in with the current storyline when The Walking Dead returns on February 12? \n \n[Featured Image by Gene Page/AMC] is an article from: The Inquisitr News","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Taylor Rios"},"topics":[],"title":"\u2018The Walking Dead\u2019: Norman Reedus Teases A Fearful Negan?

The smugglers wanted thousands of dollars in ransom from the migrants, and they used him as an example of what would happen if they didn't pay.\n\nEach day for a month, they inflicted new tortures on him, Omar Farrag told The Associated Press. They put him in a tank of water and lit a fire underneath it. They wrapped his limbs with tight barbed wire. At times, they heated the barbed wire.\n\nFinally, his younger brother came from Ethiopia with $2,000 in ransom money. The smugglers decided they could squeeze more money out of him too, so they tortured his brother and ended up killing him, Farrag said.\n\nNow in the southern Yemeni city of Aden, the 26-year-old is overcome with guilt over his brother's death. \"I got my brother killed; I am a disgrace. But it's impossible to imagine what I went through,\" Farrag said. \"I don't even know where they buried him.\"\n\nMigrants from the Horn of Africa are flowing into Yemen at ever growing rates despite the nearly 2-year-old civil war that has thrown the country into its own humanitarian crisis of hunger and displacement. The migrants -- many, like Farrag, fleeing drought or poverty back home -- are hoping to cross Yemen and reach neighboring oil-rich Saudi Arabia.\n\nMore than 111,500 migrants landed on Yemen's shores last year, up from around 100,000 the year before, according to the Regional Mixed Migration Secretariat, a grouping of international agencies that monitors migration in the area.\n\nThe chaos caused by the civil war has raised migrants' hopes that they can slip through to Saudi Arabia, with no central authority keeping watch. However, the turmoil has also left migrants vulnerable to abuse and cruelty at the hands of the armed trafficking rings, many believed connected to and acting with protection from the multiple militias involved in the war.\n\nAfter taking migrants' money as payment to transport them, the traffickers often demand more, sometimes even phoning their families in Ethiopia so they can hear the torment their loved ones are subjected to. Rape is so widespread that women carry contraception for fear of becoming pregnant.\n\n\"Migrants don't know they will have to pay twice: Once when they take the boat to cross the sea and a second time upon arrival,\" said Laurent De Boeck, head of Yemeni operations of the International Organization for Migration, or IOM. \"So when they don't pay, this is when the phase of abuses begins. They face torture, burns and rape.\"\n\nThe fate of migrants in Yemen remains a black hole. It is not known how many become trapped and abused, but officials from the IOM and other U.N. agencies believe it is widespread.\n\nIt is not even known how many eventually make it to Saudi Arabia, as the kingdom does not release figures.\n\nAuthorities in southern Yemen have carried out forced deportations of migrants at least seven times, IOM officials said. In December, at least 25 drowned when they were forced onto boats to leave Aden.\n\nThe migrants were rounded up, packed onto small boats -- as many as 150 to a vessel -- and forced out to sea, according to Yemeni security officials in Aden. \"They were led like animals with nothing with them but water,\" said one senior officer, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the press.\n\nOver 90 percent of the migrants belong to the Oromo community, Ethiopia's largest ethnic group, whose members often complain of discrimination at the hands of the Ethiopian government. Most are aged 25 and younger -- some as young as 11, said Esam al-Makhzomi an IOM official in Aden. According to IOM figures, around 20 percent of the migrants are unaccompanied minors.\n\n\"There was an impression that the numbers are going down but in fact ... the numbers are huge and they continue to grow,\" he said.\n\nHe described trafficking as \"an organized criminal ring. ... Nothing is random here.\" He said torture is rampant, aiming at scaring migrants and forcing them to pay more money. He said some local security and government officials provide cover for the traffickers.\n\n\"There is torture, rape, and we have seen severe cases of abuse where the migrants lose their lives,\" al-Makhzomi said.\n\nNearly 30 percent of the migrants who have sought IOM help to return home said they had been approached by one of the warring parties in Yemen -- or by militant groups like al-Qaida and the Islamic State group -- trying to recruit them as fighters, de Boeck said. An estimated 9,000 migrants are being held in prisons, whether by the rebels or by opposing factions.\n\nFrom Ethiopia, migrants take one of two routes, through Djbouti or the Puntland region of Somalia -- often walking for days to reach the ports there.\n\nThose leaving from Somalia cross the Gulf of Aden to land in Shabwa province on Yemen's southern coast, an area controlled by factions backing the internationally recognized government, but where factions linked to al-Qaida also are active.\n\nThose leaving from Djibouti take boats across the Bab al-Mandab -- Arabic for \"the gates of grief\" -- the straits at the mouth of the Red Sea. They land on Yemen's eastern coast in areas mostly under the control of the Houthi rebels.\n\nThe migrants then often go by foot across Yemen toward the Saudi border. But since much of the area around the border is a battle zone, chances are slim of actually making it into Saudi Arabia, al-Makhzomi said\n\nThe exception may be female migrants, who are in demand as domestic workers in Saudi Arabia. There is a \"more sophisticated smuggling mechanism for women,\" said Lalini Veerassamy, an IOM official in Djibouti.\n\nDe Boeck, the IOM chief in Sanaa, said that trafficking in human organs is also on the rise.\n\n\"The trafficking of people for organs ... seems to be more widespread, related to the fact that there is a collapse of the state and no capacity to have the rule of law applied,\" he said.\n\nFarrag, the coffee farmer, bears marks of torture at the hands of the smugglers. His arms are covered with burns and scars and he has a deep scar under one eye. One of his toes is missing.\n\n\"Now, if I see a migrant with a scar, I can tell how he sustained it. I have tasted all sorts of torture,\" he said, looking around nervously as he spoke.\n\nHe refused to be photographed or filmed, saying he didn't want his family to find out he was alive. After being held by the smugglers for around a month, he was freed after his brother's death, he said. Now he works repairing shoes from a blanket spread on the side of a road in Aden's Koud al-Nimr district.\n\nHe said he landed in Shabwa last May with a boatload of fellow migrants. The smugglers immediately took them in trucks to a building surrounded by high walls. Inside, there were many rooms, all sealed off and dark.\n\nThe traffickers asked each migrant for $2,000, and the abuses started.\n\n\"From maybe 100 migrants, they pick five to torture badly so everybody succumbs,\" he said. Occasionally gunshots rang out and the smugglers would tell him they shot a migrant trying to escape. He said he saw women screaming as they were forced into rooms where he suspected they were raped.\n\nDespite all the suffering, Farrag hasn't given up.\n\n\"I am saving money to go to Saudi Arabia,\" he said.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"MAAD AL-ZIKRYand MAGGIE MICHAEL The"},"topics":[{"name":"Saudi Arabia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Ethiopia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Yemen news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Amid Yemen's chaos, migrants face torment","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Daviess","zipCode":"42301","state":"Kentucky","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Owensboro","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Kentucky Messenger Inquirer","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169697828","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"610"},"name":"Kentucky Messenger Inquirer","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.messenger-inquirer.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695193993331","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:12:30Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/messenger-inquirer.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/5/12/51274b77-6711-5bcf-86c6-94c56665f083/588d6c8428af8.image.jpg?resize=300%2C189"},{"url":"http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/messenger-inquirer.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/5/12/51274b77-6711-5bcf-86c6-94c56665f083/588d6c8428af8.image.jpg?resize=1000%2C630"}],"video":[]}}

He spends it reading and charming the people who filter in for chitchat or new soles. A crooked mishmash of framed pictures of Abraham Lincoln, Bill Clinton and our own Rep. Rick Larsen stare across the room at a wall festooned with shoelaces and polishes.\n\nThe tools of the trade stood at the ready behind the counter.\n\nPapadimitriou showed me around. He put a finger on a switch of an ancient contraption that trims, burnishes, polishes, sands and grinds.\n\n\"Stand back,\" he instructed.\n\nThe man and the machine came to life with a burst of noise and dust. It was like being at ground zero of a rocket launch.\n\nHigh heels. Holsters. Handbags. Belts. It's all done the old-fashioned way.\n\nNot all shoes rate his time and affection.\n\nIn the first 30 minutes I was at his shop, a man stepped in hoping to find redemption for his beloved work boots that were splitting at the seams. Papadimitriou said it would be cheaper for him to buy a new pair and sent him on his way.\n\nA woman called from Kenmore asking his hours. \"Monday through Friday, 10 to 5:30,\" he said, holding a phone tethered by a long coiled cord.\n\nShe wasn't sure she could make it by closing. He told her he would come to the store on a Saturday morning to meet her.\n\nHe's that kind of guy.\n\nThe next two times I went to his shop he turned away more work than he accepted, often expressing disapproval even before reading the label where the shoe was made. The massive import of cheap shoes gets his goat.\n\n\"No good. These are plastic. Nothing you can do about it,\" he told several customers. He has resurrected many pairs from near-death, but he knows when a shoe is DOA.\n\nSome owners refuse to give up.\n\nWhen he told Colleen Stillabower it would be $45 to replace the broken plastic zipper on one boot, she unflinchingly told him to do it.\n\n\"Forty-five dollars,\" he repeated.\n\n\"That would be fine,\" she said.\n\n\"Oh, boy,\" he said.\n\nShe asked him to replace the zippers on both boots. He said he'd give her a discount.\n\nIt was the Lake Stevens woman's first time to the shop. \"I found him on the internet,\" she said. \"I asked for the best shoemaker in Everett and his shop was the first one to pop up. Said he'd been here forever.\"\n\nPeople's has been in business in Everett since 1934. It was started by Papadimitriou's uncle, who sponsored his move here in 1967 from Greece, where he'd repaired and crafted shoes.\n\n\"I worked in 1967-68 in Seattle, before you were born,\" Papadimitriou told me, winking. Told you he was a flirt. \"At that time I made $2.45 an hour. I had a skill.\"\n\nHe bought People's from his uncle in 1968. He later moved the shop from Rockefeller Avenue to 2827 Wetmore Ave.\n\nPapadimitriou used to do more than mend rips and save soles. He also made orthopedic adjustments. \"If you have a pigeon toe, we put this wedge in here and make it straight,\" he said in his Greek-English syntax.\n\nHis wife, Dona, died in 2013. She didn't work in the shop with him. Not a good idea for husbands and wives to work together, he said.\n\nHis daughter, Nikki, and grandkids recently moved from Everett to North Carolina. Papadimitriou is all alone now in the town that has been his home for 50 years and the house where he's lived almost as long.\n\nLoneliness isn't what bothers him. These three words make him cringe: \"Made in China.\"\n\nSure enough, that's what it said inside my shoes, and a number of the dozens of pairs of shoes scattered, stacked and strewn about.\n\nDon't believe the sign that says \"Not responsible for shoes left more than 30 days.\"\n\nHe's had some for two years. Every pair of shoes gets a handwritten ticket. That's Exhibit A.\n\nHe took me on a tour of The Shoes Left Behind.\n\n\"What size do you wear?\" he asked, holding up a large pair of red leather kick-ass cowboy boots.\n\nI figured he could have sized up my feet in one glance, and I told him so. Really, can't he spot a size 6.5 from across the room?\n\nHe shrugged and went back to offering me more shoes that people didn't pick up.\n\nI changed the subject to purses. \"I bring out for you,\" he said, then disappeared in a back room only to appear with a bevy of handbags.\n\nWhy don't people pick up their things?\n\n\"Long stories,\" he said.\n\nHe donates many unwanted items to the thrift shop run by Domestic Violence Services of Snohomish County. \"I give it to them so they can sell and make money for women,\" he said.\n\nI admired the flashy leopard shoes with 6-inch platform heels that were on a shelf above the can of salmon that someone gave him for Christmas.\n\nThe average person has about 20 pairs of shoes. Papadimitriou owns six pairs, including the ones on his feet and a twin pair he keeps under his desk. That's it.\n\n\"I hear many women say, 'Oh, I love my shoes,'\" he said. \"I love people. I don't love shoes.\"\n\nWhat he cares about is making his work shine and fit like a glove.\n\n\"He stretched loafers for me that were too tight,\" said Gerry Provencher, who lives nearby and likes to stop by to shoot the breeze. \"He's an artist in his approach because he wants to take something that somebody cares about and is not of any use to them and bring it back to life. He takes the time and effort that an artist would take.\"\n\nPapadimitriou keeps things simple. Cash and checks only. \"I don't ask for ID,\" he said. He's had only three bad checks in almost 50 years.\n\n\"I have good customers,\" he said.\n\nHe has outlived many of them.\n\nIs the shop for sale?\n\nYep. Everything in it. Even him.\n\nIf you think you get to sit around all day and read and listen to music, think again.\n\nHe tells about the only person so far who expressed an interest.\n\n\"A man came from Whidbey Island and asked me to train him,\" he said. \"He said, 'How long did it take you to learn this business?' Stupid question. I say, 'I learn every day. You stop to learn when you be dead.' I never see him again.\"\n\nStop by his shop. You might prance out of there in red leather boots \u2014 and a Greek cobbler on your arm.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"ANDREA BROWNThe Herald"},"topics":[{"name":"Greece news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"The charming Greek cobbler of People's Shoe Repair","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Thurston","zipCode":"98506","state":"Washington","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Olympia","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"The Olympian","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169658445","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"962"},"name":"The Olympian","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Business"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.theolympian.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://www.theolympian.com/news/state/washington/article129443839.html","https://twitter.com/share?text=The%20charming%20Greek%20cobbler%20of%20People's%20Shoe%20Repair&url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.theolympian.com%2fnews%2fstate%2fwashington%2farticle129443839.html","http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.theolympian.com%2fnews%2fstate%2fwashington%2farticle129443839.html&title=The+charming+Greek+cobbler+of+People's+Shoe+Repair","https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.theolympian.com%2fnews%2fstate%2fwashington%2farticle129443839.html","http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.theolympian.com%2fnews%2fstate%2fwashington%2farticle129443839.html&description=The+charming+Greek+cobbler+of+People's+Shoe+Repair&media=http%3a%2f%2fwww.theolympian.com%2fstatic%2fimages%2f","http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http://www.theolympian.com/news/state/washington/article129443839.html","http://www.mcclatchyreprints.com/","http://bit.ly/2jSDHMm"],"sequenceId":"695193993763","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:06:04Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:12:30Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.theolympian.com/static/images/theolympian/facebook.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Tyson told The Associated Press on Saturday that Carolyn Donham broke her long public silence in an interview with him in 2008. His book, \"The Blood of Emmett Till,\" comes out next week.\n\n\"She told me that 'Nothing that boy did could ever justify what happened to him,' \" said Tyson, a Duke University research scholar whose previous books include \"Blood Done Sign My Name\" and \"Radio Free Dixie.\"\n\nEmmett Till was a 14-year-old black tortured and killed in 1955 in Mississippi after allegedly whistling at a white woman, then known as Carolyn Bryant.\n\nHis murder became national news, was a galvanizing event in the civil rights movement and has been the subject of numerous books and movies. During the trial, Bryant said that he had grabbed her, and, in profane terms, bragged about his history with white woman. The jury was not present when she testified.\n\nDonham's then-husband, Roy Bryant, and his half brother, J.W. Milam, were acquitted by the all-white jury. Both men, who later told Look magazine they did murder Till, have since died. Milam's widow, Juanita Milam, would later tell the FBI she believed that Carolyn Bryant had fabricated her story. Juanita Milam died in 2014. The Justice Department re-examined the case a decade ago, but no one was indicted as a murderer or an accomplice.\n\nTyson said that he spoke with Donham after her daughter-in-law, Marsha Bryant, contacted him. Bryant had read \"Blood Done Sign My Name,\" about a racist murder during his childhood in Oxford, North Carolina, and invited Tyson to meet with her and Donham.\n\nTyson said he and Donham had two conversations that both lasted two to three hours and that he planned at the time to place the material in the archives at the University of North Carolina. Asked why he waited so long to publicize his findings, he responded that historians think in different terms than do journalists.\n\n\"I'm more interested in what speaks to the ages than in what is the latest media thing,\" he said.\n\nHe added that he wasn't sure whether Donham knew about the book. He said he had fallen out of touch with the family and that when he last spoke with Bryant, a few years ago, she said Donham was in poor health.\n\nTill was a fun-loving teenager from Chicago visiting the Mississippi Delta and helping out on his great-uncle Mose Wright's farm. On Aug. 24, 1955, Till and some other kids drove to a local store, Bryant's, for refreshments. At Bryant's, some of the kids stayed on the porch, watching a game of checkers, while the others filed inside to buy bubble gum and sodas. Carolyn Bryant, the 21-year-old wife of proprietor Roy Bryant, was behind the counter.\n\nAccounts of what happened next differ.\n\nMrs. Bryant claimed Emmett bragged about dating white women up north. She said he grabbed her and asked her, \"How about a date, baby?\" Simeon Wright, his cousin, heard none of this. But there is no doubt about what he heard when they left the store, he told the AP in 2005.\n\nStanding on the front porch, Emmett let out a wolf whistle.\n\nCarolyn Donham's whereabouts have long been a mystery, but North Carolina voter rolls list a Carolyn Holloway Donham. Holloway is her maiden name.\n\nThe address is for a green, split-level home in Raleigh at the mouth of a neat cul-de-sac just two turns off a busy four-lane thoroughfare.

Tattoos, turbans and beards are in.\n\nPolice departments, compelled by a hiring crisis and eager for a more diverse applicant pool, are relaxing traditional grooming standards and getting away from rules that used to require a uniformly clean-shaven, 1950s look.\n\nMore officers are on the job with tattoos inked on their forearms, beards on their chins or religious head coverings like hijabs and turbans in place of -- or tucked beneath -- their blue caps.\n\n\"My turban is a part of me,\" said Mandeep Singh, among 160 Sikhs in the New York City Police Department who last month were allowed to wear navy blue turbans in place of the standard-issue police caps. \"This opens a gate for other potential candidates who felt they could not be a police officer because they would have to choose either the job or their faith.\"\n\nThat followed a 2014 move by the St. Paul, Minnesota, police to create a special hijab for its first female Somali Muslim officer.\n\nMuslim NYPD officer Masood Syed, who grows a beard for religious reasons, was suspended for its length and sued his department last year over a rule requiring beards to be trimmed to within a millimeter of the skin. As a result, the department changed the length to a half-inch and reinstated him. Syed's suit is still pending, though, because he said the length is arbitrary and it should be case by case, depending on the officer's needs.\n\n\"It's 2017,\" Syed said. \"The police department is supposed to reflect the community that it's policing.\"\n\nMany departments say it's tougher to attract candidates to a physically demanding job that offers low pay and is under increasingly intense public scrutiny. That has led many to make a nod to shifting fashion trends, particularly among millennials, and ease longstanding bans on beards and visible tattoos.\n\nNew Orleans; Portland, Oregon; Austin, Texas; and Pinellas Park, Florida, are among the departments that look the other way if a recruit comes in with visible tattoos.\n\n\"Modern practice is colliding with dress codes,\" said Will Aitchison, an attorney who represents police unions during labor-related disputes. \"And what police departments really should be focused on is how the officer performs his or her job, as opposed to how they look.\"\n\nIn Kansas, state police did a public survey on whether officers should be allowed to have tattoos to help determine whether to change their policy after they couldn't fill about 100 trooper jobs.\n\nHalf of the nearly 20,000 respondents had tattoos themselves. Sixty-nine percent said the department shouldn't have a policy prohibiting visible tattoos.\n\n\"We were surprised by the response,\" said Lt. Adam Winters. \"It just doesn't seem to bother people.\"\n\nStill, the department's prohibition on visible tattoos has stayed in place, in part because of the potential challenge of regulating the content of tattoos that might be offensive.\n\nIn Philadelphia, the department is considering tightening its policy after photos surfaced last fall of an officer in uniform with a tattoo on his forearm showing a Nazi symbol: a spread-winged eagle under the word \"Fatherland.\"\n\nIn Chicago, a federal judge threw out a lawsuit filed by tattooed officers -- all military veterans -- who objected to a new requirement that they wear long sleeves to cover up their inked arms during a sweltering Midwestern summer. The judge argued it would be too difficult for departments to determine what would be considered offensive and need to be covered.\n\nBut, the police brass recently started allowing them again -- they said as a morale booster for a beleaguered force.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"COLLEEN LONG The"},"topics":[{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Fashion police stepping back","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Daviess","zipCode":"42301","state":"Kentucky","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Owensboro","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Kentucky Messenger Inquirer","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169697828","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"610"},"name":"Kentucky Messenger Inquirer","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.messenger-inquirer.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194002550","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:12:29Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/messenger-inquirer.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/c3/3c3ef7ea-cf11-54cb-bdef-3234f6f0b605/588d6c825acb4.image.jpg?resize=300%2C227"},{"url":"http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/messenger-inquirer.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/c3/3c3ef7ea-cf11-54cb-bdef-3234f6f0b605/588d6c825acb4.image.jpg?resize=832%2C630"}],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport, their lawyers and two U.S. representatives accompanying them tried to cross into a secure area - and were stopped themselves. \n \n\"Step back! Step back!\" the agents shouted at them. \n \nA few minutes later, Heidi Nassauer, chief of passenger operations for U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) at the airport, was called over. \n \nRepresentatives Jerrold Nadler and Nydia Velazquez, both Democrats from New York, wanted clarification on whether an immigration ban issued on Friday by President Donald Trump prevented the Iraqis from consulting with attorneys. \n \nNassauer had no clear answer. \n \n\"We are as much in the dark as everybody else,\" said the border protection official at one of the largest U.S. airports. \n \nThe tense exchange, witnessed by Reuters, was representative of the confusion at airports across the United States and others overseas after Trump abruptly halted immigration from seven majority-Muslim countries and temporarily put a stop to the entry of refugees. \n \nThroughout much of Saturday, government officials and security workers were left to guess who from those countries could enter the United States legally and who could not. \n \nThe day ended with a federal judge issuing an emergency stay that temporarily allowed stranded travelers with valid visas to remain in the United States. The American Civil Liberties Union, which sought the stay, said it would help 100 to 200 people with visas or refugee status who found themselves detained in transit or at U.S. airports. \n \nRECKLESS \n \nEarlier on Saturday, the Trump administration said it would have been \"reckless\" to brief government agencies and airports more broadly in advance of launching the security measures, which it says are aimed at preventing attacks from foreign groups. \n \nBut career officials in the Homeland Security and State departments told Reuters the administration failed to appreciate the complexity of enforcing the order consistently or the need to prepare agencies and airlines. \n \nAffected travelers had varying experiences at different airports, according to nearly 200 accounts gathered by the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA). \n \nMany holding visas told the association they were allowed into the country without a problem despite Trump's executive order banning them. \n \nBut some lawful permanent residents \u2013 those with so-called green cards \u2013 were turned away despite guidance to airlines from the CBP that they should be allowed to travel. \n \nAt about 10 p.m. on Friday in Seattle, some eight hours after Trump signed the executive order, an Iranian with dual Canadian citizenship from Vancouver was sent back to Canada, the traveler reported to AILA. A half hour later in New York City, an Iranian arrived at JFK and entered the United States on a valid visa without any problems, according to AILA. \n \nA senior administration official said Trump's order - aimed at citizens of Iran, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen - needed to be implemented urgently to protect Americans. \n \n\"There's a very strong nexus between our immigration and visa programs and terrorist plots and extremist networks inside the United States,\" the official told reporters in a briefing. \"It would be reckless and irresponsible to ... broadcast to the entire world the exact security measures you're going to take.\" \n \nKey figures at the Department of Homeland Security were informed, the official said, declining to elaborate. \n \n\"I\u2019m not at liberty to reveal exactly who was briefed and who wasn\u2019t briefed, but everyone that needed to be briefed was briefed,\" the official said. \n \nOUT OF THE LOOP \n \nAt the State Department, one of the main agencies dealing with visas and immigration, most officials first heard of the executive order on immigration through the media, according to two department officials. \n \nWhile some offices were aware an executive order was coming, there was no official communication or consultation from the White House, they said. \n \n\"Was there any inter-agency coordination or consultation? No,\u201d said one senior official, speaking on condition of anonymity. \n \nImmigration enforcement is among the federal government\u2019s most complex endeavors, involving seven agencies from the U.S. Coast Guard and CBP to the State and Justice Departments. \n \nTwo senior officials in the Department of Homeland Security said on Saturday that they had not heard of any officials in the relevant agencies - or the congressional committees and subcommittees that oversee them - who had been consulted by anyone who helped draft the president's order. \n \n\"If the result is confusion and inconsistency, the responsibility all lies at one address,\" said one of the officials, referring to the White House. \n \nThe official, like others, requested anonymity to discuss Trump's order. \n \nAnother Homeland Security official told Reuters that the White House worked on the executive orders with \u201climited department participation.\u201d \n \n\u201cIt has been a challenge but folks are working through it,\" the official said. \n \nCHAOS AT AIRPORTS \n \nOne of the Iraqis detained at JFK was Hameed Khalid Darweesh, a 53-year-old Kurd who had worked as a U.S. Army translator in Iraq and had been threatened there for helping the Americans. \n \nVisas for him and his family were finally issued on Jan. 20, according to a lawsuit filed on behalf of Darweesh and another Iraqi, who had also worked with U.S. military. But as soon as he landed at JFK, he was detained by CBP officers and barred from contacting his attorneys. \n \nWhen his attorneys, from the International Refugee Assistance Project, asked the CBP officers whom they could contact, the agents responded, \u201cMr. President. Call Mr. Trump,\u201d according to the lawsuit. \n \nEventually, Darweesh was allowed to leave and met the lawmakers and his lawyers, clutching his passport and weeping with joy. The other Iraqi who was detained, Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, was also allowed to enter the country. \n \nBut dozens of others were less fortunate. \n \nConflicting media and government reports caused confusion for airlines struggling to deal with the order. \n \nCBP informed air carriers about the executive order in a conference call late on Friday, said a person familiar with the agency's communications. CBP then sent written guidance before noon on Saturday saying that green card holders were \"not included\" in the ban and could continue to travel to the United States. The source said airlines were allowing travelers with green cards on flights until told otherwise. \n \nThe Trump administration official later told reporters that U.S. green card holders traveling outside the United States need to check with a U.S. consulate to see whether they can return. \n \n\"It's being cleared on a case-by-case basis,\u201d the official said. \n \nThe green card issue has left immigration attorneys confused about how to advise their clients. Attorney David Leopold, from Cleveland, Ohio, said he is erring on the side of caution, advising his clients to stay in the United States to avoid being stranded abroad. \n \nThat can create some agonizing dilemmas. \n \n\"A Syrian doctor who has a dying mother in Europe cannot go visit her not knowing that he will be able to get back into the United States,\u201d Leopold said. \n \n(Additional reporting by John Walcott, Jeff Mason, Mica Rosenberg, Lesley Wroughton, Jeffrey Dastin, Yara Bayoumy and Yeganeh Torbati; Writing by Brian Thevenot; Editing by Kieran Murray and Bill Rigby)","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Airline industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"How Trump's abrupt immigration ban sowed confusion at airports, agencies","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Brown","zipCode":"54311","state":"Wisconsin","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Green Bay","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WTAQ News Talk","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"190016701","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"6"},"name":"WTAQ News Talk","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wtaq.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194004669","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:47:13Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:12:31Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Prosecutors allege Berlusconi aimed to \"buy\" the women's silence in various trials involving him.\n\nBerlusconi's lawyers have denied any wronging by their client. One of them, Federico Cecconi, told reporters Berlusconi faces \"the first trial for the crime of generosity.\"\n\nPope writes to stress sovereignty of Knights of Malta\n\nROME -- Pope Francis has reassured the Knights of Malta, an ancient Catholic lay order, about its sovereignty, even as a special papal delegate will work to ensure the \"spiritual renewal\" of its members, after revelations its charity component had distributed condoms.\n\nThe order's Sovereign Council in Rome on Saturday accepted the resignation of Grand Master Fra' Matthew Festing, who had sacked the order's foreign minister, Albrecht von Boeselager. The minister was removed as grand chancellor following revelations that condoms were distributed in Myanmar under his watch.\n\nBut the Vatican intervened on the minister's behalf.\n\nOn Saturday, the council scrapped the disciplinary procedures launched against von Boeselager, who immediately resumed his post, a statement from the Knights of Malta said.\n\nThe Knights say Francis in his letter Friday stressed the order's sovereignty.\n\nThe sovereignty tussle was a touchy matter, since the Vatican is a sovereign entity as is the Knights of Malta order. Each side has diplomatic relations with scores of countries worldwide.\n\nUntil Festing's successor is elected, Fra' Ludwig Hoffmann von Rumerstein serves as its interim leader. Francis in his letter noted that the interim leader \"assumes responsibility over the Order's government, in particular regarding relationships with other States.\"\n\nHeavy snow traps Indian soldiers\n\nSRINAGAR, India -- Five Indian soldiers on patrol were trapped under snow after a snowy track caved in Saturday along the highly militarized Line of Control that divides Kashmir between India and Pakistan.\n\nA rescue operation was started immediately despite hostile weather, Indian army spokesman Col. Rajesh Kalia said. The soldiers were on a routine patrol when the cave-in occurred in the Machil sector of the Himalayan region under India's control.\n\nAuthorities in Indian-controlled Kashmir have issued avalanche warnings for many parts of the region, especially along the de facto frontier.\n\nTwo avalanches on Wednesday buried a military post and swept away a patrol in Gurez, burying 21 soldiers, seven of whom were rescued. The bodies of the 14 others were recovered in two days.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Malta news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Religion news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Pope writes to stress order's sovereignty","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Daviess","zipCode":"42301","state":"Kentucky","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Owensboro","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Kentucky Messenger Inquirer","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169697828","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"610"},"name":"Kentucky Messenger Inquirer","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.messenger-inquirer.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194011752","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:12:29Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/messenger-inquirer.com/content/tncms/custom/image/c52fb608-0a01-11e5-9c50-bbf37a41334d.jpg?_dc=1433343842"}],"video":[]}}

He alleged that the Liberals wanted to wrest police from Mr Grant, a senior Nationals MP.\n\n\"The Nationals wanted police, the right wing faction of the Liberals wanted police,\" he said. \"So she split it in two.\"\n\n\"It's the police who keep us safe from terrorism,\" Mr Foley said.\n\n\"The police commissioner now has to report to two people. It's scandalous and another deal that is counter to the public interest.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the troubled relationship between the NSW attorney-general and minister for police has been addressed, with Ms Berejiklian confirming a reshaping of the much maligned \"justice cluster\".\n\nThe arrangement, whereby as justice and police minister Mr Grant held a more senior position than then attorney-general Gabrielle Upton, was heavily criticised by the legal profession.\n\nThe NSW Bar Association said it provided Mr Grant \"with unprecedented power in determining legal policy without the historical checks and balances\".\n\nThe NSW Law Society warned the arrangement meant police were \"ostensibly responsible for criminal law policy, while at the same time, the traditional roles of the attorney-general as first law officer of the state, which includes preserving civil liberties, are being eroded\".\n\nMs Berejiklian has confirmed the cluster has been reworked so that new attorney-general Mark Speakman, SC, is the lead minister.

Smith is mistrustful of what she calls the mainstream media, particularly those elements she believes are biased towards the left. As Kirralie Smith sits at a sidewalk table in Taree for an interview this week, there is a palpable tension. She is mistrustful of what she calls the mainstream media, particularly those elements she believes are biased towards the left. But Smith has agreed to talk because she will, she says, use any platform to express her view that Islam is an ideology of violence, intolerance and sexism.\n\nSmith received relatively little attention during the last federal election as a NSW Senate candidate for the Australian Liberty Alliance, the political offshoot of the Q Society, which describes itself as \"Australia's leading Islam-critical movement\".\n\n(\"Q Society supports an integrated multi-ethnic Australia and rejects racism, which the Oxford dictionary defines as: 'Belief in the superiority of a particular race.' Since Islam is not a race or ethnicity, being critical of Islam is not racist,\" its website explains.)\n\nBut she is likely to receive far more press in the coming weeks as the co-defendant in a defamation action being brought by the businessman Mohammed El-Mouelhy, who was the subject of a critical video produced by the Q Society and presented by Smith.\n\nAlready Smith and the Q Society, also named in the suit, have rallied an impressive line-up of public supporters, including Coalition right-wingers Cory Bernardi, George Christensen and the former MP Ross Cameron, who are among a handful of public figures set to address fundraisers to be held in Sydney and Melbourne on February 9 and 10.\n\nWe sit and both reach for our phones to turn on recording apps. Smith has already explained that she wants her own record of our conversation. The tension dissipates \u2013 a little \u2013 when a sky-blue ute throbs past us and Smith laughs and points out the personalised number plate, \"TRUMP1\". Later she will tell me that she rejects the suggestion she is right wing, rather, she says she a part of the silent majority of mainstream conservatives whose voices are now being heard due to victories of Donald Trump and the Brexit campaign.\n\nSmith says she never intended to pursue politics. She has always been happiest as a wife and mother. \"I love being my husband's wife,\" she says to emphasise the point.\n\nAs it was, a confluence of events brought her to her mission. In 2000 Smith and her husband Greg, a tradesman, sought out volunteer work in Mali and there met the Assemblies of God missionary Faouzi Arzouni, whom she describes as a Muslim apostate who became a friend and mentor.\n\nTwo years later the couple went on another trip, a 10-day visit to refugee camps of the displaced of what is now known as the Maluku sectarian conflict in Indonesia, during which Christian and Muslim communities fell into violent political and ethnic conflict. Smith recalls sitting in refugee camps hearing terrible stories of violence perpetrated by Muslims.\n\nIn 2009 Smith's husband took her to a talk being given by the Q Society's Mark Durie, an Anglican vicar. During that lecture Durie said that his wife would not buy certain supermarket products because they had been certified as halal.\n\nSmith was intrigued and began her own investigations on the internet, learning that many brands are halal-certified, and that a portion of the fees paid for such certification is donated to Muslim charities. In other countries, Smith contends, those charities have directed funds towards groups with terrorist links. Her online investigation became a website, Halal Choices, a campaign and, with the support of Bernardi and Christensen, a parliamentary inquiry into \"third party\" food certification. Finally it became a political ambit, with Smith running for the ALA in a campaign launched by the anti-Islamic immigration Dutch MP Geert Wilders.\n\n\"There is no question of our country being Islamified. Now, this reply constituted a historical error as soon as it was uttered,\" Wilders once told Dutch parliament.\n\n\"I can report that they have had enough of burkas, headscarves, the ritual slaughter of animals, so\u2011called honour revenge, blaring minarets, female circumcision, hymen restoration operations, abuse of homosexuals, Turkish and Arabic on the buses and trains as well as on town hall leaflets, halal meat at grocery shops and department stores, Sharia exams, the Finance Minister's Sharia mortgages, and the enormous over-representation of Muslims in the area of crime, including Moroccan street terrorists,\" Wilders said.\n\nSmith says she does not believe there is an imminent threat of adopting Sharia law, but is concerned about what she calls \"creeping sharia\".\n\n\"We are being encouraged very strongly to tolerate sharia finance, halal certification, the hijab,\" she says.\n\n\"Sharia is definitely present in Australia \u2026 I believe there are honour killings and it is all reported under domestic violence or another name,\" she says. As evidence she says she has close friends who are pastors who work in churches who have provided sanctuary to victims.\n\nBut Smith's concerns are broader than creeping sharia. During the US election she was horrified by Hillary Clinton's support for abortion rights. She opposes political correctness, Safe Schools and big government regulations imposed upon farmers by distant bureaucrats.\n\n\"I pretty much oppose everything the Greens stand for,\" she says.\n\nShe was also appalled by the Liberal Party's abandonment of Tony Abbott for Malcolm Turnbull.\n\nThis broader political outlook, and Smith's articulate direct manner, has led some observers to speculate that she is a potential leader for a new conservative movement, one energised by the international populist surge.\n\nShe is, says John Adams, a former Coalition adviser who has written about the need for more intellectual depth in the new conservative movement, a more capable and charismatic messenger than, say, Pauline Hanson. (\"I think Pauline has a lot of good sentiment, I am not sure about the ability,\" says Smith of Hanson.)\n\nIn the months since the campaign Smith has kept in touch with supporters via videos on her Facebook page. In them she is relentlessly bright and articulate, upbeat about Christmas and Australia Day, though scandalised by the recent billboard that showed a pair of little girls celebrating in a hijab and cheerily opposed to the \"threat\" of multiculturalism. She denies ever having had media training, though confesses that she is constantly asked if she has.\n\nAsked if she plans to run for office again Smith says she cannot answer the question as her entire focus is directed towards the defamation action and her family.\n\n\"People say this is sexist, well I am sexist, I love being a wife and mother, that is the best I have ever done in my life\u2026 I love being my husband's wife.\"\n\nIn the next breath she adds that she and her husband have made the decision to use any platform to put forward their message.\n\n\"I want to be able to look my children in the eye and say I did everything I could to stand for what is right.\" The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Nick O&#39;Malley"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Religion news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Islam-critical Kirralie Smith seen as potential libertarian leader","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2428","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Forster","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Great Lakes Advocate","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"170633411","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"6"},"name":"Great Lakes Advocate","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.greatlakesadvocate.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194014818","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:50:27Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:12:33Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/157221b2-f74a-469e-b91c-c9863ca767f7.jpg/r3_0_725_408_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

He remembers the stigma his parents faced while he was growing up. \n\n\"Now it's cool,\" he said. \"If I was a teenager now, I'd get a lot more dates than I did in the '80s.\" \n\nDuring his 20 years as a performer, Wann's parents have remained an inspiration for his comedy show, he said. \n\n\"I feel like I want to sign in case my parents ever came to a show,\" he said. \n\nWhile his wife has served as his speaking interpreter for his comedy shows, Wann said he also often has local people \u2014 such as Happy Hands adviser Liza Bancroft \u2014 interpret sign language into speech. \n\n\"He's so well-respected and well-known in the deaf community,\" Bancroft said. \"So it's a real unique opportunity.\" \n\nOpportunity awaits the students continuing their ASL education as well, Wann said. \n\n\"You are learning our language,\" Wann signed during his show. \"You have two choices: You can use that language to help deaf people ... or you can use it to hurt them.

He did some shoveling outside his Williston home, and then went inside to take ibuprofen for a nagging pain in his arm. \n\nHalf an hour later, the pain was gone, and Boone was celebrating the holiday with his family. \n\nBut later that night, he woke up from an early evening nap in front of the television to raging pain in his arm, back and chest. \n\n\"I was hurting so bad I started breaking out in a sweat,\" Boone said. \"The chest pain was the worst it felt like somebody was sitting on me.\" \n\nSoon he was sick, and his wife called for an ambulance, which managed to make the trip to his subdivision on Harvest Hill Drive, but paramedics had to borrow Boone's snow-blower to clear a path to load him into the vehicle. \n\nThe weather that earlier had meant little more than a blustery white Christmas was now suddenly a terrifying barrier to the life-saving medical treatment that emergency room staff at CHI St. Alexius Health in Williston almost immediately knew Boone needed. \n\n\"We stabilized him as best we could, but at that time I realized our resources were exhausted and he would not survive if we didn't get him elsewhere,\" said Karen Johnson, a certified registered nurse anesthetist, who tended to Boone that night. \n\nThe 45-year-old was having a massive heart attack due to double blockages, and needed to be transported to Trinity Hospital in Minot for surgery. \n\nHigh winds were keeping a medical flight crew on the ground, and local ambulance drivers said the snow was piling up too high to make such a long trip possible. \n\nBy 1 a.m., after Boone's heart had stopped for a second time, Johnson made a call to Rick Sigvaldsen, Williston's Department of Transportation district maintenance supervisor. \n\nShe asked if a snowplow could escort an ambulance to Minot, and the response was immediate. \n\n\"Absolutely,\" he said. \n\nWith snowplow driver Ed Nelson clearing a path, an ambulance carrying Boone, a paramedic and members of the Valley Med-Flight crew made its way to Minot, where a cardiologist put a stent in Boone's heart. \n\nThe trip took four hours. \n\n\"There's absolutely no way we would have done it without the snowplow,\" Corey Johnson, a Williston paramedic who rode in the back with Boone, said. \n\nThe decision to call wasn't made easily, Johnson said, pointing out that she would not have asked others to travel in risky conditions if so much hadn't been at stake, the Williston Herald (http://bit.ly/2kjDsZD ) reports. \n\n\"I would never have considered calling anybody out into those conditions if it hadn't been to save someone's life,\" she said, adding that the response she got was not unexpected. \"I was relieved, but not truly surprised because of the nature of the people in this community.\" \n\nBoone, a Mississippi native, is back to work in the oil industry, and enjoying his first grandchild, who was born a month ago. The two met for the first time after Boone's discharge from the hospital. \n\n\"I can't thank them enough. If it was not for them I wouldn't be here today \u2014 the snow plow driver played just as much a part as the doctors,\" he said. \n\n--- \n\nInformation from: Williston Herald, http://www.willistonherald.com \n\nAn AP Member Exchange shared by the Williston Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Elizabeth HackenburgThe Williston Herald"},"topics":[],"title":"Man suffering a massive heart attack saved by snowplow","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Thurston","zipCode":"98501","state":"Washington","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Olympia","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Bellingham Herald","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169658696","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1606"},"name":"Bellingham Herald","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bellinghamherald.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://bit.ly/2kjDsZD","http://www.willistonherald.com/"],"sequenceId":"695194015257","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:12:34Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Marilyn van Dijk, a veterinary assistant, kept treats in Meyer's hands or in front of the dog at all times. \n\nHe'd forget that he had a bum leg, put his paw down and reach around for the treat. \n\nMeyer, keeping hold on Tigger via a harness, cooed in the dog's ear: \"I've got you. I've got you.\" \n\nAnd then Tigger relaxed. He'd move his front paws forward as if on automatic pilot. Walk, walk, walk. \n\nMeyer moved up the speed on the treadmill, and Tigger walked, walked, walked some more, as if he's been doing it his entire young life. \n\nExcept he hasn't. \n\nTigger has never walked or run on four legs like most canines. \n\nHe has jumped like a kangaroo on his hind two legs or inched forward on his belly. But he has never kept up with his foster parents' other dogs because his front two legs were congenitally deformed by a defect called ectrodactyly, or split hand or lobster claw. \n\nThese days, Meyer has him on the underwater treadmill and doing planks on a large plastic peanut to help develop callouses on the limb and strengthen his core to protect his other limbs. He hopes to introduce the dog to cavalletti exercises (small jumps) soon to help him further strengthen his muscles and improve his balance. \n\n\"He's been compensating his whole life, so we take this slow,\" Meyer said. \n\nTigger weighs slightly more than his optimal weight of 55 pounds, said his surgeon, Dr. Jennifer Warnock. The physical therapy sessions may help with that. \n\nDr. Warnock hopes to perform the second repair surgery on Tigger's other front leg at the end of March. But Good and her partner, Troy Riggs, have some fundraising to do first. When the Statesman Journal first broke Tigger's story last summer and it spread across the country through the USA Today Network and The Huffington Post, more than $17,000 was raised in a few weeks. \n\nMore than $10,000 was spent on Tigger's first surgery, ICU stay, bandaging needs, and his medication. At least $2,000 or $3,000 still needs to be raised to pay for this next round of surgery, which will repair the second front limb and fuse one portion of the other newly fashioned leg. Dr. Warnock expects Tigger's condition to regress a bit as he recovers from the second surgery, but she's cautiously optimistic the dog could be walking on both front legs by summer. \n\nTigger may or may not need prosthetics. His X-rays currently show bone fusion, which is excellent, Warnock said. If his therapy continues to help him develop callouses where he never had them before, she believes the prognosis to be very good. \n\n\"We want to get him functioning without pain,\" Warnock said. \"I want him jumping on the couch, something most dogs take for granted. But Tigger does not.\" \n\nNow about those treats ...","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"CAROL MCALICE CURRIEStatesman Journal"},"topics":[],"title":"Tigger starts water therapy as leg improves","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Thurston","zipCode":"98501","state":"Washington","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Olympia","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Bellingham Herald","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169658696","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1606"},"name":"Bellingham Herald","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bellinghamherald.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://stjr.nl/2iLOWc1"],"sequenceId":"695194015444","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:06:04Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:12:34Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

When Iraqi forces retook Mosul University earlier this month, they found chemistry labs they believed had been converted into makeshift chemical weapons labs.\n\nIraqi special forces Brig. Gen. Haider Fadhil said French officials tested the Mosul chemical this week and confirmed it was a mustard agent. Fadhil did not specify the quantity or potency of the chemical, but Iraqi soldiers were able to visit the site for about ten minutes without exhibiting any symptoms of exposure.\n\n\"We know that they were using this place to experiment with chemical weapons,\" he said, referring to IS.\n\nFadhil said he believes the facility was set up in the Nineveh ruins -- an ancient site just more than 1.2 miles from the Tigris but removed from the city's dense neighborhoods -- to keep it a secret from Mosul residents who might be passing information to Iraqi forces and the U.S.-led coalition.\n\nIraqi forces showed journalists a tank of the chemical agent and a warehouse of more than a dozen surface-to-surface rockets bearing Russian inscriptions.\n\nThe number of casualties because of IS chemical weapons is a small fraction compared to the hundreds of civilians killed in car and suicide bombings carried out by the group. Experts said that is largely because of the low grade of the weapons and the group's lack of access to efficient delivery systems.\n\nThe types of rockets found at the site suggest the Islamic State group was attempting to weaponize the chemical agent, Fadhil said. He added that he believed the facility was being used up until just one or two weeks ago.\n\nIraqi forces declared Mosul's eastern half fully liberated, just over three months after the operation to retake the city from IS was formally launched in October.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Forces discover chemical warfare agent near Mosul","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Daviess","zipCode":"42301","state":"Kentucky","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Owensboro","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Kentucky Messenger Inquirer","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169697828","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"610"},"name":"Kentucky Messenger Inquirer","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.messenger-inquirer.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194016443","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:12:35Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/messenger-inquirer.com/content/tncms/custom/image/c52fb608-0a01-11e5-9c50-bbf37a41334d.jpg?_dc=1433343842"}],"video":[]}}

He spends it reading and charming the people who filter in for chitchat or new soles. A crooked mishmash of framed pictures of Abraham Lincoln, Bill Clinton and our own Rep. Rick Larsen stare across the room at a wall festooned with shoelaces and polishes. \n\nThe tools of the trade stood at the ready behind the counter. \n\nPapadimitriou showed me around. He put a finger on a switch of an ancient contraption that trims, burnishes, polishes, sands and grinds. \n\n\"Stand back,\" he instructed. \n\nThe man and the machine came to life with a burst of noise and dust. It was like being at ground zero of a rocket launch. \n\nHigh heels. Holsters. Handbags. Belts. It's all done the old-fashioned way. \n\nNot all shoes rate his time and affection. \n\nIn the first 30 minutes I was at his shop, a man stepped in hoping to find redemption for his beloved work boots that were splitting at the seams. Papadimitriou said it would be cheaper for him to buy a new pair and sent him on his way. \n\nA woman called from Kenmore asking his hours. \"Monday through Friday, 10 to 5:30,\" he said, holding a phone tethered by a long coiled cord. \n\nShe wasn't sure she could make it by closing. He told her he would come to the store on a Saturday morning to meet her. \n\nHe's that kind of guy. \n\nThe next two times I went to his shop he turned away more work than he accepted, often expressing disapproval even before reading the label where the shoe was made. The massive import of cheap shoes gets his goat. \n\n\"No good. These are plastic. Nothing you can do about it,\" he told several customers. He has resurrected many pairs from near-death, but he knows when a shoe is DOA. \n\nSome owners refuse to give up. \n\nWhen he told Colleen Stillabower it would be $45 to replace the broken plastic zipper on one boot, she unflinchingly told him to do it. \n\n\"Forty-five dollars,\" he repeated. \n\n\"That would be fine,\" she said. \n\n\"Oh, boy,\" he said. \n\nShe asked him to replace the zippers on both boots. He said he'd give her a discount. \n\nIt was the Lake Stevens woman's first time to the shop. \"I found him on the internet,\" she said. \"I asked for the best shoemaker in Everett and his shop was the first one to pop up. Said he'd been here forever.\" \n\nPeople's has been in business in Everett since 1934. It was started by Papadimitriou's uncle, who sponsored his move here in 1967 from Greece, where he'd repaired and crafted shoes. \n\n\"I worked in 1967-68 in Seattle, before you were born,\" Papadimitriou told me, winking. Told you he was a flirt. \"At that time I made $2.45 an hour. I had a skill.\" \n\nHe bought People's from his uncle in 1968. He later moved the shop from Rockefeller Avenue to 2827 Wetmore Ave. \n\nPapadimitriou used to do more than mend rips and save soles. He also made orthopedic adjustments. \"If you have a pigeon toe, we put this wedge in here and make it straight,\" he said in his Greek-English syntax. \n\nHis wife, Dona, died in 2013. She didn't work in the shop with him. Not a good idea for husbands and wives to work together, he said. \n\nHis daughter, Nikki, and grandkids recently moved from Everett to North Carolina. Papadimitriou is all alone now in the town that has been his home for 50 years and the house where he's lived almost as long. \n\nLoneliness isn't what bothers him. These three words make him cringe: \"Made in China.\" \n\nSure enough, that's what it said inside my shoes, and a number of the dozens of pairs of shoes scattered, stacked and strewn about. \n\nDon't believe the sign that says \"Not responsible for shoes left more than 30 days.\" \n\nHe's had some for two years. Every pair of shoes gets a handwritten ticket. That's Exhibit A. \n\nHe took me on a tour of The Shoes Left Behind. \n\n\"What size do you wear?\" he asked, holding up a large pair of red leather kick-ass cowboy boots. \n\nI figured he could have sized up my feet in one glance, and I told him so. Really, can't he spot a size 6.5 from across the room? \n\nHe shrugged and went back to offering me more shoes that people didn't pick up. \n\nI changed the subject to purses. \"I bring out for you,\" he said, then disappeared in a back room only to appear with a bevy of handbags. \n\nWhy don't people pick up their things? \n\n\"Long stories,\" he said. \n\nHe donates many unwanted items to the thrift shop run by Domestic Violence Services of Snohomish County. \"I give it to them so they can sell and make money for women,\" he said. \n\nI admired the flashy leopard shoes with 6-inch platform heels that were on a shelf above the can of salmon that someone gave him for Christmas. \n\nThe average person has about 20 pairs of shoes. Papadimitriou owns six pairs, including the ones on his feet and a twin pair he keeps under his desk. That's it. \n\n\"I hear many women say, 'Oh, I love my shoes,'\" he said. \"I love people. I don't love shoes.\" \n\nWhat he cares about is making his work shine and fit like a glove. \n\n\"He stretched loafers for me that were too tight,\" said Gerry Provencher, who lives nearby and likes to stop by to shoot the breeze. \"He's an artist in his approach because he wants to take something that somebody cares about and is not of any use to them and bring it back to life. He takes the time and effort that an artist would take.\" \n\nPapadimitriou keeps things simple. Cash and checks only. \"I don't ask for ID,\" he said. He's had only three bad checks in almost 50 years. \n\n\"I have good customers,\" he said. \n\nHe has outlived many of them. \n\nIs the shop for sale? \n\nYep. Everything in it. Even him. \n\nIf you think you get to sit around all day and read and listen to music, think again. \n\nHe tells about the only person so far who expressed an interest. \n\n\"A man came from Whidbey Island and asked me to train him,\" he said. \"He said, 'How long did it take you to learn this business?' Stupid question. I say, 'I learn every day. You stop to learn when you be dead.' I never see him again.\" \n\nStop by his shop. You might prance out of there in red leather boots \u2014 and a Greek cobbler on your arm.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"ANDREA BROWNThe Herald"},"topics":[{"name":"Greece news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"The charming Greek cobbler of People's Shoe Repair","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Thurston","zipCode":"98501","state":"Washington","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Olympia","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Bellingham Herald","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169658696","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1606"},"name":"Bellingham Herald","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bellinghamherald.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://bit.ly/2jSDHMm"],"sequenceId":"695194016825","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:06:04Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:12:34Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Captain Scott Curry restored the host's lead after the break and then the game ebbed and flowed until Bazan Velez went in again to make it 12-12. \n\nBut another New Zealand turnover settle the issue and Franco Sabato won the match for Argentina with a try in the corner. \n\nREAD MORE: * * Gifford: Wellington Sevens lacks stars Having won the last three editions of this event, finishing sixth wasn't particularly impressive. However there were encouraging signs in the shape of forward Iopu Iopu-Aso and playmaker Koroi. \n\nKoroi is just out of Feilding High School, but his Wellington cameos suggest the 18-year-old has talent. \n\nTalent of the sort that made Manawatu's Tomasi Cama one of the most feared ball-players on the sevens circuit. Cama is now co-coach of New Zealand and picked Koroi despite him not appearing at the recent national tournament. \n\n\"He's probably better than me,\" Cama said of Koroi. The teenager produced some magical touches to guide New Zealand to a 24-0 win over England in their fifth-place semifinal and looks to have a bit to offer, having played on the wing for New Zealand Secondary Schools last year. \n\n\"This is his first tournament and for a young fella he looks like he's been playing for a few years now. There's always things to work on and hopefully he's going to kick on from now,\" said Cama. Ad Feedback \"When you look at playmakers, obviously they can pass, they can kick. But one thing they do have, they do have time when they have the ball and that's when they look forward and make decisions.\" \n\nIt's Koroi's composure that really excites Cama. \n\n\"At this stage I don't have to do a lot. He's got all the talent. If anything it's just the little things we can work on off the field to make sure that he gets out there and does what he does best.\" \n\nKoroi can't quite believe this is happening. He grew up idolising players such as Cama and team-mates DJ Forbes and Tim Mikkelson. Being picked for Wellington was one thing, but the idea he might play - and play well - was quite another. \n\n\"I've been very nervous playing out there. Very nervous,\" Koroi said. \n\nIt's just that he hasn't played like a nervous bloke. \n\n\"Just like Junior [Cama] says, when you get out on the field just play your game [and] stay calm under pressure, because you're a playmaker.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"HAMISH BIDWELL"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"NZ sinks to 6th at 7s","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"NZ","country":"New Zealand"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Manawatu Standard","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169677392","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1076"},"name":"Manawatu Standard","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://stuff.co.nz"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194021920","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:12:36Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://static2.stuff.co.nz/1485673157/917/17271917.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

It's crucial to take advantage of the opportunities during this time to shore up your retirement nest egg. \n  \nOne significant retirement mistake is failing to assess your current financial situation and understand how much is needed to meet your retirement goals. Many underestimate how much money is required for retirement expenses, which may result in delaying retirement. Consider hiring an adviser to do some retirement planning and help you understand your options, how much money is needed and what trade-offs may be required to meet your goals. \n \nAnother common mistake is to move all of your retirement funds into extremely conservative options as you approach retirement. With the potential of spending 30 to 40 years in retirement, it's advisable to keep a long-term perspective. Consider keeping your short-term money in more conservative options and investing your long-term money in a well-diversified portfolio that can grow faster than inflation. As you approach retirement, it's also important to avoid making emotional decisions in response to short-term swings in the stock market. Emotional reactions frequently result in selling low and buying high, which can be harmful to your portfolio. \n \nMany in their 50s and 60s have more disposable income than at any other stage of life. Avoid temptation and be intentional about your spending. Avoid increasing your cost of living with fancy cars and toys or an expensive new house as you approach retirement. Instead, consider using your disposable income to pay down your mortgage or pay off consumer debt to reduce your retirement expenses. \n \nAnother common pitfall is spending too much on adult children, including your child's college education. The desire to help your children is natural and admirable, but you need to understand what you can afford and how it will impact your long-term financial situation. Place a cap on how much you are willing to contribute for college and encourage your kids to consider less expensive options like attending a community college or living at home during their first few years of college. They have a lifetime to pay off reasonable student loans, but you have limited time to replenish your retirement funds. \n \nFinally, a failure to maintain your health can be financially devastating. If you are healthy, you will probably be more productive and energetic. This can result in improved job performance with more opportunities and higher income. If you are in poor health, you may be forced to retire early, before you are financially ready. You also may face significant medical expenses that could erode your retirement funds. \n \n- \n \nJane Young is a fee-only certified financial planner.

On the misinformation front, contrary to what you might have concluded from campaign rhetoric, \"regulations\" don't just come into existence at the whim of a president. They start with Congress. \n \nThe term \"regulation\" is often used incorrectly to refer to an actual statute passed by Congress - for example, the Affordable Care Act. The term is correctly used to refer to rules created by government agencies implementing statutes passed by Congress - for example, Regulation B, implementing the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. \n \nEither way - statute or true regulation - Congress is the fundamental source of whatever people railing against \"regulations\" are unhappy about. Even executive orders, which are sometimes used as a controversial end run around the normal process of creating regulations, must find justification in an act of Congress. \n \nSo, a war on \"regulations\" is, in fact, a war on prior legislative acts of Congress, with the real argument being that we have too darn many laws and they are getting in the way of innovation, economic efficiency, freedom of speech, the ability to get good seats for the Super Bowl, etc. \n \nTrue regulations come about because Congress, when passing a statute, has given instructions to a government agency to create rules filling in details the statute left unresolved. The agency then drafts a proposed regulation, publishes the draft in the Federal Register, solicits comment from anyone who might be affected by the regulation, holds hearings, listens to incessant babble from lobbyists, revises the draft and promulgates the final regulation. \n \nWhile it may be that, on occasion, a regulation will push the boundaries of a statute beyond what some members of Congress would like, most of the time the regulation drafting agency is just doing what Congress told it to do - that is, refine and implement the statute. \n \nOn the irony front, businesses that operate fairly and honorably, and do not rely on false promises to sell their goods and services, are often wanting regulations. Regulations have the effect of weeding out bad actors and allowing businesses that believe in honesty to compete in an ethical environment. \n \nA good example of this, among many, might be the Truth In Lending Act and its implementing regulation, Regulation Z. This body of law - part statute and part regulation - has allowed ethical providers of consumer credit (mortgage companies, auto lenders, credit card issuers, etc.) to compete based on the quality and price of their products and services and has helped to keep deceitful players off the field. \n \nTrue regulations issued by the executive departments and agencies of the federal government are assembled in a publication called the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). CFR consists of 50 titles, with each title tied generally to the agency responsible for the regulations in that title. The Office of the Federal Register, a part of the National Archives and Records Administration, and the Government Publishing Office are responsible for the upkeep of CFR. If you're interested, CFR is available in most libraries and online at several sites. \n \nColorado and all other states have regulations interpreting and implementing state statutes. These regulations are created through a process similar to the federal process - drafting, publication, public comment, etc. Colorado's regulations are assembled in the Code of Colorado Regulations (CCR), maintained by the Colorado Secretary of State's office. \n \n- \n \nJim Flynn is a private attorney with Flynn & Wright LLC in Colorado Springs.

And a lot of it is stuffed in closets, file cabinets and shopping bags. And, for some of us, stacked on our floors. \n \nSince Jan. 8, I've been encouraging people to participate in my #NoDebtNoMess Color of Money Challenge. It started with assessing the mess in your home and in your finances. The second week dealt with reducing redundancy, such as paying off and then closing credit card accounts you don't need. \n \nThis week, we are focusing on lightening your load. For me, this means addressing the paper load I'm carrying. I have pay stubs from decades ago. I keep receipts and instruction manuals for items I no longer have. This paper has got to go. \n \nBut to be sure I keep what I truly need, I asked some professionals to provide advice on what documents should be retained. \n \nLet's start with tax records. Brent Neiser, a certified financial planner and a senior director at the National Endowment for Financial Education, offered these guidelines: \n \n- Keep tax records up to seven years after the return is filed. \n \n- If you fail to file in any year, or if the IRS has found you filed something fraudulent, you'd better save your records indefinitely. \n \n- Keep business, real estate and investment purchase records until seven years after you've sold the asset and included the sale in a tax return. \n \n- Keep your tax returns indefinitely. A return is \"a window into you and your family's economic history,\" Neiser said. \"It shows the big employment, investment, charitable, spending choices and decisions you made.\" \n \nMaintaining years of tax returns can help if you need to research payments made into Social Security, said Michael Eisenberg, a Los Angeles-based certified public accountant and member of the financial literacy commission for the Association of International Certified Professional Accountants, or AICPA. \n \nSave receipts for big-ticket items such as a TV or computer for insurance purposes. Hold on to each receipt as long as you own the item. \n \nDon Grant, a CFP from Wichita, Kan., gave this advice regarding credit card statements: \"It's nice to see a monthly itemization, but most credit card companies will provide you with a year-end statement that has all expenses categorized. If you're happy with that, shred (the monthly statements) at the end of the year.\" \n \nWhen it comes to home improvement documents, Kelley Long, a Chicago-based CPA and CFP, said hold on to them at least until you sell. \n \n\"If you sell your home for more than $250,000 ($500,000 for married people) more than you originally paid, you will have a taxable gain,\" Long said. \"You can add the cost of any improvements to the original amount you paid to reduce the amount of the gain.\" \n \nOn medical bills, she said: \"If you paid a medical expense with your health savings or flexible spending account, you need to keep the receipt for three years. Consider it a tax-related document.\" \n \nAs for investment and real estate records, \"there's some gray area here,\" said Long, who is part of AICPA's consumer advocacy group. \"But any investment statements that are available online do not need to also be kept as paper.\" \n \nThere are what Long referred to as \"forever documents,\" which you should keep in a safe location where they are protected from damage, loss and theft. Such documents, which may be hard or costly to replace, include: \n \n- Birth certificates and adoption papers \n \n- Marriage license and divorce documents \n \n- Wills \n \n- Death certificates \n \n- Military records \n \n- End-of-year pay stubs \n \n- Mortgage, student and car-loan pay-off statements. If you negotiated to pay less on a debt you owed, keep the document proving you paid off that loan. \n \nAll the experts recommended scanning documents to reduce your paper load. \n \n\"I have instructed all of my clients to search for a place in the cloud that they feel comfortable storing all of these documents in a password-protected vault,\" said Brad Ledwith, a CFP from Silicon Valley. \"If they secure storage of files in the cloud, then the questions of how long to keep things are moot.\" \n \nNow that I know, I'm ready to let go. \n \n- \n \nReaders can write to Michelle Singletary c/o The Washington Post, 1301 K St., N.W., Washington, D.C. 20071.

According to its website, the World Children\u2019s Picture Contest has been held as part of the country\u2019s cultural activities since 1993 to promote the awareness and importance of nature and agriculture, and encourage friendship and goodwill among children around the world, to help develop well rounded characters. \n \nAt it\u2019s 23rd staging, Walker was a successful entrant.

I\u2019m always drawing,\u201d he stated. \u201cI draw a lot of different things, like cars, farm animals, and nuff other things.\u201d \n \nHis entry piece, he estimated, took him roughly two hours to complete. \n \nUpon winning, he noted that competition organisers visited his school to present him with his prize. There were 26,288 entries from 77 countries and regions across the world when Walker entered. Of that number, 200 winners were selected and announced on the website, after passing through two stages of rigorous judging. \n \nWalker was the only person from the Caribbean to be awarded. \n \nThough he wasn\u2019t named as a winner of a gold award, he was delighted that he was able to represent the region globally. \n \n\u201cI felt good about it.

They are travelling to a locale most people dream of getting lost in, a vacationer\u2019s paradise, where they, along with other colleagues, are part of a thrust to shape history within the development of the Caribbean\u2019s first over-the-water villas and bungalows at Sandals Royal Caribbean in Montego Bay, St James. \n \nAfter months of variable weather conditions, constant manipulation of heavy equipment and navigation of an unconventional work site, the project\u2019s successful completion makes the ATL team beam with pride. \n \nATL\u2019s Technical Supervisor Winston Simpson expressed that \u201cit was definitely not a run-of-the-mill day at the office type of set up\u201d. \n \nTechnician, Joshua Gardner echoed his supervisor\u2019s sentiments that \u201cit was quite an experience working on open scaffolding over the ocean, with daily direct exposure to the elements. Nevertheless, being entrusted with providing and installing AC solutions to help advance the country\u2019s tourism sector is an opportunity for which we are most grateful\u201d. \n \nRather different from your conventional AC install, Simpson explained that the Sandals project was unique in that they had to identify and source units that could withstand the particular environmental (sea and weather) conditions. \u201cWe had a few critical considerations in selecting the \u2018right\u2019 units. They had to be resistant to salt water corrosion, energy-saving, have air purification capabilities, accessible for service \u2014 which is a key determinant of the unit\u2019s lifespan \u2014 while simultaneously being aesthetically appealing. So we selected central units for the larger over-the-water villas\u201d. \n \nThe villas, which were unveiled last December, are to be followed by a phase two of the project, the Over-The-Water Bungalows, which have already taken the ATL team back out on the seas to install a dozen Panasonic Inverter units for a summer completion date. \n \nThe local retailer, which has a 50-year relationship with air conditioning in the Jamaican market, is highly recognised for its partnership with Panasonic in pioneering an eco-villa at Sandals Montego Bay, now adding its work at the over-the-water suites to that accomplishment. In consideration of ever-rising energy costs, ATL\u2019s Head of Engineering Mark Blair confirms that the villas\u2019 \u2018green\u2019 nature would guarantee their sustainability as \u201cthe units installed at Sandals Royal Caribbean are eco-friendly, with special mechanisms designed to reduce greenhouse emissions. \n \n\u201cAdditionally, through our major projects, we have seen where inverter AC models can reap up to 65 per cent in energy savings. That\u2019s a welcomed boost to any company\u2019s bottom line which, of course, will contribute in the long-run to the viability of this game-changing product in the Caribbean.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Travel industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Jamaica news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"ATL supports movement to enhance tourism product","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Caribbean","countryCode":"JM","country":"Jamaica"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Jamaica Observer","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169661192","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"67"},"name":"Jamaica Observer","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.jamaicaobserver.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194030385","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:12:41Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Marilyn van Dijk, a veterinary assistant, kept treats in Meyer's hands or in front of the dog at all times. \n\nHe'd forget that he had a bum leg, put his paw down and reach around for the treat. \n\nMeyer, keeping hold on Tigger via a harness, cooed in the dog's ear: \"I've got you. I've got you.\" \n\nAnd then Tigger relaxed. He'd move his front paws forward as if on automatic pilot. Walk, walk, walk. \n\nMeyer moved up the speed on the treadmill, and Tigger walked, walked, walked some more, as if he's been doing it his entire young life. \n\nExcept he hasn't. \n\nTigger has never walked or run on four legs like most canines. \n\nHe has jumped like a kangaroo on his hind two legs or inched forward on his belly. But he has never kept up with his foster parents' other dogs because his front two legs were congenitally deformed by a defect called ectrodactyly, or split hand or lobster claw. \n\nThese days, Meyer has him on the underwater treadmill and doing planks on a large plastic peanut to help develop callouses on the limb and strengthen his core to protect his other limbs. He hopes to introduce the dog to cavalletti exercises (small jumps) soon to help him further strengthen his muscles and improve his balance. \n\n\"He's been compensating his whole life, so we take this slow,\" Meyer said. \n\nTigger weighs slightly more than his optimal weight of 55 pounds, said his surgeon, Dr. Jennifer Warnock. The physical therapy sessions may help with that. \n\nDr. Warnock hopes to perform the second repair surgery on Tigger's other front leg at the end of March. But Good and her partner, Troy Riggs, have some fundraising to do first. When the Statesman Journal first broke Tigger's story last summer and it spread across the country through the USA Today Network and The Huffington Post, more than $17,000 was raised in a few weeks. \n\nMore than $10,000 was spent on Tigger's first surgery, ICU stay, bandaging needs, and his medication. At least $2,000 or $3,000 still needs to be raised to pay for this next round of surgery, which will repair the second front limb and fuse one portion of the other newly fashioned leg. Dr. Warnock expects Tigger's condition to regress a bit as he recovers from the second surgery, but she's cautiously optimistic the dog could be walking on both front legs by summer. \n\nTigger may or may not need prosthetics. His X-rays currently show bone fusion, which is excellent, Warnock said. If his therapy continues to help him develop callouses where he never had them before, she believes the prognosis to be very good. \n\n\"We want to get him functioning without pain,\" Warnock said. \"I want him jumping on the couch, something most dogs take for granted. But Tigger does not.\" \n\nNow about those treats ...","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"CAROL MCALICE CURRIEStatesman Journal"},"topics":[],"title":"Tigger starts water therapy as leg improves","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"York","zipCode":"29730","state":"South Carolina","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Rock Hill","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Rock Hill Herald","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657448","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1027"},"name":"Rock Hill Herald","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.heraldonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://stjr.nl/2iLOWc1"],"sequenceId":"695194030559","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:06:04Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:12:41Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Buddy's award was presented by NSW Deputy Premier and local member John Barilaro.\n\nOne hundred and twenty seven dogs turned up for the inaugural event in 2016.\n\nBungendore Show, which was first held in the 1840s, has gone from strength to strength in recent decades, this year's showgirl, Hanna Darmody, 22, said.\n\nMs Darmody, whose family own a Bungendore butchery, said she could recall helping with the catering at the show as a toddler almost 20 years ago.\n\n\"I've seen the event grow as the town has grown,\" she said. \"It is a great bridge between country and city; the showgirl competition is a good way to get young people involved and promotes opportunities in agriculture.\"\n\nShow organisers said this year's event, which enjoyed the best weather conditions in three years, was an unqualified success with more than 2000 people passing through the gates before lunch.\n\nIn addition to the usual attractions in the show ring and the pavilions and the dachshund dash, the 2017 event offered visitors a chance to get a close look at the Anzac Centennial 18 pounder gun.\n\nThe World War I-era weapon, which also saw service during World War II,was restored by the Royal Australian Artillery Company in conjunction with veteran coach builder Jim Frecklington.

That was one thing that I probably noticed throughout this Big Bash is the crowd and support and talking to the guys \u2013 random punters coming up and saying 'I hope you have a good season' to guys that don't have the profile. \n\n\"To get that experience and that exposure through the Big Bash, it's great for them.\" \n\nAnd icing the cake on the Scorchers' third Big Bash title, Johnson said he planned on returning to the competition next year. \n\n\"I only want to do it if I'm going to perform and I guess this year was a bit of a see how it sort of goes,\" Johnson said. \n\n\"JL [Langer] was really good with me throughout, he just said: 'Come and have fun mate, there's no pressure, you're not the No.1 strike-bowler we just want you to go and have fun and enjoy it and whatever happens happens'. \n\n\"It turns out that competitiveness in me is still there so if the body holds up and I'm bowling well then yeah.

It has attained classic status even before its elder brethren. This is the Toyota \u201cHachi-Roku\u201d as it is popularly known , which is a nickname derived from its internal AE86 designation. \n \nThis isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve had a car like this on these pages, but we can\u2019t help demonstrate our appreciation for car builds that are this thorough and clean. This Corolla belongs to Patrick Mendoza , who\u2019s had the car for nearly 20 years now. He is a hardcore car enthusiast who\u2019s played around with various brands, but confesses he\u2019s partial to Toyotas. \n \nIn the late \u201990s, his father suggested that the AE86 was going to be a classic because it was the last of the rear-wheel-drive Corollas. At first, he wasn\u2019t very interested because he wanted something sportier and more powerful. He was already playing around with a second-generation MR2 at the time and considered the Hachiroku a downgrade. But his father continued to encourage him toward getting and building up an AE86. \n \nEventually, the father and son found and acquired one in N orthern Luzon . The car had been imported by an American serviceman who worked at one of the erstwhile American military bases. Thus, this is an original left-hand-drive example, although it was just an SR-5 and not the GT-S that they had hoped for. Nonetheless, enthusiasm kicked in. \n \nPatrick then realized what he had stumbled upon. This was indeed the last of the rear-wheel-drive Corollas, and at the time it already had a cult following\u2014a fanbase that realized that the car handled well and had a glorious history. To cater to that eager niche, a plethora of aftermarket parts are available, too. A plan began to brew in Patrick\u2019s mind about how to modify and develop the car. \n \nThe first step of this plan was just to move the car in the direction of the US-version Corolla GT-S buy adding four-wheel disc brakes , a 4AGE engine, and an LSD rear-end\u2014 that was all. But as Patrick researched along the way, he learned what the more radical cultists were doing. They were putting in even more aggressive engines like the 20-valve/four-throttle Silvertop and Blacktop motors. He also learned that there was a close-ratio gearbox available for the car. It was these special performance parts that were sucking him into the vortex of the Hachi-Roku cult. And so began the development and modification. \n \nThat the Hachiroku became an icon in the world of car enthusiasts is partly why Patrick is so proud of this car. But most of all, it\u2019s how the car performs with the upgrades he\u2019s made, and all of it is wrapped in a simple minimalist style. During the latter part of the project, Initial-D  became wildly popular, further popularizing the AE86 in the mind of the public. And when it did, Patrick never heard the end of it from his father. \u201cI told you so,\u201d said his dad, over and over. Yup, fathers know best. \n \n\nIMAGE Christian Halili \n \n\nIMAGE Christian Halili \n \n\nIMAGE Christian Halili \n \n\nIMAGE Christian Halili \n \n\nIMAGE Christian Halili \n \n\nIMAGE Christian Halili \n \n\nIMAGE Christian Halili \n \n\nIMAGE Christian Halili \n \n\nIMAGE Christian Halili \n \n\nIMAGE Christian Halili \n \n\nIMAGE Christian Halili \n \n\nIMAGE Christian Halili \n \n\nIMAGE Christian Halili \n \n\nIMAGE Christian Halili \n \nNote: This article first appeared in Top Gear Philippines' December 2016/January 2017 issue.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Joey Bernardez"},"topics":[],"title":"How a father convinced his son to buy a Toyota Corolla AE86","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"South-Eastern Asia","countryCode":"PH","country":"Philippines"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Top Gear Philippines","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169985232","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"6"},"name":"Top Gear Philippines","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Lifestyle"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.topgear.com.ph"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194038503","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:05:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:12:44Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

But it shouldn't erase the troubling memory of one major element of Trump's inaugural address. The foreign policy section has received far less attention than so revolutionary a declaration deserved. It radically redefined the American national interest as understood since World War II. \n \nTrump outlined a world in which foreign relations are collapsed into a zero-sum game. They gain, we lose. As in: \"For many decades, we've enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry; subsidized the armies of other countries\" while depleting our own. And most provocatively this: \"The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed all across the world.\" \n \nJFK's inaugural pledged to support any friend and oppose any foe to assure the success of liberty. Note that Trump makes no distinction between friend and foe (and no reference to liberty). They're all out to use, exploit and surpass us. No more, declared Trump: \"From this day forward, it's going to be only America first.\" \n \nImagine how this resonates abroad. \"America First\" was the name of the organization led by Charles Lindbergh that bitterly fought FDR before U.S. entry into World War II. Not that Trump was consciously imitating Lindbergh. He just liked the phrase. But I can assure you that in London and in every world capital they are aware of the antecedent and the intimations of a new American isolationism. Trump gave them good reason to think so, going on to note \"the right of all nations to put their own interests first.\" America included. \n \nSome claim that putting America first is a reassertion of American exceptionalism. On the contrary, it is the antithesis. It makes America no different from all the other countries that define themselves by a particularist blood-and-soil nationalism. What made America exceptional, unique in the world, was defining its own national interest beyond its narrow economic and security needs to encompass the safety and prosperity of a vast array of allies. A free world marked by open trade and mutual defense was President Truman's vision, shared by every president since. \n \nUntil now. \n \nSome have argued that Trump is just dangling a bargaining chip to negotiate better terms of trade or alliance. Or that Trump's views are so changeable and unstable that this is just another unmoored entry on a ledger of confusion. But both claims are demonstrably wrong. An inaugural address is no off-the-cuff riff. These words are the product of at least three weeks of deliberate crafting for an address that Trump said would express his philosophy. Moreover, to remove any ambiguity, Trump prefaced his \"America first\" proclamation with: \"From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land.\" \n \nTrump's vision misunderstands the logic underlying the far larger, far-reaching view of Truman. The Marshall Plan sure took wealth away from the American middle class and distributed it abroad. But for a reason. Altruism, in part. But mostly to stabilize Western Europe as a bulwark against an existential global enemy. \n \nWe carried many free riders throughout the Cold War. The burden was heavy. But this was not a mindless act of charity; it was an exercise in enlightened self-interest. After all, it was indeed better to subsidize foreign armies \u2014 German, South Korean, Turkish and dozens of others \u2014 and have them stand with us, rather than stationing even more American troops everywhere around the world at greater risk of both blood and treasure. \n \nWe are embarking upon insularity and smallness. Nor is this just theory. Trump's long-promised but nonetheless abrupt withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership is the momentous first fruit of his foreign policy doctrine. Last year the prime minister of Singapore told John McCain that if we pulled out of TPP \"you'll be finished in Asia.\" He knows the region. \n \nFor 70 years, we sustained an international system of open commerce and democratic alliances that has enabled America and the West to grow and thrive. Global leadership is what made America great. We abandon it at our peril. \n \nCharles Krauthammer's email address is letters@charleskrauthammer.com.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Krauthhamer: Trump's America First a perilous path","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Pitt","zipCode":"27834","state":"North Carolina","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Greenville","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Reflector.com","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169657746","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"59"},"name":"Reflector.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.reflector.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194049254","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:12:49Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

I've shot and interviewed them, not about what they're wearing or their upcoming projects. Instead we discussed a very real and personal absoluteness: How would you spend your last day on earth? \n \nThe Last Days Project doubles as a motivational social commentary, acting as liaison between the \"untouchables\" of popular culture and the general public through a connected thread: mortality. Facing your own mortality rewires your brain to focus on the things that matter most to you. Reminds you that time waits for no man. Reminds you that we are all battling demons no matter social status. Reminds you of your virtues and the impact you have on those around you. It reminds you that life isn't over yet. \n \nInstead of waiting and worrying about the unforeseeable future, who says we can't live our days as if they were in fact our last? Here's what a few of the subjects from #TheLastDaysProject had to say about their last days. \n    Jaden Smith   \n\" I Feel Like Shit \" \n \nThe universe works in weird ways. When he was around my age, my father, Ronald Antony Williams, aka \"Sekou,\" toured with Will Smith as a dancer. Backstage during Camp Flog Gnaw 2016 I saw Jaden Smith and introduced myself. When I asked how he would spend his last day on Earth he told me it would take him some time to think of a \"prolific\" response. I didn't want something \"prolific\" from him. I wanted something relatable that no one could misinterpret or misunderstand. I asked him to tell me how he was feeling instead. This is the response I received. \n    Naomi Campbell   \n\"Naomi \" \n \nI was given about five minutes to talk to Naomi at VFiles, enough time to tell her about the project. She gave me the utmost energy and love, expressed how much she loved Polaroids--literarily exclaiming \"I love Polaroids!\"--then quickly getting into a Mona Lisa worthy pose. When I asked her the question she attempted to answer, then replied, \"That's too difficult. I don't live that way.\" She happily signed her name to the bottom. \n    George Clinton   \n\" Get Hight\" \n \nAs night fell on Day 1 of Afropunk 2016, I walked into the tent where George Clinton's wife had arranged for me to take his photograph. His entire family welcomed me with open arms. I watched George Clinton roll a blunt and asked him the secret to being funky. The next day I gave this photo to his wife and she returned it to me with the words \"Get Hight\" scribbled at the bottom. I'm uncertain if the \"t\" at the end is purposeful, but I'm grateful nonetheless. \n    Sango   \n\"Pray\" \n \nI first met Sango at a Goldlink concert at Irving Plaza. After the show, I ventured upstairs where Sango and a few others were lounging. Knowing noone, I introduced myself to everyone. The energy in the room was very friendly. Some months later I traveled to DC to cover Broccoli City Fest, where Sango would be performing. We sat down for an intimate interview, and he played me a piano recording his mother had sent him from his iPhone. \n    Joe Kay   \n\" I would take my daughter to Disneyland.\" \n    Esta   \n\" I'm having a family reunion on my last day\" \n    Alexander Sowinski, BADBADNOTGOOD   \n\"Drink wine. Dance. Sex. Smoke. Star Gaze with John Williams. Blast tunes. Play with all my animals.\" \n \nI spent some time with the members of BADBADNOTGOOD during a private recording session at RedBull Studios in Chelsea, NYC. Alex taught me a bit about the enormous soundboard that took up the front of the studio and about a machine that makes sounds more antique. It took a very long time for any of them to answer the question. With careful thought and after about an hour of chat and laughter the four members handed me back their Polaroid portraits, now scribbled with their last day requests. \n    Matthew A. Tavares   \n\"Swim in the ocean on mushrooms with everyone I love.\" \n    Chester Hanson, BADBADNOTGOOD   \n\"Make sure everyone in my life knew how much I love them.\" \n    Leland \"Chomps\" Whitty, BADBADNOTGOOD   \n\"Smooch my friends. Make love to my girlfriend. See my family and lastly walk into the ocean.\" \n                \nWhat would you do with 24 hours to live? Post a photo to Instagram of yourself using the hashtag #TheLastDaysProject and tell me @GYA.SI . I'll be adding the most detailed responses to the final of the book, The Last Days.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: book news","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"See Naomi Campbell, Jaden Smith and More in the Last Days Project Malia Obama Protests DAPL at Sundance Bella Hadid Like You've Never Seen Her Before NSFW: Women Get Carnal with the City in New Book \"F*cking New York\" Jessie Andrews Makes Winter Accessori","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"PAPER Magazine","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"511989530","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3090"},"name":"PAPER Magazine","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Lifestyle"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.papermag.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.instagram.com/gya.si/?hl=en"],"sequenceId":"695194049424","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:12:49Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The Aussies think it's great because it's a win win for them.\" \n \nCahill said there was little compassion in the Australian policy, which sent back everyone no matter what their offence. \n \n\"It might be one thing when you've got someone that has committed an armed robbery sitting in jail. It's different when you've got someone who has lived their whole life there and been convicted of a relatively minor offence.\" \n \nTony Touri, 48, landed in Christchurch before Christmas, after stints in jail and an Australian immigration detention centre. \n \nHe left behind his family, a $2000-a-week job and the kickboxing club where he helped train youth. \n \nTouri saw Christchurch as a fresh start with labouring opportunities and a place free from old North Island gang connections. \n \n\"It turned my life upside down. When I arrived here, I felt like an alien.\" \n \nCahill said it had been well proven through released prisoners, that if supports were not in place, the risk of reoffending was greater. \n \n\"These people are sort of similar but there isn't the same support available to follow up with them all the time, so it doesn't surprise me we're getting that 30 per cent reoffending,\" he said. \n \nThe Canterbury branch of Pars has found growing demand for their support service. \n \n\"We could have one in a month. We could get roughly one a week, then two in one week,\" Murphy said. \n \nIn 2014, Pars settled just three people in Christchurch. That figure rose to 15 in 2015 and to 51 in 2016. \n \nFive women were among the group that had arrived since 2014. \n \nCounties Manukau District has the highest population of deportees, with 118 residing in the area.  \n \nAuckland City has attracted 89, while 69 people are listed in Canterbury.  \n \nWellington has 52 returning offenders and 51 are in the Waitemata District. \n \nCorrections deputy national commissioner Rachel Leota\u200b said the provision of effective reintegration services for returning offenders was important because many did not have strong links to New Zealand.  \n \nCorrections budgeted $300,000 a year for five years for providers such as Pars to help returning offenders settle back into life in New Zealand.  \n \nPrior to entering a contract with the Corrections in 2016, Pars received $77,000 from the Christchurch City Council to support deportees. \n \nCahill said before an information sharing agreement with Australian authorities was signed in September 2015, police were lucky to get a few hours notice of new arrivals.  \n \n\"Whereas now we are able to prepare a little and have staff meet them.\" \n \nHigh-risk offenders are visited by police 48 hours after arrival. \n \n\"It's good in theory but there simply aren't the resources to do that. And there are no controls,\" Cahill said. \n \nHe said in some cases in Auckland, returning offenders had checked out of supported living arrangements or motels before police arrived for their checkup.  \n \n\"They're not breaking the law per se when they do that, because a lot of them aren't under any restrictions.

The Times this week used the word \u201clie\u201d in a front-page headline, and I agreed with that decision, but there\u2019s a counterargument that lying requires an intention to deceive \u2014 and that Trump may actually believe his absurd falsehoods. \n \nSo in 2017 we reach a mortifying moment for a great democracy: We must decide whether our 45th president is a liar or a crackpot. \n \nYet the costliest presidential falsehoods and delusions are not the ones that people are talking about, such as those concerning the inauguration crowd or electoral fraud. The most horrific chicanery involves Trump\u2019s new actions on women\u2019s health that will cause deaths around the globe. \n \nTrump this week signed an order that will cut off access to contraception to vast numbers of women, particularly in Africa. It will also curb access to cancer screenings and maybe even undermine vaccination campaigns and efforts against HIV and the Zika virus. The upshot: Thousands of impoverished, vulnerable women will die. \n \nAmericans have focused on the executive actions about building a wall, or expediting oil pipelines, but nothing is more devastating than the edict on women\u2019s health.  \n \nIn fairness, Trump probably thought he was doing a good thing; that\u2019s a measure of his delusion. He reinstated what\u2019s called the Mexico City policy, which stipulates that family planning funds cannot go to foreign aid groups that ever discuss abortion. (Federal funds already don\u2019t go for abortions.) \n \nPresumably Trump thought this policy would reduce abortions, and was thus \u201cpro-life.\u201d In fact, this is a \u201cpro-death\u201d approach that actually increases abortions, as well as deaths among women. \n \nHow can that be? Many groups, like Marie Stopes International and Planned Parenthood International, lose funding in poor countries from this policy. In 2001, when President George W. Bush imposed a more limited version, 16 developing countries lost shipments of contraceptives from the U.S. \n \nStanford University researchers found that the Bush version of the policy reduced contraceptive use in Africa \u2014 and increased abortion rates. \n \nThis all sounds wonkish and antiseptic, but in poor countries, the most dangerous thing a woman can do is become pregnant. I\u2019ve seen too many women dying or suffering in filth on stained cots in remote villages because of childbirth. \n \nI wish Trump could see them: a mother of three in Cameroon dying after her birth attendant sat on her stomach to hasten delivery; a woman in Niger collapsing from a common complication called eclampsia; a 15-year-old girl in Chad whose family dealt with her labor complications by taking her to a healer who diagnosed sorcery and burned her arm as she lay in a coma. \n \nWith this new order, Trump will inadvertently cause more of these horrific scenes. Maybe \u201cwar on women\u201d sounds hyperbolic, but not if gasping, dying women are seared in your memory. \n \nWorse, Trump expanded this \u201cglobal gag rule\u201d \u2014 thus called because it bars groups from mentioning abortion \u2014 so that it apparently will cover all kinds of health services, including efforts to tackle polio or Zika or HIV, even programs to help women who have been trafficked into brothels. \n \nMarie Stopes alone estimated that if it cannot find replacement funding, the new policy will result in 6.5 million unintentional pregnancies, 2.2 million abortions and 21,700 women dying in pregnancy or childbirth. \n \nThe victims invariably are among the most voiceless, powerless people in the world. When Bush imposed his version of the policy, it meant that no contraceptives reached a village in northern Ghana. As a result, a young woman named Kolgu Inusah became pregnant. \n \nShe tried to abort the pregnancy herself using herbs, but something went wrong and she suffered terrible abdominal pains. She was rushed to a clinic, but doctors couldn\u2019t save her. Her two children now have no mom. \n \nNicholas Kristof is a columnist for the New York Times.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Womens rights news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Kristoff: Trump\u2019s war on women begins","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Pitt","zipCode":"27834","state":"North Carolina","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Greenville","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Reflector.com","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169657746","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"59"},"name":"Reflector.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.reflector.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194049954","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:12:49Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

From July to December, the first six months of the fiscal year, general fund revenues are up 4 percent over the same time last year. At the same time, expenditures are up just 2 percent. If current trends continue \u2014 revenues and expenditures don\u2019t necessarily display the same patterns from year to year \u2014 state lawmakers and new Gov. Roy Cooper will likely see a sizable budget surplus by the end of June. \n \nAnd now, the bad news: state lawmakers and new Gov. Roy Cooper will likely see a sizable budget surplus by the end of June. \n \nOK, so I\u2019m being a little cheeky here. Running a surplus is far better than running a deficit. It speaks well of both the state\u2019s economic performance and the state\u2019s recent fiscal policies. But if I\u2019m right and North Carolina experiences another in what has been an impressive series of annual surpluses, you can expect tremendous political pressure on state leaders to wrench open the spending spigot. \n \nThe Cooper administration would love nothing better, it seems. The governor ran against former Gov. Pat McCrory\u2019s record of budgetary restraint, even to the point of criticizing the accumulation of a $1.6 billion rainy-day fund. During the fall campaign, Cooper said that was too big, that he\u2019d have spent a good deal of that money rather than saving it. \n \nAs the governor proposes far higher levels of expenditure for the 2017-18 fiscal year and beyond, he\u2019ll be cheered on exuberantly by liberal newspapers, left-wing activists and the spending lobbies that will actually get the loot. Yes, the Republicans maintain supermajorities in both legislative chambers. I worry, however, that some GOP lawmakers might succumb to pressure or even conclude on their own that the state has saved enough. \n \nThat would be a mistake. North Carolina has done an impressive job of shoring up its balance sheet by building the rainy-day fund and socking away another $411 million in Medicaid reserves. But if we end up with a large budget surplus by June, state policymakers should still put a good chunk of it into the rainy-day fund. \n \nIt may sound like having $2 billion in cash reserves is plenty. But what if a recession comes sooner rather than later? The current national recovery from the Great Recession, while relatively anemic, has been lengthy by historical standards. We\u2019re due for a downturn. Admittedly, some of the policies currently being debated in Congress, such as tax reform and regulatory relief, would boost economic growth in the long run. But that doesn\u2019t mean they would necessarily forestall a cyclical recession in the short run. \n \nMoreover, there is risk emanating from Pennsylvania Avenue. While new President Donald Trump says he favors domestic tax reform and regulatory relief, he also advocates tariffs (which are taxes) and other trade restrictions (regulations) that could hamper growth or even trigger a recession themselves. \n \nThe Assembly\u2019s Legislative Research Commission has already endorsed the idea of raising the state\u2019s rainy-day fund target from the current 8 percent of annual operating revenue to roughly 12 percent. That sounds about right. Building a 12 percent reserve would ensure that state policymakers could pay the bills, maintain core public services, and resist the siren song of hiking state taxes during downturns. \n \nRecessionary prospects aren\u2019t the only reasons to save. North Carolina\u2019s state health plan and pension fund are underfunded by billions of dollars. Past politicians promised generous benefits to teachers and state employees while pretending those promises had little cost. Today\u2019s politicians must exercise fiscal restraint so the promises can be kept. \n \nIt\u2019ll be good to run another surplus. It\u2019ll be great if it doesn\u2019t get squandered. \n \nJohn Hood is chairman of the John Locke Foundation.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Hood: Don\u2019t squander the coming surplus","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Pitt","zipCode":"27834","state":"North Carolina","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Greenville","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Reflector.com","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169657746","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"59"},"name":"Reflector.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.reflector.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194050274","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:12:49Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Roy Cooper. \n \nThe forum\u2019s entire list ought to be required reading for state lawmakers. It also includes a call for more overall funding for public schools, higher pay for teachers and principals, greater investments in early childhood programs to boost third-grade reading proficiency and a stronger focus on the role that race and poverty play in schools\u2019 efforts to improve academic achievement. \n \nEach recommendation came with supporting data and the numbers are startling when you consider them together. \n \nNorth Carolina ranks 41st in teacher pay with teachers making less here than in every bordering state. Fifty-two percent of teachers in North Carolina work a second job, the third highest rate in the country. \n \nPrincipal pay is 50th in the nation and the state tanks 44th in per pupil spending \u2014 which is down more than eight percent from pre-recession levels. There are 5,500 fewer slots in North Carolina for prekindergarten, at-risk 4 year olds than there were eight years ago and more than 20,000 children languish on the waiting list for day care subsidies. \n \nInvesting in children and public schools clearly has not been a priority of the General Assembly in the past six years but tax cuts have. \n \nThe cost of the tax reductions passed since 2013 is now $1.4 billion a year with most of that going to corporations and the wealthy. When the tax cuts are fully in place, they will mean $2 billion less in revenue that could be used to raise teacher and principal pay and help at-risk 4 year olds. \n \nAnd legislative leaders are talking about more tax cuts this year. \n \nDuring an interview at the forum\u2019s breakfast for the group\u2019s television show, \u201cEducation Matters,\u201d Gov. Cooper told forum President Keith Poston that it is time for different priorities and that the state should invest more in education instead of cutting corporate taxes again. \n \nCooper also said he opposed vouchers because of the lack of the accountability in the program and believes the money is better spent improving public schools for all students. \n \nIn other words, more investments in teacher pay and school funding and early childhood programs and fewer resources for the sketchy and unaccountable voucher scheme. \n \nIt\u2019s the perfect message for School Choice Week, Cooper choosing to support public schools first, and it\u2019s one that state lawmakers ought to listen closely to. \n \nChris Fitzsimon is Founder and Executive Director of N.C.

Alabede and Akinola streets are major link roads that connect this area to the Oshodi-Abeokuta Expressway. These roads should be upgraded,\u201d she appealed. \n \nEwenla Adepoju, who resides around the Aboru Oki bridge, in confirming the loss of lives and property occasioned by the overflowing canal said: \u201cA lot of accidents have been recorded whenever that portion of the road is flooded, and this is the reason we are calling on the state government to come to our aid.\u201d \n \nA commercial motorcyclist, Wasiu, in narrating his experiences plying the road said: \u201cThe kind of stress we are going through on this road as motorcycle operators cannot be explained. So, we implore the government to come to our rescue because the suffering is much. As commercial motorcycle operators, we are not praying for the rains to start coming because of what we face on the road whenever it rains.\u201d \n \nHis colleague, Kayode, who described plying Aboru Road as a \u201cvery unpleasant\u201d experience said, \u201cMany of us have had our motorcycle tyres damaged because of the deplorable state of the road. Also when it rains heavily, those of us at this side of Iyana Ipaja are cut off from those at the other side of Aboru. \n \n\u201cA lot of accidents are also recorded whenever it rains as the motorcyclists attempt to meander their way. This is the reason we are calling on the state government to kindly consider rehabilitating the road,\u201d he said. \n \nOki Central CDA Chairman/Welfare Officer, Community Development Committee, Elder Rasaki Emmanuel Jinadu, said the bridge has for years remained a major problem of the road. \n \nAccording to him, \u201cWe have been complaining about the bridge since the days of Governor Babatunde Fashola. About six years ago, Fashola sent his Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Mr. Remi Ibirogba, and representatives from Agbado Oke-Odo Local Council Development Area to inspect the shaky bridge. Since that inspection visit, nothing has been done about the bridge. \n \n\u201cWe have not only written to Governor Akinwunmi Ambode on the same problem, but also protested to Alausa about two months ago. There, we were addressed by the Deputy Speaker, Eshinloku Sanni Wasiu, who promised to look into the construction of a new bridge. He was with another member of the House, Bisi Yusuf. We are still waiting for their promise to be fulfilled.\u201d \n \nWasiu, who explained that the big canal, which begins from Abattoir, is among the seven canals, from Meiran, and Ijaiye Ojokoro that empty into Iyana Aboru Canal at Oki Road. \n \n\u201cThe contractor that has been dredging the canal has been going about it haphazardly by leaving dug up debris at the edge of the bridge. These debris promptly find their into the canal during rainfall, a development that leads to constant overflow of the canal. \n \n\u201cThis is what makes the area to flood whenever there is a downpour. While that is being addressed, the bridge, which is also a major source of worry to us should be addressed alongside the canal because if it is allowed to finally collapse, the entire Aboru axis would not only be cut off from the rest of the state, but economic activities in that area, and the Iyana Ipaja axis would also be halted. \n \n\u201cI also appeal that the link roads that would reduce the incessant traffic jams at Iyana Ipaja should be upgraded. If the government takes pains to upgrade Ige, Raji Rasaki, Sotunde and Adeleye streets, as well as, rehabilitate Iperu Akesan Street, all vehicles coming from Abeokuta and Sango can drive through Raji Rasaki Street, and venture out at Iyana Aboru, having left Iyana Ipaja behind. Motorists can also before getting to Iyana Aboru, enter through Adeleye Street to link up Iperu Akesan, veer off to Sotunde Street, come out at Alimosho, and head to Ipaja or Egbeda. \n \n\u201cWe implore Governor Ambode to rehabilitate the link roads and rebuilding the bridge. The time is right for the government to fix these problems before the rains set in.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Come to our aid, Aboru Oki Communities tell Ambode","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Western Africa","countryCode":"NG","country":"Nigeria"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"NigerianNewspapers.Today","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"565870019","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"24"},"name":"NigerianNewspapers.Today","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.nigeriannewspapers.today"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194051354","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:12:50Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

He won multiple times.\u201d \n \nWebb spread the ball around to other receivers like Mississippi State\u2019s Fred Ross as well. The Pac-12 Conference\u2019s leading passer directed scoring drives on all three of his possessions while completing 11 of 16 passes for 165 yards, including a 39-yard touchdown strike on a well-thrown fade to Reynolds. Reynolds had six catches for 96 yards, most of them on that first drive with Webb. \n \nNate Peterman of Pittsburgh had a similarly strong passing performance for the North in the showcase game for senior NFL prospects that actually featured late drama. Peterman fired a 6-yard scoring pass to East Carolina\u2019s Zay Jones with 1:51 left but the North went for two points and a potential lead. \n \nUnder heavy pressure from Chattanooga\u2019s Keionta Davis, Peterman\u2019s pass was deflected and intercepted by BYU\u2019s Harvey Langi.

He and Reynolds proved a prolific combination on the touchdown drive, moving downfield on connections of 21 \u2014 on a third-and-10 play \u2014 and 13 yards before the touchdown. \n \nGame rules require teams to go for two points in the second quarter, and the South\u2019s attempt failed to keep the halftime lead at 9-3. \n \n \nToledo running back Kareem Hunt ran for 118 yards on 15 carries to earn North Outstanding Player Honors, including a 20-yarder and a 43-yarder on back-to-back plays. \n \nThe South\u2019s honoree was Kansas State defensive end Jordan Willis, who forced two fumbles and had a pair of sacks. \n \nThe South committed five turnovers and turned it over on its first three possessions. Saint Francis linebacker Lorenzo Jerome forced a fumble and made two interceptions for the North.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"John Zenor The"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: US college sports news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Cal quarterback Davis Webb shines for South in Senior Bowl win","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Los Angeles","zipCode":"91790","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"West Covina","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"SGV Tribune","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169699559","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"5"},"name":"SGV Tribune","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.sgvtribune.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194051649","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T08:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:12:50Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://image.sgvtribune.com/storyimage/LC/20170128/SPORTS/170129385/AR/0/AR-170129385.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

He is the pioneer of the brand in UAE and has crossed the journey in four decades now with his sons taking over the reigns of the business operations.Gadoya's Gulf journey started when he was just 22 years old, that was when he landed in Dubai in 1973. \"I came here by a ship as one of my uncles lived in Oman and I always had in mind that one day even I have to go to some Gulf country to work. I cannot completely recall my first day in UAE. However, I remember that I had sea sickness. But the moment I reached the shore, I really liked Dubai and never felt out of place.\"He adds: \"My first job was with a construction company in Hatta. I got to know that there were openings so walked in and luckily I got selected. My first salary was Dh450. I kept a portion of my first salary with myself and I sent the rest of it to my father in India. I also had privilege to serve the Union Defence Force-UAE for sometime.Gadoya reminisces that setting up a business was a very smooth process and he did not face any major challenge. The only criteria to set up business then was that local partners were required and he found that in a friend who worked with him for the UAE defence. Thus Gadoya Holdings began its journey in 1979, as a humble 10-member company.He shares further that the UAE market was very welcoming in olden days and there was almost no competition and even if it was there then it was not as intense as it is today. \"Now the situation is somewhat like survival of the fittest. The competition is growing every day and you have to be on your toes to survive and excel in the market. Earlier every day came as new opportunity and now it seems that every day comes with a new challenge bringing out the best.\"He attributes his success to his wife and said: \" My wife encouraged me to start a business and she is the motivation behind all my success stories.\"\"Life has been amazing to me, specially in the UAE. This place has made me what I am today. Of course, God has been kind to me and my parents played a very crucial role in my success. But I must accept that this place also gave me whatever I dreamt off. It gave a safe environment for my family, peace of mind and ample opportunities to grow and excel in every vertical of life. The golden rule that I follow is to be always honest in every situation of life. Be it professional or personal.\"Gadoya is a great admirer of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He shares he would love to travel to Orlando and Florida; and is great fan of the golden era movie titled 'Baiju Bawra.He advises that anyone coming to the UAE must be ready to work hard and remain sincere and focused towards their goal. There is nothing which you cannot achieve here. There is no short cut to success and hard work is the only key.\"I was very determined to make my career in UAE and I always had my eyes on my destination. The UAE was a new place for me when I arrived, so many things fascinated me and many came as a pleasant surprise. I was never disappointed with anything. I focused on my goals so never had time for disappointments,\" he said.Gadoya Holdings, which has more than $500 annual turn over began with 10 people in 1979.The group now boasts a network of 14 companies with a workforce of over 900 employees.With an annual turnover in excess of $500 million, Gadoya is a renowned name in industries such as electrical, plastics, engineering, travel (Musafir.com), real estate, advertising and sports.Satish Gadoya, chairman of Gadoya Holdings, told Khaleej Times he did not face any challenge in setting up the business. \"I was certain that I want to do something of my own now.

And Small Business Saturday was a busy day, said David Borlaug, president of the Lewis and Clark Fort Mandan Foundation, which runs the gallery. \n\n\"In spite of the bad weather, in terms of original art, sales have been great,\" he said. \"It validates Bismarck was ready for this kind of gallery.\" \n\nBorlaug said Bismarck has been \"blessed\" with a multitude of galleries, each with a different niche. Bismarck Downtown Artist Cooperative, Bismarck Art & Galleries Association and Gallery 522 all feature member artists' works. There's also Art Gallerie on Main, where Lydia Richez-Bowman features her own work and that of several other local artists, as well as teaching classes. \n\nBorlaug said Capital Gallery is focused on featuring two artists on its walls \u2014 one expressive and one traditional \u2014 along with several others who work in various other media, such as glass or bronze. The gallery sets itself apart by limiting the number of artists and featuring them for longer periods. And because it does not cater to member artists, \"the world's our oyster,\" he said. \n\nBorlaug has artists lined up for the foreseeable future, with Deane Collin Fay of Gackle alongside Bismarck native Vern Erickson's western Americana pieces coming up in Februarym The Bismarck Tribune (http://bit.ly/2joTPY3 ) reports. \n\n\"There is a thriving art culture in Bismarck,\" Borlaug said. \"We're just glad to be part of it.\" \n\nHe points to Jessica Wachter as an up-and-coming Bismarck artist who has a \"real following across the country,\" with works featured in galleries in Los Angeles and Scottsdale, Ariz. \n\nStephanie Delmore of Gallery 522 agrees. \n\n\"I think we're just getting to that point of there being enough galleries\" that they could partner on events, like gallery hops, she said. \"We can start to thread ourselves together.\" \n\nAs Bismarck's population has become more diverse, Delmore said there are more people who are used to going to galleries on a regular basis. \n\n\"I think the traffic is picking up,\" she said, with the public understanding what art adds to a community. \n\nSince starting 32 years ago, Gallery 522 has wanted all local artists to be able to show their work daily rather than wait five years for their turn at a larger show. \n\n\"We've always meant to be of service to artists,\" Delmore said, and on a day-to-day basis, the gallery has a multitude of artists covering its walls. \n\nBismarck Downtown Artist Cooperative works much the same way, though with slightly different rules and organization, while BAGA has become more well-known for hosting larger shows for its member artists, Delmore said. \n\n\"I think we've got a lovely base of artists in the area,\" she said, and having more galleries showcasing those artists could result in more art-focused events come spring. \n\nBorlaug said he thinks Bismarck is where Fargo was a couple decades ago in terms of growing from a big town to a small city \u2014 and art \"makes cities.\" \n\n\"I feel Bismarck is more than ready to grow its arts community,\" he said. \n\nIn turn, that community could help grow the city, attracting more residents. Borlaug said one of the first things people want to know about before moving somewhere is the arts scene: Is there a symphony? An orchestra? Visual arts? \n\n\"It could help get people to move here,\" he said, and the art produced here is helping tell this area's story. \n\n--- \n\nInformation from: Bismarck Tribune, http://www.bismarcktribune.com \n\nAP Member Exchange shared by The Bismarck Tribune.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"JESSICA HOLDMANThe Bismarck Tribune"},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"},{"name":"Entertainment: fine arts news","group":"Entertainment"},{"name":"Entertainment: celebrity gossip","group":"Entertainment"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Number of art galleries increases for Bismarck","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Sacramento","zipCode":"95816","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Sacramento","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Sacramento Bee","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169672618","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4516"},"name":"Sacramento Bee","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Gossip","Lifestyle","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.sacbee.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://bit.ly/2joTPY3","http://www.bismarcktribune.com/"],"sequenceId":"695194061558","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:12:53Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Tejon St. in downtown Colorado Springs. Old Chicago Pizza & Taproom closed in July after 33 years at the location. \n\nLongmont - A Bunyan-sized can of beer rises above the high plains like a friendly silo from the beer dimension. The landmark is empty of suds, of course, but the restaurant at the base of the giant version of Oskar Blues Brewery's star-spangled flagship, Dale's Pale Ale, is packed with cars after lunch on a Wednesday. Same goes for the Tasty Weasel taproom, set up in a corral at one side of the massive warehouse down the street, where a 50-barrel brewhouse and canning plant churns out 200,000 barrels a year of Colorado suds shipped nationwide. \n \nFounded by Dale Katechis in 1997, the indie brand credited with kicking off the nano-beer-in-cans trend is the second largest craft brewery in Colorado and No. 14 nationwide among those producing 6 million barrels or less annually. \n \nIt all began in a basement in nearby Lyons, and small-batch specialty offerings still are made in a tin brewhouse Katechis constructed there. Since 2008, though, a facility on Pike Road has served as the main hub for the brewery and a growing ecosystem of brands and products that today includes a collection of craft-dining spots, a soda line, Hotbox Roasters coffee and REEB Cycles (that's \"beer\" spelled backwards, in case you didn't notice). \n \n\"We have coffee, we have a bike company the next building over. On the restaurant side we have the brewpub in Lyons; CyclHOPS, which is a mile and a half away, and Homemade Liquids and Solids and CHUBurger are less than a mile. It's like a little hub,\" said marketing director Chad Melis. \"We make our own coffee, we make our beer, make our bikes. We make the stuff we like to do.\" \n \nIn recent months, the Oskar Blues world has begun expanding beyond the area where it was formed, first to Denver's River North neighborhood, where a CHUBurger and Hotbox Roasters recently opened, and soon to downtown Colorado Springs, where the company will open a signature dining spot and taproom in remodeled space inside the DeGraff Building at 118 N. Tejon St. Construction is due to start in February and a grand opening is expected in June. \n \n\"We're so rooted in Colorado culture, and taking those little pieces of Colorado and going to other states has just been really super exciting, (but) I think everybody has the same buzz of being able to go to Colorado Springs,\" Melis said. \"This feels like a great way to try to become part of the community.\" \n \nExpanding the brand \n \nThe concept eatery and beer bar will occupy 15,000 square feet on two levels in space formerly home, for more than three decades, to Old Chicago Pizza & Taproom. A lower- level entertainment grotto will have two bocce courts, a stage and private party lounge, said chef and Oskar Blues Fooderies partner Jason Rogers. \n \n\"This is really our retail side of the brand when it comes to food and liquid and people,\" said Rogers. \"When Dale started this business in Lyons almost 20 years ago, this is where it started, as a restaurant that became a brew pub then became a production brewery, and so forth.\" \n \nTaps will feature a fixed and rotating selection from craft breweries around the country as well as the full lineup of Oskar Blues favorites, such as Dale's, the top-selling pale ale in the state, and Beerito, recently judged the \"most interesting\" regional American beer by tasters in a Wall Street Journal competition. \n \nAt the company's Longmont headquarters, fans can learn more about the backstory and enjoy those brews in the belly of the beast. \n \n\"A lot of brewery taprooms, it kind of feels like you're in a bar, but we wanted it to feel like you were in the brewery and were part of the process,\" said Melis. \"You can hang out and watch the canning line. Typically if you come in you're sitting next to somebody who works here and can chat them up about the beer.\" \n \nOfficial brewery tours are at 4 p.m. weekdays and hourly from 2 to 5 p.m. Friday and weekends, but \"if you come here, somebody will take you around,\" Melis said. \n \nPersonal touch \n \nOne lucky group of out-of-town visitors who arrived on a day when the brewery was closed got a backlot tour with the director himself. \n \n\"Dale was here on Easter Sunday and some people came and the place was closed. He met them in the parking lot and they said they drove here from Indiana hoping to get a tour, so he gave them a tour,\" Melis said. \n \nBehind the scenes, the recipes of 35 brewers are brought to liquid life and retail-ready form by machinery, conveyor belt and person-power (plus the occasional canine mascot), beneath colossal vessels and towering Jenga-stacks of empty cans bound for an automatic depalletizer and then a machine that fills and seals in suds at a rate of about 300 cans per minute. \n \nFor a seasoned witness such as Melis, it's testament to the craft beer trajectory at home and at large. \n \n\"It's grown quickly. When I started in Lyons a little less than nine years ago, the depalletizer was a 5-gallon bucket and a broomstick,\" said Melis, pausing for a long gaze at the machine now tasked with the job. \"I love watching this. It's relaxing and almost mesmerizing in a strange way.\" \n \nAt the next station, another growth ring for the evolving microbrewing industry. \n \n\"Yo, Crowler Team! That's Don. He's our resident drummer, too,\" said Melis. \n \nFor the as-yet uninitiated, a crowler is a 32-ounce aluminum vessel that more small breweries are embracing as a to-go option, in addition to - or in place of - growlers. Oskar Blues is the creator and sole distributor of the machine used for crowler canning-on-demand. It also coordinates resale of the brewery-bound containers manufactured by the Broomfield-based Ball Corp. \n \nGo anywhere and see a crowler machine? Thank Oskar Blues and resident CANministrator Jeremy Rudolph. \n \n\"He saw this machine that was for canning garden vegetables, and figured we could retrofit them, and he knew that Ball had (32-ounce) cans overseas,\" Melis said. \n \nThe tabletop technology is gaining an audience among brewers and drinkers as a sanitary, hermetically sealed way to take a company's tap offerings, in peace, into areas where glass containers aren't allowed. Its uses extend beyond the bar counter, too, to coffee packaging. It's also allowed the company's charity wing, CAN'd Aid, to send supplies of clean water to residents in areas suffering from natural and manmade disasters, including Flint, Mich. communities affected by an ongoing water crisis. \n \n\"We're able to send canned water as a response mechanism almost on a dime. We've helped out here and all over the country,\" Melis said. \"CAN'd Aid is a really important part of what we do at Oskar Blues.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"A visit to the Oskar Blues mothership","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"El Paso","zipCode":"80903","state":"Colorado","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Colorado Springs","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Colorado Springs Gazette","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169663227","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"78"},"name":"Colorado Springs Gazette","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Lifestyle","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.gazette.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://secure.gazette.com/login","http://gazette.com/register"],"sequenceId":"695194069312","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T20:41:19Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:12:57Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://cdn.csgazette.biz/cache/w140-5f00efb074d1f159a7e719683876a423.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Tourists and locals flock to this popular spot, overlooking boats and swimmers at Crocus Bay, to enjoy grilled lobster and seafood, barbecued chicken and ribs, rustic pizzas, burgers and salads. Photo for The Washington Post by Necee Regis. \n\n\"The trip today is about 24 minutes,\" announced the captain of our eight-passenger shuttle ferry. That was just enough time, I estimated, to be served and finish the rum punch I planned to order as we left port in St. Maarten. \n \nI settled on a seat in the rocking vessel and squinted across the sparkling Caribbean at our destination. The relatively small, flat island of Anguilla appeared as a scrub-covered outcropping on the horizon, an easily overlooked smudge on the surface of the sea. \n \nAnguilla's laid-back, gracious style, its white-sand beaches and its dynamic culinary scene are well-promoted. But with no dramatic volcanic hills, no waterfall-laced rain forest, no major port with glittering amenities, I wondered if white sand and fab food were enough to entice people to this off-the-beaten-path location in the Caribbean's Leeward Island chain. \n \nIn other words, would reality match the hype? That's what I hoped to find out as I arrived at Blowing Point Ferry Terminal, cleared immigration (in minutes), waited for my luggage (forever) and found a taxi near the ferry kiosks, where scrawny chickens scurried about. \n \nWith only one main road and a mere six stoplights, the island isn't difficult to navigate. However, visitors like me, hesitant about left-side-of-the-road driving, may opt for the ease of fixed-rate taxis. \n \nEn route to Malliouhana, an Auberge resort perched on a bluff overlooking Meads Bay, I peppered my driver with questions about Anguilla, the main one being, \"What is the correct pronunciation?\" \n \n\"It's An-gwilla, sort of like gorilla. The name comes from its shape. Like an eel,\" said the driver, who was born and raised on the island. \n \nLike many islands in the Caribbean, Anguilla was colonized in the 17th century by alternating groups of Europeans, primarily from Great Britain and France. After a 1967 revolution to separate itself from the Federation of the West Indies (established in the 1950s with nearby St. Kitts and Nevis), Britain intervened. By December 1980, Anguilla became a British Overseas Territory with some measure of governmental autonomy. The language of the island is English, though most of the population - estimated at 15,000 - speak a melodic Caribbean version. \n \nArriving with an appetite \n \nMy driver beeped his car horn and waved at other drivers, and those walking along the road, and it soon became apparent that everyone knew everyone. Since the largest slice of the business pie involves tourism, the majority of the people I met were unfailingly polite and happy to share their opinions of what to see and do on the island, including where to hear traditional soca, calypso, reggae and country music. \n \nI arrived hungry - a good thing, as my visit was planned around experiencing as much of the island's purported tasty offerings as I could schedule in a three-day visit. After check-in and a swim in one of two pools with ocean views, I headed out to dinner. \n \nBefore opening Veya, chef Carrie Bogar along with her business partner and husband, Jerry, were looking to escape the gloomy Pennsylvania winters. \"We Googled, 'Caribbean restaurants for sale,' and packed up the kids and moved,\" Bogar said. \n \nLocated in tropical woodlands, this secluded restaurant has the feel of an exotic treehouse combined with a bohemian lounge. The eclectic menu fuses Caribbean tastes and ingredients with those from other far-flung steamy lands. \n \n\"I didn't want to be pigeonholed as just a Caribbean chef so I started thinking about other countries with warm climates such as (the ones in) North Africa, South America and Southeast Asia,\" Bogar said. \n \nOpen since 2007, Veya is no secret. In high season, reservations must be made weeks in advance to sample Bogar's inventive dishes such as grilled jerk-spiced tuna with rum-coffee glaze or grilled local lobster with passion fruit mustard sauce. For light bites, tapas plates and crafted cocktails are offered in the garden lounge, Meze, along with music by local artists, including the soulful reggae beats of Omari Banks. A former celebrated cricketer, Banks is the son of Bankie Banks, a reggae singer known as the \"Anguillan Bob Dylan.\" \n \nPure bliss at Sandy Island \n \nIt seems silly that I left the island to head to another island for lunch. But, indeed, I did. \n \nSandy Island is one of a number of small, uninhabited offshore islands, or cays - all accessible by boat - that are popular with beachcombers, snorkelers and kite surfers. Several of these islands sport casual tiki-style beach shacks that are open for lunch on varying days of the week. \n \nAt Sandy Ground in Road Bay, where those arriving by private yacht clear customs and immigration, I caught a shuttlecraft named Joy (the others are Happiness and Bliss) along with several young guys clutching beers and snorkeling gear. Frigate birds circled overhead as we cruised toward Sandy Island and in minutes, it seemed, we were jumping into the shallows and wading to shore. \n \nThe shaded, open-air restaurant, also known as Sandy Island, specializes in traditional local foods, all prepared on a seaside grill: freshly caught lobster, red snapper, crayfish and mahi-mahi, as well as baby back ribs, barbecued chicken and drunken coconut shrimp. I sat at a picnic table, feet in the white sand, enjoying a margarita mixed at the gaily painted bar while waiting (and waiting) for my meal to arrive. While chatting with guests at nearby tables, I learned that those in the know call ahead to place their orders. \n \nBut when on vacation, what's the rush? My succulent lobster with coconut ginger sauce and accompanying rice, beans and salad were worth the wait - in fact, pure bliss, which was the apt name of the shuttle I boarded back to port after post-lunch snorkeling (mask rentals are available) in the crystalline waters around the reef. \n \nResort meal a splurge \n \nMy other notable beachside lunch was at Bayside Bar & Grill, a popular spot overlooking boats and swimmers at Crocus Bay. Though tempted to order another lobster, I opted instead for grilled snapper and Creole sauce with corn, rice and peas while others around me, many of them locals, I guessed by their lilting accents, enjoyed barbecued chicken and ribs, rustic pizzas, burgers and salads. Before leaving, I peeked inside the grill's elegant sister property, da'Vida, where the dinner menu is a touch more formal - grilled Angus beef tenderloin, herb-crusted rack of lamb, ginger teriyaki sea scallops - but the vibe remains island-casual. \n \nAfter a fruit-and-granola breakfast, some hotel guests headed out to play golf at the island's only course while others planned a day of Auberge spa treatments. I chose a day of lollygagging and swimming at a quiet cove, a short hike down a path from my hotel, where it was easy to imagine I was happily shipwrecked on a deserted island. \n \nI planned a last-night splurge at Pimms, a candlelit, open-air restaurant at Cap Juluca, a five-star resort with its own mile-long beach. \n \nIt can be awkward eating meals alone, especially at a place that blatantly conjures romance. Maybe it was days spent in the sun and the relaxed island vibe, but the staff at Pimms seemed extra-welcoming, the meal of lobster ravioli and grilled Anguilla crayfish extra divine. I sat at a table near the edge of the sea, where curved Moorish arches framed a view of Maundays Bay and the mountains of St. Maarten, the setting sun smearing pink and violet stains across puffy clouds.

With Mitchell Johnson set to lead the attack, and Tim Bresnan and Andrew Tye being certainties for their spots, coach Justin Langer was left deciding between Richardson and left-arm pacer Jason Behrendorff for the fourth pacer's spot. \n \nBehrendorff was in with a chance making a surprising return to the line-up from injury, having not played competitive cricket since November last year. While the 20-year-old Richardson was young and fitter, Behrendorff brought with him a lot of experience. Nonetheless, with the Scorchers coach unsure of the left-arm pacer's fitness, he decided to eventually play Richardson in the all-important clash. \n \nThe move paid off richly as the bowler returned with three crucial wickets - Moises Henriques, Brad Haddin and Jordan Silk, apart from effecting the brilliant run-out to send Nic Maddinson back to the dugout. \n \n\"It was just such a dilemma, I reckon I asked at least 50 people their opinion about whether we should go Jason Behrendorff or Jhye Richardson,\" Langer said after the Scorchers' convincing nine-wicket win over the Sixers on Saturday (January 28). \"It's hard to leave someone like Behrendorff out, he's been our most influential bowler of the last three or four years. \n \n\"But it came really clearly to me this morning when I was meditating. If we were talking about being fit to play and to perform, then as good as Behrendorff is, I just left he hadn't played enough cricket. Richardson was battle hard and his fielding - if he didn't take one wicket today, that run out of Maddinson earned every cent of his wage tonight.\" \n \n\"He was pumped. I had to make two tough phone calls, but I wussed out and called Jhye first,\" Langer added. Not surprisingly, Richardson was ecstatic on receivingthe call from the former Australian opener on Saturday morning. \n \nIt was a tough season for the Perth Scorchers with three front-linepacers - Nathan Coulter-Nile, Joel Paris and Behrendorff not being able to play due to injuries. However, with a player from the recently-graduated Under-19 batch being able to stand up and deliver in big matches comes as good news. He played eight matches in the recently-concluded season and took 11 wickets. \n \n\"It's unbelievable. At the start of the season I couldn't have even dreamed of it,\" Richardson said. \"I'm speechless. \n \n\"I was probably a bit lucky with injuries throughout the squad (to play as many games) but I had to trust myself and hard work I've done and it paid off.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Langer justifies Jhye Richardson's tricky selection","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Cricbuzz.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169751182","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"99"},"name":"Cricbuzz.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Cricket","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.cricbuzz.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194079528","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:13:00Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

His name is Sergey Brin and he is one of the co-founders of Google. The tone of the conversation was thoughtful but subdued, possibly because Brin is not a master in Trump\u2019s universe, but mainly because he\u2019s a smart and thoughtful guy. When asked about the future of AI he replied \u2013 sensibly \u2013 that it was \"impossible to forecast accurately\" and followed up with a story from his own experience. Poker requires reasoning and intelligence that have up until now eluded machines. There\u2019s no single optimal move Ten years ago, Brin was running Google\u2019s X lab, the place where they work on projects that have, at best, a 100-1 chance of success. One little project there was called Google Brain, which focused on AI. \"To be perfectly honest,\" Brin said, \"I didn\u2019t pay any attention to it at all.\" Brain was headed by a computer scientist named Jeff Dean who, Brin recalled, \"would periodically come up to me and say, \u2018Look \u2013 the computer made a picture of a cat!\u2019 and I would say, \u2018OK, that\u2019s very nice, Jeff \u2013 go do your thing, whatever.\u2019 Fast-forward a few years and now Brain probably touches every single one of our main projects \u2013 ranging from search to photos to ads\u2026 everything we do. This revolution in deep nets has been very profound and definitely surprised me \u2013 even though I was right in there. I could, you know, throw paper clips at Jeff.\"\n\nFast-forward a week from that interview and cut to Pittsburgh, where four leading professional poker players are pitting their wits against an AI program created by two Carnegie Mellon university researchers. They\u2019re playing a particular kind of high-stakes poker called heads-up no-limit Texas hold\u2019em. The program is called Libratus, which is Latin for \"balanced\". There is, however, nothing balanced about its performance. Just over halfway through the 20-day game, Libratus was $800,000 up on the humans, some of whom were beginning to feel depressed. \"I didn\u2019t realise how good it was until today,\" said one of them, Dong Kim. \"I felt like I was playing against someone who was cheating, like it could see my cards. I\u2019m not accusing it of cheating. It was just that good.\"\n\nThe match doesn\u2019t end until tomorrow (you can follow it via the hashtag #brainsvsai) and so we don\u2019t know yet if the computer will win. But even if it doesn\u2019t, another milestone has been passed on the road to artificial intelligence, because the Pittsburgh contest has shown that a machine can play a pretty mean game of poker against real human experts. This is a big deal, because poker requires reasoning and intelligence that have up until now eluded machines. There\u2019s no single optimal move and the machine has to change its tactics to ensure that its opponents find it hard to guess when it\u2019s bluffing. Poker, says Will Knight, a robotics expert, \"is fundamentally different from checkers, chess, or Go because an opponent\u2019s hand remains hidden from view during play. In games of \u2018imperfect information\u2019, it is enormously complicated to figure out the ideal strategy given every possible approach your opponent may be taking. And no-limit Texas hold\u2019em is especially challenging because an opponent could essentially bet any amount.\"\n\nThe Pittsburgh contest will definitely take its place in a sequence of significant stages in the road to some kind of AI. Earlier ones have included IBM\u2019s 1997 Deep Blue victory over Garry Kasparov in chess, its Watson machine\u2019s and in March 2016. Each of these was, understandably, regarded as a stunning achievement at the time, but in reality they were baby steps on what looks like being a very long journey, despite all the hype about \"superintelligence\". Garry Kasparov holds his head in his hands at the start of his sixth and final chess match against IBM\u2019s Deep Blue computer, 11 May 1997. Photograph: Stan Honda/AFP/ So how could we make an intelligent assessment about the question put to Brin in Davos? One way favoured by the research community is to distinguish between two types of AI \u2013 strong and weak. Strong AI means machines with human-level abilities of perception, natural language, reasoning and motor control. Weak AI means the kind of AI we have now \u2013 the stuff that enables Amazon or Netflix to guess what you might want to buy or watch next or that Google uses to \u2018autocomplete\u2019 search queries: in other words, machine learning plus big data. So in one sense you could say that the future of AI is already here. Strong AI, on the other hand, seems a long way off. Geoffrey Hinton, one of the real gurus of the field, (he turns 70 this year). But although Brin is only 43, he might not get to see it either.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"John Naughton"},"topics":[{"name":"Pittsburgh news","group":"US regional"},{"name":"Internet

But many Chiloquin residents have said they see Gibson\u2019s admission as a threat to their community. \n \n\u201cPeople need to know this disgusting filth lives here,\u201d said Alisha Hansen in a Facebook comment to the Herald & News. \n \n\u201cThere should be an investigation going on with this pedophile, and any information shared would be of great value in putting this guy away,\u201d said John Shaw on the Chiloquin Community Watch page. \n \nHowever, Klamath County Sheriff Chris Kaber said, unless Gibson is suspected of a specific crime or a victim comes forward, his agency has no grounds to open an investigation. \n \n\u201cSomeone merely admitting he has attractions or impulses toward any criminal activity is not enough for the sheriff\u2019s office to investigate,\u201d said Kaber. \n \nAfter the episode aired, Kaber said his office was contacted by at least one person wishing to voice concerns, though Kaber said he had not yet seen the interview himself. While he understands why people may be upset, Kaber said Gibson\u2019s admission alone does not give the sheriff\u2019s office reason to take action. \n \n\u201cWe investigate suspected crimes or actual crimes ... but not thought-crimes, for lack of a better word,\u201d said Kaber. \n \nGibson has been accused by at least one alleged victim: former foster daughter Jazzmyne Holden, who accused Gibson on the show of raping her while she was in his care roughly 10 years ago. Holden, now 20, said she and her sister stayed with Gibson and his wife, Tabitha Abel, for three months before being removed after Gibson was accused of molesting girls in his care, according to Holden. \n \nAbel also appeared on the show in support of Gibson and said she believes her husband when he said he has not abused any children. Abel has known of Gibson\u2019s attraction to girls since 2011 and helped him found ASAP. \n \nHolden said she did not remember specifically what happened but recalled \u201cpain where I shouldn\u2019t been having pain.\u201d On air Gibson said, if Holden believes she was abused, he does not deny it happened but said he was not the one who abused her. \n \nKlamath County District Attorney Rob Patridge confirmed Holden\u2019s allegations were investigated in 2011 by the Multidisciplinary Task Force of Oregon State Police, who determined there was not enough evidence to bring charges. Patridge said Gibson volunteered to take a polygraph test during the investigation, but later declined on the advice of his attorney. \n \nPatridge said he has seen Gibson\u2019s segment on \"Dr. Phil\" and said, based on statements made by Gibson and others during the program, there is no reason for his office to file charges or reopen the 2011 investigation. \n \nKaber also said, since authorities are in no position to take action, it would be unwise and possibly illegal for residents to conduct their own investigations or attempt to take Gibson into custody. \n \n\u201cIf they take some sort of criminal conduct against a citizen that has not committed any crimes, then that would be foolish,\u201d said Kaber. \n \nHe added Gibson has lived peaceably in the community for a number of years, and his admission of pedophilia should not make a difference in his behavior. \n \nWhen interviewed by the Herald and News, Gibson said he is not surprised by a negative response within the community and said he has received death threats since the episode aired. \n \n\u201cMy wife especially is feeling threatened,\u201d he said. \n \nBut Gibson said he does not regret coming forward, as it is still his goal to help those struggling with pedophilia. \n \n\u201cWe understand people\u2019s anger but they\u2019re misunderstanding that pedophilia equals child molestation,\u201d said Gibson. \n \nGibson said, while he believes the episode depicted some of his statements out of context, he believes he was given \u201ca fair shake\u201d overall and appreciated an opportunity to speak out.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Stephen Floyd Klamath Falls Herald &amp; News"},"topics":[],"title":"Chiloquin pedophile goes on 'Dr. Phil'","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Jackson","zipCode":"97501","state":"Oregon","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Medford","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Medford Mail Tribune","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169687916","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2404"},"name":"Medford Mail Tribune","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.mailtribune.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194080547","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T04:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:13:01Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Marilyn van Dijk, a veterinary assistant, kept treats in Meyer's hands or in front of the dog at all times.\n\nHe'd forget that he had a bum leg, put his paw down and reach around for the treat.\n\nMeyer, keeping hold on Tigger via a harness, cooed in the dog's ear: \"I've got you. I've got you.\"\n\nAnd then Tigger relaxed. He'd move his front paws forward as if on automatic pilot. Walk, walk, walk.\n\nMeyer moved up the speed on the treadmill, and Tigger walked, walked, walked some more, as if he's been doing it his entire young life.\n\nExcept he hasn't.\n\nTigger has never walked or run on four legs like most canines.\n\nHe has jumped like a kangaroo on his hind two legs or inched forward on his belly. But he has never kept up with his foster parents' other dogs because his front two legs were congenitally deformed by a defect called ectrodactyly, or split hand or lobster claw.\n\nThese days, Meyer has him on the underwater treadmill and doing planks on a large plastic peanut to help develop callouses on the limb and strengthen his core to protect his other limbs. He hopes to introduce the dog to cavalletti exercises (small jumps) soon to help him further strengthen his muscles and improve his balance.\n\n\"He's been compensating his whole life, so we take this slow,\" Meyer said.\n\nTigger weighs slightly more than his optimal weight of 55 pounds, said his surgeon, Dr. Jennifer Warnock. The physical therapy sessions may help with that.\n\nDr. Warnock hopes to perform the second repair surgery on Tigger's other front leg at the end of March. But Good and her partner, Troy Riggs, have some fundraising to do first. When the Statesman Journal first broke Tigger's story last summer and it spread across the country through the USA Today Network and The Huffington Post, more than $17,000 was raised in a few weeks.\n\nMore than $10,000 was spent on Tigger's first surgery, ICU stay, bandaging needs, and his medication. At least $2,000 or $3,000 still needs to be raised to pay for this next round of surgery, which will repair the second front limb and fuse one portion of the other newly fashioned leg. Dr. Warnock expects Tigger's condition to regress a bit as he recovers from the second surgery, but she's cautiously optimistic the dog could be walking on both front legs by summer.\n\nTigger may or may not need prosthetics. His X-rays currently show bone fusion, which is excellent, Warnock said. If his therapy continues to help him develop callouses where he never had them before, she believes the prognosis to be very good.\n\n\"We want to get him functioning without pain,\" Warnock said. \"I want him jumping on the couch, something most dogs take for granted. But Tigger does not.\"\n\nNow about those treats ...","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"CAROL MCALICE CURRIE Statesman Journal"},"topics":[],"title":"Tigger starts water therapy as leg improves","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Richland","zipCode":"29201","state":"South Carolina","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Columbia","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"South Carolina State","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169660449","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1235"},"name":"South Carolina State","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.thestate.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://www.thestate.com/news/article129443829.html","https://twitter.com/share?text=Tigger%20starts%20water%20therapy%20as%20leg%20improves&url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.thestate.com%2fnews%2farticle129443829.html","http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.thestate.com%2fnews%2farticle129443829.html&title=Tigger+starts+water+therapy+as+leg+improves","https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.thestate.com%2fnews%2farticle129443829.html","http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.thestate.com%2fnews%2farticle129443829.html&description=Tigger+starts+water+therapy+as+leg+improves&media=http%3a%2f%2fwww.thestate.com%2fstatic%2fimages%2fthestate%2ffacebook.jpg","http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http://www.thestate.com/news/article129443829.html","http://www.mcclatchyreprints.com/","http://stjr.nl/2iLOWc1"],"sequenceId":"695194083310","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:13:03Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.thestate.com/static/images/thestate/facebook.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Japanese financial services firm Nomura on Saturday projected about 20 percent returns for the Sensex by the end of 2017 as multiples are likely to rise with normalizing growth. \nNomura maintained its overweight view on the mix of public and private sector banks, downstream oil and gas, utilities, four-wheeler and select industrial companies, while being underweight on telecom and pharmaceutical sectors. \n\nIn its report, it added the impact of demonetisation on the economy, investment cycle and earnings will not be significant. \n\nIt has listed HDFC Bank, State Bank of India, Maruti Suzuki India, Zee Entertainment Enterprises and Indian Oil Corporation as its top stock picks. \n\n\"On November 8, 2016, the government had pulled out 86 percent of the currency in

Marilyn van Dijk, a veterinary assistant, kept treats in Meyer's hands or in front of the dog at all times. \n\nHe'd forget that he had a bum leg, put his paw down and reach around for the treat. \n\nMeyer, keeping hold on Tigger via a harness, cooed in the dog's ear: \"I've got you. I've got you.\" \n\nAnd then Tigger relaxed. He'd move his front paws forward as if on automatic pilot. Walk, walk, walk. \n\nMeyer moved up the speed on the treadmill, and Tigger walked, walked, walked some more, as if he's been doing it his entire young life. \n\nExcept he hasn't. \n\nTigger has never walked or run on four legs like most canines. \n\nHe has jumped like a kangaroo on his hind two legs or inched forward on his belly. But he has never kept up with his foster parents' other dogs because his front two legs were congenitally deformed by a defect called ectrodactyly, or split hand or lobster claw. \n\nThese days, Meyer has him on the underwater treadmill and doing planks on a large plastic peanut to help develop callouses on the limb and strengthen his core to protect his other limbs. He hopes to introduce the dog to cavalletti exercises (small jumps) soon to help him further strengthen his muscles and improve his balance. \n\n\"He's been compensating his whole life, so we take this slow,\" Meyer said. \n\nTigger weighs slightly more than his optimal weight of 55 pounds, said his surgeon, Dr. Jennifer Warnock. The physical therapy sessions may help with that. \n\nDr. Warnock hopes to perform the second repair surgery on Tigger's other front leg at the end of March. But Good and her partner, Troy Riggs, have some fundraising to do first. When the Statesman Journal first broke Tigger's story last summer and it spread across the country through the USA Today Network and The Huffington Post, more than $17,000 was raised in a few weeks. \n\nMore than $10,000 was spent on Tigger's first surgery, ICU stay, bandaging needs, and his medication. At least $2,000 or $3,000 still needs to be raised to pay for this next round of surgery, which will repair the second front limb and fuse one portion of the other newly fashioned leg. Dr. Warnock expects Tigger's condition to regress a bit as he recovers from the second surgery, but she's cautiously optimistic the dog could be walking on both front legs by summer. \n\nTigger may or may not need prosthetics. His X-rays currently show bone fusion, which is excellent, Warnock said.

Organisers claim this a record number of the little dogs in the one place at the one time. \n\nMark Ellis, the organiser of Sunday's Werriwa Wiener Dash at the Bungendore Show, believes the turnout of 154 dachshunds for the event constitutes a world record for the number of the sausage dogs in one place at one time.\n\n\"We had miniatures, long hairs, short hairs, standards and wire hairs,\" he said. \"They came from all over; some even travelled from Melbourne.\n\nWhile Mr Ellis wasn't able to engage the attention of the people from Guinness, who ruled the record being sought was too \"specialised\" to interest them, he is happy to claim the record with any other contenders needing to prove him wrong.\n\nAlthough the quirky event, which has captured the imagination of dachshund lovers from across NSW and the ACT, is only in its second year it has already become one of the feature events of the Bungendore Show.\n\nThis year's dash winner was Buddy, owned by Jacqueline Winzenberg of Page in the ACT. Buddy's award was presented by NSW Deputy Premier and local member John Barilaro.\n\nOne hundred and twenty seven dogs turned up for the inaugural event in 2016.\n\nBungendore Show, which was first held in the 1840s, has gone from strength to strength in recent decades, this year's showgirl, Hanna Darmody, 22, said.\n\nMs Darmody, whose family own a Bungendore butchery, said she could recall helping with the catering at the show as a toddler almost 20 years ago.\n\n\"I've seen the event grow as the town has grown,\" she said. \"It is a great bridge between country and city; the showgirl competition is a good way to get young people involved and promotes opportunities in agriculture.\"\n\nShow organisers said this year's event, which enjoyed the best weather conditions in three years, was an unqualified success with more than 2000 people passing through the gates before lunch.\n\nIn addition to the usual attractions in the show ring and the pavilions and the dachshund dash, the 2017 event offered visitors a chance to get a close look at the Anzac Centennial 18 pounder gun.\n\nThe World War I-era weapon, which also saw service during World War II,was restored by the Royal Australian Artillery Company in conjunction with veteran coach builder Jim Frecklington.

Marilyn van Dijk, a veterinary assistant, kept treats in Meyer's hands or in front of the dog at all times. \n\nHe'd forget that he had a bum leg, put his paw down and reach around for the treat. \n\nMeyer, keeping hold on Tigger via a harness, cooed in the dog's ear: \"I've got you. I've got you.\" \n\nAnd then Tigger relaxed. He'd move his front paws forward as if on automatic pilot. Walk, walk, walk. \n\nMeyer moved up the speed on the treadmill, and Tigger walked, walked, walked some more, as if he's been doing it his entire young life. \n\nExcept he hasn't. \n\nTigger has never walked or run on four legs like most canines. \n\nHe has jumped like a kangaroo on his hind two legs or inched forward on his belly. But he has never kept up with his foster parents' other dogs because his front two legs were congenitally deformed by a defect called ectrodactyly, or split hand or lobster claw. \n\nThese days, Meyer has him on the underwater treadmill and doing planks on a large plastic peanut to help develop callouses on the limb and strengthen his core to protect his other limbs. He hopes to introduce the dog to cavalletti exercises (small jumps) soon to help him further strengthen his muscles and improve his balance. \n\n\"He's been compensating his whole life, so we take this slow,\" Meyer said. \n\nTigger weighs slightly more than his optimal weight of 55 pounds, said his surgeon, Dr. Jennifer Warnock. The physical therapy sessions may help with that. \n\nDr. Warnock hopes to perform the second repair surgery on Tigger's other front leg at the end of March. But Good and her partner, Troy Riggs, have some fundraising to do first. When the Statesman Journal first broke Tigger's story last summer and it spread across the country through the USA Today Network and The Huffington Post, more than $17,000 was raised in a few weeks. \n\nMore than $10,000 was spent on Tigger's first surgery, ICU stay, bandaging needs, and his medication. At least $2,000 or $3,000 still needs to be raised to pay for this next round of surgery, which will repair the second front limb and fuse one portion of the other newly fashioned leg. Dr. Warnock expects Tigger's condition to regress a bit as he recovers from the second surgery, but she's cautiously optimistic the dog could be walking on both front legs by summer. \n\nTigger may or may not need prosthetics. His X-rays currently show bone fusion, which is excellent, Warnock said. If his therapy continues to help him develop callouses where he never had them before, she believes the prognosis to be very good. \n\n\"We want to get him functioning without pain,\" Warnock said. \"I want him jumping on the couch, something most dogs take for granted. But Tigger does not.\" \n\nNow about those treats ...","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"CAROL MCALICE CURRIEStatesman Journal"},"topics":[],"title":"Tigger starts water therapy as leg improves","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Ada","zipCode":"83707","state":"Idaho","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Boise","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Idaho Statesman","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169669368","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2631"},"name":"Idaho Statesman","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Health","Lifestyle","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.idahostatesman.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://stjr.nl/2iLOWc1"],"sequenceId":"695194098855","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:06:04Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:13:08Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Failure to reach a deal by then, he suggested, might mean the end of the coalition and lead to a snap parliamentary election.\n\nHe has since retreated from those comments, saying there will be no snap election, but meetings that run into the small hours have continued as the two sides try to reach an agreement.\n\nA snap election would most likely play into the hands of the far-right Freedom Party (FPO), which is running first in opinion polls, helped by widespread frustration with a coalition government that many voters believe is ineffective.\n\n\"I assume that we can get to a result in the course of next week, at the start of next week,\" Kern told reporters as talks broke up on Friday evening and were set to resume on Saturday. \n\n\"But that depends of course on the progress that is made on the critical points,\" he said, without specifying what those critical point were.\n\nAs the talks went on into Friday afternoon, Kern postponed a visit to Israel and the West Bank that was due to begin on Sunday because of the talks.\n\nKern, who took over as head of the government in May, has sought to project a more modern and dynamic image than his predecessor, Werner Faymann, who resigned after an FPO candidate won the first round of the presidential election.\n\nAt an event this month, Kern announced a 150-page list of proposals on issues ranging from cutting unemployment to reforming education. Kern's junior coalition partners from the conservative People's Party have countered with their own proposals, many of them on security and immigration. They include halving a cap on asylum claims set at 35,000 for this year and banning public servants from wearing Muslim headscarves.\n\nThe government has given few details of the talks, and a spokeswoman for Kern said the situation was changing hourly. Austrian media have said other points being discussed include tax relief for employers and making working hours more flexible.\n\n\"We are on a constructive path, but of course the whole thing will only be decided when we really reach the finish,\" Vice Chancellor Reinhold Mitterlehner told reporters on Friday, adding that the talks were in the \"final straight\".","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Author's response"},"topics":[{"name":"Finance latest","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Austria news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Austrian coalition talks make slow progress, drag into weekend","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Western Asia","countryCode":"CY","country":"Cyprus"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Investing.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"362107434","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"236"},"name":"Investing.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://de.investing.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194101116","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-27T11:10:34Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:13:09Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://ca33f332e2199349c49c-dc74b5af55c9b2a1bd8891aa9e8701fc.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/trkd-images/LYNXMPED0Q0K3_L.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Organisers claim this a record number of the little dogs in the one place at the one time. \n\nMark Ellis, the organiser of Sunday's Werriwa Wiener Dash at the Bungendore Show, believes the turnout of 154 dachshunds for the event constitutes a world record for the number of the sausage dogs in one place at one time.\n\n\"We had miniatures, long hairs, short hairs, standards and wire hairs,\" he said. \"They came from all over; some even travelled from Melbourne.\n\nWhile Mr Ellis wasn't able to engage the attention of the people from Guinness, who ruled the record being sought was too \"specialised\" to interest them, he is happy to claim the record with any other contenders needing to prove him wrong.\n\nAlthough the quirky event, which has captured the imagination of dachshund lovers from across NSW and the ACT, is only in its second year it has already become one of the feature events of the Bungendore Show.\n\nThis year's dash winner was Buddy, owned by Jacqueline Winzenberg of Page in the ACT. Buddy's award was presented by NSW Deputy Premier and local member John Barilaro.\n\nOne hundred and twenty seven dogs turned up for the inaugural event in 2016.\n\nBungendore Show, which was first held in the 1840s, has gone from strength to strength in recent decades, this year's showgirl, Hanna Darmody, 22, said.\n\nMs Darmody, whose family own a Bungendore butchery, said she could recall helping with the catering at the show as a toddler almost 20 years ago.\n\n\"I've seen the event grow as the town has grown,\" she said. \"It is a great bridge between country and city; the showgirl competition is a good way to get young people involved and promotes opportunities in agriculture.\"\n\nShow organisers said this year's event, which enjoyed the best weather conditions in three years, was an unqualified success with more than 2000 people passing through the gates before lunch.\n\nIn addition to the usual attractions in the show ring and the pavilions and the dachshund dash, the 2017 event offered visitors a chance to get a close look at the Anzac Centennial 18 pounder gun.\n\nThe World War I-era weapon, which also saw service during World War II,was restored by the Royal Australian Artillery Company in conjunction with veteran coach builder Jim Frecklington.

The group was told to take down all references to sexuality and LBGT. \n  \nA conversation about sexuality and gender diversity has been hushed at a Christian music festival. \n \nCraig Watson was part of a group that paid about $6000 for a stall at Festival One, centred around lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender issues (LGBT) and sexuality.  \n \nFestival One, which was held at Mystery Creek from January 27-30, is an all ages Christian music festival that is drug and alcohol free. It has been running for the past three years and was started after Christian music festival Parachute stopped running in 2014. \n \nAs well as music, the festival's website says it offers seminars on a whole range of topics that invite and encourage discussion. \n \n  \n  \n   \n \nInviting and encouraging discussion was exactly what The Wilderpeople stall was about, said Watson. Its aim  was to promote conversations around sexuality and diversity, and aligning that with the Christian faith. It was run by a Christian group called Incendo.  \n \nThe stall openly displayed signs that read \"Gay\", \"Lesbian\" and \"Transgender\".  News clips about LGBT issues could be viewed, with headphones for audio. One video was a documentary about a lesbian couple who were bringing up a child within the Christian faith.  \n \nBut one day into the festival the organisers decided the material was not appropriate and the group was asked to remove it. This was despite the organisers approving the application which explained the group's intention. \n \nWatson said none of the material was offensive but the group agreed to change the stall and removed the material, opting instead to offer face painting.  \n \nAfter staying another day, they decided on Saturday to remove the stall altogether.  \n \nAfter initially refusing to comment, Festival One chief executive Graham Burt and Incendo released a joint statement on Sunday afternoon:  \"Incendo and Festival One state that the Wilderpeople Collective accepted that the Wilderpeople Collective could not meet expectations of Festival One organisers about what their presence in the Wilder Precinct should be. Therefore the Wilderpeople Collective decided to withdraw their stall.\" \n \nThere has been a discussion about a refund for the stall, Watson said.  \n \nWatson, who is a gay Christian, said Festival One was a great place to start a conversation about LGBT issues. \n \n\"Festival One is a Christian Music festival, and the only one in New Zealand, and it attracts a large number of young adults and youth. We know that there is a large number of these young people who are exploring and wanting to talk about sexuality and gender identity. It's a huge thing for a young person but in the Christian sector it's more complicated because you've then got a faith that has been very much rooted in your upbringing that unless you are a straight, normal person then you are an abomination and destined for hell. \n \n\"I believe that it's right to get the message out there that it's important to have these conversations and that it's important to talk about so it doesn't lead to depression and suicide which we see in a lot of young people in New Zealand,\" Watson said.  \n \n\"I think it's just a clear indication of how we are as a Christian journey with this topic. There's still a lot of work that needs to be done. To not be able to use those words at a camp that is predominantly full of teenagers and adults is a clear indication of what's going on. \n \n\"For me it's just a sign that we are still not there, we are still quite judgmental when it comes to Christians and churches accepting people with different views.\" \n \n ","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"KELSEY WILKIE"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"LGBT news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Religion news","group":"Society"}],"title":"LGBT topic not up for discussion at Christian festival","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"NZ","country":"New Zealand"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Marlborough Express","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169681155","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1076"},"name":"Marlborough Express","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://stuff.co.nz"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194123321","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:13:19Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It is an acknowledgement that traffic problems cause particular issues for public transport and is one proposal in the plan for island transport that has now been put out to public consultation. \n\nThe plan is for stretches of motorway coming into Palma and refers to the Llucmajor motorway and to the one from Paguera. Both have central reservations along sections coming into the city, which isn't the case with the Inca motorway. The idea would therefore be to concentrate initially on the two with reservations and to have a second phase for the Inca road. \n\nA further idea for Palma-Inca is for bus-to-train transfer at the Es Caülls station at Festival Park. The bus would stop there and the onward journey would be on a metro-style train to the intermodal station that would operate every four or five minutes at peak times. \n\nThe government wants to speed up public transport because a journey can typically take up to almost three times longer than by car. Certain examples are given, such as to Cala Vinyes. Public transport means a journey that takes 2.7 times as long: 30 minutes by car and 81 minutes by public transport. A car journey to S'Arraco takes 40 minutes; public transport means 104 minutes. \n\nThe overall transport plan divides Majorca into three areas, for which there will be a single ticketing system when the plan comes into operation in 2019. The government aims to increase public transport use from a current 13% to 25%. \n  \n\n   Related Tags","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Majorca Daily Bulletin reporter"},"topics":[],"title":"Central reservations could become bus fast lanes","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Southern Europe","countryCode":"ES","country":"Spain"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Majorca Daily Bulletin","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"410268984","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"6"},"name":"Majorca Daily Bulletin","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://majorcadailybulletin.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://banners.evoluhcion.es/www/delivery/ck.php?n=ac87e5c3&cb=860296221"],"sequenceId":"695194129158","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T15:43:51Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:13:22Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

He is the pioneer of the brand in UAE and has crossed the journey in four decades now with his sons taking over the reigns of the business operations.Gadoya's Gulf journey started when he was just 22 years old, that was when he landed in Dubai in 1973. \"I came here by a ship as one of my uncles lived in Oman and I always had in mind that one day even I have to go to some Gulf country to work. I cannot completely recall my first day in UAE. However, I remember that I had sea sickness. But the moment I reached the shore, I really liked Dubai and never felt out of place.\"He adds: \"My first job was with a construction company in Hatta. I got to know that there were openings so walked in and luckily I got selected. My first salary was Dh450. I kept a portion of my first salary with myself and I sent the rest of it to my father in India. I also had privilege to serve the Union Defence Force-UAE for sometime.Gadoya reminisces that setting up a business was a very smooth process and he did not face any major challenge. The only criteria to set up business then was that local partners were required and he found that in a friend who worked with him for the UAE defence. Thus Gadoya Holdings began its journey in 1979, as a humble 10-member company.He shares further that the UAE market was very welcoming in olden days and there was almost no competition and even if it was there then it was not as intense as it is today. \"Now the situation is somewhat like survival of the fittest. The competition is growing every day and you have to be on your toes to survive and excel in the market. Earlier every day came as new opportunity and now it seems that every day comes with a new challenge bringing out the best.\"He attributes his success to his wife and said: \" My wife encouraged me to start a business and she is the motivation behind all my success stories.\"\"Life has been amazing to me, specially in the UAE. This place has made me what I am today. Of course, God has been kind to me and my parents played a very crucial role in my success. But I must accept that this place also gave me whatever I dreamt off. It gave a safe environment for my family, peace of mind and ample opportunities to grow and excel in every vertical of life. The golden rule that I follow is to be always honest in every situation of life. Be it professional or personal.\"Gadoya is a great admirer of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He shares he would love to travel to Orlando and Florida; and is great fan of the golden era movie titled 'Baiju Bawra.He advises that anyone coming to the UAE must be ready to work hard and remain sincere and focused towards their goal. There is nothing which you cannot achieve here. There is no short cut to success and hard work is the only key.\"I was very determined to make my career in UAE and I always had my eyes on my destination.

He remembers the stigma his parents faced while he was growing up. \n\n\"Now it's cool,\" he said. \"If I was a teenager now, I'd get a lot more dates than I did in the '80s.\" \n\nDuring his 20 years as a performer, Wann's parents have remained an inspiration for his comedy show, he said. \n\n\"I feel like I want to sign in case my parents ever came to a show,\" he said. \n\nWhile his wife has served as his speaking interpreter for his comedy shows, Wann said he also often has local people \u2014 such as Happy Hands adviser Liza Bancroft \u2014 interpret sign language into speech. \n\n\"He's so well-respected and well-known in the deaf community,\" Bancroft said. \"So it's a real unique opportunity.\" \n\nOpportunity awaits the students continuing their ASL education as well, Wann said. \n\n\"You are learning our language,\" Wann signed during his show. \"You have two choices: You can use that language to help deaf people ... or you can use it to hurt them.

Last week I was looking at their site to buy something. I did click on a couple other interesting items, but did not go ahead and actually submit the order.\n\nYesterday I got an email from them saying I hadn\u2019t bought anything for some time, and it offered me free shipping and 25 percent off my purchase. So I went back and bought the one item that wasn\u2019t discontinued, and a couple others that were on sale. The 25 percent off applied to everything, including the sale items.\n\nMy four items ended up costing me $24 instead of $56 with shipping!\n\nIs this something that other online businesses do? I know I\u2019ve gotten emails in the past that I left something in my cart, but never a discount offer. But it\u2019s a trick I\u2019ll certainly try in the future elsewhere. \u2014 J.R.\n\nYou\u2019ve stumbled across a tactic that many online retailers use to combat online shopping cart abandonment: Remarketing. Remarketing is the practice of trying to reach potential shoppers who\u2019ve visited a shopping website or app and expressed interest in making a purchase.\n\nHave you ever searched the web for a specific item \u2013 say, a pair of shoes \u2013 and then seen that same item featured in online banner ads while you\u2019re browsing around the web? This is a remarketing technique: putting the item\u2019s photo in front of you again to remind you that you were interested in it.\n\nIf you\u2019ve left an item or two in your shopping cart without completing your transaction, the retailer may reach out to you in an effort to get you to finish shopping. Perhaps they\u2019ll offer you a discount code, free shipping or another promotion. Why?\n\nShopping cart abandonment is a serious issue for online retailers. According to the Baymard Institute research firm, the average shopping cart abandonment rate is more than 68 percent. Nearly seven out of every 10 people who begin the online purchase process do not complete it. Their research notes the top reason people abandon online shopping carts is excessive extra costs added before purchase: shipping and handling, taxes and fees.\n\nNo business wants to lose seven out of 10 potential customers. This is where remarketing efforts come in. Web trackers called \u201ccookies\u201d enable the technology that will have a product you previously browsed for seemingly \u201cfollow\u201d you in banner ads across multiple websites in an effort to re-entice you to click on the item again.\n\nIf a website knows exactly who you are, it\u2019s even easier to market directly to you. If you us a social media platform such as Facebook, your account may be linked to online retailers you frequent, and they can easily target you directly for a remarketing \u201ccome back\u201d offer. The same is true if you\u2019re a member of a retailer\u2019s email list.\n\nI\u2019ve long been aware of these tactics. When I see items I\u2019m interested in buying, but the price isn\u2019t quite where I\u2019d like it to be, I\u2019ll add the products to my online shopping cart anyway. I make sure to log into the website first, so they know exactly who I am.\n\nThen, I wait. I\u2019ll leave the cart alone and forget about it for a few days. More often than not, I\u2019ll receive an email within the next week either reminding me that I still have items in my cart or offering me a general shopping or shipping discount. These efforts are specifically designed to re-engage shoppers so they return to the website and make a purchase.\n\nA few weeks ago, I was looking online for some thick, wool winter socks for my son. The socks were a fair price, but the shipping charges were high. I left them in my cart, and three days later, I received a 15 percent off coupon code with free shipping. You can bet that I went right back and ordered the socks for an even better price \u2013 sans shipping.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"allan.swift@lee.net"},"topics":[],"title":"Jill Cataldo: Use shopping cart \u201cremarketing\u201d to your advantage","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Winona","zipCode":"55987","state":"Minnesota","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Winona","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Winona Daily News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169674807","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"328"},"name":"Winona Daily News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Lifestyle"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.winonadailynews.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194133279","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:30:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:13:24Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/winonadailynews.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/b/72/b728d7f9-c4c7-5d0a-b88e-4e266587a049/572a2ffb1dd82.image.jpg?crop=1169%2C658%2C0%2C101&amp;resize=1120%2C630&amp;order=crop%2Cresize"},{"url":"http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/winonadailynews.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/b/72/b728d7f9-c4c7-5d0a-b88e-4e266587a049/56b26f0468685.preview-300.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

There's a very strong nexus between our immigration and visa programs and terrorist plots and extremist networks inside the United States,\" the official continued. \"Look at the recent, high-profile attacks that have occurred inside the country -- an immigration nexus is not at all uncommon. I won't go through the list of them all now. One obvious example would be Tashfeen Malik and the San Bernadino incident with the K1 visa.\" \n\nA K1 visa is a non-immigrant visa issued to the foreign-citizen fiance of a US citizen. Tashfeen Malik was from a family of wealthy landowners in Pakistan and later moved to Saudi Arabia with her immediate family. Her husband, Syed Rizwan Farook, was a US citizen. \n\nPakistan and Saudi Arabia, however, are not on the list of countries subject to the new ban. \n\nThe administration is facing criticism from leaders in the U.S. and around the world for taking steps their critics say are unconstitutional and anti-American. \n\nThe second mention of San Bernardino came when the official was trying to explain why there was no grace period before the executive order went into effect, to help ease implementation. \n\n\"Imagine if this had been an executive order that had been contemplated the day before the San Bernardino shooter entered the United States?\" the official asked. \"Would have delaying its implementation served the best interests of the country?

Marilyn van Dijk, a veterinary assistant, kept treats in Meyer's hands or in front of the dog at all times. \n\nHe'd forget that he had a bum leg, put his paw down and reach around for the treat. \n\nMeyer, keeping hold on Tigger via a harness, cooed in the dog's ear: \"I've got you. I've got you.\" \n\nAnd then Tigger relaxed. He'd move his front paws forward as if on automatic pilot. Walk, walk, walk. \n\nMeyer moved up the speed on the treadmill, and Tigger walked, walked, walked some more, as if he's been doing it his entire young life. \n\nExcept he hasn't. \n\nTigger has never walked or run on four legs like most canines. \n\nHe has jumped like a kangaroo on his hind two legs or inched forward on his belly. But he has never kept up with his foster parents' other dogs because his front two legs were congenitally deformed by a defect called ectrodactyly, or split hand or lobster claw. \n\nThese days, Meyer has him on the underwater treadmill and doing planks on a large plastic peanut to help develop callouses on the limb and strengthen his core to protect his other limbs. He hopes to introduce the dog to cavalletti exercises (small jumps) soon to help him further strengthen his muscles and improve his balance. \n\n\"He's been compensating his whole life, so we take this slow,\" Meyer said. \n\nTigger weighs slightly more than his optimal weight of 55 pounds, said his surgeon, Dr. Jennifer Warnock. The physical therapy sessions may help with that. \n\nDr. Warnock hopes to perform the second repair surgery on Tigger's other front leg at the end of March. But Good and her partner, Troy Riggs, have some fundraising to do first. When the Statesman Journal first broke Tigger's story last summer and it spread across the country through the USA Today Network and The Huffington Post, more than $17,000 was raised in a few weeks. \n\nMore than $10,000 was spent on Tigger's first surgery, ICU stay, bandaging needs, and his medication. At least $2,000 or $3,000 still needs to be raised to pay for this next round of surgery, which will repair the second front limb and fuse one portion of the other newly fashioned leg. Dr. Warnock expects Tigger's condition to regress a bit as he recovers from the second surgery, but she's cautiously optimistic the dog could be walking on both front legs by summer. \n\nTigger may or may not need prosthetics. His X-rays currently show bone fusion, which is excellent, Warnock said. If his therapy continues to help him develop callouses where he never had them before, she believes the prognosis to be very good. \n\n\"We want to get him functioning without pain,\" Warnock said. \"I want him jumping on the couch, something most dogs take for granted. But Tigger does not.\" \n\nNow about those treats ...","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"CAROL MCALICE CURRIEStatesman Journal"},"topics":[],"title":"Tigger starts water therapy as leg improves","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Johnston","zipCode":"27577","state":"North Carolina","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Smithfield","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Raleigh News & Observer","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169658506","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2271"},"name":"Raleigh News & Observer","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.newsobserver.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://stjr.nl/2iLOWc1"],"sequenceId":"695194133710","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:06:04Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:13:25Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Horror? Yes. Shock? No. In fact, sadly, \"situation normal\". \n \nCanberra's residential rental market problems are chronic. They are not a temporary phenomenon. And they mostly affect the poor. That's because the most acute shortages are at the bottom end of the market. Our comparatively high median rents are a reflection of not just high average incomes but also the inadequate stock of cheaper housing. \n \nPublic housing initiatives can help but are expensive and have not filled the gap left by a lack of private investment. \n \nThe ACT government could improve matters by releasing more land and by re-jigging its land tax scales to encourage more private investment in low cost housing. State Governments have generally avoided directly taxing lower cost rental accommodation. The ACT Government has not. If anything, it's done the very opposite. \n \nOur land tax scales encourage investors to put their money into something other than affordable housing. And that \"something else\" can include higher-end, more tax-effective properties. That's one reason why Canberra has an inadequate housing stock and why there's nowhere near enough housing to provide for those who need it most. \n \nBob Bennett, Wanniassa \n \nFencing off rights \n \nThe architectural detail of the proposed fence to prevent public access to the Parliament House bifurcated grassed roof is not the issue (\"Architects back down over Parliament fence\", Jan. 26, p. 11). Transcending that are the underlying semiotics of the original design, which the people have embraced and made their own. Ways of making the building secure must be found that do not take away that moral right of the people. \n \nJack Kershaw, Kambah \n \nSolar benefits limited \n \nPeter Hannam (\"Soaring power bills driving move to solar\", January 24, p.5) suggests soaring electricity prices are prompting more people to consider adding PV solar and batteries. \n \nMaybe the mathematically challenged might. \n \nIt would take about 30 or 60 years to break even (there are a lot of unknowns and variables). The batteries are likely to last around eight years depending on quality and cycling and the inverter for the PV Solar is likely to need replacement about the same time. \n \nPV Solar degrades with time, its output decreases due to circuit problems, etc, and may have to be replaced or just discarded earlier than planned. \n \nMost people forget that they require frequent cleaning for maintaining full output. They are awkwardly placed for cleaning. \n \nSuch systems are for feel-good value, one-upsmanship on the neighbours, bragging ability but certainly not for economic benefit. \n \nJohn McKerral, Batemans Bay \n \nOlder revolutionaries \n \nI read on these pages that most of the letter writers are old folk. \n \nPossibly because retirees have the time to spare or, maybe, just nothing better to do. \n \nIt may be because, after over half a century, they've developed some strong beliefs. \n \nIt may also be because in their twilight years they don't care any more if they're vilified and castigated, mocked, derided, spat upon, or hassled by local traders. \n \nThey don't need to keep their heads down and compete for a job. Few with a baby in their arms are likely to lead a revolution. Possibly the Nobel poet laureate can come back and recite, with guitar accompaniment: \n \n\"Come young men and women/ Throughout the land \n \nAnd don't criticise/ What you cannot embrace \n \nYour dads and your mothers/Are beyond your young cares \n \nYour young fears do not affect them/ Please get out of the way if you're frightened to help \n \nFor they fear not the costs of resistance. \n \nGary J. Wilson, Macgregor \n \nTop TPP explanation \n \nÇongratulations to Patricia Ranald (\"Time for progressive trade action\", January 25, p.19), a clear explanation of what is wrong with the TPP and a policy outline for the Government and the Opposition to take forward that will benefit all Australians and the peoples of our trading partners. \n \nDavid Groube, Guerilla Bay, NSW \n \nTrump's 'America first' stand could be something to fear \n \nIt is most doubtful that Donald Trump knows or understands much history, but surely his speech writers do. Trump's repeated use of the phrase \"American first\" channelled unsavoury and shameful echoes from the 1930s. The America Firsters, whose figurehead was the aviation hero Charles Lindbergh, were a mixed lot that included genuine old-school pacifists as well as crypto-fascist admirers of Nazism like Lindbergh himself. \n \nPart of the movement was strongly anti-Semitic and generally intolerant of non-Christian \"foreigners\". America Firsters believed that America could turn its back on the world and live in splendid isolation, protected by distance and two oceans. This idea was shown to be dangerously deluded when World War II began. In today's interconnected world, the idea of isolationism is absurd and even more dangerous. We now live in an age of intercontinental ballistic missiles and international inter-dependence that makes such a concept ridiculous. \n \nThe thought the US now has a president who aspires to isolationism and appeasement of Russian aggression is cause for great concern, if not alarm. \n \nSteve Ellis, Hackett \n \nBillionaire Kelcy Warren (\"Oil industry eyes big gains from Trump\", January 26, p24) says, \"My God, this is going to be refreshing\" in relation to Trump's decision to revisit the Texas oilman's stalled Dakota pipeline project. \n \nAnother \"alternative fact\" I think. Mr Warren surely means \"rewarding\" \u2013 for him at least. \n \nEric Hunter, Cook \n \nThe first week of the Trump administration suggests that political satirists should seek another line of work for the next four years. \n \nThe week started with the White House Press Secretary channelling Groucho Marx in suggesting that reporters should believe him rather than the evidence of their own eyes. \n \nThis was followed by a senior administration adviser suggesting without any apparent moral concern that falsehoods could be redescribed as \"alternative facts\". \n \nNow the President has signed a proclamation declaring January 20, 2017, as a \"National Day of Patriotic Devotion\". \n \nThe President, consciously or not, seems to have channelled the North Korean leader Kim Jon-un, who has used this phrase frequently. \n \nI have to commend Paul McGeough for his measured attempt to provide an informed and balanced assessment of US politics and government. \n \nDoug Hynd, Stirling \n \nFormer Australian ambassador to the US, Michael Thawley, advises unhappy opponents of Donald Trump to take a Bex and have a good lie down. In the interests of his health, distraught Washington correspondent Paul McGeough would be well advised to heed this advice. \n \nH. Ronald, Jerrabomberra, NSW \n \nFull marks to Paul McGeough for his article (\"Trump declares he's smart\", January 23, p.6). \n \nHe clearly exposed Trump's mendacity, racist attitudes, misogyny, duplicity and other vices. \n \nOne can only wonder at the mentality of the voters who ignored these shortcomings and voted for such an individual. \n \nSimilarly one can only condemn potential voters who failed to vote in anticipation of an inevitable Clinton victory. \n \nThey effectively handed the Presidency to Trump, supposedly aided as he was by Russian interference in the election. \n \nTrump talks about serving an eight year term. I predict he will only last a year or so as dissident Republicans, angered by Trump's departure from the party's core conservative values will surely side with the Democrats to impeach him. \n \nA. Biela, Gordon \n \nStar Bucks trashed, litter bins set on fire, Trump supporters assaulted, a limo torched and Madonna threatens to blow up the White House. Just another day in the peaceful Democrat protests. Sorry Paul McElligott (letters, January 26), your dummy spitting mates are dime a dozen losers. \n \nMark Sproat, Lyons \n \nYour Wilcox cartoon (Comment, January 23, p.13) nails it. A small book, On Bullshit, originally published in 1986 by Professor Harry Frankfurt of Princeton University, is becoming required reading in the United States. \n \nAccording to Professor Frankfurt, the bullshit artist \"does not care whether the things he says describe reality correctly. He just picks them out, or makes them up, to suit his purpose\". \n \nConsidering the then candidate Trump in May last year, Professor Frankfurt said: \"It is disturbing to find an important political figure who indulges freely both in lies and in bullshit\". \n \nBullshit is not the same as lying. Liars have to know what the truth is so they can depart from it. Bullshitters have no such constraint. \n \nDavid Stephens, Bruce \n \nYes, it is true. Mr Trump is well on his way to making America grate or great? If so, he might do well to remember the only war his great America won by itself was its Civil War. And what is so great about a nation that elects a blustering bully whose business acumen has been sustained on corporate insolvencies and fire sales in which other people have borne the suffering and the little people are to be denied basic health care and education. But then sometimes democracy speaks with a forked tongue \u2013 just see our own leaders! \n \nJames Grenfell, Spence \n \nMyGov brings shame \n \nHaving moved house I tried to log onto MyGov to change address details for Medicare etc. Part of the logon is to create an account. This involved MyGov sending me a logon code. \n \nWell after two attempts and four days I am still waiting for the code. \n \nAs someone with 30 plus years in the IT industry it is obvious that the site applications are poor and that it has woefully inadequate infrastructure. \n \nThe Prime Minister continually talks about innovation and smart working and yet his Government presents us with this rubbish. He should be ashamed. \n \nJim Willis, Mollymook, NSW \n TO THE POINT  \nBILLBOARD THREAT \n \nSo sad Andrew Barr, taxing air space and endangering Canberra's beautiful billboard-free environment. As Ogden Nash wrote, \"I think that I shall never see a billboard lovely as a tree. Perhaps, unless the billboards fall, I'll never see a tree at all\". \n \nRoz Lambert, Belconnen \n \nPlease Canberra, remember that you will be entrusted as the capital city of the Republic of Australia. The nation expects that at least one city should maintain some standard of visual literacy \u2014 so no advertising billboards. \n \nRonald Elliott, Sandringham, Vic \n \nNILE TRUMPED \n \nSo, NSW Christian Democrat Party MLC Fred Nile was denied entry to the United States after offering advice to President Trump (\"Fred Nile denied visa for Donald Trump inauguration, deemed a 'security threat',\" Canberratimes.com.au, January 25). Trumped by a bigger bigot. \n \nJohn Richardson, Wallagoot, NSW \n \nREPLACE TOP COP \n \nCan't Victorian Police Commissioner Graham Ashton be replaced by someone with a bit of empathy and common sense?

Cooke, (letters, January 26), you must be a very special customer if you received your Medicare refund in two weeks. My husband and I waited over six weeks for our refunds. All in the name of progress, I don't think so. \n \nPauline Vincent, Wanniassa \n \nUNITED IRELAND \n \nThe UK Supreme Court has ruled Brexit must be approved by the English Parliament but not Northern Ireland's Assembly.

Organisers claim this a record number of the little dogs in the one place at the one time. \n\nMark Ellis, the organiser of Sunday's Werriwa Wiener Dash at the Bungendore Show, believes the turnout of 154 dachshunds for the event constitutes a world record for the number of the sausage dogs in one place at one time.\n\n\"We had miniatures, long hairs, short hairs, standards and wire hairs,\" he said. \"They came from all over; some even travelled from Melbourne.\n\nWhile Mr Ellis wasn't able to engage the attention of the people from Guinness, who ruled the record being sought was too \"specialised\" to interest them, he is happy to claim the record with any other contenders needing to prove him wrong.\n\nAlthough the quirky event, which has captured the imagination of dachshund lovers from across NSW and the ACT, is only in its second year it has already become one of the feature events of the Bungendore Show.\n\nThis year's dash winner was Buddy, owned by Jacqueline Winzenberg of Page in the ACT. Buddy's award was presented by NSW Deputy Premier and local member John Barilaro.\n\nOne hundred and twenty seven dogs turned up for the inaugural event in 2016.\n\nBungendore Show, which was first held in the 1840s, has gone from strength to strength in recent decades, this year's showgirl, Hanna Darmody, 22, said.\n\nMs Darmody, whose family own a Bungendore butchery, said she could recall helping with the catering at the show as a toddler almost 20 years ago.\n\n\"I've seen the event grow as the town has grown,\" she said. \"It is a great bridge between country and city; the showgirl competition is a good way to get young people involved and promotes opportunities in agriculture.\"\n\nShow organisers said this year's event, which enjoyed the best weather conditions in three years, was an unqualified success with more than 2000 people passing through the gates before lunch.\n\nIn addition to the usual attractions in the show ring and the pavilions and the dachshund dash, the 2017 event offered visitors a chance to get a close look at the Anzac Centennial 18 pounder gun.\n\nThe World War I-era weapon, which also saw service during World War II,was restored by the Royal Australian Artillery Company in conjunction with veteran coach builder Jim Frecklington.

And Small Business Saturday was a busy day, said David Borlaug, president of the Lewis and Clark Fort Mandan Foundation, which runs the gallery. \n\n\"In spite of the bad weather, in terms of original art, sales have been great,\" he said. \"It validates Bismarck was ready for this kind of gallery.\" \n\nBorlaug said Bismarck has been \"blessed\" with a multitude of galleries, each with a different niche. Bismarck Downtown Artist Cooperative, Bismarck Art & Galleries Association and Gallery 522 all feature member artists' works. There's also Art Gallerie on Main, where Lydia Richez-Bowman features her own work and that of several other local artists, as well as teaching classes. \n\nBorlaug said Capital Gallery is focused on featuring two artists on its walls \u2014 one expressive and one traditional \u2014 along with several others who work in various other media, such as glass or bronze. The gallery sets itself apart by limiting the number of artists and featuring them for longer periods. And because it does not cater to member artists, \"the world's our oyster,\" he said. \n\nBorlaug has artists lined up for the foreseeable future, with Deane Collin Fay of Gackle alongside Bismarck native Vern Erickson's western Americana pieces coming up in Februarym The Bismarck Tribune (http://bit.ly/2joTPY3 ) reports. \n\n\"There is a thriving art culture in Bismarck,\" Borlaug said. \"We're just glad to be part of it.\" \n\nHe points to Jessica Wachter as an up-and-coming Bismarck artist who has a \"real following across the country,\" with works featured in galleries in Los Angeles and Scottsdale, Ariz. \n\nStephanie Delmore of Gallery 522 agrees. \n\n\"I think we're just getting to that point of there being enough galleries\" that they could partner on events, like gallery hops, she said. \"We can start to thread ourselves together.\" \n\nAs Bismarck's population has become more diverse, Delmore said there are more people who are used to going to galleries on a regular basis. \n\n\"I think the traffic is picking up,\" she said, with the public understanding what art adds to a community. \n\nSince starting 32 years ago, Gallery 522 has wanted all local artists to be able to show their work daily rather than wait five years for their turn at a larger show. \n\n\"We've always meant to be of service to artists,\" Delmore said, and on a day-to-day basis, the gallery has a multitude of artists covering its walls. \n\nBismarck Downtown Artist Cooperative works much the same way, though with slightly different rules and organization, while BAGA has become more well-known for hosting larger shows for its member artists, Delmore said. \n\n\"I think we've got a lovely base of artists in the area,\" she said, and having more galleries showcasing those artists could result in more art-focused events come spring. \n\nBorlaug said he thinks Bismarck is where Fargo was a couple decades ago in terms of growing from a big town to a small city \u2014 and art \"makes cities.\" \n\n\"I feel Bismarck is more than ready to grow its arts community,\" he said. \n\nIn turn, that community could help grow the city, attracting more residents. Borlaug said one of the first things people want to know about before moving somewhere is the arts scene: Is there a symphony? An orchestra? Visual arts? \n\n\"It could help get people to move here,\" he said, and the art produced here is helping tell this area's story. \n\n--- \n\nInformation from: Bismarck Tribune, http://www.bismarcktribune.com \n\nAP Member Exchange shared by The Bismarck Tribune.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"JESSICA HOLDMANThe Bismarck Tribune"},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: celebrity gossip","group":"Entertainment"},{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"},{"name":"Entertainment: fine arts news","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"Number of art galleries increases for Bismarck","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Sedgwick","zipCode":"67202","state":"Kansas","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Wichita","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Wichita Eagle","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169665895","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"6865"},"name":"Wichita Eagle","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Gossip","Lifestyle","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.kansas.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://bit.ly/2joTPY3","http://www.bismarcktribune.com/"],"sequenceId":"695194137668","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:13:22Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

But will they?  29-07-2016 Teresa Ayuga  \nThe minister for development, Íñigo de la Serna, has called on airlines to reflect the reduction in airport taxes in the price of tickets. (The reduction of 2.2% per annum from this year until 2021 was announced last week.) He acknowledged that the Spanish government has no legal capacity to enter into a \"strictly private\" issue, but he hopes that the reduction will mean cheaper fares. \n\nThe cut to airport taxes was formally approved by the cabinet on Friday and it is included in the first document for airport regulation (DORA); this also includes enormous investment in airports over the next five years. De la Serna said that DORA will improve the positioning of Spanish airports in the global market, noting that it has been well received by the tourism industry: four out of five tourists who come to Spain do so by plane. The document also establishes that airport taxes will not rise in the five years from 2021. If the law hadn't been amended, he explained, there would be increases of up to five per cent. \n\nHe said that the regulations will serve to consolidate Aena's position as a leading airport operator - it has sixteen overseas interests in addition to the 46 airports and two heliports in Spain - and he described Aena as a \"solid and solvent company\" which is currently ranked ninth on the Ibex 35 of leading Spanish companies in terms of market capitalisation. \n\nThe Majorca Hoteliers Federation has expressed its satisfaction with the tax reduction. Its president, Inma Benito, said that the national government had \"finally\" taken the decision to reduce taxes, despite Aena having wanted to freeze them, adding that she considers it necessary to work to improve the discounts in winter in order to incentivise more air traffic. \n\nBenito stressed the importance of the reduction meaning lower air fares. This will be \"fundamental\" in order to \"gain competitiveness and a comparative advantage over other destinations\". She observed that while the Balearic government had been demanding a cut in airport taxes in order to boost competitiveness, it had introduced the tourist tax, which does not assist competitiveness. \n\nThe association of Spanish air transport companies has also welcomed the reduction. This will contribute to stimulating demand, incentivising air traffic and benefiting the end-consumer. It was therefore hinting, without saying so definitively, that De la Serna's hope for lower fares will be fulfilled. \n  \n\n   Related Tags","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Majorca Daily Bulletin reporter"},"topics":[{"name":"Airline industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Tax news","group":"Finance"}],"title":"Hope for lower fares because of airport tax reduction","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Southern Europe","countryCode":"ES","country":"Spain"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Majorca Daily Bulletin","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"410268984","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"6"},"name":"Majorca Daily Bulletin","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://majorcadailybulletin.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://banners.evoluhcion.es/www/delivery/ck.php?n=ac87e5c3&cb=793941586"],"sequenceId":"695194139578","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T15:38:15Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:13:22Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

That answer is 6! One man even made it all the way in with a knife. You really believe terrorists would attack civilians instead of the White House or a Military Base or a Federal building? They would NOT! People that have no Army, no Navy, no type of Aviation supposedly attack a Super Power and take responsibility. Ask yourselves why would they attack then claim responsibility when they could move in silence, hitting place after place, undetected? F.Y.I: There are well over a BILLION MUSLIMS in the WORLD and they've made up less than 1% of all attacks since World War II. Think about that. Our own government plots against us and blames it on other countries. Don't live in fear. Open your eyes and don't fall asleep. All those who were banned never once attacked Americans. Revolution! #wakeup \n     \nKeep calm and remember Trump is right there are 1.2 billion Muslim's in the world and about fifteen to twenty five percent are radicals, possibly higher. . \"You're looking at 180 million to 300 million people dedicated to the destruction of Western civilization and you're worried about Trump protecting you, are you that stupid that maybe you want to see another attack and then at that point you will see the light? At that point you will start saying OK now I believe the facts, and if the president knew this why didn't he do something to try and save us, that's what he is trying to do, you snowflakes. The temporary ban and extreme vetting will help us gather much information during this process. Islam is not a religion it's an ideology , get yourself a Quran and read it, you need to do this, read everything on it on your own, once you do all the pieces of the puzzle will come together. You got a president now that is looking out for you. Of course not all Muslim's you meet seem bad but if their allegiance is to the Quran get yourself a Quran. I have Muslim friends that never read it. What happens when they are called upon. Just want to be safe, I am sure you don't want to see another terrorist attack ever, same as me. God forbid something happens, the right will be showing in the aftermath all these protesters disrupting what Trump wants to do, and they will look bad, this ain't a contest, it's simply about safety.

Eduardo Ano said the body of the suspected Indonesian, known by his nom de guerre Mohisen, was recovered by troops along with three slain Filipino followers of militant leader Isnilon Hapilon, who was seriously wounded in the hilly outskirts of Butig town in Lanao del Sur province. \n \nHapilon was wounded in the arm and was losing blood after air force warplanes, including South Korean-made FA50 fighter jets, unleashed 500-pound (225-kilogram) bombs Wednesday night and Thursday on a militant encampment in an ongoing offensive, Ano said. It was the first time that the FA50s, which were acquired in late 2015 as the military's only fighter jets, were deployed in a combat mission. \n \nHapilon, who has reportedly been designated to lead an Islamic State group branch in Southeast Asia, was being moved around by his men in a makeshift stretcher but could not escape from Lanao, about 830 kilometers south of Manila, because artillery-backed troops have blocked possible exit points, Ano said. \n \n\"We're making it very difficult for them to move around and survive,\" Ano told The Associated Press by telephone. \n \nThe military will ask Indonesian authorities for help in confirming the identity and background of Mohisen, who was not in the list of foreign militants previously monitored as having joined Filipino militant groups in the south. \n \nHapilon, who is on the U.S. Department of Justice list of most-wanted terrorists worldwide with a reward of up to $5 million for his capture, moved to Butig from his stronghold on southern Basilan island a month ago with about 30 fighters to look for a base for his new militant alliance, Ano said. \n \nIS group commanders apparently wanted Hapilon to set up a base in Lanao, a vast region that offers more security including the presence of other Muslim insurgent groups than his mountain base on Basilan island, so foreign militants can have a springboard to expand their influence in the region, he said. \n \nThe ongoing offensive \"is significant because it will derail their plan to expand the IS presence to mainland Mindanao,\" said Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana, referring to the southern Philippine region, the scene of decadeslong uprisings by minority Muslims. \n \nPresident Rodrigo Duterte has repeatedly warned that the emergence of Islamic State-influenced militant groups is fast looming as a major national security threat. While pursuing peace talks with two large Muslim rebel groups in the predominantly Roman Catholic nation, he has ordered the military to destroy smaller but brutal extremist groups like the Abu Sayyaf, which is dreaded for cross-border kidnappings, beheadings and bombings. \n \nDuterte has asked the two Muslim rebel groups in talks with the government not to help extremists under attack by troops, warning that may bring them in a new conflict with Manila. \n \nThe elusive Hapilon, an Arabic-speaking Islamic preacher known for his expertise on commando assaults, pledged allegiance to the IS group in 2014. \n \nHe then organized an alliance called Dawlatul Islam Wilayatul Mashriq, which is now believed to include at least 10 small militant groups including some Abu Sayyaf factions and the Maute armed group, which he was meeting in Lanao when the military launched the airstrikes using the FA50s and OV-10 bomber planes. \n \nThe Maute and the Ansar Al Khilafah Philippines, another group under Hapilon's nascent alliance, have been linked to a Sept. 2 bombing of a night market that killed 15 people and wounded 69 others in southern Davao city, the president's hometown, and a failed bombing at Manila's popular Rizal Park and the U.S. Embassy last year.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Top Asia-Pacific stories","group":"Top stories"},{"name":"Indonesia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Philippines news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Asia-Pacific latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Southeast Asia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Philippine airstrikes kill suspected Indonesian militant January 29, 2017 MANILA--A suspected Indonesian militant has been killed and one of Southeast","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Eastern Asia","countryCode":"JP","country":"Japan"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"Asahi.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169631930","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2668"},"name":"Asahi.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.asahi.com","publisher":"Asahi Shimbun"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194143144","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:13:27Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

A 120-day suspension for the entire refugee program was also included in the order.\n\nProtesters and lawyers flocked to international airports Saturday as family members waited hours for loved ones to arrive, only to find out they could be deported.\n\nThough the judge\u2019s order keeps the presidential executive order in place, it seemed to offer some hope to people wondering what would immediately happen to loved ones who had already arrived, many of them on flights when the Trump delivered his signature.\n\nAs travelers were released by immigration officials, protesters at the airports cheered.

Smith is mistrustful of what she calls the mainstream media, particularly those elements she believes are biased towards the left. As Kirralie Smith sits at a sidewalk table in Taree for an interview this week, there is a palpable tension. She is mistrustful of what she calls the mainstream media, particularly those elements she believes are biased towards the left. But Smith has agreed to talk because she will, she says, use any platform to express her view that Islam is an ideology of violence, intolerance and sexism.\n\nSmith received relatively little attention during the last federal election as a NSW Senate candidate for the Australian Liberty Alliance, the political offshoot of the Q Society, which describes itself as \"Australia's leading Islam-critical movement\".\n\n(\"Q Society supports an integrated multi-ethnic Australia and rejects racism, which the Oxford dictionary defines as: 'Belief in the superiority of a particular race.' Since Islam is not a race or ethnicity, being critical of Islam is not racist,\" its website explains.)\n\nBut she is likely to receive far more press in the coming weeks as the co-defendant in a defamation action being brought by the businessman Mohammed El-Mouelhy, who was the subject of a critical video produced by the Q Society and presented by Smith.\n\nAlready Smith and the Q Society, also named in the suit, have rallied an impressive line-up of public supporters, including Coalition right-wingers Cory Bernardi, George Christensen and the former MP Ross Cameron, who are among a handful of public figures set to address fundraisers to be held in Sydney and Melbourne on February 9 and 10.\n\nWe sit and both reach for our phones to turn on recording apps. Smith has already explained that she wants her own record of our conversation. The tension dissipates \u2013 a little \u2013 when a sky-blue ute throbs past us and Smith laughs and points out the personalised number plate, \"TRUMP1\". Later she will tell me that she rejects the suggestion she is right wing, rather, she says she a part of the silent majority of mainstream conservatives whose voices are now being heard due to victories of Donald Trump and the Brexit campaign.\n\nSmith says she never intended to pursue politics. She has always been happiest as a wife and mother. \"I love being my husband's wife,\" she says to emphasise the point.\n\nAs it was, a confluence of events brought her to her mission. In 2000 Smith and her husband Greg, a tradesman, sought out volunteer work in Mali and there met the Assemblies of God missionary Faouzi Arzouni, whom she describes as a Muslim apostate who became a friend and mentor.\n\nTwo years later the couple went on another trip, a 10-day visit to refugee camps of the displaced of what is now known as the Maluku sectarian conflict in Indonesia, during which Christian and Muslim communities fell into violent political and ethnic conflict. Smith recalls sitting in refugee camps hearing terrible stories of violence perpetrated by Muslims.\n\nIn 2009 Smith's husband took her to a talk being given by the Q Society's Mark Durie, an Anglican vicar. During that lecture Durie said that his wife would not buy certain supermarket products because they had been certified as halal.\n\nSmith was intrigued and began her own investigations on the internet, learning that many brands are halal-certified, and that a portion of the fees paid for such certification is donated to Muslim charities. In other countries, Smith contends, those charities have directed funds towards groups with terrorist links. Her online investigation became a website, Halal Choices, a campaign and, with the support of Bernardi and Christensen, a parliamentary inquiry into \"third party\" food certification. Finally it became a political ambit, with Smith running for the ALA in a campaign launched by the anti-Islamic immigration Dutch MP Geert Wilders.\n\n\"There is no question of our country being Islamified. Now, this reply constituted a historical error as soon as it was uttered,\" Wilders once told Dutch parliament.\n\n\"I can report that they have had enough of burkas, headscarves, the ritual slaughter of animals, so\u2011called honour revenge, blaring minarets, female circumcision, hymen restoration operations, abuse of homosexuals, Turkish and Arabic on the buses and trains as well as on town hall leaflets, halal meat at grocery shops and department stores, Sharia exams, the Finance Minister's Sharia mortgages, and the enormous over-representation of Muslims in the area of crime, including Moroccan street terrorists,\" Wilders said.\n\nSmith says she does not believe there is an imminent threat of adopting Sharia law, but is concerned about what she calls \"creeping sharia\".\n\n\"We are being encouraged very strongly to tolerate sharia finance, halal certification, the hijab,\" she says.\n\n\"Sharia is definitely present in Australia \u2026 I believe there are honour killings and it is all reported under domestic violence or another name,\" she says. As evidence she says she has close friends who are pastors who work in churches who have provided sanctuary to victims.\n\nBut Smith's concerns are broader than creeping sharia. During the US election she was horrified by Hillary Clinton's support for abortion rights. She opposes political correctness, Safe Schools and big government regulations imposed upon farmers by distant bureaucrats.\n\n\"I pretty much oppose everything the Greens stand for,\" she says.\n\nShe was also appalled by the Liberal Party's abandonment of Tony Abbott for Malcolm Turnbull.\n\nThis broader political outlook, and Smith's articulate direct manner, has led some observers to speculate that she is a potential leader for a new conservative movement, one energised by the international populist surge.\n\nShe is, says John Adams, a former Coalition adviser who has written about the need for more intellectual depth in the new conservative movement, a more capable and charismatic messenger than, say, Pauline Hanson. (\"I think Pauline has a lot of good sentiment, I am not sure about the ability,\" says Smith of Hanson.)\n\nIn the months since the campaign Smith has kept in touch with supporters via videos on her Facebook page. In them she is relentlessly bright and articulate, upbeat about Christmas and Australia Day, though scandalised by the recent billboard that showed a pair of little girls celebrating in a hijab and cheerily opposed to the \"threat\" of multiculturalism.

Bartlesville went ahead, 4-2, on two free throws by Richter, but Jenks later regained the lead, 7-6, on a free throw by Church. \n \nTwo more Richter free throws \u2014 with 2:14 remaining in the first quarter \u2014 flip-flopped the lead in favor of Bartlesville, 8-7. \n \nShoemaker shoehorned in a three-pointer, with about a minute remaining in the period, to power Bartlesville to an 11-7 advantage \u2014 which is where the score would remain at the end of the quarter. \n \nShortly before Shoemaker\u2019s trey, Williams took a charge under the Jenks basket to prevent the Lady Trojans (5-11, 3-5) from regaining the lead. \n \nJenks burst back \u2014 on a 6-2 run \u2014 early in the second period to forge the game\u2019s third tie, 13-13. \n \nBoth offenses then stalled for several minutes, with Bartlesville missing on two three-point attempts on the same possession \u2014 thanks to an offensive rebound by Trinity Parker \u2014 and Jenks failing to find the bottom of the net. \n \nBut, the Lady Bruins finally broke the tie when Richter nailed 1-of-2 free throws with 2:27 remaining until halftime, 14-13. \n \nHowever, Jenks\u2019 Church then had a three-point prayer answered and the Lady Trojans went ahead, 16-14. \n \nBut, Bartlesville\u2019s scoring hiatus then ended. \n \nBartlesville surged on a 10-0 run \u2014 in the final 1:02 of the half \u2014 to take an eight-point lead into the break, 24-16. \n \nShoemaker fueled the rally by canning a three-pointer, while Parker made a stick-back on a missed transition layup. \n \nWhen Bartlesville \u2014 which is coached by Krista Binam \u2014 opened the second half with an 8-0 run, it was beddy-bye time for Jenks. \n \nRichter started the third quarter scoring on a layup \u2014 set up by Shoemaker\u2019s zip pass. \n \nShoemaker then stuck in two three-pointers to extend the Lady Bruin lead to 32-16. \n \nJenks trailed the rest of the way by double-figures. \n \nBartlesville reached the 40-point mark on two free throws by Emily Hicks \u2014 with 1:08 left in the third quarter \u2014 to put the Lady Bruins up by 15, 40-25. \n \nBartlesville took a 12-point lead into the final period, 42-30. \n \nWilliams\u2019 three-pointer at the opening of the fourth quarter widened the gap back to 15, 45-30. \n \nBartlesville achieved the 50-point plateau \u2014 for the ninth-time this season \u2014 on Williams\u2019 driving layup from the right wing. That stretched Bartlesville\u2019s lead to 16 points, 50-34. \n \nBartlesville closed out its scoring on three-pointers by Allen and Shoemaker. \n \nThe Lady Bruins recorded nine treys in the game. \n \nNext up, Bartlesville will play host Tuesday to Broken Arrow (10-7, 5-3) and Friday to Tulsa Union (9-7, 4-3). \n \nBartlesville 56, Jenks 44 \n \nJenks 7-9-14-14\u201444 \n \nBartlesville 11-13-18-14\u201456 \n \nJenks \n \nMakenley Church 5 3-4 15,Makenna Burch 3 1-2 8, Rylie Watson 4 0-0 8, Tatiana Gilford 5 1-2 11, Emma Wasson 1 0-0 2.

Still, when they hosted Memphis on Saturday, the game meant more than a January contest should have. \n \nFirst, the Jazz have had all kinds of trouble with Memphis. Second, it\u2019s time to move forward, right? \n \nIn hindsight, just qualifying for the postseason is leaving the bar low. Already they\u2019ve practically reached their objective. It\u2019s what comes afterward that they should now be targeting. The best way to ensure they do more than show up in April is to practice beating good teams. Their most recent chance came in a 102-95 loss to the Grizzlies. \n \nEvery win counts the same in the standings, but in the heads and hearts department it\u2019s a different deal. Beating a team in the regular season is an indication you can beat it in the postseason. \n \nIf the Jazz want to be a serious playoff team, they should act like it. \n \n\u201cGames can be more impactful toward the end of the year,\u201d coach Quin Snyder said. \u201cIt\u2019s not something we\u2019ll put a flag on, or a line in the sand, but all the players are aware of that kind of thing.\u201d \n \nYou wouldn\u2019t know it from Saturday\u2019s showing. \n \n\u201cWe were not a good defensive team,\u201d Snyder said. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to play like that, we\u2019re not going to win many games.\u201d \n \nAs successful as the Jazz have been this year \u2014 a half-game out of fourth place in the conference \u2014 there have been caution signs throughout. For instance, the one that says \u201cROAD WORK AHEAD.\u201d And the ones that say \u201cDETOUR\u201d or \u201cNOT A THROUGH STREET.\u201d But the most serious consideration is the one that says \u201cDEAD END.\u201d \n \nMemphis isn\u2019t going to rule the world, but it\u2019s a team that beat the Jazz three out of four meetings this year. \n  \n\u201cNeedless to say, (the Grizzlies) were terrific,\u201d Snyder said. \n \nMemphis is two games behind Utah in the standings. \n \nThe Jazz are having their best year since 2009-10, regardless. But there\u2019s still that road work to do. Playing well is becoming routine, but succeeding against high-end teams isn\u2019t. Of their 30 wins, just seven have been against teams with winning records. \n \nIn short, they\u2019re beating the teams they should, but only occasionally moving the meter against the top. \n \nIf you want to hang with the beautiful people, you have to put on your bow tie. That\u2019s exactly what the coaching staff did, in honor of recently deceased NBA lawyer Michael Goldberg. Snyder arrived in the postgame interview room with his tie \u2014 and his team \u2014 slightly undone. \n \nIt was with considerable anticipation the Jazz took the court to show off newly minted All-Star Gordon Hayward. But he made just 4 of 13 shots. In a short time the Jazz have gone from cute to intriguing to respected. However, back-to-back losses to Oklahoma City and Denver, as well as another loss to Memphis, served as a good reminder they aren\u2019t yet safely parked. They have defeated San Antonio, Cleveland, Houston and Atlanta, but lost to Golden State (twice), Toronto (twice) and Boston. Ahead are games with the Clippers, Houston, Atlanta, Cleveland, San Antonio, Boston and Golden State. \n \nFifteen of their final 34 games are against plus-500 teams. \n \nOn Saturday they trailed by as many as 12, as Derrick Favors sat out on a \u201crest\u201d night. \n \nYou could hear Karl Malone grinding his teeth in Louisiana. \n Comment on this story  \nRodney Hood\u2019s 3-point heave at the end of the third quarter crazily banked in, cutting the Memphis lead to 80-74. They had it down to three with 5:20 left in the game. But Marc Gasol\u2019s shooting overshadowed anything the Jazz did. \n \nOn Beale Street in Memphis, they struck up the music. \n \nSo on go the Jazz, looking good for the playoffs but iffy to advance. They\u2019ve hit some bumps in the road. \n \nDriving like you mean it is a learned trait.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Brad Rock"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Brad Rock: Jazz need to take it from the top","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Salt Lake","zipCode":"84110","state":"Utah","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Salt Lake City","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Deseret Morning News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169663405","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4002"},"name":"Deseret Morning News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.deseretnews.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194151917","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:55:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:13:31Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://cdn.deseretnews.com/images/headline/queue2/865672123/865672123.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Archambo to trounce the visiting Jenks High School Trojans, 56-45, in a Frontier Valley Conference showdown. \n \nArchambo \u2014 who had to be helped off court, suffered an apparent bad ankle sprain, Bruin head coach Clent Stewart said after the game. \n \nEven with Archambo \u2014 who has played virtually every minute this season \u2014 banished from action, the Bruins didn\u2019t get upset. \n \nThey got reset. \n \nIn the quarter-and-a-half following Archambo\u2019s mishap \u2014 which occurred when he was knocked down while trying to cash in on a fast break bucket \u2014 the Bruins outscored Jenks, 23-17, and led by 10 at halftime, 27-17. \n \nBarron Tanner \u2014 with whom Archambo has formed a Dynamite Duo the past two seasons \u2014 picked up much of the slack. Tanner scored 19 points the final three quarters \u2014 including burying 11-of-13 free throws. \n \nWhen Archambo left the game, Tanner went to an extra gear of aggression, Stewart said. \n \n\u201cI\u2019ve told Barron, \u2018When you make up your mind to be aggressive, there\u2019s no one in the conference who can stop you,\u2019\u201d Stewart continued. \n \nStewart praised the play off all the Bruins who stepped up to nail down the team\u2019s ninth season win. \n \nJunior guard Andrew Gronigan contributed 13 points \u2014 including two back-breaking three-pointers in the third period. His backcourt mate Jake Bilger chipped in with one trey and six points. \n \nJenks (3-11, 1-7) came into the game on the momentum of a two-game winning streak, while the Bruins (9-7, 4-3) looked to regroup from a loss Tuesday at Muskogee. \n \nThe backdrop was the former Bruin Fieldhouse \u2014 now known as the Phillips Fieldhouse \u2014 in which Jenks and the Bruins had staged some monumental battles prior to Bartlesville\u2019s move, in 2005, to its current facility. \n \nFriday\u2019s encounter was officially known as the Throwback Game \u2014 a once-a-year event on the Bartlesville basketball schedule. \n \nThe Bruins went to work early. \n \nOn their first possession, Bilger lofted a lob pass to the low post while Archambo made a backdoor cut, jumped up like a high-speed elevator and dropped the ball through the net. \n \nAfter Jenks failed to answer, the Bruins went ahead 4-0 on a 16-foot baseline \u2018J\u2019 by Tanner, off a feed from Tayo Dina. \n \nJenks recorded two more empty possessions. As the quarter neared the halfway point, Jenks turned the ball over and Archambo took off for a transition layup. \n \nBut, he collided in midair with a Jenks defender, landed and went to the ground \u2014 and, in obvious pain \u2014 landed on his right side. \n \nLongtime Bartlesville trainer Alan Mount focused on Archambo\u2019s lower left leg, particularly around the foot and ankle area. \n \nAfter a few minutes, Archambo got to his feet and two people \u2014 one under each arm \u2014 helped him walk out the front end of the gym, with 4:11 left in the first quarter. \n \nAfter the game, he would leave on crutches. \n \nWithin 70 seconds of Archambo\u2019s exit from the game, the Bruins threw in four more points \u2014 a reverse layup on baseline drive by Tanner and two free throws by Gronigan \u2014 to stretch their lead to 8-0. \n \nJenks then went on a 4-0 spurt \u2014 a free throw by Cole Surrett and a three-pointer by Anania Carson \u2014 to cut Bartlesville\u2019s score in half. \n \nThe Bruins finished out the quarter with two more Gronigan charity tosses and a layup by Dina \u2014 off a back cut and pass from Tanner \u2014 to carry a 12-4 advantage into the second period. \n \nThe tough times for Jenks continued when Bruin guard Matt Simpson dialed in a layup \u2014 on another one of those back-cut-and-feed plays \u2014 to open the second period scoring. \n \nThe Bruins then built a 16-4 lead. \n \nTo their credit, the Trojans then made a stand \u2014 despite the roaring noise from the Bruin student section, not to mention the homecrowd squeezed together on the bleachers. \n \nJenks whittled the margin back to four points, 20-16, just past the halfway point of the second quarter. \n \nBut, Bilger jump-started the Bruins again when he flushed a three-pointer \u2014 with Tanner spooning him an assist from the high post \u2014 to widen the gap back to seven points, 23-16. \n \nBartlesville bumped its lead back to 10 points, 27-17, going into halftime. \n \nJenks made several rally rumblings in the second half. But, the Bruins repelled every comeback. \n \nAbout 4:30 into the third quarter, Jenks trailed by just four points, 29-25, after a running hook by Surrett. \n \nMoments later, Gronigan sank a three-pointer. He also canned another trey in the closing seconds of the period to elevate the Bruins to an eight-point lead, 37-29. \n \nBy the start of the fourth period, Jenks had ran out of gas \u2014 or bullets. \n \nForty-seven seconds into the quarter, Tanner scored a conventional three-point play to push the Bruins back to a double-digit lead, 40-29. \n \nJenks never pulled closer than eight points the rest of the evening. \n \nThe Bruins led late by 16, 54-38, but Jenks scored a flurry of points in the final minute. \n \nNext up, the Bruins will be home two times this week \u2014 on Tuesday and Friday. \n \nBartlesville 56, Jenks 45 \n \nJenks 4-13-12-16\u201445 \n \nBartlesville 12-15-10-19\u201456 \n \nJenks \n \nA.

Cobb nailed three three-pointers. \n \nBoys: Bartlesville jayvee 48, Jenks 45 \n \nJaylin Oliver and Caleb Colbert each stuffed the nets with 17 points to pace the Bartlesville Bruins to a thrilling three-point win Friday at the Phillips Fieldhouse. \n \nBartlesville squandered a 10-point lead \u2014 from early in the fourth quarter \u2014 to watch Jenks tie the game, 42-42. \n \nThe Bruins went back up by three, 45-42, on one free throw by Colbert and two by Olivier. \n \nAfter Jenks pulled even again, 45-45, Colbert knocked down a 17-footer to elevate Bartlesville back into the lead. \n \nShane Simpson \u2014 who finished with 10 points \u2014 added an insurance free throw in the final 15 seconds. \n \nElijah Baker and Abhi Ayyappan each contributed two points in the game. \n \nBartlesville had led at the half, 26-20, and had owned a 10-point advantage, 42-32, early in the fourth period. \n \nBut, Jenks went on a 10-0 run and the Bruins needed some late heroics to save the win. \n \nGirls: Liberty Christian 49, WCS 42 \n \nThe WCS Mustangs finished just shy of a season sweep of Liberty Christian. \n \nTwo weeks ago, the Mustangs produced a last-second shot to win the first meeting. \n \nBut, Liberty Christian came on strong in the final minutes Friday in the rematch. \n \n\u201cIt kind of became a foul-fest in the fourth quarter,\u201d WCS head coach Rocky Clark said. \n \nLiberty Christian scored 13 of its 19 fourth-quarter points from the charity stripe. Three Lady Mustangs fouled out. \n \nTaylor Dickinson and Meghan Clark scored 13 apiece for the Lady Mustangs, followed by Camryn Clark. \n \nBoys: Kiefer 47, Caney Valley 40 \n \nThe Caney Valley Trojans competed close the entire time against Kiefer, but just didn\u2019t quite have the juice on the offensive side to flip-flop the result. \n \n\u201cOur defense was good, our rebounding was pretty good,\u201d said Caney Valley coach \u2018Tug\u2019 Brinker. \u201cWe had some turnovers and we missed some putbacks.\u201d \n \nErick McLaughlin and Christian Ballew poured in 11 and nine points, respectively, to lead Caney Valley. \n \nBrinker is pleased freshmen Cheyton Shepherd, Gunner Hawkins and Eli Lucas are getting some good playing minutes. \n \nCaney Valley \n \nErick McLaughlin 11, Christian Ballew 9, Cooper Eden 7, Cheyton Shepherd 3. \n \nBoys: Kansas 54, Dewey 44 \n \nWith only one player in double-figure scoring (Drew Miller, 23), the Dewey Doggers just didn\u2019t generate enough firepower to pull past the Kansas Comets. \n \nDown by as many as 17 points, Dewey whittled the margin all the way down to three points, late in the fourth period \u2014 but ran out of time. \n \nAlfredo Lopez added eight points for Dewey, followed by Colton Thornton, five; Blayz Rippy and Caston Frye, three points each; and Kameron Hays, two. \n \nBoys: Copan 69, South Coffeyville 61 \n \nCopan Hornets zipped to their 11th win \u2014 surpassing last season\u2019s total of 10 \u2014 thanks to a dominating second quarter, in which they outscored South Coffeyville, 20-4. \n \nKirk Foreman snapped the cords for 31 points \u2014 including 16 (13 free throws, one trey) in the fourth period. Dylan Williams and Cole Raemhild added 17 and 12 points, respectively, for the Hornets (11-7). \n \n\u201cI though Joe Phelan and Garrick Askew did a good job on their big man,\u201d added Copan coach Kevin Foreman. \u201cThey held him to nine points.\u201d \n \nCopan 69, South Coffeyville 61 \n \nS.

Bullpups past Neodesha (Kan.), by 10 points, in a crucial matchup, in Neodesha. \n \nTrevor Watson contributed four points \u2014 but he scored them on all on free throws in the final period. \n \nCamdyn Melchiori chipped in with nine points for game, followed by Grant Richey with eight. \n \nNeodesha surged to a 23-20 halftime lead but then watched Caney Valley scorch the cords for 40 points in the second half. \n \n\u201cTonight was intense,\u201d said Caney Valley head coach Josh Wolfe. \n \nDuring last week\u2019s Wilson County Tournament, Neodesha had knocked off the Pups, 79-78, behind the massive scoring (39 points) of O\u2019Neill. \n \nIn Friday\u2019s rematch, O\u2019Neill piled up 15 points by halftime. \n \n\u201cI challenged our kids to stop him. \u201c \n \nO\u2019Neill tallied just one point in the second half. \n \nThe key was defensive rebounding, which shut down Neodesha\u2019s second-chance scoring and created some fast break opportunities for Caney Valley, Wolfe added. \n \nRichey scored six points in the third quarter to help trigger the Pup rally. \n \nBaylor Melchiori is just 35 points away from becoming the career leading scorer in Caney Valley Pup history, Wolfe added. \n \nCaney Valley 60, Neodesha 50 \n \nCaney Valley 12-8-20-20 \u201460 \n \nNeodesha 9-14-15-12\u201450 \n \nCaney Valley \n \nBaylor Melchiori 27, Camdyn Melchiori 9, Ty Messner 5, Preston Kastning 2, Trevor Watson 4, Grant Richey 8, Andrew Anderson 2, Saje Cowell 3. \n \nBoys: Barnsdall 98, Shidler 34 \n \nNot one, but two 20-point scorers graced the Barnsdall Panthers\u2019 scoresheet in this 64-point rout. \n \nChristian Warford and Derek Wilson netted 29 and 20 points, respectively, to pace the Panthers, who bolted to a 33-4 first quarter lead and never looked back. \n \n\u201cThe boys came out firing on all cylinders and played our most complete game of the season,\u201d said Barnsdall coach Clifton Warford, who noted his squad amassed 22 assists and 16 three-pointers. \n \nAll 12 Panthers scored. \n \nAlso scoring in double figures were Heath Moles, 14 points, and Michael Marin, 10. \n \nChristian Warford and Wilson each shot five-of-seven from behind the three-point arc. \n \nChristian Warford distributed a team-high eight assists while Moles contributed seven boards and three blocks. \n \nBarnsdall 98, Shidler 34 \n \nBarnsdall 33-23-19-23\u201498 \n \nShidler 4-6-13-11\u201434 \n \nBarnsdall \n \nChristian Warford 29 Derek Wilson 20, Heath Moles 14, Michael Marin 10, Alex Gaines 5, Elijah Gott 4, Perrier 4, Braden Kelley 3, Beau Smith 3, Paul Schmidt 2, Ely Reese 2, Dylan Wilson 2.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Mike Tupa mtupa@examiner-enterprise.com"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Lady Pups knock off Neodesha; Mustangs cruise","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Washington","zipCode":"74006","state":"Oklahoma","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Bartlesville","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Examiner Enterprise","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169736515","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Examiner Enterprise","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.examiner-enterprise.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194154160","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:13:30Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Buddy's award was presented by NSW Deputy Premier and local member John Barilaro.\n\nOne hundred and twenty seven dogs turned up for the inaugural event in 2016.\n\nBungendore Show, which was first held in the 1840s, has gone from strength to strength in recent decades, this year's showgirl, Hanna Darmody, 22, said.\n\nMs Darmody, whose family own a Bungendore butchery, said she could recall helping with the catering at the show as a toddler almost 20 years ago.\n\n\"I've seen the event grow as the town has grown,\" she said. \"It is a great bridge between country and city; the showgirl competition is a good way to get young people involved and promotes opportunities in agriculture.\"\n\nShow organisers said this year's event, which enjoyed the best weather conditions in three years, was an unqualified success with more than 2000 people passing through the gates before lunch.\n\nIn addition to the usual attractions in the show ring and the pavilions and the dachshund dash, the 2017 event offered visitors a chance to get a close look at the Anzac Centennial 18 pounder gun.\n\nThe World War I-era weapon, which also saw service during World War II,was restored by the Royal Australian Artillery Company in conjunction with veteran coach builder Jim Frecklington.

In the first he set the fourth fastest time before a mistake in the second saw him only thirteenth. From that point on he said, the weekend was \u201call downhill.\u201d \n\nA great start in the opening race saw Leitch into second place behind his team mate Thomas Randle of Australia but both Victory Motor Racing drivers were caught out at turn two of the race as they slid wide on a part of the track that was breaking up. Several others were caught out at the same spot, causing the race to be restarted, Leitch eventually finishing twelfth. \n\nThat result saw Leitch down the grid for Sunday morning\u2019s contest. He caught the group ahead but was unable to make up positions, eventually crossing the line sixteenth. The feature event of the weekend was the prestigious NZ Motor Cup race over 20 laps on Sunday afternoon. From thirteenth on the grid Leitch had hustled the ITM FT-50 to tenth but later he dropped a wheel off the racing line and picked up some asphalt on the tyres of the car which meant he locked up under brakes, hitting the car of American Kory Enders. Leitch pitted to have a new front wing fitted losing several laps. He eventually resumed in an attempt to secure as many points as possible. \n\nThe results have dropped Leitch to tenth in the series. The three race winners for the round were Marcus Armstrong of Christchurch, Enaam Ahmed of England and Thomas Randle in the feature. \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never had a weekend like that before,\u201d said Leitch on Sunday evening. \u201dWe had good car speed early in the weekend. My team mate Thomas Randle is going really quick and is pushing me along too. The track was breaking up in race one and I got caught out on the marbles. In race two I was down the grid and while the ITM FT-50 was fast and I caught the group in front you can\u2019t pass easily here. People were driving defensively and making it tough. In the third race we picked up a bit of asphalt on the tyre and hit Kory. You just have to take this stuff on the chin and not get down about it. The goal at the last two rounds is to do a good qualifying, keep performing and hopefully pick up some race wins.\u201d \n\nThe series moves to Taupo next weekend. \n\nTo contact Brendon Leitch - 027 207 2228 \nLindsay Beer \n021 351 499","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"LEITCH TAKES TOUGH ROUND ON THE CHIN","source":{"category":"Organisation","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"NZ","country":"New Zealand"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"MotorSport NZ","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"171987994","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"MotorSport NZ","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["MotorRacing","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.motorsport.org.nz"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194160211","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:13:32Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It's scandalous and another deal that is counter to the public interest.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the troubled relationship between the NSW attorney-general and minister for police has been addressed, with Ms Berejiklian confirming a reshaping of the much maligned \"justice cluster\".\n\nThe arrangement, whereby as justice and police minister Mr Grant held a more senior position than then attorney-general Gabrielle Upton, was heavily criticised by the legal profession.\n\nThe NSW Bar Association said it provided Mr Grant \"with unprecedented power in determining legal policy without the historical checks and balances\".\n\nThe NSW Law Society warned the arrangement meant police were \"ostensibly responsible for criminal law policy, while at the same time, the traditional roles of the attorney-general as first law officer of the state, which includes preserving civil liberties, are being eroded\".\n\nMs Berejiklian has confirmed the cluster has been reworked so that new attorney-general Mark Speakman, SC, is the lead minister.

The American golfer\u2019s next stop? Dubai.\n\nComeback kid \n\nWoods, a 14-time major champion, was looking forward to his return to Torrey Pines, a venue in which he had won on eight times previously. But an opening-day 76 left him on four-over par and struggling to make the cut, before Friday\u2019s second-round 72 meant he missed out on the weekend by four strokes. Finally fully recovered from back surgery, he tees it up this week at the Omega Dubai Desert Classic.\n\nClassic credentials \n\nWoods, 41, has a very favourable record at the Dubai event, winning in 2006 and 2008. In fact, in his seven appearances, he has also finished runner-up, tied third and tied fifth, although he did struggle on his last visit to Emirates Golf Club, coming home tied 41st in 2014. On how his body would hold up with the 17-hour flight to Dubai, Woods said: \"Flying out here was something I hadn\u2019t done in a while. So now we\u2019ve got a pretty good jaunt.\"\n\nComfort factor \n\nOn whether his familiarity with the Dubai tournament gives him some reassurance, Woods said: \"I know the golf course, I know the greens, I know the putts, I know how it\u2019s going to play. And I\u2019ve played it under so many different conditions over the years, whether we\u2019ve had a lot of rough, no rough. We\u2019ve had shamals, no shamals.

A four-time winner at Augusta, he was generally pleased with his progress at Torrey Pines, saying: \"I felt I made some nice strides, just wish I could be playing the weekend because I really love this course. I need to get more rounds under my belt. Just like everybody, I\u2019m trying to get ready for that first week in April.\"\n\njmcauley@thenational.ae","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: golf news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Tiger Woods heads for Omega Dubai Desert Classic after missed cut at Torrey Pines","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Western Asia","countryCode":"AE","country":"United Arab Emirates"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"UAE NewsApp.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"548625643","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"UAE NewsApp.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Sports"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://uaenewsapp.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194160904","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:13:32Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The Victory Team has given me a great car. Now we\u2019ll have to see what we can do at Taupo.\u201d \n  \nRandle had to cope with the pressure of two safety car periods, the second when series leader Richard Verschoor clipped the back of Marcus Armstrong\u2019s car. The Christchurch driver was forced out with damaged rear suspension, while the Dutch teenager restarted 18th from the pit lane after changing a damaged front wing. \n  \nHe fought his way back to 12th place, but was penalized 30 seconds for the collision with Armstrong, which put him back in 16th place. Verschoor still leads the series, although Randle\u2019s victory means the margin has been reduced from 80 to 23 points. \n  \nAustrian Ferdinand Habsburg turned in his best drive of the series to finish second after starting seventh, while Jehan Daruvala (India) claimed third after Pedro Piquet had a brief off track excursion and lost two places on the last lap. \n  \nThe best Kiwi was Taylor Cockerton (Pukekohe) who finished seventh after starting tenth, while Brendon Leitch (Invercargill) had a weekend to forget from 13th on the grid, tangling with American Kory Enders and being forced to change the front wing to finish 18th. \n  \nFor further information please contact: \nJohn Coker, Castrol Toyota Racing Series Public Relations, \nPhone (021) 537 250 or email john@wrightcommunications.co.nz \n  \nVisit us: \nhttp://www.toyota.co.nz/racing/ \n  \nFollow us: \nFacebook /ToyotaRacingNZ \nTwitter   @ToyotaRacingNZ \nYouTube /ToyotaRacingSeries","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"RANDLE DELIVERS ON PROMISE IN TOYOTA RACING SERIES","source":{"category":"Organisation","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"NZ","country":"New Zealand"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"MotorSport NZ","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"171987994","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"MotorSport NZ","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["MotorRacing","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.motorsport.org.nz"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.toyota.co.nz/racing/"],"sequenceId":"695194161089","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:13:33Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The November 2014 direction was passed on a plea by Dhoni and Rhiti Sports, alleging that Maxx Mobilink had not paid dues worth crores of rupees which was agreed upon for using the cricketer's name on their products.\n\nDhoni's counsel had said the endorsement agreement between him and the company had expired in December 2012 but Maxx was still using his name to sell its products and not paying him the dues.\n\nThe cricketer, in his contempt plea, has also sought a direction to seize all the products/mobile handsets and such other articles where his name and image is being used to sell and promote these products.\n\n(With inputs from PTI)","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"NDTV Sports"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"MS Dhoni Alleges Misuse of Name by Mobile Com...","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Western Asia","countryCode":"AE","country":"United Arab Emirates"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Dotemirates.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"609646081","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Dotemirates.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Sports"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.dotemirates.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/players/700-ms-dhoni-playerprofile","https://sports.ndtv.com/india-vs-england-2016-17/india-vs-england-2nd-odi-ms-dhoni-hits-classy-century-in-rescue-act-1650563"],"sequenceId":"695194166909","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:10:32Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:13:34Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://dotemirates.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/2017/01/e3547c9b1ca5ca47c8d04f159f509638.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

It is not disputed by her that the man had a living spouse on June 2, 1990 and she expired on May 11, 1994. \n \n\u201cUnder Hindu Law, marriage is a \u2018sacrament\u2019 (solemn pledge) and not a contract which can be entered into by execution of a marriage deed.

Hopefully the others will get back out tomorrow.\" \n\nAfter swapping the lead several times during the ten lap race it was James Hagan who prevailed, though the margin at the chequered flag was just 0.325 of a second. \n\n\"I had  a brilliant time,\" he said. \"I love it here, the people are so friendly and they can\u2019t do enough for you.\" \n\nTomorrow brings two more races apiece for both F5000 and F1 groups ahead of the combined 14-lap Race of Champions Revival feature timed to start at 4.19pm. \n\nThe 2016/17 SAS Autoparts MSC NZ  F5000 Tasman Cup Revival Series is organised and run with the support of sponsors SAS Autoparts, MSC, NZ Express Transport, Bonney's Specialised Bulk Transport, Mobil Lubricants, Pacifica, Avon Tyres, Webdesign and Exide Batteries. \n\nwww.F5000.co.nz   \nFor more information about the 2016/2017 SAS Autoparts MSC NZ F5000 Tasman Cup Revival Series contact Ross MacKay on 021 677 919 or via e-mail on ross@fastcompany.co.nz","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"LAP TIMES TELL STORY AS SMITH AND LYONS SQUARE OFF","source":{"category":"Organisation","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"NZ","country":"New Zealand"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"MotorSport NZ","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"171987994","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"MotorSport NZ","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["MotorRacing","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.motorsport.org.nz"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.F5000.co.nz/"],"sequenceId":"695194176295","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:13:39Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Then, the friend asked, \u201cWill he come when you call?\u201d Collier told the guy that he couldn\u2019t call the dog because he didn\u2019t know its name. But he suddenly realized that \u201cwill he\u201d sounded a lot like \u201cWillie\u201d \u2013 and since they were in the birthplace of the Texas outlaw country music revolution, that seemed like a pretty good name. Collier called and Willie came running, and it has been a great partnership ever since.\n\nWillie is starting to get up in years, and long gone are the days when he\u2019d burst out of the blind like a raging bull, pacing impatiently for the tell-tale splash of a duck on the pond. \u201cThese days, he\u2019s much more content curling up at my feet and occasionally raising his head skyward to survey the horizon,\u201d said Collier.\n\nGordon and Willie made a half dozen hunting trips to the pond this season, each time hoping the ducks would arrive en masse like they used to, but apparently, Collier says, they have found a more peaceful body of water to call home. \u201cBut for us, hunting isn\u2019t just about the harvest. It\u2019s about quality time together basking in God\u2019s great creations,\u201d he said.\n\nFriday morning, they had barely settled into the blind when the first flight of ducks dropped into the decoys. \u201cI was as surprised to see them as they were to see me,\u201d said Collier. As they lifted off, he dropped two of them, and Willie was in for a long retrieve.\n\n\u201cI opened the door to the blind and Willie didn\u2019t hesitate to hit the icy water,\u201d he said. \u201cAs if I had done a tremendous job training him, he went after the longest retrieve first. He ignored the other downed duck as he swam by with a mouthful of another.\u201d\n\nCollier says that when Willie was younger, he\u2019d prance around with his bounty, and only reluctantly give it up after a few harsh words, but this time, he dropped the bird into the waiting hand and waited for the command to fetch the other.\n\nAfter some more success, both shooting and retrieving, the fog cleared and Collier decided to pack up and head back \u2013 but not before stopping off at another pond for some relaxing under a tree with his hunting buddy. The once freight train-like dog was content to sit next to Collier, occasionally resting his head on the man\u2019s shoulder. Like a bottle of homemade wine, Willie has mellowed with age.\n\nA while later, Collier decided to blow his call one last time. \u201cThe reeds were frozen,\u201d he said, \u201cso I had to blow extra hard.\u201d Karooonk! The call sounded more like a heron than a mallard, Collier said, and even Willie seemed amused by it. Then they spotted four big ducks coming in on a landing path that would\u2019ve put them right in front of the hunters. \u201cAfter hearing that obnoxious call, they seemed to pivot in mid-air before soaring away,\u201d said Collier.\n\nEven though this year\u2019s duck hunts were less productive than usual, Collier did manage to have a legendary day this season \u2013 on a special hunt when he got engaged to be married to his friend and now fiancée, Bonnie.\n\nCongratulations, Gordon, Bonnie and Willie and the boys (Gordon\u2019s sons). Have a good off-season.\n\nwww.centexoutdoors.com\n\n717-89","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"TODD NAFE, Outdoors"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Outdoors: Hunting with man\u2019s best friend","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Mclennan","zipCode":"76701","state":"Texas","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Waco","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Waco Tribune Herald","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169696278","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1899"},"name":"Waco Tribune Herald","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wacotrib.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.centexoutdoors.com/"],"sequenceId":"695194177352","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:13:43Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/wacotrib.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/c/d1/cd124ccd-b2c1-5900-ae17-1af401bd41b3/588d558c952b5.image.jpg?resize=300%2C400"},{"url":"http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/wacotrib.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/c/d1/cd124ccd-b2c1-5900-ae17-1af401bd41b3/588d558c952b5.image.jpg?resize=473%2C630"}],"video":[]}}

It\u2019s not something to hide ... you can be role model for a lot of kids here that have diabetes. They see this kid playing at a high level and dealing with it.\u201d\n\nIn order to keep her diabetes in check, Cox has to prick her finger to check her blood sugar six to 10 times per day, has an infusion site on her body for an insulin pump that has to be changed every other day and wears a glucose monitor that has to be changed every other week \u2014 and has actually come off during a game before.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s super hard, and it\u2019s an every single day responsibility you have to stay on top of,\u201d Cox said. \u201cSunday is really important to me to just show kids they can do whatever they want, regardless of the disease.\u201d\n\nBaylor\u2019s medical and training staff can monitor Cox\u2019s blood-sugar levels \u2014 to a point \u2014 and Brenda Cox\u2019s question to Mulkey during the recruiting process was put to an early test when the Lady Bears traveled to Tennessee on Dec. 4.\n\nIn pregame, Mulkey was informed that Cox\u2019s levels were dangerously high after her monitor wasn\u2019t attached until the morning of the game and the readings didn\u2019t come in until right before the scheduled 1 p.m. start.\n\n\u201cI said \u2018She\u2019s not gonna play until it goes down,\u2019 and it was because the night before she didn\u2019t have something attached she was supposed to,\u201d Mulkey said. \u201cIn high school and during her entire life, her parents have taught her to do it herself and she has done that ... but now I\u2019m responsible for these kids and their health.\u201d\n\nCox\u2019s response to Mulkey\u2019s decision wasn\u2019t much different from how she plays \u2014 fierce.\n\n\u201cShe had a meltdown,\u201d Mulkey said.\n\n\u201cYep, meltdown,\u201d senior forward Nina Davis said.\n\n\u201cIt made me really emotional,\u201d Cox said.\n\nCox eventually got in that game \u2014 once her blood-sugar levels went down \u2014 and seems to get better every time she steps on the court. She\u2019s coming off her first career double-double with 19 points and 10 rebounds in Wednesday\u2019s 91-49 win at No. 25 Kansas State, and now she\u2019ll be counted on even more with sophomore forward Beatrice Mompremier nursing a sprained ankle.\n\nAnd maybe, through her play, Cox can eventually tap into something bigger than the game itself.\n\n\u201cI want kids (with diabetes) to know they can do whatever they want,\u201d Cox said. \u201cSome doctors will tell them \u2018Oh, you just have to watch what you do,\u2019 but I want them to know they can do whatever they want, regardless of if they have Type 1 diabetes.\u201d\n\n-----\n\nNo. 2 Baylor vs. No. 20 Oklahoma\n\nWhen: 5:30 p.m. Sunday\n\nWhere: Ferrell Center\n\nRecords: OU 16-5, 7-2; BU 20-1, 9-0\n\nTV: ESPN2 (find channel: wacotrib.com/tv)\n\nRadio: 166","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"TONY ADAME"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Baylor freshman forward Lauren Cox\u2019s battles go beyond the court","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Mclennan","zipCode":"76701","state":"Texas","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Waco","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Waco Tribune Herald","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169696278","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1899"},"name":"Waco Tribune Herald","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wacotrib.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194177534","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:13:44Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/wacotrib.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/18/118a7baf-b822-5c0c-894e-310fffb33ca5/588d58c62ccda.image.jpg?resize=850%2C630"}],"video":[]}}

One of the most versatile players of his era, Metcalf was a dynamic receiver coming out of the backfield and ranked among the best kick returners in the NFL.\n\nWhen people saw Eric play for the Texas Longhorns and seven NFL teams, it was evident where he got his genes.\n\n\u201cI wanted to be just like my dad, and fortunately my dad happened to be an NFL player,\u201d Eric said. \u201cEven at Texas, it was a tall order because people had seen him play for the Cardinals. But the only pressure I felt was from myself. Fortunately, I was pretty good at it.\u201d\n\nEric didn\u2019t just crawl out of his father\u2019s shadow, he carved out his own legacy.\n\nMetcalf developed into a three-time all-Southwest Conference running back for the Longhorns and was named All-American and the conference\u2019s player of the year in 1987. He became a first-round draft pick in 1989 and played six seasons for the Cleveland Browns before going on to play for Atlanta, San Diego, Arizona, Carolina, Washington and Green Bay in a 13-year career.\n\nOn Feb. 21, Metcalf will be inducted into the Texas Sports Hall of Fame. While most people remember Metcalf for his football accomplishments, he was also an NCAA championship long jumper for the Longhorns.\n\n\u201cI had talked to Earl Campbell about it a few times and hoped one day I could be included in that group,\u201d Metcalf said. \u201cA lot of athletes from Texas in all sports have done major things throughout the country and the world, and to be included in that group excites me.\u201d\n\nNow 49, Metcalf is back in his hometown in Seattle where he coaches the University of Washington sprinters and relay teams. He had previously coached football and track at Rainier Beach High School in Seattle, and ran an elite high school track and field club called the Seatown Express.\n\nSince he was a kid, he always played football and ran track. While he wanted to emulate his father, Terry wanted Eric to do his own thing.\n\n\u201cPlaying the game and coaching in high school, I had seen parents really pushing their kids instead of just allowing them to play,\u201d said Terry Metcalf. \u201cMy expectations would be higher than the average coach and I didn\u2019t want to become a stumbling block. I didn\u2019t want to get in the way. I just wanted to allow him to grow and be his own person and develop his talent.\u201d\n\nWith Terry finishing up his NFL career with the Washington Redskins, the Metcalf family moved to Virginia as Eric began high school. He starred for Bishop O\u2019Connell High School in Arlington and was recruited by schools across the country.\n\n\u201cI committed to Miami, but my mother and father didn\u2019t want me to go there,\u201d Metcalf said. \u201cMy entire life I went to Catholic schools, and with that in mind you can assume what school they wanted me to go to. But I told them I didn\u2019t want to go to Notre Dame. But then Coach (Fred) Akers came to see me, I loved the visit there. I chose Texas which was the perfect spot for me.\u201d\n\nSince Metcalf wasn\u2019t from Texas, many of his new Longhorns teammates didn\u2019t know him. They had heard of his exploits but wondered how such a tiny guy could dominate games in such a major way.\n\n\u201cBack in 1985, we came in as freshmen together,\u201d said former Texas tight end Tim McCray. \u201cWe saw he was fast in camp. Nobody really knew much about him, but in the first game against Missouri he took a punt back 80 yards and we thought, \u2018OK, that\u2019s what all the hype was about.\u2019 Ever since then he was the man. His name was born that day against Missouri.\u201d\n\nAfter solid freshman and sophomore years, Metcalf exploded as a junior in 1987 as he rushed for 1,161 yards and 10 touchdowns and caught 33 passes for 234 yards. He also averaged 13.5 yards on 24 punt returns to earn SWC player of the year in David McWilliams first year as head coach after replacing Fred Akers.\n\n\u201cWhen I first got there with Coach Akers, we were still in the I-formation, and I ran between the tackles like I had played my whole life,\u201d Metcalf said. \u201cCoach McWilliams played more of a split back and ran draws, and I was able to catch a lot of passes.\u201d\n\nMetcalf also produced a strong senior year with 932 yards rushing and eight touchdowns and 42 catches for 333 yards and two scores. That led to him being picked No. 13 overall in the first round by the Cleveland Browns.\n\nMetcalf\u2019s lone regret was that he was never able to beat Oklahoma during his four seasons with the Longhorns. Metcalf grew up hoping to play for Oklahoma, but coach Barry Switzer never offered him a scholarship.\n\n\u201cI have no idea how many offers I got, but I remember getting letters from everyone except Oklahoma,\u201d Metcalf said. \u201cThey always had a lot of running backs like Billy Sims, and I thought I could play there. That\u2019s not why I went to Texas, but I got to understand what the rivalry meant. I really wanted to beat them but unfortunately I never did.\u201d\n\nMetcalf starred for the Texas track team as he won national long titles in 1986 and 1988 and was also a tremendous 100 and 200-meter runner. He tried out for the 1988 United States Olympic team but finished eighth behind an unbeatable field that included Carl Lewis, Mike Powell and Larry Myricks who swept the long jump medals in Seoul, South Korea.\n\n\u201cI thought I had no shot of making the Olympic team,\u201d Metcalf said. \u201cTo be perfectly honest, I thought if I was lucky enough to make it, I wouldn\u2019t have gone to the Olympics. I thought I had a chance to win the Heisman that year, and I would have taken that over the Olympics.\u201d\n\nJust having the chance of competing against Lewis in the Olympic Trials was a thrill for Metcalf.\n\n\u201cWhen I was in high school, I had a wall dedicated to Carl,\u201d Metcalf said. \u201cNow I was on the same stage with him. It wasn\u2019t my main sport, but I could still be like a fan and say, \u2018Wow, that\u2019s Carl Lewis.\u2019\u201d\n\nMetcalf immediately stepped into a major role for the Browns as a rookie in 1989 as he rushed for 633 yards and six touchdowns and caught 54 passes or 397 yards and four scores while also amassing 718 yards in kick returns.\n\nDuring his second season, he led the NFL with 1,052 kickoff returns and two touchdowns. But his best all-around seasons for the Browns were in 1993-94 when he made consecutive Pro Bowls.\n\nMetcalf relished the atmosphere in Cleveland and loved playing games at old Municipal Stadium before the rowdy fans who were dubbed the Dawg Pound.\n\n\u201cThere was nothing like playing in that city,\u201d Metcalf said. \u201cIf a city deserves a champion, it\u2019s them. With those die-hard fans, it was like being in a college town. That\u2019s how much they love that team, and I loved being a part of it. Going back two, three or four times a year, people still talk to me like I was playing two years ago.\u201d\n\nPlaying for the Atlanta Falcons in 1995, Metcalf enjoyed his most productive season as a receiver as he made a career-high 104 catches for 1,189 yards and eight touchdowns. As his 13-year NFL career moved along, he increasingly became more of a receiver than a runner.\n\n\u201cHe was a carbon copy of me almost,\u201d said Terry Metcalf. \u201cHe had the potential to break a big one every time he touched the ball and like myself he could do it many different ways. He was a multi-talented athlete, and you don\u2019t find that much at all.\u201d\n\nMetcalf always enjoyed returning kicks and punts and set a career high with 1,218 kick return yards for Arizona in 1998. He finished his career with 10 punt returns for touchdowns and and two kick returns for scores.\n\n\u201cReturns gave me a chance to score long touchdowns,\u201d Metcalf said. \u201cWith a kickoff return, you had a chance to change the game, either at the start or the second half. If it was a punt return, your defense has stopped the offense, and that gives me a chance to change the momentum of the entire game.\u201d\n\nMetcalf beat the odds by playing 13 NFL seasons as he ended his career with Green Bay in 2002. He finished his career with 541 yards receiving for 5,572 yards and 31 touchdowns, 2,392 yards rushing and 12 touchdowns, and amassed 9,266 kick and punt return yards.\n\nMetcalf\u2019s 5-10, 190-pound stature benefited him because few defenders got a solid shot at him.\n\n\u201cTo be so small in that frame, what he did at the college level and the NFL was incredible,\u201d McCray said. \u201cHe played in the league 13 years, and to be that size was almost unheard of. Punt returners now don\u2019t play offense like they did back then for their team. You had to account for him on offense and special teams as well.\u201d\n\nThough their styles were similar, Terry Metcalf took great pride in watching his son carve out his own niche in the NFL.\n\n\u201cEverybody said he had big shoes to fill, but he was just himself,\u201d Terry Metcalf said. \u201cI heard guys call him me and it was more out of respect. They saw the same things.\u201d\n\n-----\n\nHall of Fame 2017\n\nThis is the second in a series of profiles on the new class of the Texas Sports Hall of Fame that will be inducted Feb. 21.

New coach Bruce Arena\u2019s MLS-based player group is clearly optimistic about the tests ahead, but the U.S. needs immediate improvements after two losses late last year put the Americans at the bottom of their World Cup qualifying group. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s a new vibe,\u201d Feilhaber said. \u201cIt\u2019s been great. Everybody is fighting for positions, but united in the knowledge that we need to do something special this year in qualifying, and it starts in this camp.\u201d \n \nFeilhaber is an offensive midfielder who could provide a dimension that seemed lacking in the Americans\u2019 attack in recent months. He is just one of several players getting newfound looks and increased attention after fading from Klinsmann\u2019s favor. \n \nDax McCarty, Chris Pontius and Chad Marshall also might have thought they were all done with U.S. national team play after getting passed over by the German coach. Other younger MLS-based players, including Sebastian Lletget and Walker Zimmerman, still hadn\u2019t attracted Klinsmann\u2019s serious attention. \n \nWhen Klinsmann was fired and Arena took over late last year, the veterans had already made their usual January vacation plans \u2014 and McCarty even scheduled his wedding this month. \n \nThey all reported to Carson for the start of another run under Arena, who has been determined to keep an open mind about anyone who could help his team. \n \n\u201cThey don\u2019t have to prove anything extra,\u201d Arena said of the second-chance contingent. \u201cBut they\u2019ve demonstrated they\u2019re good players, and they\u2019ve convinced me that they\u2019re options. At the end of the day, we\u2019ve got to compile all of this stuff after this camp and then look at our pool of players that are in Europe as well as in Mexico and try to see what makes sense for the games in March. It\u2019s not going to be an easy exercise, for sure.\u201d \n \n \nThe match in San Diego is Arena\u2019s first for the U.S. team since June 22, 2006, when the Americans were eliminated from the World Cup with a 2-1 loss to Ghana at Nuremberg. After his first U.S. tenure ended, Arena moved on to build the LA Galaxy into a three-time MLS champion. \n \nFrom veteran Jermaine Jones to youngster Jordan Morris, the MLS-based players appear to appreciate Arena\u2019s confident style of management \u2014 while realizing the results will determine his real success. \n \n\u201cBruce is very open with his players,\u201d Feilhaber said. \u201cHe lets you know exactly what he expects from you, and he\u2019s been very clear with me what position he would like me to play in, and what my responsibilities would be for the team. It\u2019s very straightforward and easy to grasp what my job is.

Center Onyeka Okongwu had seven blocks in the game. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s my role to be the defensive leader and I will continue to do that moving forward,\u201d Okongwu said. \u201cWe don\u2019t feel any pressure at all (when it comes to the win streak), I\u2019m just playing to win.\u201d \n \nChino Hills\u2019 next big test will come when it faces Oak Hill (VA) on Saturday in the Nike Extravaganza at Mater Dei High School. \n \nTop game scores from Rolling Hills Prep State Preview: \n \nBishop Montgomery topped Fairfax 79-55, Ethan Thompson poured in a game-high 25 for Bishop Montgomery (20-2) and Jamal Hartwell had 24 for Fairfax (19-2). \n \nSanta Margarita\u2019s (17-5) Kaden Rasheed scored a team-high 15 points to help the Eagles edge Corona Centennial 52-51. Centennial\u2019s (17-7) Gio Nelson hit a jumpshot as time expired that appeared to be a 3-pointer to tie the game, but was called a two-point shot by the referee because his foot was on the line.

If we get 1 on 1, I\u2019m going your way so you\u2019d better win,\u201d\u2019 Webb said. \u201cAnd he did. He won multiple times.\u201d \n \nWebb spread the ball around to other receivers like Mississippi State\u2019s Fred Ross as well. The Pac-12 Conference\u2019s leading passer directed scoring drives on all three of his possessions while completing 11 of 16 passes for 165 yards, including a 39-yard touchdown strike on a well-thrown fade to Reynolds. Reynolds had six catches for 96 yards, most of them on that first drive with Webb. \n \nNate Peterman of Pittsburgh had a similarly strong passing performance for the North in the showcase game for senior NFL prospects that actually featured late drama. Peterman fired a 6-yard scoring pass to East Carolina\u2019s Zay Jones with 1:51 left but the North went for two points and a potential lead. \n \nUnder heavy pressure from Chattanooga\u2019s Keionta Davis, Peterman\u2019s pass was deflected and intercepted by BYU\u2019s Harvey Langi. The South ran out the clock from there. \n \nThe week was about auditioning for NFL teams, more than winning, but Peterman said he wanted that last completion \u201cvery bad.\u201d \n \n\u201cYou\u2019re always competitive,\u201d said Peterman, who was 16-of-23 passing for 153 yards and played most of the game. \u201cTo say you can drive down and win the Senior Bowl in the last seconds, that would have been pretty cool. We didn\u2019t get it but it was a great experience still.\u201d \n \nWebb was the game\u2019s overall MVP after passing for 4,295 yards and 37 touchdowns last season as a graduate transfer from Texas Tech. \n \nHe led the South to a touchdown and field goal in the final three minutes of the first half. He and Reynolds proved a prolific combination on the touchdown drive, moving downfield on connections of 21 \u2014 on a third-and-10 play \u2014 and 13 yards before the touchdown. \n \nGame rules require teams to go for two points in the second quarter, and the South\u2019s attempt failed to keep the halftime lead at 9-3. \n \n \nToledo running back Kareem Hunt ran for 118 yards on 15 carries to earn North Outstanding Player Honors, including a 20-yarder and a 43-yarder on back-to-back plays. \n \nThe South\u2019s honoree was Kansas State defensive end Jordan Willis, who forced two fumbles and had a pair of sacks. \n \nThe South committed five turnovers and turned it over on its first three possessions. Saint Francis linebacker Lorenzo Jerome forced a fumble and made two interceptions for the North.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"John Zenor The"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Cal quarterback Davis Webb shines for South in Senior Bowl win","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Los Angeles","zipCode":"90802","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Long Beach","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Press-Telegram","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169677868","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"150"},"name":"Press-Telegram","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.presstelegram.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194182319","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T08:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:13:41Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://image.presstelegram.com/storyimage/LB/20170128/SPORTS/170129413/AR/0/AR-170129413.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

There\u2019s not enough drama. It\u2019s not real NFL football. \n \nBut Incognito, a Buffalo Bills guard, is like the vast majority of the 88 players invited to this all-star gathering Sunday night. He sees the Pro Bowl more as a celebration of achievement and as a way to thank the fans. \n \nHe wouldn\u2019t change a thing. \n \n\u201cIn my mind it\u2019s as good as it should be,\u201d Incognito said. \u201cYou really can\u2019t ask guys to come out here and fly around at full speed when we\u2019ve been off for the last two or three weeks. And some guys are just coming down here after conference championship games. Maybe make it more fan interactive, get the fans involved more, do more of the skills competition.\u201d \n \nThe NFL has seemed open to ways to energize its end-of-the-year showcase that is now sandwiched between conference championship and Super Bowl weeks. A few years ago the league broke from the traditional AFC-NFC Pro Bowl matchup and allowed celebrity coaches to draft two teams. \n \nNow, in hopes of giving the game a lift, the NFL has moved the Pro Bowl from Hawaii to Orlando, where it has become more of a weeklong event, complete with a re-imagined Skill Showdown. The AFC-NFC matchup has also returned after three years of nonconference games. \n \nStill, it remains to be seen if the NFL can continue selling a game that bears little resemblance to the product it puts on the field during the season. The players come to the Pro Bowl to have fun, not get hurt and maybe win. \n \n\u201cThis Pro Bowl for me in a sense is special because you are coming here to celebrate what you\u2019ve accomplished,\u201d New York Giants receiver Odell Beckham, Jr. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of fun.\u201d \n \nSeattle Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman says the intensity would rise and more invited players would show up if the NFL gave them their weekly game salaries. Under the collective bargaining agreement, each player from the winning team will make $61,000 this week and the losing players will take home $30,000. \n \n\u201cYou pay them what you are paying them and you get this performance,\u201d Sherman said. \u201cIt\u2019s a different element. ... I guarantee you less guys would miss the Pro Bowl if you told you are going to pay them their normal salary for one more game.\u201d \n \nFormer NFL player and coach Herm Edwards says the game as played now is fine. He says the Pro Bowl is not about the game, it\u2019s about the fans and the players giving back. Thousands of fans have been out at ESPN\u2019s Wide World of Sports complex this week watching both the AFC and NFC practice. \n \n \nAfter the practices were over most of the players signed autographs and took pictures in the laid-back atmosphere. All of the practices are short and glorified walk-throughs, and the players are mostly having fun with each other and the fans. \n \n\u201cWe are all ambassadors to this great game of football and how you conduct yourself once you leave this practice field is more important than how you play the game,\u201d said Edwards, who now works as analyst. \u201cThe fans aren\u2019t going to remember the game. The fans remember if Odell Beckham, Patrick Peterson, or if Drew Brees takes a picture with them, signs an autograph.\u201d \n \nEdwards, however, understands the criticism. He even admits, as a football purist, he doesn\u2019t watch the Pro Bowl. \n \nBut he says if the game does become more fiercely contested it would come at a cost that players, teams and even fans may not want to pay. \n \n\u201cThe only way to make it better is you do this: If you want all of them to show up, make the game worth $500,000,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cThey will all show up and now they play. Here is the problem, when one of them gets hurt you have the same problem.\u201d \n \nOakland Raiders general manager Reggie McKenzie acknowledges being torn when his players are selected for the Pro Bowl. On one hand, he is excited for their recognition. On the other, he\u2019s concerned about injuries. \n \nMcKenzie would be in favor of more of skills challenge than a game where key players can be injured. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s a risk,\u201d said McKenzie, who will have four players representing the AFC on Sunday. \u201cI cringe every time I go to practice, but it\u2019s the nature of the game. It\u2019s what it is. But you do everything you can to set your safety-type precautions. What else can you do? Not play?

But never had she had a weekend quite like the last one. \n \nKaren Chen, a 17-year-old, 4-foot-11 sprite from Fremont who trains under Gambill at Riverside Icetown, stunned the figure skating community by swiping the Ladies Senior gold at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships in Kansas City. \n \nThe next night, Vincent Zhou, a 16-year-old from Palo Alto via Icetown who won the national junior title three years ago as a 13-year-old, finished second in the Men\u2019s Senior competition to Nathan Chen, no relation to Karen. \n \nOne more level crossed off. It may have been just a matter of time. \n \n\u201cIt is a building process,\u201d said Gambill. \u201cI guess that just means we\u2019re on the right track. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s fun because now I\u2019ve had every national champion: Juvenile boy and girl, intermediate boy and girl, novice boy and girl, junior boy and girl, and now senior girl. Karen is my first senior champion, so that makes it special, that elusive senior title. And Vincent was very close.\u201d \n \nWhich would make her, um, an overnight success? \n \n\u201cExactly,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cI\u2019m an up-and-coming coach.\u201d \n \nGambill, a Redlands resident who declined to state her age but acknowledged her skaters now give her anniversary cards on her birthday \u2014 anniversaries of turning 39, get it? \u2014 grew up in the Sacramento area and was a good enough skater at 14 to leave home to train, much as her pupils now do. \n \nShe began coaching in Stockton 30 years ago. \n \n\u201cThe Oak Park Ice Arena,\u201d she recalled. \u201cThen I moved down to Southern California, and had two kids and started coaching down here. My son (Matt) is now 27, so it was 27 years ago that I started down here.\u201d \n \nHer first teaching gig in Southern California was in Palm Desert, at a long, skinny rink in the middle of the Town Center Mall \u2014 \u201ccalled a hot dog rink,\u201d she recalled. Her pupils there included Yorba Linda\u2019s Sandy Rucker and Indio\u2019s Dennis Phan; both went on to win age group national championships, Phan in 2003 and Rucker in 2005. \n \nShe later began commuting from Redlands to Anaheim three times a week to teach on a bigger ice surface, and also used the Ice Castle international training center in Lake Arrowhead when it was still open. \n \n \nAnd then Icetown opened, in 1997, an easier commute with no need to navigate mountain roads. \u201cPerfect,\u201d she said. \n \nThe accolades have accumulated over the years. Gambill was named the USOC Developmental Coach of the Year in 2005 \u2014 an honor that encompasses all sports \u2014 and has been similarly honored by U.S. Figure Skating and the Professional Skaters Association in 2005, 2012 and 2013. \n \nBut it\u2019s about her pupils, as it should be. She has coached world or national medalists Richard Dornbush, Shotaro Omori, Tyler Pierce and Caroline Zhang. \n \nFour of her skaters will be competing at either the world championships or world junior championships this year. Chen and Brendan Kerry of Australia will compete in the 2017 World Championships March 29-April 2 in Helsinki, Finland (and both will also compete in the Four Continents competition Feb. 15 in Gangneung, Korea, the site of next year\u2019s Olympic competition). \n \nMeanwhile, Zhou and Yarrick Paniot of the Ukraine will compete in the World Junior Championships beginning March 15 in Tapiei City, Taiwan. Zhou will also be the first alternate for the U.S. at the Worlds should there be an injury. \n \n\u201cI like it when they come in young and I can build them back up again,\u201d Gambill said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s fun to get some of the older ones. Yaro (Paniot) just came in a couple of weeks ago. He\u2019s super talented, so I\u2019m very excited to see what I can do with him as well.\u201d \n \nShe has around 20 skaters total, and her preference is to have everyone on the ice together. She barks orders \u2014 her own description \u2014 and, along with assistant coach Ryan Berning, gives technical guidance. She doesn\u2019t discourage the idea among her skaters that she has eyes in the back of her head, a fiction that works as long as she can see their reflections in the Plexiglas. \n \nAnd she listens as well as instructs. \n \n\u201cI\u2019ve been with her for three years now, and I feel like I really do love her as a coach,\u201d Chen said. \u201cShe can be strict, but she\u2019s definitely very understanding as well. She listens to my opinion. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s always been something I struggled with in my interaction with my coach, but I feel like I\u2019m getting better. Sometimes if I\u2019m having a bad day or my knee\u2019s bothering me or something, it\u2019s hard for me to speak up and tell her, because I feel like I want to give my 100 percent in training and I don\u2019t want to let this affect anything ... (but) she\u2019s let me know this: It\u2019s important that if I\u2019m not feeling 100 percent today I need to let her know, so she can make adjustments to my training and it\u2019ll be beneficial for us both.\u201d \n \nChen is one of many skaters who have relocated from elsewhere specifically to train under Gambill. Her mother, Hsiu-Hui Tseng, is with her and her younger brother Jeffrey, an ice dancer, in Southern California during the week while her husband, Chih-Hsiu Chen, has stayed in the Bay Area. \n \n\u201cI like the way she teaches kids,\u201d Tseng said. \u201cSometimes you need to be strict. (But) she\u2019s a coach you can communicate with. Some coaches won\u2019t communicate with parents, but she\u2019s willing to listen.\u201d \n \nWith more success, inevitably Gambill will field more calls from parents inquiring whether there is space for their prodigies. For the good ones, there will assuredly be room. \n \n\u201cWhen I first started coaching I taught a little girl whose father was a farmer,\u201d Gambill said. \u201cAnd he made a statement to me that \u2018when my crop is great, I\u2019m the smartest farmer in the world. But when I have a bad crop, due to whatever reason, all of a sudden I\u2019m a very stupid farmer.\u2019 \n \n\u201cIt all depends on the crop you have at the time.\u201d \n \nOf course, how well you cultivate it matters, too.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Jim Alexander jalexander@scng.com @Jim_Alexander"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Jim Alexander: Tammy Gambill's coaching leaves nothing to chance","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Los Angeles","zipCode":"90802","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Long Beach","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Press-Telegram","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169677868","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"150"},"name":"Press-Telegram","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.presstelegram.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194191959","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T08:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:13:41Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

those two awards were presented by Kidman and her husband, musician Keith Urban respectively.\n\nThe event was staged at the Ray Dolby Ballroom, adjacent to the Dolby Theatre, the home of the annual Academy Awards.\n\nOther VIPs in attendance included Australia's consul-general in Los Angeles Chelsey Martin, actors Rachel Griffiths, Paul Hogan and Daniel MacPherson and the directors Baz Luhrmann and Phillip Noyce.\n\nThe Australian and American national anthems were performed by Australia's Hugh Sheridan and Wé McDonald, a contestant on the US version of The Voice, respectively; Australian singer-songwriter Vance Joy also performed.\n\nThe black-tie gala, which is also attended by Australia's foreign minister Julie Bishop and trade minister Steve Ciobo, is the somewhat colourful icing on a larger, more serious government cake, the G'Day USA trade mission.\n\nThat mission, first staged in 2004, promotes Australian food and wine, fashion, film and the arts, defence industry and technological innovation; in recent years it has also included our expertise in water and drought management.\n\nThe foreign minister and trade minister have been in the US for the last week as part of a travelling roadshow, more fancifully referred to as the business of \"economic diplomacy\".\n\nIn addition to the gala, nicknamed \"G'Day LA\" and held in Los Angeles, there are events staged by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade across the US, including San Francisco, Austin and New York.\n\nAs part of that roadshow Mr Ciobo delivered an economic outlook address in New York, and was the guest of Texas governor Greg Abbott at an \"Australia-Texas BBQ\" at the governor's mansion in Austin.\n\nMs Bishop delivered a keynote address on the role of Australia and the US in the Indo-Pacific at the Skirball Cultural Centre in Los Angeles.\n\nDespite the fact that this year's G'Day USA trade mission has taken place largely in the shadow of a turbulent handover of power in the US, Mr Ciobo told Fairfax Media it was a success.\n\n\"We are always, of course, focused on Australia's national interest, but the US and Australia have been very close friends for decades and and I'm very confident we'll continue to be for a long time yet,\" he said.\n\nAustralia's trade with the US in goods and services is worth about A$60 billion a year and Mr Ciobo said the trade mission was an opportunity to reinforce Australia's \"diversified and mature\" economy.\n\n\"On the west coast, for example, we highlight the benefits of being able to produce film and television shows in Australia; in each particular area we focus on our natural strengths,\" he said.\n\nMr Ciobo said G'Day USA was largely unaffected by US president Donald Trump's decision to nix the planned Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) free-trade agreement.\n\n\"Australia will continue having conversations on the TPP 11 or 12-1 approach, and that's with other countries excluding the US, but there's always opportunity to drive the relationship forward,\" Mr Ciobo said.\n\nAustralia also has an existing free-trade agreement with the US, the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement (AUSFTA), which was signed in 2005.\n\n\"That's the architecture that drives the [Australia-US] relationship,\" Mr Ciobo said. \"That provides a good framework for our trade relationship and investment relationship.\"\n\nThe G'Day USA event is managed by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade with Austrade and Tourism Australia.\n\nIt is sponsored by organisations including Australia Unlimited, Qantas, the United States Studies Centre at The University of Sydney and the American Australian Association.

Organisers claim this a record number of the little dogs in the one place at the one time. \n\nMark Ellis, the organiser of Sunday's Werriwa Wiener Dash at the Bungendore Show, believes the turnout of 154 dachshunds for the event constitutes a world record for the number of the sausage dogs in one place at one time.\n\n\"We had miniatures, long hairs, short hairs, standards and wire hairs,\" he said. \"They came from all over; some even travelled from Melbourne.\n\nWhile Mr Ellis wasn't able to engage the attention of the people from Guinness, who ruled the record being sought was too \"specialised\" to interest them, he is happy to claim the record with any other contenders needing to prove him wrong.\n\nAlthough the quirky event, which has captured the imagination of dachshund lovers from across NSW and the ACT, is only in its second year it has already become one of the feature events of the Bungendore Show.\n\nThis year's dash winner was Buddy, owned by Jacqueline Winzenberg of Page in the ACT. Buddy's award was presented by NSW Deputy Premier and local member John Barilaro.\n\nOne hundred and twenty seven dogs turned up for the inaugural event in 2016.\n\nBungendore Show, which was first held in the 1840s, has gone from strength to strength in recent decades, this year's showgirl, Hanna Darmody, 22, said.\n\nMs Darmody, whose family own a Bungendore butchery, said she could recall helping with the catering at the show as a toddler almost 20 years ago.\n\n\"I've seen the event grow as the town has grown,\" she said. \"It is a great bridge between country and city; the showgirl competition is a good way to get young people involved and promotes opportunities in agriculture.\"\n\nShow organisers said this year's event, which enjoyed the best weather conditions in three years, was an unqualified success with more than 2000 people passing through the gates before lunch.\n\nIn addition to the usual attractions in the show ring and the pavilions and the dachshund dash, the 2017 event offered visitors a chance to get a close look at the Anzac Centennial 18 pounder gun.\n\nThe World War I-era weapon, which also saw service during World War II,was restored by the Royal Australian Artillery Company in conjunction with veteran coach builder Jim Frecklington. The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"David Ellery"},"topics":[{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Werriwa Wiener dash claims world dachsund record","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2567","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Narellan","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Macarthur Advertiser","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169754919","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2"},"name":"Macarthur Advertiser","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.macarthuradvertiser.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194192817","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:10:23Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:13:42Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/01e2e8d0-6ac5-4e81-9bc2-708dc395bfb7.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

He alleged that the Liberals wanted to wrest police from Mr Grant, a senior Nationals MP.\n\n\"The Nationals wanted police, the right wing faction of the Liberals wanted police,\" he said. \"So she split it in two.\"\n\n\"It's the police who keep us safe from terrorism,\" Mr Foley said.\n\n\"The police commissioner now has to report to two people. It's scandalous and another deal that is counter to the public interest.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the troubled relationship between the NSW attorney-general and minister for police has been addressed, with Ms Berejiklian confirming a reshaping of the much maligned \"justice cluster\".\n\nThe arrangement, whereby as justice and police minister Mr Grant held a more senior position than then attorney-general Gabrielle Upton, was heavily criticised by the legal profession.\n\nThe NSW Bar Association said it provided Mr Grant \"with unprecedented power in determining legal policy without the historical checks and balances\".\n\nThe NSW Law Society warned the arrangement meant police were \"ostensibly responsible for criminal law policy, while at the same time, the traditional roles of the attorney-general as first law officer of the state, which includes preserving civil liberties, are being eroded\".\n\nMs Berejiklian has confirmed the cluster has been reworked so that new attorney-general Mark Speakman, SC, is the lead minister.

If achieved, these objectives will no doubt start the conversation to bring Nigeria close to becoming a major player in the industrialized world, a vision that should be shared by all Nigerians, he added. \n \n    Leadership Headlines Yesterday \n[Sat-28-Jan-2017]  \nBakassi Deep Seaport: Cross River Journalists Commend Gov Ayade \n \nN35.5m Alleged debt: Crisis In Bayelsa Owned Radio Deepens With Threat Of N100m Defamation Suit \n \nAbraka Farmers Recount Blood-Chilling Encounter With Herdsmen \n \nObaseki, Investors, Others Inspect Fertilizer Plant In Auchi, Okpella \n \nLow Turnout, Malfunctioned Card Readers Trail NASS Bye Election In Edo \n \nAisha Buhari Targets 3000 For Free Medical Treatment In Kogi \n \nAmbode, Mohammed, Osoba Harp On Entertainment, Tourism Sectors For Economic Growth \n \nConfusion In Ondo Assembly As Two Faction Lay Claim To Leadership \n \nAmbode, Mohammed, Osoba Harp On Entertainment, Tourism Sectors For Economic Growth \n  Click to view all Leadership headlines yesterday","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Leadership on Sun, 29 Jan"},"topics":[{"name":"Steelmaking news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Nigeria news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"FG Urged To Revive Ajaokuta Steel","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Western Africa","countryCode":"NG","country":"Nigeria"},"editorialRank":"5","name":"Latest Nigerian News.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"552291450","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Latest Nigerian News.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.latestnigeriannews.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://leadership.ng/news/568988/bakassi-deep-seaport-cross-river-journalists-commend-gov-ayade","http://leadership.ng/news/568982/n35-5m-alleged-debt-crisis-in-bayelsa-owned-radio-deepens-with-threat-of-n100m-defamation-suit","http://leadership.ng/news/568976/abraka-farmers-recount-blood-chilling-encounter-with-herdsmen","http://leadership.ng/news/568964/obaseki-investors-others-inspect-fertilizer-plant-in-auchi-okpella","http://leadership.ng/news/568957/low-turnout-malfunctioned-card-readers-trail-nass-bye-election-in-edo","http://leadership.ng/news/568955/aisha-buhari-targets-3000-for-free-medical-treatment-in-kogi","http://leadership.ng/news/568948/ambode-mohammed-osoba-harp-on-entertainment-tourism-sectors-for-economic-growth-2","http://leadership.ng/news/568946/confusion-in-ondo-assembly-as-two-faction-lay-claim-to-leadership","http://leadership.ng/news/568944/ambode-mohammed-osoba-harp-on-entertainment-tourism-sectors-for-economic-growth"],"sequenceId":"695194198470","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:50:42Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:13:46Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Frampton won the first bout by a similar majority-decision scoreline but couldn't avoid the first loss of his career in this second go-around.Santa Cruz made the necessary adjustments to win this time around, making great use of his jab and aseven-inchreach advantage to both hurt Frampton and prevent him from controlling the pace of the bout.Frampton's excellent counterpunching was apparent throughout, and the exciting pugilism on display will likely have fight fans everywhere hoping for a rubber match between these two.Frampton himself wants another bout, per theLos Angeles Times' Lance Pugmire:Santa Cruz got off to a better start in this fight than in the first edition, using his length to keep the smaller Frampton at bay and landing some stinging jabs.A volume puncher by trade, Santa Cruz showed a level of restraint early on, per NYFights.com's Michael Woods:When the action went to the ropes, limiting Santa Cruz's reach advantage, Frampton was able to get in some precise counterpunches to the head and body, particularly with the left hook.The third and fourth rounds featured a few vicious, crowd-pleasing exchanges between the two fighters, as Frampton took the fight inside and forced Santa Cruz to trade punches. Here's a look at the fourth-round action, via Showtime Boxing:Frampton's head movement throughout much of the bout was excellent, but he dropped his gloves at the end of the fifth and absorbed several hard shots to the jaw. However, the Belfast fighter didn't look any worse for wear, and the action continued at a frenetic pace.Boxing journalist Andreas Hale distilled the fight down to the key weapons for each boxer:While the offense in the bout was in ample supply, Frampton did entertain the crowd with some sublime movement that had Santa Cruz punching air at the end of the seventh.Frampton fought with greater urgency in the later rounds, though Santa Cruz still kept up his usual taxing work rate. Santa Cruz's jab kept Frampton out of the easy rhythm he slid into on the first fight, and his counterpunches were cleaner as well.There was still little between these two all the way to the final bell, as an aggressive Frampton pushed Santa Cruz to the ropes on multiple occasions and pounded away with his furious flurries.The pace hardly subsided despite fatigue becoming a factor, and Santa Cruz was able to land well enough in the final rounds to keep Frampton from swinging the bout at the end.Showtime Boxing provided some late-round highlights:Make no mistake, a third fight between these two should be on every boxing fan's wish list. Both are aggressive fighters who provide plenty of action and are still under 30 years old. The Mexican Santa Cruz and the Belfast native Frampton provide global appeal. The two showed plenty of mutual admiration during the bout, tapping gloves between several rounds and quickly embracing as soon as the final bell sounded.If Santa Cruz and Frampton can get a third fight done, it will likely be another entertaining slugfest and a victory for the sport and its fans. \nClick here to read full news..","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Carl Frampton vs. Leo Santa Cruz 2: Winner, Scorecard and Reaction","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Western Africa","countryCode":"NG","country":"Nigeria"},"editorialRank":"5","name":"Latest Nigerian News.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"552291450","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Latest Nigerian News.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.latestnigeriannews.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2689873-carl-frampton-vs-leo-santa-cruz-2-winner-scorecard-and-reaction"],"sequenceId":"695194199073","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:01:51Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:13:46Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Jan Schakowsky of Evanston, reached by phone Saturday night, said she was nearly in a state of \u201cdisbelief,\u2019\u2019 seeing what was happening at airports across the country. \n \n\u201cI have never in my life imagined that in the United States of America that we would see this,\u2019\u2019 she said, speaking of \u201cperfectly legal\u2019\u2019 residents of the country being questioned and held at airports. \n \nTrump\u2019s executive order, signed late Friday afternoon, suspends entry of all refugees to the United States for 120 days, bars Syrian refugees indefinitely and blocks entry for 90 days for citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. \n  \nThe Department of Homeland Security said the order also bars green card holders from those countries from re-entering the United States. White House officials said Saturday that green card holders from the seven affected countries would need a case-by-case waiver to return to the U.S. \n  \n\u201cI think it\u2019s un-American. I just can\u2019t stand it,\u2019\u2019 Schakowsky said. \u201cIt\u2019s painful to me. You know he (President Trump) signed the executive order on Holocaust Remembrance Day and one of the things we\u2019re supposed to remember is that the United States actually turned back people that went to their deaths,\u2019\u2019 Schakowsky said. \n \nRep.

The court's decision, which will affect people who have been detained in airports, came after the ACLU and other activist groups filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of two Iraqis who were held at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York as a result of the order.'I hope Trump enjoys losing. He's going to lose so much we're going to get sick and tired of his losing,' ACLU national political director Faiz Shakir told Yahoo News shortly after the decision was announced.The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the court rulingined or turned around at airports.The class action lawsuit sought an immediate injunction barring the Trump administration from blocking immigrants based on the executive order. It argued that the order violates a 1965 law that banned discrimination in immigration based on national origin. According to a copy of the court decision from Judge Ann Donnelly, it will stop officials from removing individuals with approved refugee applications, holders of valid visas and people from the affected countries who have been authorized to enter ' pending completion of a hearing on the matter in court. Donnelly also wrote that the lawsuit would have a 'strong likelihood of success.' 'There is imminent danger that, absent the stay of removal, there will be substantial and irreparable injury to refugees, visa holders, and other individuals from nations subject to the January 27, 2017 executive order,' Donnelly said.Shakir said the stay will affect those who are 'currently detained in airports' and that the ACLU's lawyers 'will continue litigating the rest of the people impacted' by the order.Trump's order has led to large protests at airports around the country. Critics charge that it amounts to a 'Muslim ban,' while Trump and his team have maintained that the order is not designed to target any specific religion and is merely aimed at terror-prone nations.Yahoo News asked White House press secretary Sean Spicer about the order during his briefing on Wednesday. He framed it as a 'necessary step' for dealing with people from countries that have 'a propensity to do us harm.' During his presidential bid, Trump called for a 'total and complete shutdown of Muslims' entering the U.S. That proposal subsequently evolved into a vague promise of 'extreme vetting.'Trump touted the executive order while speaking to reporters in the Oval Office on Saturday. He said the scenes in the airports were evidence of its success.'It's not a Muslim ban, but we were totally prepared. It's working out very nicely. You see it at the airports, you see it all over,' Trump said, according to a White House press pool report.Source:https://www.yahoo.com/news/aclu-wins-legal-challenge-against-immigration-ban-hope-trump-enjoys-losing-024846291.html \nClick here to read full news..","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Lawsuits news","group":"Business"}],"title":"ACLU Wins Legal Challenge Against Trump's Immigration Ban","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Western Africa","countryCode":"NG","country":"Nigeria"},"editorialRank":"5","name":"Latest Nigerian News.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"552291450","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Latest Nigerian News.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.latestnigeriannews.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.nairaland.com/3598871/aclu-wins-legal-challenge-against","https://www.yahoo.com/news/aclu-wins-legal-challenge-against-immigration-ban-hope-trump-enjoys-losing-024846291.html"],"sequenceId":"695194202019","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:59:01Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:13:45Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

According to ESPN Stats & Info, that mark represented the most by any team this season through three quarters. With Curry in full highlight mode and Kevin Durant (23points) and Klay Thompson (16points) scorching beside him, there was simply no hope for the visitors, according to theWashington Post's Tim Bontemps:Shea Serrano of The Ringer was among those who marveled at the Warriors' ability to break away in an instant:While the Warriors were led by their trio of sensational scorers, the Clippers leaned on Blake Griffinin his second game back from injuryto lead them to the tune of 20 points on 9-of-14 shooting.That efficiency was a small silver lining, but the Clippers couldn't take away many other positives on a night when they shot 43.9 percent from the field, committed 14turnovers and were ravaged in transition.Los Angeles has now lost two in a row and four of its last five dating back to Jan. 19.And while a backslide in Paul's absence was expected to some degree, losses to the Denver Nuggets, Minnesota Timberwolves and Philadelphia 76ers over the past 10 days don't reflect positively on the team's supporting cast.The bad news is it's not going to get any easier.A showdown against the Phoenix Suns on Wednesday will represent a brief reprieve for Doc Rivers' club, but a rematch against the Warriors on the second night of a back-to-back will represent a major challenge.Speaking of back-to-backs, the Warriors will return to the floor Sunday evening at Moda Center for a clash with the Portland Trail Blazers before the Charlotte Hornets pay a visit to the Bay Area on Wednesday.Postgame ReactionAccording to theSan Francisco Chronicle's Connor Letourneau, Kerr needed just three words to sum up Curry's third quarter:Kerr later broke down Curry's sensational showing in more depth, as Anthony Slater of the Bay Area News Group documented on Twitter:As for his second-quarter buzzer-beater, Curry provided some insight regarding his thought process on the heaves. \"I love throwing up those however-far shots at the end of the buzzer just to see if itll go in,\" he said, per Letourneau.On the Clippers' side of things, Rivers told reporters he thought his side could have done a much better job of defending the reigning MVP, per 95.7 The Game on Twitter:\"This is the worst loss probably in my career,\" J.J. Redick concluded, per 95.7 The Game's Bonta Hill. \nClick here to read full news..","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: NBA - Golden State Warriors news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: NBA - Los Angeles Clippers news","group":"Sports Teams"}],"title":"Clippers vs. Warriors: Score, Highlights, Reaction from 2017 Regular Season","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Western Africa","countryCode":"NG","country":"Nigeria"},"editorialRank":"5","name":"Latest Nigerian News.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"552291450","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Latest Nigerian News.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.latestnigeriannews.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2689859-clippers-vs-warriors-score-highlights-reaction-from-2017-regular-season"],"sequenceId":"695194203843","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:01:51Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:13:45Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

But generally speaking it\u2019s already set for the whole season.\"\n\nMouratoglou said numbers alone were not the main factor behind Serena's continuing hunger, even in her 20th year on tour.\n\n\"She was not motivated by 22, she was motivated to win grand slams,\" he said.\n\n\"That\u2019s her motivation. This won\u2019t change until she maybe one day wakes up and is not motivated to win grand slams, but for now she is. That\u2019s enough. The record is not the thing that makes her play.\"\n\nAnd Mouratoglou said Serena would not obsess over the record of 24 held by Court.\n\n\"With all the respect for Margaret Court, it was another era, the draws were like 16 players and they were not professionals,\" he said.\n\n\"Of course the record is here and we definitely want to beat it, but there was a professional era and the record was Steffi Graf.\"\n\n(Editing by Amlan Chakraborty)","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Serena to play fewer tournaments to aid grand slam quest","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Yahoo!

The Aussies think it's great because it's a win win for them.\" \n \nCahill said there was little compassion in the Australian policy, which sent back everyone no matter what their offence. \n \n\"It might be one thing when you've got someone that has committed an armed robbery sitting in jail. It's different when you've got someone who has lived their whole life there and been convicted of a relatively minor offence.\" \n \nTony Touri, 48, landed in Christchurch before Christmas, after stints in jail and an Australian immigration detention centre. \n \nHe left behind his family, a $2000-a-week job and the kickboxing club where he helped train youth. \n \nTouri saw Christchurch as a fresh start with labouring opportunities and a place free from old North Island gang connections. \n \n\"It turned my life upside down. When I arrived here, I felt like an alien.\" \n \nCahill said it had been well proven through released prisoners, that if supports were not in place, the risk of reoffending was greater. \n \n\"These people are sort of similar but there isn't the same support available to follow up with them all the time, so it doesn't surprise me we're getting that 30 per cent reoffending,\" he said. \n \nThe Canterbury branch of Pars has found growing demand for their support service. \n \n\"We could have one in a month. We could get roughly one a week, then two in one week,\" Murphy said. \n \nIn 2014, Pars settled just three people in Christchurch. That figure rose to 15 in 2015 and to 51 in 2016. \n \nFive women were among the group that had arrived since 2014. \n \nCounties Manukau District has the highest population of deportees, with 118 residing in the area.  \n \nAuckland City has attracted 89, while 69 people are listed in Canterbury.  \n \nWellington has 52 returning offenders and 51 are in the Waitemata District. \n \nCorrections deputy national commissioner Rachel Leota\u200b said the provision of effective reintegration services for returning offenders was important because many did not have strong links to New Zealand.  \n \nCorrections budgeted $300,000 a year for five years for providers such as Pars to help returning offenders settle back into life in New Zealand.  \n \nPrior to entering a contract with the Corrections in 2016, Pars received $77,000 from the Christchurch City Council to support deportees. \n \nCahill said before an information sharing agreement with Australian authorities was signed in September 2015, police were lucky to get a few hours notice of new arrivals.  \n \n\"Whereas now we are able to prepare a little and have staff meet them.\" \n \nHigh-risk offenders are visited by police 48 hours after arrival. \n \n\"It's good in theory but there simply aren't the resources to do that. And there are no controls,\" Cahill said. \n \nHe said in some cases in Auckland, returning offenders had checked out of supported living arrangements or motels before police arrived for their checkup.  \n \n\"They're not breaking the law per se when they do that, because a lot of them aren't under any restrictions. They're just into the wind.\" \n \n  \n      Comments","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"EMILY SPINK"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"New Zealand news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Deportees stretching resources","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"NZ","country":"New Zealand"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Taranaki Daily News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169693667","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1076"},"name":"Taranaki Daily News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://stuff.co.nz"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194205942","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:13:47Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

She can fight in and out, fast and slow. She can box and wrestle. She's sharp and tactical.If there is any issue for Shevchenko, it's her size. She is a natural flyweight, but that's a division the UFC does not have for women, so she fights on and manages to excel one class above where she should be.She is so good, in fact, that her ultimate bantamweight destination is to be the division's champion. AfterShevchenko beat Julianna Pena on Saturday at UFC on Fox, the only one standing between her and destiny is champion Amanda Nunes.Nunes, the same fighter who beat her once before, but who she dominated in the third round of their bout after the Brazilian ran out of gas. The next time they meet, it will be for five rounds. More time for Shevchenko to implement her fight IQ, her complete game, her stamina.Shevchenko will almost certainly get the opportunity to face Nunes again after submitting Pena with a second-round armbar victory in Denver. She will almost certainly win.More on that later.Saturday night was a crowning moment in itself, another one to follow her recent defeat of former 135-pound champ Holly Holm, a woman who is big enough to soon be fighting for the inaugural featherweight belt.This one was notable because it was differentthe method of victory coming as a surprise that fully highlights Shevchenko's complete skill set.It had been years since she had tapped out an opponent. In fact, she hadn't pulled off the trick in a full decade, since tying up Yulia Nemtsova in an Ezekiel choke in March 2006.In the time since, she's mostly been viewed as a stand-up stylist who displays technical muay thai and poise.While it has been clear that her game has been rounding out, the close of the fight was a master's trap; the finish both measured and sharp. After spending over a minute on her back with Pena in her guard, she trapped Pena's right arm with her own, shifted her hips and completed the arm lock.It was a checkmate kind of moment, one predicated on ring smarts over sheer aggression.\"I don't know what you guys thought, but I thought if the fight stays standing, Shevchenko wins all day,\" UFC President Dana White said in the post-fight press conference.\"If it goes to the ground, Julianna Pena was going to submit her or ground-and-pound her or something. You never know. Shevchenko proved us wrong, that she's a very well-rounded mixed martial artist, and that she's ready for a title fight. Stylistically, I think it's a very fun fight with these two.\"It will be, and Shevchenko should be considered the favorite in the bout due to Nunes' propensity for fading as fights go on. She has fast hands and crushing power, but both of those attributes have proved to be temporary weapons.Witness, for instance, the third round of their first bout. Final strike count of the third round' Shevchenko 17, Nunes three. And those FightMetric numbers aren't a one-off mirage. Nunes landed zero in the final round against Cat Zinganoa fight she dominated early before losing via third-round stoppage. It was a similar story against Alexis Davis several years ago.If Nunes begins to struggle around the 10-minute mark, 25 will seem like an eternity. In that kind of fight, you have to pick Shevchenko.Her success feels like something of a throwback to earlier MMA, when there were clear distinctions between skill and size, and the former could make up for a lack of the latter. All these years later, the gap has mostly closed, and it's the rare athlete who can continually succeed while being undersized.Yet that's exactly what Shevchenko is doing, much like Demetrious Johnson did in the men's bantamweight division before the UFC instituted his natural weight class, flyweight, allowing him to dominate. Even fighting up, Johnson came within a couple of rounds of winning the belt.Shevchenko can go one step further later this year.Of course, she will have to play everything just right. Nunes' explosion is not to be ignored, but the same could have been said aboutHolm and Pena, who often fights with an intensity that makes it seem like there is something personal at stake. What she lacks in proficiency, she makes up for with aggression. Yet that kind of approach usually only works up to a certain level.Pena found the dividing line Saturday, and early. After trapping Shevchenko against the fence in the opening minutes of the first, she threw a series of knees. However, Shevchenko recognized the pattern, caught one in the series and used it to sweep Pena's left leg, scoring a takedown.Moments later, she did the same thing.In that moment, it was easy to get the feeling that they were playing on two different planes of enlightenment.\"You know I can say exactly about Pena, she's good fighter,\" Shevchenko said in the press conference. \"She's wild. But I'm a master.\"With each passing round, she's proving that to be true.Always undersized and often outgunned, Shevchenko is something to see. And by the end of the next time we see her, she may have proof of her mastery strapped in gold around her waist.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Bleacher Report on Sun, 29 Jan"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: MMA news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"For Valentina Shevchenko, UFC Bantamweight Championship Seems Inevitable","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Western Africa","countryCode":"NG","country":"Nigeria"},"editorialRank":"5","name":"Latest Nigerian News.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"552291450","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Latest Nigerian News.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.latestnigeriannews.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194208486","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:01:51Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:13:46Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

In this report, EJURA ADAMA who visited the sites and interacted with the men behind the age long trade of dyeing, reports on the spectacular nature of the dye-pits.Beyond the traffic around Kofar Mata, Kano, in the hot afternoon sun, lie the dyeing pits of Kofar Mata.A first-time visitor would be disappointed to see almost no activity within the walls and no queues of customers stretching from within the walls to without it. Very disappointed, after all that have been written about it.It is hard to believe Kofar Matas dyeing pits are half-a-millennium-old.It must have been covered in dust and the smell of dyeing ingredients filling the air back then, but, in this day, it boasts of interlocking tiles and finely cemented dye-pits.But it is not what is used to be; not anymore.Secretary of the place, Haruna Baba, knows this much, seeing that, seven generations before him, his forefather was the first person to have begun the art. This was back in 1489.My family was the first to initiate this art, which was introduced by my forefather,Mallam Muhammadu Dabbo Sani, who was the first to start the art in the world.He must have attended to many other first-comers and getting to explain a few valid, historical facts was no issue for him.Kofar Mata is the Hausa word which literally means womens gate. Back in the days, the entrance, he stated, pointing to the gate of the settlement, was manned by women warriors, who defended the place from external attacks. That was why it was named kofar Mata.These dying pits were dug in 1498, over 500 years ago. Every man working here inherited this art from either his father, grandfather or some other person in his family.The compound has 144 dyeing pits, though they are rarely put to use at the same time. It has about 200 workers, both men and women, but the women make their designs from home, while the men only come to the compound to work, to dye the fabrics.Islam, as you know, does not allow the women work in public, he said.The ingredients and procedure for dyeing are as old as the place itself. Very little has changed since Harunas fore-father began the art.Dying begins with getting an empty pit which is filled with about 1,550 litres of water. When you pour this water in, add 40 buckets of ash (straight from firewood), before mixing it with water. After mixing, leave same for three days before adding indigo to it.Indigo is a flower that grows like henna. The only difference is that indigo gives you blue colour while henna gives brown. You add 200kg of the indigo mixed with the ash and leave it for another three days. After the sixth day, you get some potassium chloride note, this is not potash sold in the market, it is made here. Get four buckets of it, mix it with the ash and indigo and let it be for three days, making it nine days in all.After nine days, you allow all the ingredients to ferment for a total of four weeks. After the four weeks of fermentation, filter the solution which is now brown after the process and leave it. Get a local stirring machine and stir the solution every day for seven days.After six weeks and three days, you can start making the colour. We have four colours mixed into the solution: light blue, navy blue, dark blue and blue-black. Dark blue takes an hour before it changes to light blue, navy blue takes two hours and blue-black takes up to six hours.By the time this last step is accomplished, it is ready for use. The prepared solution can be used for one year before it is discarded to make way for a new one.You see this mixture which Baba (he points to an aged man who is working a pit) is using' It will be changed this January, because it is useless and cannot effectively dye a fabric, although, it is used as a traditional cure for diseases like sickle cell anemia and certain skin conditions, he scoops some of the solution into his mouth, as he says this. This is because the solution is without chemicals; it is natural and pure.Mixing the colours for a dyeing pit is far from easy work, but it hardly translates into good pay for those who do the back-breaking job.BalaAdo, who has been working the pits in Kofar Mata since he turned 15, makes up to N500 to N700 a day when business is bad (which is almost always). Introduced to the art by his father, some of Ados five children have begun to take more than a passing interest in the work in the pitsjust like their father did at their age.He wouldnt stand in the way of their pursuit of education, so he only orders them to the pit after they return from school. Ado, who gives visitors a tour of the place, leaves the work to his children when he has to attend to visitors. After all, it is the only source of income the family has.Ado is not the only one who does not expect any salary from the pits. Many of those who work here earn no salaries; instead, they earn their keep daily.The secretary of the place, Haruna Baba, told LEADERSHIP Sunday that everyone works for themselves. Look at that old man (he points to the oldest of the lot), he has people who work for him. When the work is much, he passes it on to them to get some of the work done. If you want him to dye your cloth, he has to charge you N500 per yard.In a month, how much we make is dependent on the season. Our main customers come from Niger, Mali, Chad and other West African countries. During the rains, they cannot come, because of the nature of the water from the Futa Jallon. So, they come here during the dry season, right after the rains. When they come, business booms again, because they come with plenty orders; although, this has reduced due to Boko Haram insurgency.The people from Niger only wash their clothes once, before they bring them for washing in the dry season. However, it is more useful to the people of Niger because of the relative famine in the country, these dyed clothes still look their best, even without washing for eight to nine months.These are the kind of times they pray for and they cant wait for these days to arrive.In a day, when business is good, someone can make up to N15000 from one pit, he said.Today, it might just be another historical enclave to the state government which may think it is just a tourists attraction now, but, for the people who work there, they need more government presence. They believe that, if the government cannot make the place more 21st century-compliant, at least, it should make the place a skills acquisition centre.The government has never called on us to impart the skills on any one; the only people we have been called to teach anything are the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) membersbut that is only when they are in camp and need to know what we do here, Baba said.For some, it is shocking that the government would allow the place rot away the way it is doing. Many of those working in the pits today could remember tailing their fathers as children when the former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher visited and many were in their teens when the President of Sudan Al-Bashir and other ambassadors stopped by to see the famous pits. \nClick here to read full news..","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Fond Memories Of Kofar Matas 500-Year-Old Dye Pits","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Western Africa","countryCode":"NG","country":"Nigeria"},"editorialRank":"5","name":"Latest Nigerian News.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"552291450","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Latest Nigerian News.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.latestnigeriannews.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://leadership.ng/features/569010/fond-memories-of-kofar-matas-500-year-old-dye-pits"],"sequenceId":"695194212274","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:49:31Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:13:47Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

They use the money to provide food and do other necessary things for us. These were the words of 10-year-old Daniel Pam (not real name).People call our business illegal and sometime security operatives chase us but we believe it is better than stealing or engaging in other vices. We are exploring the blessing of God on our land to our own benefit, he said while looking unperturbed.Many children, like Pam who ordinarily should be in the class room listening to their teachers impart knowledge to them, are unfortunately on the mining field, in many of the mining sites scattered in different locations in Jos and its environs, including some far away council areas where mining activities take place.Plateau State is reputed for mining with Jos its capital, widely referred to as the tin city state owing the abundance of tin and years of tin mining activities in the area.But over a century after mining commenced in parts of the state, school children and in some instances, children of school age now abandoned school for illegal mining activities in Plateau State.It is observed that this singular act is responsible for an unusually large number of students/pupil drop out to pursue illegal mining business in various location in the state.In places like Bassa, Jos South, Riyom and BarkinLadi local government council of the state where illegal mining activities are being carried out, scores of children are seen engaged in carrying the excavated minerals from one location to another for a token.In most of the sites visited, there are close to a thousand youths; this is aside married women who are engaged in illegal mining activities. Other businesses also thrive around the mining sites such as selling of local beer known as burukutu, and commercial sex work.Beyond the fact that there are so many youths engaged in the illegal activities, the key concern of stakeholders hinge on the fact that children who ordinarily should have been in schools swarm in and around the illegal mining sites.As against this background, stakeholders in education sector in Barkin-Ladi and Bassa local government area recently appealed to relevant government authorities to look into this ugly trend which they noted, was putting the education of the children and by implication, the future of the state in jeopardy.This development has led to increase in school drop out in the area, a seasoned educationist and retired principal, Solomon Titus noted.The stakeholders made the call when the commissioner for Secondary Education in the state Hon. Joseph Mairiga visited Government College Foron in Barkin-Ladi LGASpeaking to our correspondent, the area director of Education in Barkin-Ladi, Longbam Elizabeth who acknowledged the increase in students enrolment in public school as a result of the relative peace that has returned to the area, lamented that tin mining activities in the locality was distracting students from attending schools.Speaking in a similar manner, a community leader, Timothy David from Bassa local government area also called for intervention on the illegal mining activities in the area along Mista Ali.But while the community leader was silent on what many described as side effect of the mining bug that has bitten Plateau State children, the principal of Government Secondary School Mista Ali, a village along Jos-Zaria road, Mrs. JijidaJamo specifically noted that the ongoing illegal mining activities in the area was threatening the education of the children of the area.It is distracting the activities of the institution as most students would rather visit the site to work and make little money than attend school, she said and called for urgent intervention.Security Clamp Down On Illegal MinersIndications have emerged that security personnel are not resting on their oars in stemming the dangerous tide if for no other thing, but to save the future of the children who are increasingly being lured into abandoning their education for the illegal business.Only recently, the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDS) in the state arrested four persons for carrying out illegal mining activities around the Lamingo Dam, in Jos North local government area of the state.The states NSCDC public relations officer Naomi Cishak told journalist that the corps also arrested three other illegal miners around Mista Ali Bassa local government area of the state recently, bringing the number of those arrested to seven, a figure many describe insignificant considering the large number of persons allegedly engaged in the act, but a step in the right direction.Chishak warned residents to desist from mining around the Lamingo Dam which provides water for domestic and industrial use insisting that it was detrimental to the health of all residents of Jos City. She assured that that the NSCDC will intensify efforts at arresting such illegal miners. Our correspondent reports that other security agencies like the police are also not resting in their oars in combating the menace.A Peep Into History Of Mining On The PlateauOne of the things that earned fame for Plateau State is mining activities which was done by the Europeans before the discovery of oil in Nigeria. Indeed, before the oil boom, mining was one of the major sources of revenue generation in the country.By 1913, there were 108 mining companies registered by the Royal Niger Company and in 1943, tin mining on the Plateau was at its peak as there were about 80,000 African workers.Until 1960, Jos was the sixth largest producer of tin in the world while it was gathered that 225-kilometre land space was claimed by tin mining. In the 1970s, Nigeria produced an average of 10,000 tons of tin-ore annually.Experts estimated that miners on the Plateau dig up six million tons of soil every year. Sitting on the mineral-rich Plateau, Jos and its surrounding areas became prosperous and famous as a result of tin mining activities.It is gathered that mining activities on the Plateau was the single most important factor responsible for the wealth of some indigenous business men during the 1960s when the business boom.Residents Seek End To Illegal MiningObviously disturbed by the emerging trend and its implication for the state, some residents who spoke to our correspondent enjoined government and relevant stakeholders to synergize and ensure a lasting solution to the menace is achieved.Among the respondents who spoke to our correspondent was Dachan Dennis. He said the time was ripe for all hands to be on deck in combating the menace of illegal mining in general and specifically, the idea of luring children to be used as child labour in most of the illegal sites.This is a sad development and indeed, its an infraction on the rights of children, that is even if we dont condemn the business for the simple fact that it is illegally done, we must condemn it for attracting children.One thing which appears central in the views expressed by all the respondents is the need for government to step-up its surveillance role and ensure that all those engaged are arrested and made to face full wrath of the law.We are not opposed to people prospecting for minerals after all it is a source of revenue for us as a people but we frown at it being done illegally and more so that people use it to lure children to the sites for cheap labour, DomicToklong said. \nClick here to read full news..","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Nigeria news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Concerns Over Child Miners Of Plateau","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Western Africa","countryCode":"NG","country":"Nigeria"},"editorialRank":"5","name":"Latest Nigerian News.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"552291450","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Latest Nigerian News.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.latestnigeriannews.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://leadership.ng/news/569024/concerns-over-child-miners-of-plateau"],"sequenceId":"695194212439","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:50:42Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:13:47Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

This is heartbreaking,\" said Cimpian. \n \n\"This work offers insight into the intransigence of gender disparities in math and science,\" said David Moore, program director for the NSF Developmental Sciences program. \n \n\"It highlights the importance of attacking the problem of gender disparities in society, because it shows that we are influenced by the society we encounter starting when we are extremely young.\" \n \nsource: Xinhua","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"Girls less likely to think women are\u2026","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"GB","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Arabstoday.net","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"195129065","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"Arabstoday.net","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Arts"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.arabstoday.net"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.arabtoday.net/health-337/dubai-healthcare-city-authority-to-participate-in-arab-health-2017-044105","http://www.arabtoday.net/health-337/health-care-veterans-pioneers-awarded-030719"],"sequenceId":"695194214151","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:13:49Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Marilyn van Dijk, a veterinary assistant, kept treats in Meyer's hands or in front of the dog at all times. \n\nHe'd forget that he had a bum leg, put his paw down and reach around for the treat. \n\nMeyer, keeping hold on Tigger via a harness, cooed in the dog's ear: \"I've got you. I've got you.\" \n\nAnd then Tigger relaxed. He'd move his front paws forward as if on automatic pilot. Walk, walk, walk. \n\nMeyer moved up the speed on the treadmill, and Tigger walked, walked, walked some more, as if he's been doing it his entire young life. \n\nExcept he hasn't. \n\nTigger has never walked or run on four legs like most canines. \n\nHe has jumped like a kangaroo on his hind two legs or inched forward on his belly. But he has never kept up with his foster parents' other dogs because his front two legs were congenitally deformed by a defect called ectrodactyly, or split hand or lobster claw. \n\nThese days, Meyer has him on the underwater treadmill and doing planks on a large plastic peanut to help develop callouses on the limb and strengthen his core to protect his other limbs. He hopes to introduce the dog to cavalletti exercises (small jumps) soon to help him further strengthen his muscles and improve his balance. \n\n\"He's been compensating his whole life, so we take this slow,\" Meyer said. \n\nTigger weighs slightly more than his optimal weight of 55 pounds, said his surgeon, Dr. Jennifer Warnock. The physical therapy sessions may help with that. \n\nDr. Warnock hopes to perform the second repair surgery on Tigger's other front leg at the end of March. But Good and her partner, Troy Riggs, have some fundraising to do first. When the Statesman Journal first broke Tigger's story last summer and it spread across the country through the USA Today Network and The Huffington Post, more than $17,000 was raised in a few weeks. \n\nMore than $10,000 was spent on Tigger's first surgery, ICU stay, bandaging needs, and his medication. At least $2,000 or $3,000 still needs to be raised to pay for this next round of surgery, which will repair the second front limb and fuse one portion of the other newly fashioned leg. Dr. Warnock expects Tigger's condition to regress a bit as he recovers from the second surgery, but she's cautiously optimistic the dog could be walking on both front legs by summer. \n\nTigger may or may not need prosthetics. His X-rays currently show bone fusion, which is excellent, Warnock said. If his therapy continues to help him develop callouses where he never had them before, she believes the prognosis to be very good. \n\n\"We want to get him functioning without pain,\" Warnock said. \"I want him jumping on the couch, something most dogs take for granted. But Tigger does not.\" \n\nNow about those treats ...","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"CAROL MCALICE CURRIEStatesman Journal"},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Tigger starts water therapy as leg improves","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Fresno","zipCode":"93786","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Fresno","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Fresno Bee","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169688462","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3053"},"name":"Fresno Bee","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.fresnobee.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://stjr.nl/2iLOWc1"],"sequenceId":"695194216357","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:06:04Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:13:49Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The state used to be the hub of PDP in the North-west, with key stalwarts of the party at the national level from the state such as the National treasurer of the party, Alhaji Halidu Bala and Dr. Bello Haliru, an elder of the party former BoT chairman and former Acting national chairman of the party.But despite assuming the natural status of largest opposition party after the 2015 polls, PDP is gradually being emasculated by the ruling APC following incidences of decamping and cross carpeting of PDP members into APC.Reduced to the proverbial dog that does not bite some notable figures and stalwarts who have defected to APC include those who led the PDP campaign machinery in the 2015 gubernatorial election such as Alhaji Malami Abdulkadir , the Chairman of the PDP guber candidate campaign team, Alhaji Lawal Shuwa, the campaign Coordinator of PDP guber candidate , General Sarkin Yaki Bello .Other notable figures who left the PDP to APC were Alhaji Mansur Shehu, former State PDP chairman, Alhaji Nurudeen Usman Kangiwa, former SSG to the immediate past government of PDP under Governor Saidu Nasamu Dakingari and a host of others.PDPs shrinking profile in the state was also spelt out in the large number of decampees received by APC at the various local government areas visited by the APC committees to receive decampees from PDP.In an exclusive interview with LEADERSHIP Sunday, the Kebbi State APC chairman of elders committee, Alhaji Sani Hukuma Zauro hinted that apart from receiving decampees from various local government areas in the state, the party leadership was in consultation with the immediate former Governor of the state, Alhaji Saidu Nasamu Dakingari and the state chairman of PDP, Alhaji Musa Dan Illela, to forget the past and join APC.According to him Yes, I led a delegation to the state chairman of PDP; he organised an unprecedented dinner to welcome us in his residence in Birnin Kebbi.We are still consulting the former Gov. Alhaji Saidu Dakingari to join our fold in order to move the state forward; as soon as the consultation is over, there will be no opposition in Kebbi.He addedthe present Governor, Alhaji Atiku Bagudu, supported the former governor, Dakingari during his two terms of office. Some hypocrites, who were hell bent on seeing disunity in the state caused the misunderstanding between them through hypocritical mongering.But the PDP has remained the architect of its misfortunes in the state. The prevailing political leadership tussle of the PDP both at the national level and within the state where Alhaji Musa Dan Illela and Alhaji Ali Bagudo both claim leadership of the party has greatly contributed to the partys woes.Investigations carried out by LEADERSHIP Sunday revealed that most of the decampees left PDP in Kebbi because for them the party has lost focus, sense of direction while its followers are in disarray as to who their real leader is.An example was when a by election was to be conducted following demise of the member of the state house of assembly from Arewa local government, Abdullahi Yeldu, who was of the APC.There was utter confusion during the electioneering campaign when Alhaji Ali Bagudo and Alhaji Musa Dan Illela, visited Arewa local government both laying claim to the chairmanship of the PDP and campaigning for Alhaji Suleiman Yeldu against the APC candidate, Alhaji Salihu Biu.The APC candidate took advantage of the chaotic situation and won the election.Clearly PDP in Kebbi just like at the national, has not recovered from the devastating defeat at the 2015 guber election.The PDP lost almost all its political seats to the APC in both the State and Federal House of Assembly except that of Suru, Shanga and Bagudo local government areas.The lingering leadership tussle in the party, the chaotic ward and local government congresses in the state further aggravated the wounds of the PDP.Several reconciliation meetings from within the state and at the national level to bring the two warring factions of the PDP together proved abortive as they have all gone to court to seek for redress of the matter.In a response to the wave of notable PDP figures decamping to APC, the Publicity Relation Officer of the PDP, Ibrahim Umar Ummai, neither denied no confirmed the issue.He however acknowledged that the APC leadership visited the PDP top echelon including the Chairman, Alhaji Musa Dan Illela in his residence for consultation.Yes they were in the PDP chairman, Dan Illelas residence but I did not go with them and Dan Illela confirmed it to me too. I will not be surprised if the APC are now after our former Governor, Dakingari to lure him because of his record of achievements in the state over the years. The PDP chairman, Dan Illela too has large followership. I think they want to use the two figures to attract PDP members to decamp to APC.However, the two leaders did not categorically say they have decamped to APC, but if it is true that they decided to decamp to APC, then its unfortunate. They should realize that we are not happy and their ambition in no small measure represent a set back to democracy of the state.They should understand that God gives power to whom he wishes and takes away power when he likes. Alliance to the ruling party does not mean integrity, what makes integrity is for a politician to have principle and remain as a genuine and credible opposition.When asked if they are ready to decamp to APC should the former governor, Dakingari and PDP Chairman of the state, Musa Dan Illela decide to dump PDP, he replied I joined PDP since 1998 when PDP was first established, even before governor Dakingari joined PDP, he met me in the party, so simply because they decamp to APC will not make me dump PDP. But my advise to them is they should have a second thought before they finally decamp to APC and as for the so called mass decampees from local government areas, I still do not agree because the APC did not categorically specify the exact number that decamped or at least a breakdown from each local government area of the decampees.A stalwart of the PDP who recently decamped to APC from PDP is the former Chairman of Bunza Local Government Area, Alhaji Sambo Sarkin Yaki Zogirma. He confirmed to LEADERSHIP Sunday in a telephone conversation that it is true that he dumped the PDP to APC with all the ward exco members of the local government.Although he said nobody influenced his decision to decamp or gave any condition before he left the party to APC, he identified the current leadership crises facing the party in both the state and at national level as reasons for his decamping.Yes I have decamped to APC with all the ward members, my decision to join APC is purely personal. However, I must confess to you that the current impasse in PDP in the state and at the top was disturbing to me and other members. Peace is prerequisite in stabilizing the party but it is lacking in PDP. The two factions in the state instead of harmonising to become one are at loggerheads with each other hampering the unity of the party , he said.As the political scenario of Kebbi is now favouring the ruling APC, how will the party deal with the influx of decampees. Already there there is are complains from some founding members of the party that since the inception of the APC in the state, they have nothing or very little to show as dividends of democracy.You know nothing goes for nothing, 90% of us are into politics for personal gains before talking of developing the state or country. Personal gain in politics is primary to us and development for the state/country is secondary, if anyone decides to decamp, he is on his own, he or she should not expect any quick change or booty, Bello Jekada, a staunch APC supporter said. \nClick here to read full news..","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Nature news","group":"Science"}],"title":"Is PDP Going Into Extinction In Kebbi","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Western Africa","countryCode":"NG","country":"Nigeria"},"editorialRank":"5","name":"Latest Nigerian News.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"552291450","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Latest Nigerian News.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.latestnigeriannews.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://leadership.ng/features/569009/is-pdp-going-into-extinction-in-kebbi"],"sequenceId":"695194217837","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:49:31Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:13:49Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

As part of a closer look at this lost decorative art, Ulysse Nardin will launch a new edition Classico Manufacture with a blue 'Grand Feu' enamel dial.\n\nThe timepiece upholds the three fundamentals upon which Ulysse Nardin has built its reputation as a mechanical watchmaker: independent manufacturing, rare craftsmanship and an unceasing quest for innovation.\n\nThis Classico Manufacture is powered by the self-winding UN-320 caliber, a movement entirely designed and produced in-house by the Swiss manufacture. It incorporates the celebrated silicium hairspring and anchor es-capement, also designed and manufactured in-house. In fact, Ulysse Nardin pioneered the use of silicium parts in mechanical watchmaking, being the first to identify the advanced material's potential for improved precision and durability before others followed suit.\n\nThe second pillar of Ulysse Nardin's unique savoir-faire is evident in the artistry of the 'Grand Feu' enamel dial. Created by the Ulysse Nardin company, Donzé Cadrans, specialists in the fine art of enameling, this 'Grand Feu' enamel dial is a stunning blue. Only a handful of craftsmen have the necessary skill to master this 17th-century technique, and the blue dial of the Classico Manufacture 'Grand Feu', with its delicately translucid quality, is a fi-ne example of this challenging art.\n\nThe UN-320 movement and 'Grand Feu' enamel dial are set in a chic 40 mm stainless-steel case with a leather strap. The overall effect is one of streamlined simplicity: the hour and minute hands point to classic roman numer-al indexes, completed with a small seconds counter at 6 o'clock. Within lies a round date window: the wearer can easily set the date forwards or backwards, an incredible achievement for a mechanical watch.\n\nWith a competitive price point, the latest edition Classico Manufacture 'Grand Feu' is a more accessible expression of Ulysse Nardin's DNA: craftsmanship rooted in tradition, and savoir-faire anchored in innovation.\n\nTECHNICAL DATA\n\nReference\n\n3203-136-2/E3\n\nMovement\n\nCaliber UN-320, 11 ½''' In-house designed movement, with Ulysse Nardin certificate Silicium hairspring and anchor escapement 39 jewels \n\nPower-Reserve\n\napproximately 48 h \n\nWinding\n\nself-winding \n\nFunctions\n\nH/M/s/D small seconds-hand counter at 6 o'clock Forward and backward date corrector \n\nCase\n\nstainless steel, extra flat: 9.60 mm \n\nDial\n\nblue \u201cGrand Feu\u201d enamel with white roman numerals \n\nDiameter\n\n40 mm \n\nWater-resistance\n\n30 m \n\nCrystal\n\nanti-reflective sapphire crystal \n\nCase-back\n\nscrewed open case back with sapphire crystal \n\nStrap\n\nleather strap with a tang buckle","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Ulysse Nardin highlights the exquisite art of enameling with a translucid blue Classico Manufacture ...\u2026","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Western Asia","countryCode":"AE","country":"United Arab Emirates"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"GoDubai.com","feed":{"genre":"Press Release","tags":[],"id":"202689383","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"GoDubai.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard","Wires"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.godubai.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194218007","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:13:49Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

resistance to Trump\u2019s crackdown on Muslim immigration with large protests spreading at major airports across the country\n\n\"Victory\" the American Civil Liberties Union ACLU whose lawyers sued the government tweeted after US District Judge Ann Donnelly issued her decision\n\n\"Our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders\"\n\nTrump\u2019s sweeping executive order signed Friday suspends the arrival of refugees for at least 120 days and bars visas for travelers from seven Muslim majority countries for the next three months\n\nThe move which was implemented immediately by US authorities sparked large protests at major airports across the country At New York\u2019s John F Kennedy International Airport some of the 2000 demonstrators there chanted \"Let them in let them in\"\n\nLarge protests took place at the main airports for Washington Chicago Minneapolis Denver Los Angeles San Francisco and Dallas\n\nDonnelly\u2019s decision to issue a temporary stay \u2014 which stopped short of ruling on the constitutionality of Trump\u2019s order \u2014 came after dozens of people were detained at US airports following Trump\u2019s actions\n\nThe exact number of those affected is unclear but the judge ordered the government to provide lists of all those detained at US airports since the measure went into effect\n\nSending those travelers back to their home countries following Trump\u2019s order exposes them to \"substantial and irreparable injury\" wrote Donnelly who was appointed by Trump\u2019s Democratic predecessor Barack Obama\n\nA second federal judge in Virginia also issued a temporary order restricting immigration authorities for seven days from deporting legal permanent residents detained at Dulles Airport just outside Washington according to US media\n\n\u2013\u2018We were prepared\u2019\u2013 \n\n\"We knew that was coming \u2014 we were prepared\" said Camille

men on grounds of unlawful detention One of them \u2014 Hameed Khalid Darweesh who has worked as interpreter and in other roles for the US in Iraq \u2014 was in fact released on Saturday after being detained the day before\n\n\u2013\u2018We must fight\u2019\u2013 \n\nDemocratic Representative Jerrold Nadler who went to JFK to press for the release of those detained under Trump\u2019s measure said \"We must fight this executive order in the streets in the courts anywhere anytime We must resist We must fight\"\n\nTrump\u2019s pronouncement on Muslim immigration makes good on one of his most controversial campaign promises to subject travelers from Islamic countries to \"extreme vetting\"\u2014 which he declared would make America safe from \"radical Islamic terrorists\"\n\nThe targeted countries are Iran Iraq Libya Somalia Sudan Syria and Yemen\n\nDonnelly\u2019s decision shows that \"when President Trump enacts laws or executive orders that are unconstitutional and illegal the courts are there to defend everyone\u2019s rights\" ACLU executive director Anthony Romero said in leaving the emergency hearing\n\nThe ban has triggered political backlash including from Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans\n\nOrrin Hatch the most senior Republican in the US Senate spoke of America\u2019s \"legal and moral obligations to help the innocent victims of these terrible conflicts\"\n\n\"I strongly urge the new administration to move quickly to tailor its policy on visa issuance as narrowly as possible delivering on our security needs while reducing unnecessary burdens on the vast

washed up on a beach in Turkey in 2015 after a failed attempt to flee Syria\u2019s brutal war to join relatives in Canada\n\n\u2013 A long battle \u2013 \n\nThe rapid mobilization against the order suggests a protracted battle is shaping up between migrant advocates and Trump and his administration\n\n\"This is the opening salvo of a long battle that will go on in the courts\" said Michael Kagan a law professor at the University of Nevada Las Vegas who specializes in immigration issues\n\nHe said the outcome of the legal battle is unclear because \"we are in unchartered territory in modern

He also transmitted power to his second- in- command, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, the authority to act while he is away. The statement by Buharis spokesperson, Femi Adesina, further said that Buhari would also undergo medical check-ups during his vacation. It is surprising that no sooner had these got into public domain than the social media and a section of the orthodox print and electronic mediaTV and Radio stationswent berserk. They insinuated that President Buhari had either passed on in a London hospital or more outlandishly committed suicide while on his medical tourism for some undisclosed terminal ailment.It is dizzying that this is traceable to some foreign agencies based in Arizona in the United States. Checks have since confirmed that the hoax was the handiwork of cybersquatters and website spoofs, purporting to be Metro newspaper of UK or Huffington Post of United States owned by WILD WEST DOMAINS. According to whois.domaintools.com, the sitesHuffington was registered on November 19, 2016, and Metro on October 25, 2016. We are stupefied that Nigerian media, ever willing to seek validation for such outlandish stories from foreign media dedicated prime times and pages to celebrate this hogwash. These fake sites, apparently ignorant of diplomacy and protocols referred to the Nigerian Embassy in London, instead of High Commission as their sources and further committed a worse hara-kiri by alleging that a statement had been issued by the Nigerian mission. If the president actually dies, the announcement will be made in Abuja, not London!Presidential spokespersonsFemi Adesina and Garba Shehuhave been upbeat, debunking vehemently the snide reports and tried to out-do the Minister of Information, Lai Mohammed in condemning those indecorously celebrating morbidity. They have published pictures in the cyberspace showing the president relaxing and watching TV over there in the UK and another set of photographs, showing the Governor of Ogun State, Ibikunle Amosun and Senator Daisy Danjuma in a relaxed mood with President Buhari. But the wailers would not see these as portraying the true state of the President and assurances of him being in good health.It is benumbing that Nigerians and some so-called friends of Nigeria would wish the President dead. While we see this as an expression of the frustration of many with the state of affairs in the country, it beats us hollow that it has gained currency and all attempts at dousing the tension have further heated up the polity instead. We found it absurd how hate campaigners satanically brought the Vice President resigning his appointment into the whole absurdity. We cannot understand how the people react to a mans demise in a society like ours, where it is unheard of to speak ill of the dead. We are, however, not unmindful of the fact that reaction to someones death is totally dependent on how the man treated his people while alive and in power. That was the case when General Murtala Muhammed died in office in 1976 and later General Sani Abacha in 1998. We are also conscious of the lop-sidedness in the information management architecture of the government at the moment and failure to handle basic rules of media reportage of crises situations as we now have in our hands. Sad enough, Nigeria has a long history of leaders lying about their health and it may take another lifetime to know the truth about former President Umaru YarAdua, former Taraba State Governor Dambaba Suntai or even Patience, the wife of former President Goodluck Jonathan. Their illnesses were shrouded in mysteries as if they were superhuman. Their kitchen cabinet or cabals simply churned out conflicting reports about what should be seen as simply vicissitudes associated with human existence.We call on all agents of misinformation and those not through with the hogwash that was propaganda and hate campaign of the last general elections to know that politics needs to give way to policies and governance now. We need alternative actions and positions that can better the economy and social engineering in the country. Spin doctors in the corridors of powers must muster courageous professional dignity to discountenance patently false, inciting and potentially divisive actions and statements from enemies of the government. Reacting with puerile peevishness does not glamourise them nor sustain them in their high offices. For us, there is a time frame given for this holiday, Nigerians should be calm and wait for February 6, when the President is expected back in office. \n \n    Leadership Headlines Yesterday \n[Sat-28-Jan-2017]  \nBakassi Deep Seaport: Cross River Journalists Commend Gov Ayade \n \nN35.5m Alleged debt: Crisis In Bayelsa Owned Radio Deepens With Threat Of N100m Defamation Suit \n \nAbraka Farmers Recount Blood-Chilling Encounter With Herdsmen \n \nObaseki, Investors, Others Inspect Fertilizer Plant In Auchi, Okpella \n \nLow Turnout, Malfunctioned Card Readers Trail NASS Bye Election In Edo \n \nAisha Buhari Targets 3000 For Free Medical Treatment In Kogi \n \nAmbode, Mohammed, Osoba Harp On Entertainment, Tourism Sectors For Economic Growth \n \nConfusion In Ondo Assembly As Two Faction Lay Claim To Leadership \n \nAmbode, Mohammed, Osoba Harp On Entertainment, Tourism Sectors For Economic Growth \n  Click to view all Leadership headlines yesterday","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Leadership on Sun, 29 Jan"},"topics":[{"name":"Nigeria news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Who Wishes The President Dead","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Western Africa","countryCode":"NG","country":"Nigeria"},"editorialRank":"5","name":"Latest Nigerian News.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"552291450","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Latest Nigerian News.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.latestnigeriannews.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://leadership.ng/news/568988/bakassi-deep-seaport-cross-river-journalists-commend-gov-ayade","http://leadership.ng/news/568982/n35-5m-alleged-debt-crisis-in-bayelsa-owned-radio-deepens-with-threat-of-n100m-defamation-suit","http://leadership.ng/news/568976/abraka-farmers-recount-blood-chilling-encounter-with-herdsmen","http://leadership.ng/news/568964/obaseki-investors-others-inspect-fertilizer-plant-in-auchi-okpella","http://leadership.ng/news/568957/low-turnout-malfunctioned-card-readers-trail-nass-bye-election-in-edo","http://leadership.ng/news/568955/aisha-buhari-targets-3000-for-free-medical-treatment-in-kogi","http://leadership.ng/news/568948/ambode-mohammed-osoba-harp-on-entertainment-tourism-sectors-for-economic-growth-2","http://leadership.ng/news/568946/confusion-in-ondo-assembly-as-two-faction-lay-claim-to-leadership","http://leadership.ng/news/568944/ambode-mohammed-osoba-harp-on-entertainment-tourism-sectors-for-economic-growth"],"sequenceId":"695194220212","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:49:51Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:13:51Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It will also block entry for citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. \n\nThough the crackdown was expected, US Homeland Security officials continued interviews of refugees held by Australia on Nauru as late as Friday.\n\nMs Horrigan-Dixon received the medal of the Order of Australia in last week's Australia Day honours, recognition for more than 30 years of work to support waves of refugees arriving in Australia, including from Europe, China, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos and Thailand.\n\nShe said Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull should immediately explain how many people would go to the US.\n\n\"Australia needs to start thinking about how we can work with local groups in Canada,\" she said. \n\n\"The major problem remains the 1500-odd people being held on Manus Island and in Papua New Guinea, because no other country will accept them. \n\n\"Justin Trudeau and his government have welcomed people. Maybe we need a delegation over there, and Australia could take people Canada would have otherwise taken to get people off these islands.\" \n\nAn adviser to the St Mary's House of Welcome project in Fitzroy and founder of a series of local engagement and English-language programs, Ms Horrigan-Dixon said the Coalition and Labor had denied thousands of people the chance to build successful lives in Australia's cities and towns. \n\nShe said the reinstatement of temporary protection visas by the Abbott government in 2013 meant many asylum seekers living in the community were in limbo, while those given permanent resettlement were thriving. \n\n\"They want to be here and they want to work and settle. The thing they say they love the most is our democracy, our stable system of government and the inclusion and safety of Australia,\" Ms Horrigan-Dixon said. \n\n\"What we set out to do is think how would we treat these people if they were our own children?\n\n\"Everything has been teamwork, because we've had a common cause.\"\n\nCanada has accepted 39,671 Syrians since November 2015.\n\n\"After these poor people have suffered for years on Manus and Nauru, they need to be somewhere welcoming and Justin Trudeau has shown he's prepared to provide that,\" she said. \n\nFollow Tom McIlroy on","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Tom McIlroy"},"topics":[{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Negotiate with Trudeau for refugee resettlement, says advocate","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"AU","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"Melbourne Age","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169652301","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3545"},"name":"Melbourne Age","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Politics","Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.theage.com.au/","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.facebook.com/tcmcilroy"],"sequenceId":"695194222829","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:13:50Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}
