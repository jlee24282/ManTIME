That was eight years ago. \n \nWhat does your company do differently? \n \nOne of our tag lines is \u2018budget tours to destinations your mother would rather you stayed away from\u2019, while another is \u2018group tours for people who hate group tours\u2019. I\u2019m not into normal travel, although some people wouldn\u2019t go to the places I go to if I paid them. I design itineraries for trips that I want to go on and luckily there are a few people out there who want to do them too. \n \nApart from North Korea, where do you go? \n \nThis year we did our first trip to Venezuela, which was great \u2013 it was fascinating to see that the cult of personality around [late president Hugo] Chavez is still there. We\u2019ve done tours to Haiti, which is a very strange place. One of our specialities is frozen conflict zones: the unrecognised countries of Europe. We do tours to Transnistria between Moldova and the Ukraine; Nagorno-Karabakh between Armenia and Azerbaijan; and Abkhazia between Georgia and Russia. I\u2019m also adding some more. \n \nWhat\u2019s a typical day for you? \n \nI spend most of my time in China, and if I\u2019m not on a trip, I\u2019m usually on a train between one of our offices. There are lots of emails, lots of Skyping, and lots of research for where to go next. Sometimes trips take years to pull off. Our newest trips \u2013 to Eritrea and Somaliland \u2013 were difficult because Eritrea is what you might call \u2018politically interesting\u2019, and Somaliland is another of those unrecognised countries. On a tour, I\u2019m the first one up and the last one to bed, because there\u2019s always stuff to do and people always have questions. You\u2019ve constantly got to be on it in case there are issues. \n \nSuch as? \n \nThe time we got stuck at the Transnistria/Moldova border as they claimed we hadn\u2019t got the right paperwork. I had to pay a really big bribe in the end\u2026 It\u2019s all very well to say, \u2018Oh, the clients will understand,\u2019 but if people put their time and money and trust into you, it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re in a crazy place \u2013 you\u2019ve still got to deliver. \n \nWhy do you think people are attracted to the \u2018unusual\u2019 places you travel to? \n \nThe world is becoming one boring, monotonous place. People wear the same kind of clothes, eat the same fast food... When you look back a few hundred years these same people wanted to go west to explore and do crazy things, and now there\u2019s just less crazy stuff to do. I think our clients are modern-day versions of those folk. \n \nYou\u2019ve been to North Korea many times now \u2014 what\u2019s the appeal? \n \nI have a real affection for the people, they\u2019re some of the most friendly people around, with a really dry sense of humour. I think the country is certainly misunderstood and there are so many stories that just aren\u2019t true \u2013 like people being forced to get their hair cut like Kim Jong-un. I think my favourite memory goes right back to the first trip I made there. You\u2019re basically led to believe that the North Koreans don\u2019t talk to anyone, but we went out to the main public park and, in fact, they were all singing and dancing and having a great time, insisting that we join them and share their barbecue. \n \nWho are the friendliest people? \n \nWell, the people of North Korea are definitely friendly but they do need to warm to you for a bit first. Some of the friendliest people I\u2019ve met would be in Iran \u2013 very welcoming. \n \nAny tips for getting on with locals? \n \nYes \u2013 it\u2019s do what they do, even if it seems rude. In China for example, you\u2019ll see someone eating a chicken leg and they\u2019ll just put it on the table when they\u2019ve finished. You do the same. What you view as polite in your country isn\u2019t necessarily viewed as polite in theirs \u2013 in China they don\u2019t say thank you if you\u2019re considered friends or family, for instance. Also, don\u2019t talk, listen \u2013 especially when it comes to politics. \n \nAnd if the locals are hostile? \n \nStand your ground \u2013 to an extent. But don\u2019t be too aggressive. Generally, people react badly to aggression, but they act even worse to people who are really weak. \n \nIs the world as unsafe as people think it is? \n \nNo, it\u2019s extremely safe if you\u2019re not stupid. I\u2019ve been robbed a few times but I was in the wrong place at the wrong time and not being very clever. There\u2019s a big difference between the appearance of danger and genuine danger \u2013 you just need to know where to draw the line. What I especially love is getting to the airport when you\u2019re leaving a country and you can look back and go, \u2018Yeah. I know this place now\u2019. \n \nHow about packages to the Moon? \n \nYes! And Mars.

Wives, daughters, and in-laws have played the role of the first lady of the land. \n \nMelania Trump is the second immigrant to join the sisterhood. And she has thus far approached the role with caution. There have been no announcements of staff for her--no chief of staff, no communications director, no social secretary. \n \nShe was lovely and gracious and typically reserved on inauguration day. She arrived at the White House on the morning of Jan. 20 with a gift for Michelle Obama wrapped in a Tiffany blue box that matched her cashmere coat and dress by Ralph Lauren. No word from either the Trump or Obama staff on what the box contained but one guess is a picture frame, given the box's shape and size. \n \nIn a remarked contrast, Michelle Obama's coolness about the day was written across her face. A fierce campaigner for Hillary Clinton and a fiery critic of Donald Trump, the outgoing first lady had no smile and a tight expression on her face as she left the White House with Melania Trump and then throughout the ceremony at the Capitol. She flashed a rare smile to Hillary Clinton and to President George W. Bush, to whom she is close. \n \nFirst lady historian Carl Sferrazza Anthony told RealClearPolitics that it was the bond of first ladyhood that brought Michelle Obama out to campaign for Hillary Clinton. \n \n\"It read to me as 'I really understand what she's been through,'\" he said. \n \nAfter the swearing-in ceremony as the Obamas prepared to board the Marine One helicopter on the Capitol grounds, Michelle hugged Melania, but she only offered the new president her hand. He kissed her on both cheeks. It's believed to be one of the few contacts they've had since the campaign, when Mrs. Obama slammed Trump--though not by name--for his comments about women. And in a rare move for Trump, who showed no fear in criticizing anyone who spoke against him, he stayed silent on the then-first lady. \n \nThere were four former first ladies at the handover of power: Obama, Laura Bush, Hillary Clinton, and Rosalynn Carter. \n \nIt was Clinton's day too, but hardly in the way she wanted. The former first lady, senator from New York and secretary of state had all eyes on her as she watched her rival take the oath for the office she twice ran for. \n \nClinton's day was summed up in one split-screen shot blasted across the news networks early that morning: She and Bill Clinton walking hand-in-hand in the basement of the Capitol to attend the inauguration as guests while Obama and Trump, the two men who have denied her the office she sought, left the White House in a limo for their ride along Pennsylvania Avenue. \n \nNow the focus turns to 47-year-old Melania Trump. But it also turns to 36-year-old Ivanka Trump, the oldest daughter of the president. \n \nQuestions have been raised about what role each woman will play in the Trump East Wing. \n \nMelania will not move to Washington right away but stay in New York City so her 10-year-old son Barron Trump can finish the school year, raising speculation Ivanka will take on many of the ceremonial roles of the first lady. \n \nNo formal role has been announced for the first daughter, whose husband, Jared Kushner, will be a senior adviser in the West Wing. \n \nBut she shot down talk she'd overshadow her stepmother. \n \n\"I think it's an inappropriate observation,\" Ivanka told ABC News last week when asked if she'd be first lady. \"There is one first lady, and she'll do remarkable things.\" \n \nBut Ivanka has laid out priorities of her own for her father's time in the White House: policies to promote women and ones focused on children. \n \nIn contrast, little has been heard from Melania. In one of her rare campaign appearances, she said she would focus on women's issues and work to eliminate cyber bullying, but there have been no follow-up announcements. \n \nRep. Marsha Blackburn, who was a member of Trump's transition committee, told RealClearPolitics recently that she had not spoken to the incoming first lady, but she had spoken to Ivanka. \n \n\"I have talked with Ivanka primarily about the legislation that we're going work on dealing with families and child care, tax incentives, dependent care, things of that nature,\" she said. \n \nHistorian Anthony pointed out first lady-daughter tag teams have been common throughout White House history: Margaret Truman often accompanied her mother, Bess Truman, on official events while Julie Nixon filled in for Pat Nixon, who wearied of the intense press coverage that came as the Watergate scandal worsened. \n \nBut no matter how stepmother and stepdaughter decide what their respective roles will be, the former will have the support of those who came before her. \n \n\"Women who are incumbent first ladies or recently might have left the White House oftentimes do form a very close bond with the sort of a senior member of the club,\" Anthony said. \"For example, Hillary Clinton was very close to Lady Bird Johnson. At Betty Ford's funeral, Rosalynn Carter delivered the eulogy. And the two of them, even though their husbands ran against one another in '76, became very close.\" \n \nEmily Goodin is the managing editor of RealClearPolitics. \n \nEditorial on 01/29/2","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"EMILY GOODIN RealClearPolitics"},"topics":[{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Melania Trump: latest first lady","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Washington","zipCode":"72765","state":"Arkansas","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Springdale","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"North West Arkansas Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169669649","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"938"},"name":"North West Arkansas Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://nwaonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204207484","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:10:29Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:27:11Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The \u201csanitised\u201d report was declassified recently by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). \n \nThe report, whose complete title is not entirely available as it is part deleted, was prepared on the basis of inputs available to the CIA till January 1986. \n \nThe very first sentence of the report\u2019s available (undeleted) page reads: \u201cPrime Minister Rajiv Gandhi faces at least an even chance of assassination before his tenure in office ends in 1989.\u201d It, however, later clearly said that \u201cassassination is the major near-term threat\u201d to him. \n \nOver five years later, Gandhi was assassinated at Sriperumbudur in Tamil Nadu on May 21, 1991. \n \nThe first section titled \u201cKey Judgments\u201d analyses and deliberates upon what likely scenario would emerge in the domestic and international political situation if there is a sudden change in leadership minus Rajiv Gandhi and the likely impact on India\u2019s relations with the US, the then USSR and the region. \n \nThreats \n \nIt also dealt with the threats posed to Gandhi\u2019s life by various extremist groups at that time and the likely fallout of his murder. \n \n\u201cIf Gandhi fell to a Sikh or Kashmiri Muslim assassin, widespread communal violence probably would erupt even if strong preventive security measures \u2014 including deployment of Army and paramilitary troops across northern India \u2014 were taken by the Indian President ...... (deleted),\u201d it said. \n \nInterestingly, it also names P.V. Narasimha Rao and V.P. Singh, who could be the \u201cinterim successor\u201d and \u201clikely candidates\u201d in case of sudden exit by Rajiv. Rao took over as the Prime Minister in 1991. \n \nIn a section, titled \u2018The Threat of Assassination: Stability in Jeopardy\u2019, the report says \u201cIn our view, there is at least an even chance in the next several years of an assassination, most likely by extremist Sikhs or disgruntled Kashmiri Muslims who have targeted Rajiv,\u201d besides \u201ca fanatical Hindu\u201d. \n \nSince a significant portion of this section is deleted, it is not clear whether Sri Lankan Tamil extremists were also dealt with in the analysis. However, another section deals in-depth with Rajiv\u2019s mediation efforts to resolve \u201cthe conflict between militant Sri Lankan Tamils and the Sinhalese-dominated government in Colombo...\u201d \n \nGandhi's departure \n \nBesides Gandhi\u2019s possible assassination, the report also analysed various scenarios of his \u201cabrupt departure\u201d from the political scene before 1989. \n \n\u201cAlthough we believe assassination is the major near-term threat to Rajiv\u2019s tenure, any of several other events could cause his abrupt departure from the political scene before 1989,\u201d it said while listing out several other possibilities including \u201chis death from natural causes or by accident\u201c. \n \nIt ruled out the possibility of a decision by him \u201cto resign out of frustration\u201d, saying \u201cwe see no signs of this and believe it would be out of character\u201c. \n \nThe CIA report also noted: \u201cWe suspect, however, that Rajiv would calculate \u2014 as we do \u2014 that he and his kin would be targets for extremist violence even if he left public office.\u201d \n \nIn a section called \u201cImplications for the United States\u201d, the report says \u201cWe believe (Rajiv) Gandhi\u2019s death would represent a significant blow to US interests, regardless of the circumstances of the succession.\u201d \n \n\u201d...We believe Indo-US relations could also suffer as a result of domestic political changes following Rajiv\u2019s assassination.\u201d \n \nThe report assessed Rajiv\u2019s policies ranging from dealing with extremists, foreign relations (including Sri Lankan Tamil issue) to promoting acquisition of selected foreign technology\u201d among others, and their outcome. \n \n\u201cAlthough some of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi\u2019s policies will continue to encounter serious resistance over the next several years, we believe his dominance of the Indian political scene is secure until at least the end of his present term of office in December 1989, barring his incapacitation or death,\u201d it said. \n \nThe report also dealt with the possibility of a \u201cnational government\u201d taking over in case of a sudden exit by Rajiv, while discounting the possibility of a military coup in such a scenario. \n \nSeveral portions of the 23-page report were deleted before the CIA decided to release it under the Freedom of Information Act.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Sri Lanka news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"}],"title":"39mins \u2018CIA assessed Rajiv assassination 5 years before he was killed\u2019","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"The Hindu","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169592117","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"917"},"name":"The Hindu","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.hindu.com","publisher":"The Hindu Group"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204216216","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:27:19Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Immigration lawyers, activists and Democratic politicians reacted furiously, and many worked to help marooned travelers find a way back home. \n \nIn Brooklyn, the American Civil Liberties Union sought to block the order in an emergency hearing, a large crowd chanting \"Let them stay, it's the American way!\u201d outside the courthouse. \n \nHundreds of protesters gathered at airports in Dallas, Chicago, New York and elsewhere while inside, anxious family members waited and worried for travelers. \n \nAt Chicago O'Hare International Airport, brothers Bardia and Ayden Noohi waited for four hours for their father Kasra Noohi -who has an Iranian passport and a U.S. green card - to be allowed through. \n \nThey knew Mr. Trump had pledged tougher rules but did not expect they would affect holders of green cards, which allow foreigners to live and work in the United States. \n \n\u201cI didn't thing he'd actually do it,\u201d Bardia Noohi (32), said. \u201cA lot of politicians just talk.\u201d \n \nMr. Trump, who took office just over a week ago, had promised during his campaign what he called \u201cextreme vetting\u201d to do more to protect Americans from terror attacks. \n \nHe told reporters in the Oval Office that his order was \u201cnot a Muslim ban\u201d and said the measures were long over due. \n \n\u201cIt's working out very nicely. You see it at the airports, you see it all over,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \n \n\u201cWe're going to have a very, very strict ban and we're going to have extreme vetting, which we should have had in this country for many years.\u201d \n \nCHAOS \n \nThe ban affects travelers with passports from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Green card holders will not be allowed back in until they are re-screened. \n \nThe order seeks to prioritize refugees fleeing religious persecution. In a television interview, Mr. Trump said the measure was aimed at helping Christians in Syria. \n \nConfusion abounded at airports as immigration and customs officials struggled to interpret the new rules, with some legal residents who were in the air when the order was issued detained at airports upon arrival. \n \nA chaotic scene played out in the arrivals terminal at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, where a group of lawyers had filed a lawsuit on behalf of two Iraqi men who had worked for the U.S. military who were in the air when Mr. Trump signed the order. \n \nThousands of refugees seeking entry were thrown into limbo. Melanie Nezer of the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, a Jewish group that works with refugees, said she knew of roughly 2,000 who were booked to come to the United States next week. \n \nThe U.S. technology industry, a major employer of foreignworkers, hit back on Saturday, with some leaders calling the order immoral and un-American. \n \nColleges also spoke out on behalf of students from the countries, and warned students in the United States that they should avoid travel lest they not be allowed back in. \n \nArab travelers in the Middle East and North Africa said the order was humiliating and discriminatory. It drew criticism from U.S. Western allies including France, Germany and Britain. \n \nIran condemned the order as an \u201copen affront against the Muslim world and the Iranian nation\u201d and vowed to retaliate. Of the seven countries targeted, Iran sends the most visitors to the United States each year - around 35,000 in 2015, according to the Department of Homeland Security. \n \nSudan called the action \u201cvery unfortunate\u201d after Washington lifted sanctions on the country just weeks ago for cooperation on combating terrorism. A Yemeni official expressed dismay at the ban. \n \nCanadians welcome those fleeing persecution, terror and war\"regardless of your faith,\u201d Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a Twitter post. \n \nLEGAL RESIDENTS STUNNED \n \nDuring the presidential campaign, Trump promised to clampdown on immigration as a way to prevent attacks. He first proposed a ban on Muslims entering the United States, modifying that later to \u201cextreme vetting\u201d of immigrants from certain countries. \n \nIt was unclear how many legal permanent residents would be affected. A senior U.S. administration official said on Saturday that green card holders from the seven affected countries have to be cleared into the United States on a case-by-case basis. \n \nAccording to State Department guidance, travelers who have dual nationality of one of these countries will not be permitted for 90 days to enter the United States. \n \nLegal residents of the United States were plunged into despair at the prospect of being unable to return to the United States or being separated from family members trapped abroad. \n \nIn Cairo, five Iraqi passengers and one Yemeni were barred from boarding an Egypt Air flight to New York on Saturday, sources at Cairo airport said. Dutch airline KLM said on Saturday it had refused carriage to the United States to seven passengers from predominately Muslim countries. \n \nU.S. AGENCIES SCRAMBLE \n \nIn Washington, the agencies charged with handling immigration and refugee issues grappled with how to interpret the measure, and enforcement was uneven. \n \nU.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they were not consulted on the executive order and in some casesonly learned the details as they were made public. \n \nAt the State Department, a senior official said lawyers were working closely with their counterparts at Homeland Security to interpret the executive order, which allows entry to people affected by the order when it is in the \u201cnational interest.\u201d \n \nHowever, a federal law enforcement official said, \u201cIt's unclear at this point what the threshold of national interest is.\u201d \n \nSenior administration officials said it would have been \"reckless\u201d to broadcast details of the order in advance of new security measures. The officials told reporters that Homeland Security now has guidance for airlines. \n \n\u201cI don't think anyone is going to take this lying down,\" said Cleveland immigration lawyer David Leopold. \u201cThis is the tip of the spear and more litigation is coming.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Egypt news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Yemen news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Political unrest news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Religion news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Lawsuits news","group":"Business"}],"title":"4hrs Chaos, protests, lawsuit as Trump orders halt on some Muslim immigrants","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"The Hindu","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169592117","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"917"},"name":"The Hindu","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.hindu.com","publisher":"The Hindu Group"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204216755","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:27:20Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

>> diced onions cooking up and add 2 stocks of celery and that is a normal sized onion and what is great about soup you don't have to be that specific. if you have a big onion or only half an onion left in the fridge. >> jason: throw it in there! >> don't worry about it. and saute the onion with some garlic and i like to be generous and might be 3 or 4 and that is just the way it goes. >> keep the vampires away. >> a couple of saute these vegetable in red pepper. >> what's it is difference between the red and yellow and orange and green? >> i don't know if it's true but i heard a red pepper and green pepper are the same pepper, it it is just red is more ripe but then you get a yellow one? you need like a gardner for that and i'm not a i can hardly on then it is pepper and we're going to saute and that takes a little longer and once you get those cooking for a couple of minutes and add a can of diced tomatoes. not going to get tomatoes and cut them. canned diced tomatoes. and you can even with the soup cheat and go to the store and get the frozen pre?diced onions. like you don't even have to cut an onion. you can make it that easy. >> i cry cutting onions all the time. >> want to know the trick about that? >> if you do it under water, right? >> but then how do you not burn your hand off? to cut? >> so what's the trick? >> cold. if the onion is cold, it's less likely to spray up the onion fumes and there is that trick of the day. >> learn something new every day. >> and i don't know how to the stove on hotter and and that is going to cook for about a minute and i actually smoke our lentils overnight because you don't have to do that. >> jason: softens them up. >> we only have a few minutes in between the two segments so i wanted to have it ready for this. >> jason: tv magic! >> yes, tv magic. and we'll just add those >> jason: how much is that? two cups? >> two cups after they've been soaked so i just sort of took the half a bag and lentils and dumped some in the bowl with the water left in on the counter last night and glad i did and thought i have to remember to soak those lentils so i remembered and it is the sign of the miracle and salt. use as much ear as little salt. if you, later on, wh waiting for this to cook fresh dill and parsley. if that's not your thing add some cumin and maybe crushed red pepper and maybe a different flavor profile. it's a lemon and something you can make your own and whatever flavors you like. >> all right. >> back in the good with the tasty and healthy dish. >> when we cook in the schools with the kids, the smell of onions and garlic and all the teachers come by. >> and now jason said the only thing you didn't get to touch on was how much water. >> we put 4 cups of water and go flew it real quick and we sauted onion and garlic and peper and carrots and celery with a couple of each and the onion and little bit of garlic. >> people probably have it at home, right? >> yes. and it is stuff that lasts a long time in the fridge. if you have a perper, great, if you don't, put it in. >> kathlynn: if you don't like certain things, leave them out. >> or put them in and cut them really small and that way you may start to learn to develop a like for it but if you have a big chunk of something you don't like, you won't like it. >> kathlynn: let me ask you this. is it something your child is kind of into vegetables but not really. you could convince them to like the peppers? >> it works with the 600 kids we work with in the system with happy healthy cooks. the kids are part of preparing the food so you cut with them. they tear the dill. they tear parsley. take a little taste. you cut the pepper. >> that's the best part. taking taste. >> take a tiny taste of pepper and the more you do that, maybe the first time they're not going to be if you have the pickiest of picky, but the you do that with them, it is an investment of time and it takes longer to cook dinner but food is powerful and it either makes you really sick over a long time or keeps you healthy. >> and that is what all focus on, right? >> exactly. >> kathlynn: and many dishes are tasty and gr >> they're all actually loaded with fruits and vegetables and lintels and black eyed peas and things like that and they make everything in the classroom with the help of volunteers and go cook it in the classroom and eat it. and it is amazing. last week we made african stew with collard greenssinger, corn, tomatoes, all of these things that separately they taste. >> kathlynn: we have 30 seconds ask been letting it ?? and been letting it cool off. and said wait until last second. >> this takes 15 minutes to cook, maybe 20. make sure everything is and tender. and add salt to taste. that's nice especially for the weekend! >> it will be nice and warm and it freezes really well, too, so always, always, always make a double batch. >> kathlynn: sounds great! the recipe online. always good \n   \nYou Might Like","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Good Day Cafe- Middle Eastern lentil soup","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"5","name":"NewsR.in","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"535022491","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"168"},"name":"NewsR.in","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://newsr.in"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204240147","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-27T16:06:12Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:27:33Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The request for documents was spurred by an incident at the museum on Jan. 20, during which a pinata bearing the resemblance of President Donald Trump was struck several times and then hung from the rafters. \n \nPueblo Republican Brian Mater also submitted a request for El Pueblo records. The state has not yet responded to his demands. \n \nIn its email to Navarro, History Colorado Human Resources Director Dany McCoy revealed that the budget for El Pueblo during fiscal year 2017 is $317,364, of which $153,064 is from limited gaming funds and $164,300 is from the museum cash fund where all earned revenues are deposited (rentals, admissions, educational programs, retail sales, etc.). \n \nMcCoy went on to state that their contact info for Chicanos Against Trump, the local organization that organized the Inauguration Day protest, was Vicente Martinez Ortega. \n \nNavarro asked for copies of emails and other communication addressed to or sent by El Pueblo staff regarding the anti-Trump rally. \n \nIn the email response, McCoy said, \u201cThere was only one email between (sic) from Mr. Ortega asking one of our employees about the layout of the building.\u201d \n \nIn response to Navarro\u2019s question about who hung the pinata, McCoy said, \u201cThe event organizer Mr. Ortega and his team.\u201d \n \nThe Republican who represents Colorado\u2019s House District 47 then asked if El Pueblo Museum had a \u201cset of standards.\u201d In response, McCoy said, \u201cWe have a contract that we are currently in the process of updating,\u201d \n \n\u201cI\u2019m disheartened that this has happened,\u201d wrote Navarro in an email to The Pueblo Chieftain. \u201cIt has cast a cloud over the El Pueblo History Museum, and for that I\u2019m concerned. \n \n\u201cThe El Pueblo History Museum is an attribute of the community of Pueblo and all of Southern Colorado,\u201d continued Navarro. \u201cI believe a lesson has been learned here by many parties, including myself, and again, steps are being taken to ensure this never happens again. \n \n\u201cThe El Pueblo History Museum is a great piece of all that Pueblo has to offer, but it must always be remembered, especially by staff, that it is a taxpayer-funded entity, and it should be treated as such. \n \n\u201cI\u2019ll continue to monitor this, and I\u2019m confident progress is being made to aid in the fair and equitable treatment of each and every group. \n \n\u201cI thank History Colorado and the El Pueblo History Museum for being responsive to me and my office, on what I consider a very serious and offensive incident,\u201d she said. \n \njfairman@chieftain.com","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"State responds to request for El Pueblo records","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Pueblo","zipCode":"81003","state":"Colorado","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Pueblo","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Pueblo Chieftain Online","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169701228","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"576"},"name":"Pueblo Chieftain Online","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Politics","Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.chieftain.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204254958","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:57:04Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:27:32Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

This growth would bring the total number of overseas journeys from 68.7 million in 2016 to 103.4 million by 2021\u2014exceeding China\u2019s expected GDP growth in the same period. \n \n103.4 million outbound journeys in 2021 would position China not only as the largest tourism source market, but also as the by far most important source market in Asia Pacific\u2014representing approximately 40 percent of all travel from Asia Pacific by 2021. The second and third runner ups, South Korea and India, are projected to only account for between a fourth and a fifth of Chinese outbound travel respectively. \n \nImportantly, MasterCard\u2019s research does not account for Chinese travel to China\u2019s Special Administrative Regions (SARs), which until recently have accounted for over half of China\u2019s outbound travel. In 2016 alone, Hong Kong and Macau received over 60 million Chinese tourists combined, which still represents a decline on 2015\u2019s figures. Assuming that Chinese travel to SARs remains relatively stagnant in the coming 5-year period, that would bring the total number of Chinese tourists to the region of 160 million outbound journeys by 2021. \n \nChina is projected to remain the by far largest tourism source market in Asia Pacific. (Data from MasterCard) \n \nThe report also finds that China has an enormous potential for growth as its catching up with the propensity of travel in developed countries across the Asia Pacific. In Singapore, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, the ratio of outbound travel exceeds 100 percent\u2014meaning that, on average, at least one person per household travels internationally every year. In China, this ratio stood at 15.6 percent in 2016, underlining the room for future growth in China as economy catches up with more developed economies in the region. Even so, China\u2019s ratio of outbound travel is higher than that in many other developing Asian markets. For example, India, Myanmar, Indonesia, and Bangladesh all report ratios lower than 10 percent. China\u2019s ratio of outbound travel is projected to reach 23 percent by 2021, putting it some 17 percentage points behind Japan\u2014the developed economy with the lowest rate of international travel in Asia Pacific. \n \nIn contrast to many other developing economies in the Asia Pacific, the projected growth of outbound travel originating in China is not due to a growing number of households, but due to increasingly affluent Chinese households. The report finds that Chinese outbound tourism will grow at a rate of 8.5 percent per year between 2016 and 2021, whereas the total number of households is only expected to grow at 0.4 percent per year in the same period. Instead, it argues that the number of households which earn between US$ 10,000 and US$ 30,000 is more indicative of future tourism growth. The number of households that falls in this category (or above) is projected to reach 48.8 percent of all Chinese households by 2021 and will act as the main engine of tourism growth in this period. \n \nIndeed, if nothing stands in the way of China\u2019s continued GDP growth, the future looks bright for global Chinese travel. \n \nThe post appeared first on Jing Daily . \n \nJing Daily \n    Previous article    Next article","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Asia-Pacific latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"China news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Report: Number of Chinese Overseas Journeys to Increase by 50.5% in Five-Year Period","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"South-Eastern Asia","countryCode":"TH","country":"Thailand"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"News EasyBranches.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"591774460","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"News EasyBranches.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://news.easybranches.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://newsroom.mastercard.com/asia-pacific/press-releases/latest-mastercard-report-forecasts-exponential-boom-in-outbound-travel-from-asia-pacifics-emerging-markets/","https://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/01/07/donald-trump-says-he-favors-big-tariffs-on-chinese-exports/","https://jingdaily.com/report-number-chinese-overseas-journeys-increase-50-5-percent-five-year-period/","https://jingdaily.com/"],"sequenceId":"695204255131","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:24:36Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:27:32Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

 Asian News Share the joy \n                                 \nTHERE have been concerns over the Philippine police force going rogue and using President Duterte\u2019s bloody war on drugs as a cover for their activities following allegations of extortion, abduction, murder and the framing of people. \n \nAccording to the Manila Times , multiple scandals have been uncovered following last week\u2019s revelation that a South Korean businessman was strangled to death inside the national police headquarters in October when he was kidnapped by anti-drug officers who were looking to extort money from his family. \n \n\u201cIt is hard for the all-out war on illegal drugs to succeed because we have a problem with members of the police force taking advantage,\u201d the news outlet quoted Senator Panfilo Lacson, an ex-national police chief and a member of Duterte\u2019s ruling coalition, as saying. \n \nDuterte has in the past promised to shield the police from prosecution if they are charged with killing drug suspects as part of the crackdown on drugs. \n \nSEE ALSO:  Philippines: Spotlight on police immunity after \u2018for-profit\u2019 killing of South Korean \n \nA government investigation revealed the three officers who killed Jee Ick-joo were members of the Anti-Illegal Drugs Group based in the Philippine National Police headquarters in Camp Crame in Metro Manila. \n \nThe death of the businessman comes as the Philippine police face growing criticism from rights groups and some lawmakers, who say cover-ups and abuses of police power are rampant. \n \nThe Human Rights Watch has spoken out about the revelation, calling it an \u201cominous indicator\u201d of the breakdown of the rule of law under Duterte. \n \n\u201cDuterte has pledged effective immunity  for police who kill in the name of his drug war,\u201d Phelim Kine, the group\u2019s Asia division deputy director said. \n \n\u201cHe underscored his own personal contempt for human rights and rule of law on Dec 12 when he publicly announced that he had  personally killed suspected drug users  and dealers while mayor of Davao City,\u201dKine added. \n \nDuterte has publically apologised for the murder of the South Korean national and called for severe punishment to be meted out to the culprits behind the act. \n \nSEE ALSO:  Philippines: Duterte wants to execute police behind South Korean\u2019s murder \n \nHe called again for the death penalty to be reinstated so that he can hang 20 criminals a day. \n \n\u201cI will see to it that they are sentenced to the maximum,\u201d he said of the policemen. \u201cYou give that power to me back again, I will execute them\u2026 I\u2019ll hang them in one day, 20 of them \u2013 20 a day.\u201d he warned. \n \nCapital punishment has been a priority for Duterte, whose allies introduced a death penalty bill in Congress on June 30 last year, the same day as his inauguration. \n \nMeanwhile, a Senate investigation into Jee\u2019s

But plenty did, culminating in a 17-12 loss to Argentina that meant the three-time defending champions finished sixth.  \n \nSouth Africa won the final, with a convincing win 26-6 over Fiji \n \nThe World Sevens Series continues in Sydney this weekend and New Zealand co-coach Waldrom is desperate for the change in scenery to also herald a change of fortunes. The team had been fairly chipper after beating England 24-0 on Sunday afternoon, but the Argentine defeat knocked the smile off everyone's face. \n \n  \n   \n   \n \n\"It's been a pretty tough week. We had to deal with a lot around the old [Gordon] Tietjens controversy, the poor [crowd] numbers and the lack of support and then the coach getting Bell's Palsy so his face is a bit munted and he's talking a bit funny,\" Waldrom said. \n \n\"The guys have been through a lot and to walk away on that note's been disappointing, because we know we're better than that.\" \n \nBell's Palsy is a kind of facial paralysis which affected Waldrom in the last few days and was the last thing he needed. \n \nParticularly at a time when the team have been under pressure regarding the lack of spectator interest in this tournament. One of the - many - remedies mooted has been for New Zealand to pick more \"name\" players. Who knows, it might work. In the meantime, though, that kind of talk hardly makes young players feel they deserve to be here representing New Zealand. \n \n\"We've tried to stay away from it. It's nothing we can control. Obviously better performances might get more support,\" said Waldrom. \n \nFiji's supporters at Westpac Stadium appeared to outnumber - and definitely out-sung - New Zealand's in Sunday's quarterfinal and that hurt the team. \n \n\"Obviously we were out-supported by the Fijians in that one and to me it felt the Argentinian crowd was even louder than ours. That's a little bit disappointing for the boys that when they do get to play in front of a home crowd, it's not there.\" \n \nA lack of support won't hurt so much when the team hit Sydney where Waldrom is confident they'll be better. They'll definitely need to be, because they can't continue to make the sort of soft errors and missed tackles that thwarted their title aspirations in Wellington. \n \n\"There was some pretty stern words from everyone after that [Argentine] game and we're certainly good enough. You've just got to look at some of the games yesterday [Saturday] and the England game,\" Waldrom said. \n \n\"If we can put in six games like that then we can certainly be a contender for the cup.\" \n \nTim Mikkelson hobbled off early against Argentina and captain Scott Curry copped a few knocks too. Waldrom indicated that New Zealand would probably take the same side to an event at which they're again the defending champions. \n \nSouth Africa will be the undoubted favourites in Sydney after claiming their dominant win in Wellington.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"HAMISH BIDWELL"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Sydney or the bush for NZ","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"NZ","country":"New Zealand"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Marlborough Express","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169681155","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1076"},"name":"Marlborough Express","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://stuff.co.nz"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204258050","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:27:33Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The plan: Bike the country's \"southernmost century,\" cycling-speak for a 100-mile journey in a single day, from Key Largo to Key West. \n\nWe all know that plans, especially in travel, often go awry. Last-minute logistical glitches meant my husband and I had to spread the ride over two days instead of one. \n\nThat turned out to be a coup. It forced us to slow down and savor an experience that spanned the spectrum from goose-bump-inducing euphoria to hair-raising fear involving semi trucks, Seven Mile Bridge, and the prospect of becoming shark chum by plummeting 65 feet into the Atlantic Ocean. This ride gave me all the feels. \n\nMy husband and I were making a two-day trip from mile marker 100 in Key Largo all the way down to mile marker 0 in Key West. We rented hybrid bikes and cycled roughly 50 miles to Marathon, then caught a ride back to our Key Largo hotel. The next morning, we picked up where we'd left off in Marathon and cycled the remaining 50 miles to what's literally the end of the road: the southern terminus of U.S. Highway 1, which starts more than 2,300 miles away, in Fort Kent, Maine. (We saw at least 100 cyclists with an organization called Pedal Across Wisconsin doing a similar ride on a five-night, round-trip journey between Key Largo and Key West; floridakeysbikeride.com.) \n\nThe irony of cycling through the picturesque Keys is that much of the ride isn't particularly scenic - until it is. Then it's a showstopper. Biking over dozens of bridges provided infinite vistas of tranquil water with more blue hues than a Sherwin-Williams warehouse. Palm trees swayed in the wind, and leggy herons stood guard in tangles of mangrove roots. But these highlights were interrupted by long stretches of strip malls and billboards flanking some of the more developed sections of the route. We often were within earshot of the roar of traffic on U.S. Highway 1. Sometimes you have no choice but to bike on the road shoulder, which might be as wide as 10 feet or as narrow as three. \n\nEven quieter segments of the trail pose hazards, like oblivious motorists pulling out of driveways and bright-green iguanas playing Frogger on the bike path. But if you stay alert and are in reasonably good shape, the ride is doable. And it's a ride worth doing, especially when you consider the route's fascinating history. \n\nA little more than a century ago, the only way to reach Key West was by boat. Millionaire Henry Flagler changed that with his wildly ambitious plan - initially dubbed Flagler's Folly - to build an overseas railroad connecting the Keys to the mainland. The undertaking involved unprecedented feats of engineering, including the construction of a seven-mile bridge over open water. \n\n\"The building of 'the railroad across the ocean' was a colossal piece of work, born of the same impulse that made individuals believe that pyramids could be raised, cathedrals erected, and continents tamed,\" Les Standiford wrote in his 2002 best seller, Last Train to Paradise , a must-read for anyone traveling the Keys. \n\nDeemed the Eighth Wonder of the World when it opened in 1912, the railroad was largely destroyed by the infamous Labor Day hurricane of 1935. The ferocious storm killed hundreds of workers - many of them World War I veterans - who were in the Keys to work on the Overseas Highway, a predecessor of today's asphalt lifeline between the Keys and the Florida peninsula. \n\nTheir cremated remains are part of a hurricane monument at mile marker 82 in Islamorada (where much of the Netflix series Bloodline is filmed), one of our first stops. It was the kind of short-but-worthwhile side trip we likely wouldn't have made if we'd had to mow down 100 miles in a day. \n\nIf we'd stuck to our original plan to do a century ride, we also probably would have blown right by Robbie's Marina, where you can feed massive tarpon by hand. We would have missed spotting endangered Key deer prance into the woods as we tacked on a few extra miles for a conch-fritter lunch at No Name Pub, a dive bar on Big Pine Key. The inside of this onetime brothel is covered with dollar bills. \"A quarter million,\" said our waitress, who must wish she had a buck for every time customers asked, \"How many?\" \n\nA more leisurely pace also meant we could poke around the beaches of Bahia Honda State Park and take a break at mile marker 40's Veterans Memorial Park, where a rickety boat that carried 17 Cubans to U.S. shores in 2013 is on display. \n\nMy favorite part of the ride was cruising along Long Key Viaduct, a parade of concrete arches that once served Flagler's railroad and the old Overseas Highway. Cars have since been booted off to a new bridge built parallel to the viaduct, bequeathing this two-plus-mile span to fishermen, joggers, and cyclists. We rode alongside soaring pelicans searching for prey below, where the Atlantic meets the Gulf. \n\nIslamorada resident Mark Terrill, owner of Key Largo Bike & Adventure Tours, said most cyclists' favorite part is going over Seven Mile Bridge. I was too busy catastrophizing scenarios of 18-wheelers sending me to a watery grave to enjoy the scenery. \n\nThe exhilaration of surviving those seven miles unscathed stayed with me all the way into Key West, where we casually pedaled along the Atlantic to the Southernmost Point monument, where Cuba - some 90 miles away - was closer than our Key Largo hotel. \n\nMile marker 0 was just a short ride from there, followed by an even shorter ride to the Green Parrot Bar for a celebratory beer. \n\nWe took our time - and plenty of photos - at these last few stops. After all, it's the Keys.

Like Mardi Gras, it's traditionally a last chance for excess before the solemn season of Lent for Catholics. \n\nThe annual bash is practically synonymous with Rio de Janeiro. But it's also a big deal in the Caribbean, which, despite popular belief, isn't one homogeneous destination. Each Caribbean island has its own history, cuisine, culture - and its own take on Carnival. \n\nOn some islands, the event is tied to Catholic traditions. On others, it commemorates slave emancipation or the harvest. \n\nSome celebrations are held in February, others in the summer. One thing they all have in common: the chance to party like a local. \n\nThe pounding beat of African tumba music fills the air at a Carnival that's lively but not as risque as the bashes on other islands. This is a Carnival you'd be comfortable taking the kids to. \n\nThe Feb. 26 and 28 parades are a big deal. Sixty marching groups stream down the streets of Willemstad, a capital city so picture-perfect you'll think you've landed on the set of a movie about a quaint Caribbean island. \n\nTwo good spots to enjoy the festivities are the Carnival Dome near the beginning of the parade route and the Carnival Tribune, near the end. Both have seating, music, food, and drink. \n\nCuracao prides itself on making sure everyone can enjoy the party. Considered one of the Caribbean's most gay-friendly destinations, it has hotels catering to gay tourists and an annual gay pride parade. \n\n\"Our melting pot history has led to a progressive 'live and let live' philosophy that has long welcomed the LGBT community,\" says Andre Rojer of the Curacao Tourist Board. \n\nWhere to stay: Sitting on a UNESCO World Heritage Site, Kura Hulanda Village ( www.kurahulanda.com ) features 18th- and 19th-century buildings restored to their original splendor. Cobblestone paths meander through lush gardens filled with art and inviting pools. An on-site museum details how Curacao was once the epicenter of the slave trade in the Caribbean. Rates start at $180 a night during Carnival. \n\nInsider tip: When it's time to eat, head to the food stalls of Plasa Bieu, also known as the Old Market. Sample the popular goat stew or traditional tutu, a dish of ground-up beans with sugar and other goodies. \n\nwww.curacaocarnival.info \n\nTrinidad is the mecca for Carnival in the Caribbean. The riotous, multicultural spectacle starts with the predawn J'ouvert (daybreak in French Creole) on Carnival Monday, Feb. 27, when people throw paint on one another. It culminates with the Parade of the Bands, in which several thousand scantily clad costumed revelers dance to pulsating soca. \n\nBirthplace of the steel pan, Trinidad is an oil-rich country whose ports have long been flooded with empty oil drums. Resourceful locals turned them into instruments. Panorama, the world's largest steel pan competition, is held over several days in January and February, leading up to Carnival, but the big final competition is Feb. 25 in Queen's Park Savannah in Port of Spain. Many of the preliminary competitions are held in Port of Spain's pan yards, where tourists are welcome to hear steel pan bands practice throughout the year. \n\nTour companies like Banwari Experience ( www.banwaricaribbean.com ) will help you \"play mas\" with a Carnival band, which means you don a costume and march in the parade. They also can set you up to be part of fetes, Carnival-themed parties held all over the island that include your food and drink. \n\nWhere to stay: Downtown Port of Spain's traffic is at its worst during Carnival, so consider the Hilton Trinidad ( www.hiltoncaribbean.com/destinations/trinidad.html ), within walking distance of Queen's Park Savannah, where many events are held. Carnival rates begin at $500 a night. \n\nInsider tip: If someone asks whether you want a wine, they're not wondering whether you'd like a chardonnay. They're asking whether you want to wind . . . as in wind your hips or gyrate, presumably in tandem with the person asking. \n\nwww.ncctt.org/new \n\nKnown for its towering Piton mountains, breathtaking beaches, and a world-class jazz festival, St. Lucia used to hold its Carnival before Lent. The country changed the festival date in 1999 to eliminate competition with Carnival titan Trinidad and Tobago and to attract more tourists to its lush playground in the summer. \n\nSt. Lucian Carnival is a more intimate affair that remains on the smaller side, with roughly eight bands participating in the festivities. It culminates with the three-mile-long Parade of the Bands through the capital city of Castries. \n\nWhere to stay: Main events are on the north end of the island. The oceanfront St. James's Club Morgan Bay ( www.morganbayresort.com ) is a good choice in that area. Rates start at $291 a night for two people, including all food and drink. \n\nInsider tip: You'll hear the locals talk about \"liming.\" Simply put, to lime is to party or hang out. It refers to the art of doing nothing while sharing food, drink, and laughter with friends. And no matter what season you visit, the fishing village of Gros Islet hosts a lively street party on Friday nights, full of barbecue, drinks, and dancing. \n\nwww.stlucia.org/events/carnival \n\nBarbados could give Trinidad a run for the title of top party island - just don't call Barbados' event Carnival. It's Crop Over, and it's so important to this former British colony that it's a national holiday. As the name suggests, Crop Over celebrates the end of the harvest on an island that was once among the world's largest sugar producers. \n\nSoca music competitions, the coronation of the Crop Over king and queen, parties, boat rides, and parades - nearly two months of nonstop festivities lead up to the main event, Kadooment Day, the first Monday in August, when revelers parade through the streets in barely there bikinis loaded with sequins and feathered finery. You might even spot pop star Rihanna, who often returns to her native island for the festivities. \n\nWhere to stay: Many events take place in the bustling capital, Bridgetown. To be in the heart of the party, try the beachfront Hilton Barbados. The concierge will assist with tickets to events and fetes. ( www.hiltonbarbadosresort.com ). Rates start at $199. \n\nInsider tip: Take a bathing suit along on Kadooment Day. After parading and partying in the streets of Bridgetown, revelers head to the outskirts for a swim at Brandons Beach. \n\nwww.visitbarbados.org/things-to-do","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Andrea Guthmann"},"topics":[],"title":"Celebrate Carnival throughout the CAribbean","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Philadelphia","zipCode":"19101","state":"Pennsylvania","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Philadelphia","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Philly.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657485","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4851"},"name":"Philly.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Recreation","Consumer","TravelTourism"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://philly.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.kurahulanda.com/","http://www.curacaocarnival.info/","http://www.banwaricaribbean.com/","http://www.hiltoncaribbean.com/destinations/trinidad.html","http://www.ncctt.org/new","http://www.morganbayresort.com/","http://www.stlucia.org/events/carnival","http://www.hiltonbarbadosresort.com/","http://www.visitbarbados.org/things-to-do"],"sequenceId":"695204258917","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-27T14:30:24Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:27:41Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Salzburg attracts a crowd with all those churches and castles. But within easy striking distance of both big-name tickets are delightful corners of Austria where English-speakers are rare, crowds are thinner, and the gemuetlichkeit is pervasive. \n\nI have an inside track. My explorations of the country's lesser-known delights have been led by my Austrian-born mother and cousins who have lived in Upper Austria since birth. During my stays there, they've squired me on frequent day trips to a multitude of spots unfamiliar to most American tourists but beloved among Austrians. By the end of my most recent visit, I had come up with a top-three list: The spa village of Bad Schallerbach, the Lake District town of Gmunden, and the Alpine village of Kaprun. \n\nOn a balmy Friday night in late September, I threw open the oversize windows in my street-front hotel to the captivating sounds of traditional Austrian folk music. Bad Schallerbach locals sat at the outdoor cafe, drinking steins of beer, laughing and talking as an accordion played in the background. The scene was the very definition of the difficult-to-translate gemuetlichkeit , a state of being that conveys friendliness, good cheer, and relaxation. \n\nThe town of about 4,000 residents consists of just a few blocks of shops and restaurants, yet it is visited by more than 400,000 people each year, almost all Austrian, German, and Czech. Some come for the concerts: For more than 20 years, it has hosted a series of live shows (70 are scheduled for 2017) showcasing genres as disparate as klezmer and classical. \n\nBut most make the trip for the waters. Since 1918, the town's natural sulfur springs have attracted those in search of a cure. Most recently, with an infusion of public dollars, it has morphed into EurothermenResort, a massive spa-themed facility situated in the midst of a 22-acre botanical garden along the Trattnach River. \n\nAnchored by a luxurious 150-room hotel connected to the spa via a covered walkway, the resort is a series of indoor and outdoor pools, hot springs, waterslides, and lounging areas so extensive that a first-timer easily can get lost. \n\nOn a Tuesday afternoon in early autumn, one end of the resort, called Tropicana, hosted a group of mostly young adults bellied up to the pool bar with Caribbean-style drinks in hand. Off to the side, a few people lounged in smaller specialty pools infused with salt, iodine, selenium, and sulfur. Covered with a towering retractable glass roof and dominated by an indoor-outdoor pool, Tropicana also has a 5,000-gallon tropical-fish aquarium, sandy beaches, and huge plastic palm trees that, if you squint, could pass for the real thing. \n\nAt the resort's other end, several blocks away, families with squealing children occupied Aquapulco, a pirate-themed water park with five slides and an array of sprays, buckets, and fountains. Between Tropicana and Aquapulco were more pools. In one, called Colorama, visitors swam laps beneath a 16-yard-wide movie screen while listening to an underwater music system. Another large pool was populated by those who prefer swimming in the buff. \n\nThose who like dry heat headed to an area called AusZeit das Sauna-Bergdorf (Break at the Sauna Mountain Village), which has more than 40 sauna-related facilities, including the women-only Dirndl Spa and one set in the world's largest cider barrel. Interspersed throughout the resort were lunching couples, families resting under infrared heaters, women heading into the massage area, and older visitors waiting at the Physikarium health center for supervised medical treatments. \n\nAdjacent to the resort, the free-access parklands offer a respite from the spa crowds. Botanica Park is a quiet haven that attracts a mix of joggers, parents pushing strollers, dog walkers, and plant lovers. During an afternoon run, I stopped frequently to examine the various gardens, including one that focuses on medicinal plants and another that offers a place to meditate. Walking back to the hotel, I wandered past an atrium where a traditionally garbed Bavarian brass band was performing for wine-sipping employees of a local business - gemuetlichkeit defined on a typical afternoon in Bad Schallerbach. \n\nWe piled into two cars at my cousin's home in the tiny village of Krenglbach for the 40-minute drive to Gmunden, one of many scenic lakeside towns in Austria's Salzkammergut region. We're not strangers to this historic resort town on the northern end of crystal-clear Traunsee (Lake Traun). Repeat visits never get old, with the promise of a long hike along postcard-perfect trails punctuated by a lovely piece of pastry at a waterfront cafe. \n\nOn an unseasonably warm day in early October, sailboats drifted past Schloss Ort, an island castle founded in 1080 and connected to the mainland via wooden bridge. The Gisela, a 145-year-old restored paddle steamboat, ferried sightseers along the lake. A backdrop of cornflower-blue sky and towering mountains dominated by the distinctive and boulderlike 5,500-foot Traunstein transformed the view into something straight out of The Sound of Music . \n\nAfter drinking in the fanciful scene during a walk along the quiet eastern edge of the town's waterfront, we headed for its newest attraction, the Grunberg Mountain cable cars, which started operating in summer 2014. \n\nBackpack-equipped hikers gathered at the bottom of the 3,300-foot mountain while we took the easy way up via one of the two 60-passenger cable cars. \n\nDuring our ascent, a sweeping view of Upper Austria unfolded, eventually giving us far-off looks at the cities of Linz and Wels. Immediately below us, glamorous lakefront homes turned into dollhouses. \n\nAtop the mountain, children zoomed down a long, red slide that starts at a lodge-style restaurant and ends at a playground. As their parents sipped sturdy beers and tucked into plates of schnitzel, the kids raced along the playground's zip wire and rope walk. A few yards away, intrepid adventurers lined up to ride the Gruenberg Flitzer, a toboggan on a rail that heads straight down for nearly a mile before returning via a roped ski lift. \n\nBut these man-made amenities play second fiddle to the star of the show, the surrounding mountains. Dozens of walking-stick-equipped hikers, including a few wearing traditional lederhosen, traversed the miles of hiking paths that connect Grunberg Mountain to Laudachsee (Lake Laudach). More skilled hikers tackled the difficult ascent to the Traunstein. \n\nSated by a hearty lunch of wursts and beer, we again took the easy way off the mountain via cable car. A hike down would have earned us another hour or two of idle gemuetlichkeit over strudel and coffee at one of the town cafes. Next time, we'll walk. \n\nFifty miles southwest of Salzburg, in the heart of the Austrian Alps, the adjacent towns of Zell am See and Kaprun draw more than 500,000 tourists annually. The extensive ski network, offering more than 81 miles of runs, draws enthusiasts of winter sports from around the globe. In summer, visitors come to hike, bike, and boat. \n\nBut my mother yearned to once again visit a nearby, far-less-known sight that had captured her imagination decades earlier - the Kaprun dams and mountain reservoirs. Though designed to provide electricity to the Salzburg region, construction of Austria's version of the Hoover Dam had an unintended consequence: It created easy access to an area brimming with natural beauty. \n\nThe two dams and adjoining reservoirs - Mooserboden and Wasserfallboden - have a dark history. Started by the Nazis in 1938, the initial stages were built by thousands of prisoners of war and enslaved workers under horrible conditions; the official worker-death tally is 120, but many more may have perished. After the war, the dams were completed, first by German and Austrian POWs, then by workers who included my uncle. Heralded as a perfect example of postwar reconstruction, it wasn't until years later that the role of slave labor was acknowledged. \n\nOn a blue-sky, puffy-white-clouds day, we took the drive to Kaprun. Pulling in to an inauspicious parking garage after more than two hours and then walking a few yards to catch a bus outside a gift shop, I was underwhelmed. What could my mother be going on about? Several minutes into the first bus ride, I started to get it. \n\nOn a narrow road through rock tunnels, some so narrow I could have touched the walls through an open window, we were first dropped off at the area's base camp, close to the 4,000-foot mark. From there, we lined up for a standing spot on the open platform of the Larchwand, Europe's longest diagonal outdoor elevator. \n\nAnd once released from that, we boarded yet another bus, which went through more tunnels and past towering mountains, the almost artificially blue Wasserfallboden, and steep hills dotted with goats, horses, and cows. \n\nWhen we finally arrived at the top dam, at 6,700 feet, the panorama unfolded. Snowcapped mountains above the tree line, lower conifer-covered rolling hills, fields of wildflowers, a lone boat plying the virescent Mooserboden reservoir, a group of schoolchildren hiking in the distance all combined to create an unreal backdrop of beauty. \n\nWe walked along the dam before heading to the mountaintop restaurant for more wursts with a view, spending a leisurely afternoon reminiscing with my 92-year-old mother about her childhood in pre-World War II Austria. Threadbare clothes were handed down from sister to sister, bales of hay were their beds, the outhouse seemed miles away during bitterly cold winters, and there was never a time when they weren't hungry. \n\nBut she doesn't remember her childhood as particularly sad. They were always surrounded by beautiful scenery and Austrian gemuetlichkeit .","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Carol Sottili"},"topics":[],"title":"Austria beyond Vienna and Salzburg: The locals' favorites","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Philadelphia","zipCode":"19101","state":"Pennsylvania","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Philadelphia","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Philly.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657485","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4851"},"name":"Philly.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Recreation","Consumer","TravelTourism"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://philly.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204259706","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-27T19:36:13Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:27:42Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It\u2019s altogether unclear they have any such authority. \n \nDeschutes County District Attorney John Hummel says COCC\u2019s officers do not possess lawful police powers . From his analysis of Oregon law, the officers can enforce campus traffic regulations, but that\u2019s about it. Hummel has told the college that he would initiate criminal charges against it if the officers continue to act without lawful authority. \n \nCOCC has presented no legal analysis to the public to prove Hummel wrong. \n \nWe pointed out in an editorial in August that COCC public safety officers should not be using blue lights on their vehicles. Under Oregon law, blue lights are supposed to mean only one thing: the police. \n \nBut the concerns with COCC\u2019s public safety operations go back further than that. In 2015, Hummel and Bend Police Chief Jim Porter began asking questions. That was after a botched COCC investigation into an iPhone that was apparently set up to record in a women\u2019s restroom on campus. Then in July, Kaylee Sawyer was allegedly kidnapped and killed by Edwin Lara, who was at the time a COCC public safety officer. \n \nCOCC President Shirley Metcalf announced several changes in a message to the campus this week. For now, the campus public safety officers are not going to make any arrests. The blue lights in their vehicles have been disabled. The bars to create barriers between the front and back seats in the public safety vehicles have been removed. Other practices, including the look of the officer\u2019s uniforms, will be evaluated. \n \nThose are good steps, though it\u2019s worth asking why it took so long for COCC to change its practices. \n \nThere can be disagreements about interpreting the law. And COCC\u2019s leadership wants to ensure it has a safe campus. But it was clearly more than just possible that COCC was allowing its officers to act without lawful authority. The campus leadership should have put a stop to it immediately until the issue could be sorted out. That is not what happened.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Police news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Editorial: No pretend cops on COCC campus","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Jackson","zipCode":"97502","state":"Oregon","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Central Point","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Bend Bulletin","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169668815","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2479"},"name":"Bend Bulletin","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bendbulletin.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204260720","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:27:42Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

He stayed home and watched the comedy lineup on CBS because it was too good to miss. (This was back when, if you didn\u2019t see a TV show, you missed it.) \n \nThat says it all. Mary Tyler Moore was not cool. The character she played was not cool. The comedy lineup she anchored \u2014 which included \u201cThe Bob Newhart Show,\u201d which she also produced \u2014 was not cool. But somehow, Moore and Co. stood the whole idea of watching TV on Saturday night on its head, so it became cool. \n \nMoore, who died Wednesday, played a classic type that we need more of right now. She was part of a long parade of decent do-rights that has also included Alex Reiger (\u201cTaxi\u201d), Jimmy Stewart as Jeff Smith, Newhart\u2019s nebbishes, Leslie Knope, Jimmy Stewart as George Bailey, and, right now, Kimmy Schmidt, who might as well be Mary Richards\u2019 loopy granddaughter, right down to the adorable overbite. \n \nThese characters live in the middle, where we live. They\u2019re not the smartest, the funniest or the hottest. They might not even be the most virtuous, although they generally are surrounded by knaves. \n \nAs Laura Petrie of \u201cThe Dick Van Dyke Show,\u201d Moore was a sweetheart, not a siren. She told \u201cFresh Air\u201d host Terry Gross that \u201cwomen liked me. They were not envious of the fact that their husbands had a crush on me. \u2026 And this was an odd thing because they were also able to identify with me as a friend, as a girlfriend.\u201d \n \nMoore\u2019s ex-husband and producer Grant Tinker, who died two months ago, said the initial audience testing of \u201cThe Mary Tyler Moore Show\u201d reported back that Mary Richards was \u201ca loser.\u201d \n \nNot a loser. Just one of us. Mike Nichols said there are two reasons for a joke: \u201cbecause it\u2019s funny and because it\u2019s you.\u201d Comedy works when we see ourselves. \n \nMoore as Richards got an astonishing amount of mileage out of the pure struggle to be a halfway decent person in a world not entirely set up for that. Her most famous performance came in the \u201cDeath of Chuckles\u201d episode, when \u2014 at the funeral of a clown \u2014 she chastises her snarky co-workers for making dead clown jokes. \n \nBut during the eulogy, she gets the giggles. And what follows is three hilarious minutes of eruptions and stiflings. Finally the eulogist tells her it\u2019s OK to laugh, at which point she wails with grief. And writ large across this legendary performance is the message, \u201cThis is how hard it is to be good, to be nice! Most people don\u2019t even try! I\u2019m trying, and this happens!\u201d \n \nThey don\u2019t fill this job anymore. \n \n\u201cVeep\u201d is full of brilliant writing, but there\u2019s no Mary. They stopped putting Marys in these ensemble shows during the 1990s, which should worry us. It\u2019s as if TV creators said: \u201cYou don\u2019t need somebody who has a heart, who\u2019s gentle and a little shy, who\u2019s no dummy, who mostly does the right thing. You\u2019ll identify just fine with this crowd of creeps and freaks and wiseasses.\u201d \n \nI guess we do. But something nice and very, very funny got lost when we mothballed the heart of Mary Richards. \n \nEvery so often, when I think our radio show was pretty good \u2014 maybe not our best, but pretty good \u2014 I borrow the motto of Chuckles the Clown. \n \nI walk out of the studio and into the newsroom and say, \u201cThat was \u2018a little song, a little dance, a little seltzer down your pants.\u2019\u201d \n \nNot the coolest thing to say. But who needs to be cool? Right, Mary? \n \n\u2014 Colin McEnroe is a columnist for the Hartford Courant and a radio host on Connecticut Public Radio.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Column: Mary Richards was one of us \u2014 uncool and with a heart","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Jackson","zipCode":"97502","state":"Oregon","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Central Point","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Bend Bulletin","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169668815","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2479"},"name":"Bend Bulletin","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bendbulletin.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204261812","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:27:43Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

So he has now banned people from seven countries, including Syria, which I fled with my family in 2014. But we were thoroughly vetted before we came here, just like other refugees \u2014 exhaustively, endlessly vetted. We are not terrorists. And if we\u2019d been stopped from coming here, we would be suffering horribly right now. \n \nWhen our 7-day-old son died while receiving treatment for jaundice in a Damascus hospital, my husband and I decided to flee the country with our daughters. We ended up in a cramped apartment in Tripoli, Lebanon, where we soon spent our savings; we were living hand-to-mouth. \n \nAfter a year, I received a call from the United Nations asking if my family would like to resettle somewhere else. Based on our documents, stories and circumstances \u2014 our large family, five girls, my husband\u2019s potential as a healthy worker \u2014 we had been deemed eligible to apply for refugee status. \n \nWe could not return home to Syria. We could not continue living on the brink of starvation in Lebanon. A safe option was available: We began the application process to come to the United States. \n \nThe process started with a series of meetings with U.S. government representatives \u2014 at least five in-person interviews with each of us and countless phone conversations. The questions were very detailed: about my family, my friends, how I spent my time. The interviewers often knew the answers to the questions before they asked them. They asked about my life going back to the day I was born; they even knew the location of the hospital. My story is my story, so I knew that the details would match their information. But I was stunned by the level of scrutiny and the length of the process. \n \nEach member of the family told their story, and those stories had to be consistent with interviews given by other people who knew us. If our answers didn\u2019t match information U.S. officials already had, or if they couldn\u2019t validate our information, we didn\u2019t progress to the next step. \n \nFinally, more than a year after we began applying and more than two years after we fled Damascus, we were cleared in December 2014 to resettle in Baltimore. We had $30 for the journey. During an airport layover in Germany, I bought a drink and, without realizing it, spent a third of our savings on a $10 bottle of water. My husband joked that now we were really finished and should just turn back. \n \nWe, too, have been appalled by the Islamic State\u2019s terrorist attacks around the world, and we condemn them wholeheartedly. My family and I lived through horrific acts like these. I believe the screening we underwent was so intense, so thorough and so long that it would be impossible for militants to come here. \n \nTrump says he wants to fight terrorism, but instead he\u2019s fighting the victims of terrorism. I want to ask him: If America is based on diverse people from different cultures and countries, what right do you have to tell suffering Muslims that they are unwelcome. Even your wife is an immigrant! Is it because she\u2019s not from a Muslim country? \n \nWith Trump\u2019s policy, we are telling people who are dying: We can\u2019t help you. Stay where you are, and die there. \n \n\u2014 Linda J. and her family are Syrian refugees who made their way from Damascus to Lebanon and then to Baltimore.

The writer illuminated rigid ideologies but obfuscated the issue of the Electoral College. At a time when we have elected a president while the opposing party received 2.6 million more votes, this deserves honest scrutiny. \n \nTo quote the writer: \u201cThe purpose of the Electoral College is to select a winner who represents a geographically broader portion of the country despite not receiving the majority vote.\u201d This is as good a definition as I have found, but what does it really mean? It means that the Electoral College is a device to override the popular vote. \n \nAnother way this is often put: to give the states with small populations more weight against those with large populations. But why? How can the people of \u201cgeographically broader portion,\u201d or smaller states, benefit, beyond having all of their votes count? If the Electoral College strengthens the vote of one portion, does it not do so at the expense of another portion, and undermine the bedrock democratic principle of one person, one vote? \n \nThat reveals this institution for what it is \u2014 undemocratic and open to manipulation. \n \nSo why do we still have it? Because those who support it do not wish to entrust the outcomes of presidential elections to the people! We may vote, but the outcome is managed beyond our reach. \n \nThe test of any election system is the fair, democratic result it yields. When we wind up with results in which millions of voters are deprived of their voice, it is clear that the process is neither fair nor democratic. How, then, can the Electoral College be justified? \n \nThe words \u201cto select a winner\u201d offer a clue. Above and beyond our voting, there is a power that selects the ultimate outcome, regardless of how we vote. Powers hiding behind a complex, archaic construct can overrule the will of the people and have the ultimate say. And that in no way qualifies as democratic. \n \nIn the last election, 2.6 million voters were essentially disenfranchised. This could include you, or me, and equals the populations of our four smallest states. It renders arguments about voting fraud picayune in comparison. \n \nDemocratic arguments against the Electoral College are often countered with the vacuous notion that American is not a democracy, but rather a representative republic. This may be technically correct, yet is hardly convincing. Does this mean that we Americans are OK with something less than fair and democratic in our national elections? If you are for the Electoral College today because it helped your champion win, consider that next time your side may just as easily lose because of it. \n \nWe live today in a deeply troubled nation. Voter turnout is pitifully low. Too many have come to believe that their votes don\u2019t matter and point to what has just happened again as proof. It behooves us to measure our institutions by today\u2019s effects, rather than by an outdated reverence for their original intent. Change is the primary constant in human affairs. No human institution can usefully endure forever. \n \nIt comes down to what kind of nation we want to be. Are we content to live in a nation in which our vote may count, or not count, depending on what serves an apparatus beyond direct accountability? Or do we want to live in a nation of transparent and accountable voting, based on one person, one vote? In that case we need to recognize the Electoral College for what it is, and say good riddance. \n \n\u2014 Al Baensch lives in Prineville.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Education news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Letter: Say good riddance to Electoral College","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Jackson","zipCode":"97502","state":"Oregon","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Central Point","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Bend Bulletin","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169668815","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2479"},"name":"Bend Bulletin","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bendbulletin.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204262262","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:27:43Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

But it shouldn\u2019t erase the troubling memory of one major element of Trump\u2019s inaugural address. \n \nThe foreign policy section has received far less attention than so revolutionary a declaration deserved. It radically redefined the American national interest as understood since World War II. \n \nTrump outlined a world in which foreign relations are collapsed into a zero-sum game. They gain, we lose. As in: \u201cFor many decades, we\u2019ve enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry; subsidized the armies of other countries\u201d while depleting our own. And most provocatively this: \u201cThe wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed all across the world.\u201d \n \nJFK\u2019s inaugural pledged to support any friend and oppose any foe to assure the success of liberty. Note that Trump makes no distinction between friend and foe (and no reference to liberty). They\u2019re all out to use, exploit and surpass us. \n \nNo more, declared Trump: \u201cFrom this day forward, it\u2019s going to be only America first.\u201d \n \nImagine how this resonates abroad. \u201cAmerica First\u201d was the name of the organization led by Charles Lindbergh that bitterly fought FDR before U.S. entry into World War II \u2014 right through the Battle of Britain \u2014 to keep America neutral between Churchill\u2019s Britain and Hitler\u2019s Reich. \n \nNot that Trump was consciously imitating Lindbergh. I doubt he was even aware of the reference. He just liked the phrase. But I can assure you that in London and in every world capital they are aware of the antecedent and the intimations of a new American isolationism. Trump gave them good reason to think so, going on to note \u201cthe right of all nations to put their own interests first.\u201d America included. \n \nSome claim that putting America first is a reassertion of American exceptionalism. On the contrary, it is the antithesis. It makes America no different from all the other countries that define themselves by a particularist blood-and-soil nationalism. What made America exceptional, unique in the world, was defining its own national interest beyond its narrow economic and security needs to encompass the safety and prosperity of a vast array of allies. A free world marked by open trade and mutual defense was President Truman\u2019s vision, shared by every president since. \n \nUntil now. \n \nSome have argued that Trump is just dangling a bargaining chip to negotiate better terms of trade or alliance. Or that Trump\u2019s views are so changeable and unstable \u2014 telling European newspapers two weeks ago that NATO is obsolete and then saying \u201cNATO is very important to me\u201d \u2014 that this is just another unmoored entry on a ledger of confusion. \n \nBut both claims are demonstrably wrong. An inaugural address is no off-the-cuff riff. These words are the product of at least three weeks of deliberate crafting for an address that Trump said would express his philosophy. Moreover, to remove any ambiguity, Trump prefaced his \u201cAmerica first\u201d proclamation with: \u201cFrom this day forward, a new vision will govern our land.\u201d \n \nTrump\u2019s vision misunderstands the logic underlying the far larger, far-reaching view of Truman. The Marshall Plan sure took wealth away from the American middle class and distributed it abroad. But for a reason. Altruism, in part. But mostly to stabilize Western Europe as a bulwark against an existential global enemy. \n \nWe carried many free riders throughout the Cold War. The burden was heavy. But this was not a mindless act of charity; it was an exercise in enlightened self-interest. \n \nWe are embarking upon insularity and smallness. Nor is this just theory. Trump\u2019s long-promised but nonetheless abrupt withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership is the momentous first fruit of his foreign policy doctrine. Last year the prime minister of Singapore told John McCain that if we pulled out of TPP \u201cyou\u2019ll be finished in Asia.\u201d He knows the region. \n \nFor 70 years, we sustained an international system of open commerce and democratic alliances that has enabled America and the West to grow and thrive. Global leadership is what made America great. We abandon it at our peril. \n \n\u2014 Charles Krauthammer is a columnist \n \nfor The Washington Post Writers Group.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Column: Trump\u2019s foreign policy revolution","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Jackson","zipCode":"97502","state":"Oregon","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Central Point","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Bend Bulletin","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169668815","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2479"},"name":"Bend Bulletin","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bendbulletin.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204262436","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:27:43Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

(I would have gone to the moon, but I couldn\u2019t get a ride.) Even from here I have vertigo. \n \nMy head is swirling from \u201calternative facts,\u201d trade deals canceled, pipelines initiated, Obamacare in the Twilight Zone and utterly bizarre rants about attendance on Inauguration Day and fake voters on Election Day. Whatever this cost Vladimir Putin, he\u2019s already gotten his money\u2019s worth \u2014 a chaos president. Pass the vodka. \n \nBut moderate Republicans, independents and Democrats who opposed Donald Trump need to beware. He can make you so nuts \u2014 he can so vacuum your brains out \u2014 that you can\u2019t think clearly about the most important questions today: What things are true even if Trump believes them, and therefore merit support? And where can Democrats offer smarter approaches on issues, like jobs, for instance \u2014 approaches that can connect to the guts of working-class voters as Trump did, but provide a smarter path forward. \n \nWhere Trump\u2019s instinct is not wrong is on the need to strike a better long-term trading arrangement with China. But I worry about his pugnacious tactics. I would be negotiating with Beijing in total secret. Let everybody save face. If he smacks China with \u201cAmerica First,\u201d China will smack him with \u201cChina First,\u201d and soon we\u2019ll have a good ol\u2019 trade war. \n \nWhere I think Democrats should focus their critique, and fresh thinking, is how we actually bring back more middle-class jobs. A day barely goes by without Trump threatening some company that plans to move jobs abroad or build a factory in Mexico, not America. If Trump\u2019s bullying can actually save good jobs, God bless him. But what Trump doesn\u2019t see is that while this may get him some short-term jobs headlines, in the long run CEOs may prefer not to build their next factory in America, precisely because it will be hostage to Trump\u2019s Twitter lashings. They also may quietly replace more workers with robots faster, because Trump can\u2019t see or complain about that. \n \n\u201cTrump wants to protect jobs,\u201d explained Gidi Grinstein, who heads the Israeli policy institute Reut. \u201cWhat we really need is to protect workers.\u201d \n \nYou need to protect workers, not jobs, because every worker today will most likely have to transition multiple times to multiple jobs as the pace of change accelerates. So the best way you help workers is by ensuring that they are flexible \u2014 that they have the skills, safety nets, health care and lifelong learning opportunities to make those leaps and that they live in cities open to innovation, entrepreneurship and high-IQ risk-takers. \n \nThe societal units protecting workers best are our healthy communities \u2014 where local businesses, philanthropies, the public school system and universities, and local government come together to support a permanent education-to-work-to-life-long-skill-building pipeline. \n \nBusinesses signal to schools and colleges, in real time, the skills they need to thrive in the global economy, and philanthropies fund innovative programs for supplemental education and training. Schools also serve as adult learning and social service centers \u2014 and local and state governments support them all, including reaching out globally for investors and new markets. \n \nWhen Trump strong-arms a company to retain jobs but kills Obamacare without a credible alternative, he is saving jobs but hurting workers, because he is making workers less secure and less flexible. \n \nAnother of Trump\u2019s jobs fallacies is that regulation always holds companies back. In some cases it does, and thoughtful deregulation can help. But Trump\u2019s argument that we must ignore climate science because steadily upgrading clean energy standards for our power, auto and construction companies kills jobs is pure nonsense. \n \nIn sum, Democrats should and can take the language of \u201cstrength\u201d away from Trump and own it themselves. They should be for strong workers, not strong walls; for building strong communities, not relying on a strongman to strong-arm employers; and for strong standards to create strong companies. Those would be my fightin\u2019 words. \n \n\u2014 Thomas Friedman is a columnist for The New York Times.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Column: Smart approaches, not strong-arm tactics, to jobs","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Jackson","zipCode":"97502","state":"Oregon","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Central Point","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Bend Bulletin","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169668815","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2479"},"name":"Bend Bulletin","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bendbulletin.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204262621","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:27:44Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It went by the name of Measure 37, and it passed in 35 of the state\u2019s 36 counties. It even won in famously liberal Multnomah County despite opposition from a who\u2019s who of public employee unions, environmental groups and Democratic politicians. \n \nThe measure was a crude weapon aimed at uncompensated property \u201ctakings,\u201d which in plain English means regulations that reduce a property\u2019s value for which the owner isn\u2019t compensated. Aimed at Oregon\u2019s restrictive land use system, the measure allowed property owners to develop their land under rules in effect at they time they bought it. Otherwise, they were entitled to compensation for lost value. \n \nThe face of Measure 37 was an elderly woman named Dorothy English, who bought dozens of acres in the Portland area in the 1950s but was prohibited from developing it fully by the state\u2019s subsequently adopted land use system. English died at the age of 95 less than four years after Measure 37 passed. \n \nMeasure 37 had problems \u2014 big problems \u2014 and Oregonians voted to scale it back a few years later. Still, it was a valuable reminder to lawmakers of Oregonians\u2019 deep appreciation for property rights and their eagerness to right wrongs. \n \nIt\u2019s impossible to know how long those lessons lasted, but the collection of bills lying in wait this year for property owners known (often disparagingly) as landlords suggests that the lessons of Measure 37 are little more than a dim memory in Salem. For some, anyway. \n \nHousing costs are high in many places around the state, including Bend. A number of factors contribute to this problem, including high development charges imposed by cities, the scarcity of buildable land exacerbated by the state\u2019s land use system and, surely the most significant, Oregon\u2019s popularity. Lots of people want to live here, and the result is a mismatch in some places between the demand for housing and the supply. \n \nAmeliorating a problem this complicated isn\u2019t simple, but you wouldn\u2019t know that by reading some of the ideas proposed by legislative leaders this year. \n \nBuckle up, landlords. \n \nConsider House Bill 2001 , sponsored by House Speaker Tina Kotek, D-Portland . It would allow cities and counties to control rents, allowing landlords \u201ca fair rate of return,\u201d whatever that means. It also would prohibit rent increases above 5 percent except under certain circumstances. And if a landlord did qualify for one of those circumstances \u2014 to pay for necessary repairs, for instance \u2014 a tenant would have the right to terminate his lease and receive relocation expenses equivalent to three months\u2019 rent. \n \nAnd then there\u2019s House Bill 2004 , co-sponsored by more than a dozen lawmakers. The bill would prohibit no-cause evictions for month-to-month leases except under certain circumstances. For longer tenancies, landlords would be required to offer tenants an opportunity to renew for a period at least as long as their existing leases. The bill would effectively lock landlords into their relationships with tenants, whose rents \u2014 if HB 2001 passed \u2014 might be controlled by their local government. \n \nThe net effect of this legislation would be that of an uncompensated taking, a seizure of some of the value of private property for public benefit. Few people would argue that the rental market should be completely unregulated, and even fewer would argue that all landlords are fair and reasonable people. Still, there comes a point at which the desire to help strapped renters can devolve into the scapegoating of landlords and encourage an unjustified assault on their property rights. In some corners of the Oregon Legislature, that point has been passed. \n \nSo dismissive have some lawmakers become of landlords, in fact, that a couple of representatives think nothing of subordinating their property rights to the consumer choices of their tenants. House Bill 2511 , sponsored by Democrats Phil Barnhart and Ken Helm , would allow residential tenants to install electric-car charging stations on their landlords\u2019 property even over their landlords\u2019 objections. This bill may well die, but the fact that it\u2019s even thinkable really says something. \n \nWhat it says is that at least some lawmakers seem to have forgotten the lessons of Measure 37, assuming they learned them in the first place. To be sure, there\u2019s little reason to believe that abusing landlords in the way some might like would fuel another property-rights rebellion. Dorothy English was a much more sympathetic figure than your average landlord, after all, and most Oregonians are probably more likely to feel sorry for struggling renters in any case. \n \nStill, the property interests of unpopular people deserve protection, too.

The experiment showed that dogs continued to prefer familiar partners. \n \nThe researchers from University of Veterinary Medicine in Austria had earlier showed that dogs share food rewards with other dogs. \n \nUsing a bar-pulling task, the dogs delivered the treats to partner dogs - especially if these were already known to them. \n \nHowever, the increased complexity of the task influenced the readiness with which the dogs delivered a food reward to another animal. \n \nThe new study confirmed that the chosen method affects the result and is much more dependent on social proximity than had previously been assumed. \n \nFor the study, the dogs had to recognise special objects in form of tokens in order to deliver a food reward to the other dog. \n \n\"This time we not only tested a different experimental set-up but also the level of difficulty. The dogs were first trained to touch a token in exchange for a food reward for themselves,\" said Rachel Dale from the university. \n \n\"They were then trained to recognise two more tokens: one that resulted in a reward being delivered to a partner dog and another which did not,\" Dale said. \n \nThe researchers tested whether it made a difference to the donor dog if the receiver was familiar or a stranger and whether the presence of another dog was enough to trigger generous behaviour in the test dog even if the partner had no access to the food. \n \nThe test set-up consisted of two enclosures. The test dog was trained to wait on a specific location in one enclosure until the researchers revealed a board containing the tokens. \n \nThe dog could then choose to deliver a food reward to the receiver dog or not. In the first test, either a familiar dog or a stranger sat in the receiver enclosure. The dogs could see each other during the experiment. \n \nIn the second test, the receiver enclosure remained empty but the other dog was present in the testing room. \n \nIn a third test, the dogs were alone in the entire set-up.

The suit said their connections to US forces made them targets in their home country and that the pair had valid visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe lawsuit highlights some of the legal obstacles facing Trump's new administration as it tries to carry out the directive, which the president signed late on Friday to impose a four-month ban on refugees entering the United States and a 90-day hold on travelers from Syria, Iran and five other Muslim-majority countries. \n \nIn an emergency ruling on Saturday, US District Judge Ann Donnelly ordered US authorities to refrain from deporting previously approved refugees as well as \"approved holders of valid immigrant and non-immigrant visas and other individuals ... legally authorised to enter the United States\" from the countries targeted in Trump's order. \n \nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which sought the temporary stay, said it would help about 100 to 200 people who found themselves detained in transit or at US airports after Trump signed the order. \"I am directing the government to stop removal if there is someone right now in danger of being removed,\" Donnelly said in the court hearing. \"No one is to be removed in this class.\" \n \nUS Department of Justice attorney Susan Riley during the hearing said, \"This has unfolded with such speed that we haven't had an opportunity to address all the legal issues.\" Many of the people in a huge crowd that had gathered outside the Brooklyn courthouse broke out into cheers after word of the judge's ruling filtered out. \n \nThe US Department of Homeland Security in a statement hours later said only a small fraction of airline passengers arriving in the United States on Saturday were \"inconvenienced while enhanced security measures were implemented.\" \n \n\"These individuals went through enhanced security screenings and are being processed for entry to the United States, consistent with our immigration laws and judicial orders,\" the statement said. \n \nThe department said Trump's executive order remained in place and that its officers would enforce it. Separately, a group of state attorneys general were discussing whether to file their own court challenge against Trump's order, said officials in three states. \n \"TARGETED BY TERRORISTS\"  \nThe plight of one of the men who brought the lawsuit, a former US Army interpreter who was detained at John F. Kennedy International Airport, is especially compelling, said David Leopold, a former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, who is not involved in the suit. \"Here is a guy who was a translator who worked for the US military for years, who himself was targeted by terrorists,\" he said. \"It is clear that if he is sent back, he is facing a direct threat to his life.\" \n \nThat man, Hameed Khalid Darweesh, was released later on Saturday and told a crowd of reporters at JFK Airport that he did not have ill feelings about his detention. \"America is the greatest nation, the greatest people in the world,\" he said. Darweesh, 53, worked for the US Army and for a US contractor in Iraq from 2003 to 2013 as an interpreter and engineer, the lawsuit said. \n \nThe second plaintiff, Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, 33, was also detained at JFK Airport but has since been released. He is the husband of an Iraqi woman who worked for a U.S. contractor in Iraq. She already lives in Houston, the suit said. Trump, a Republican, has said his order would help protect Americans from terrorist attacks. \n \nThe lawsuit on behalf of the Iraqis challenges Trump's order on several grounds. It says the order violates the US Constitution's guarantee of due process by taking away their ability to apply for asylum, and violates the guarantee of equal protection by discriminating against them on the basis of their country of origin without sufficient justification. It also says the order violates procedural requirements of federal rulemaking. \n \nThe next hearing in the case was set for February 10. Supporters of the order say the president has wide authority to limit the entry of foreign nationals from specific countries when it is in the national interest. \n \n\"Even if they do and they win, my answer is so what?\" said Mark Krikorian, the director of the conservative Center for Immigration Studies. \"We are talking a few dozen people - that is just a last-ditch effort to get the last few people in. It doesn't really change the policy,\" he said. \n \nTrump's order does not mention specific religions but Trump said in an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network on Friday he was acting to help Christians in Syria who were \"horribly treated.\" Comments like that could come back to haunt the president in litigation over his order, said Hiroshi Motomura, an immigration expert at UCLA School of Law. \n \n\"There were comments during the campaign that focused very much on religion as the target,\" Motomura said. \"If the record showed that the origins of a particular measure were based on targeting a particular group, that could be challenged in court.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Terrorism news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Lawsuits news","group":"Business"}],"title":"Trump's immigration order: Two Iraqis lead legal fight against ban","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"DNA India","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659516","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1346"},"name":"DNA India","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.dnaindia.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204277614","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:14:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:27:55Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://static.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/third/public/2017/01/29/543333-terminal-4-jfk-airport-queens-j28-reuters.jpg?itok=b2po172t"}],"video":[]}}

The hosts gained momentum but Bayern were able to protect their 2-1 lead to the end.\n\nWith the result, Bayern stay atop the standings with a three-point advantage whereas 15th-placed Bremen remain at the edge of the relegation zone.\n\nIn the other match, Leipzig wrapped up an important 2-1 comeback win over third-placed Hoffenheim, whose unbeaten streak ended. \n\nTimo Werner and Marcel Sabitzer were on target to keep the \"Red Bulls\" on Bayern's heels.\n\nDespite being under pressure in the opening period, the visitors from Hoffenheim opened the scoring with 19 minutes into the game. \n\nSebastian Rudy forced a turn over following a Leipzig corner, allowing Nadiem Amiri to complete a five-pass counter attack.\n\nLeipzig remained unimpressed and responded in the 38th minute as Timo Werner slotted home Naby Keita's build-up play to restore parity before the half time.\n\nAfter the restart, things went from bad to worse for the visitors as Sandro Wagner received his marching orders following a rude foul play on Stefan Ilsanker in the 60th minute.\n\nThe hosts capitalised on their numerical advantage and snatched the 2-1 winner through Marcel Sabitzer, who unleashed a 22-meter effort to beat Hoffenheim goalkeeper Oliver Baumann in the 77th minute.\n\nWith the 13th victory of the season, Leipzig remain second while Hoffenheim slipped from the third to fourth spot.\n\nElsewhere, Cologne crushed last-placed Darmstadt 6-1 thanks to Yuya Osako's brace.\n\nWolfsburg lost 2-1 to Augsburg while Ingolstadt shocked Hamburg 3-1 and Monchengladbach turned the tides from two goals down to beat Leverkusen 3-2.\n\n--IANS\n\ngau/mr \n\n(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Germany news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"},{"name":"Sports: Bundesliga news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Leipzig remain on Bayern's heels in German Bundesliga","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Business Standard India","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659514","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"218"},"name":"Business Standard India","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Business"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.business-standard.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://mybs.in/2USkNPm"],"sequenceId":"695204284625","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T00:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:28:00Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The six-wheeled, knee-high robots from startup Starship Technologies are part of a new wave of automated systems taking aim at the \"last mile\" delivery of goods to consumers.\n\nStarship is launching a pilot project of robotic deliveries of parcels, groceries and prepared foods in early February in the US capital Washington, with a similar test taking place in Redwood City, California.\n\nThe startup, created by two of the founders of Skype, Ahti Heinla and Janus Friis, has already begun testing in several European cities as part of an effort to bring new efficiencies to local delivery.\n\nThe goal is to enable delivery within a radius of two miles (three kilometers) within 15-30 minutes of an order, for $1 or less, with the autonomous robots traveling on sidewalks and alerting consumers of their arrival via smartphone app.\n\nStarship spokesman Henry Harris-Burland said the founders were looking to \"disrupt\" an industry which had seen little efficiency improvement from new technology.\n\n\"We're trying to solve real social and economic problems,\" Harris-Burland said during a demonstration of the delivery bots in Washington.\n\n\"This will take cars and vans off the road. We can also provide deliveries to the elderly and handicapped who have difficulty getting around.\"\n\nThe company, which has its business office in London, engineering in Estonia and some 90 employees, announced in January it had raised $17.2 million, led by Daimler AG with other investors as it moves to expand its testing and partnerships.\n\nWhile the Starship robots roll at a modest pace of around four miles (six kilometers) per hour, Harris-Burland said they offer a more efficient and economical delivery model than drones, which are being tested by online retail giant Amazon and others.\n\nThe rolling robots are far less expensive to build and operate than drones and face fewer regulatory issues.\n\nHe said drones might be better-suited to remote and rural areas, while the Starship bots are designed for cities and suburbs, where they can roll along on sidewalks.\n\n\"We don't see these as competing with drones, we see it as complementary,\" Harris-Burland said.\n\nThe Starship robots, which look like high-tech plastic picnic coolers, can carry about 20 pounds (nine kilograms) of goods, suited to three to four grocery bags. They do not offer heating or chilled compartments because rapid deliveries would not need them, according to Harris-Burland.\n\nThey will not have the capacity to leave items on doorsteps, he said, because \"customers will get delivery within 30 minutes, when they are home\" and collect the goods at the door.\n\n- Mapping sidewalks -\n\nStarship has agreements for testing with the delivery firm Postmates in Washington and DoorDash in California, as it works toward a commercial model with other partners and retailers.\n\nWhen the pilot begins in February, consumers will be able to order pizza, toothpaste, milk or eggs through the services which may use humans or robots.\n\nStarship is not the only robotic delivery startup looking to disrupt the sector.\n\nCalifornia-based startup Dispatch has raised $2 million in venture funding to begin testing of its rolling robots. Another California firm, Savioke, has agreed to provide delivery bots to hotels and apartment complexes.\n\nStarship says one of its strong points is its \"visual localization\" technology that allows for real-time mapping using nine cameras on each robot to help navigate along sidewalks and circumvent obstacles, people and pets.\n\n\"We can see every crosswalk, every traffic light, every pothole,\" Harris-Burland said.\n\n\"A lot of companies have mapped roads but no one has mapped sidewalks.\"\n\nThe navigation is done by artificial intelligence, and the bots are \"99 percent autonomous,\" according to the spokesman.\n\n\"We want a human being able to oversee the robot's journey and to intervene whenever there is a problem,\" he said.\n\nHarris-Burland said the company's tests so far in Europe have shown the system works, with no problems related to theft or vandalism.\n\nThe lids of the devices are locked until the customer opens it with a smartphone. If anyone tries to steal it, an alarm will sound, and if it is hijacked the company can track it \"to the nearest inch,\" he said.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Pizza, Eggs, Milk To Be Delivered By Six-Whee...","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Western Asia","countryCode":"AE","country":"United Arab Emirates"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Dotemirates.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"609646081","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Dotemirates.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Global","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.dotemirates.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204285191","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:20:09Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:28:01Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://dotemirates.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/2017/01/f5119578a1a12681364fdb92c04489a9.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Warm the oil mixture in a microwave for 30 seconds and add an egg yolk, mix all the ingredients well and massage the mixture on your hair length. \n\nCastor oil and extra virgin coconut oil help in replenishing dry and dull hair, whereas the egg yolk helps in improving the texture, leaving the tresses soft and shiny.\n\n* Banana voluminising mask: Even if you have fine hair, sometimes dryness can occur, specially in winter.

He said instead of being a reason of stress for the students, parents as well as teachers, exams should be an occasion for happiness.\n\n\"For some, exam is a pleasure but for most it is a pressure. It is for you to chose between pleasure and pressure.\"\n\n\"Those who will take it as pleasure will get more (marks) and those who take it as pressure will repent,\" said the Prime Minister, calling upon parents and guardians to create an environment of festivity during examinations.\n\n\"Relaxation boosts your memory recall. When you are in tension, all doors get closed. It becomes a baggage for you. The biggest medicine for memory recall is relaxation.\"\n\n\"A happy mind is the secret to scoring good marks. Smile more, score more,\" he said.\n\nCalling on students to compete with themselves rather than others, Modi said exams were not a benchmark of success. He also gave an example of Cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar in this regard. \n\n\"A.P.J. Abdul Kalam had failed to get selected in the air force.

The \"sanitised\" report was declassified recently by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). \n \nPARTS OF REPORT DELETED \n \nThe report, whose complete title is not entirely available as it is part deleted, was prepared on the basis of inputs available to the CIA till January 1986. \n \nThe very first sentence of the reports available (undeleted) page reads: \"Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi faces at least an even chance of assassination before his tenure in office ends in 1989.\" It, however, later clearly said that \"assassination is the major near-term threat\" to him. \n \nOver five years later, Gandhi was assassinated at Sriperumbudur in Tamil Nadu on May 21, 1991. \n \nAlso read | Rajiv Gandhi assassination: Planned, precise, pulverising \n \nThe first section titled \"Key Judgments\" analyses and deliberates upon what likely scenario would emerge in the domestic and international political situation if there is a sudden change in leadership minus Rajiv Gandhi and the likely impact on India's relations with the US, the then USSR and the region. \n \nTHREATS  TO RAJIV'S LIFE \n \nIt also dealt with the threats posed to Gandhi's life by various extremist groups at that time and the likely fallout of his murder. \n \n\"If Gandhi fell to a Sikh or Kashmiri Muslim assassin, widespread communal violence probably would erupt even if strong preventive security measures - including deployment of Army and paramilitary troops across northern India - were taken by the Indian President ......(deleted),\" it said. \n \nInterestingly, it also names P V Narasimha Rao and V P Singh, who could be the \"interim successor\" and \"likely candidates\" in case of sudden exit by Rajiv. Rao took over as the Prime Minister in 1991. \n \nIn a section, titled 'The Threat of Assassination: Stability in Jeopardy', the report says \"In our view, there is at least an even chance in the next several years of an assassination, most likely by extremist Sikhs or disgruntled Kashmiri Muslims who have targeted Rajiv,\" besides \"a fanatical Hindu\". \n \nSince a significant portion of this section is deleted, it is not clear whether Sri Lankan Tamil extremists were also dealt with in the analysis. However, another section deals in- depth with Rajiv's mediation efforts to resolve \"the conflict between militant Sri Lankan Tamils and the Sinhalese-dominated government in Colombo...\" \n \nWHAT IF RAJIV QUITS POLITICS? \n \nBesides Gandhi's possible assassination, the report also analysed various scenarios of his \"abrupt departure\" from the political scene before 1989. \n \n\"Although we believe assassination is the major near-term threat to Rajiv's tenure, any of several other events could cause his abrupt departure from the political scene before 1989,\" it said while listing out several other possibilities including \"his death from natural causes or by accident\". \n \nIt ruled out the possibility of a decision by him \"to resign out of frustration\", saying \"we see no signs of this and believe it would be out of character\". \n \nThe CIA report also noted: \"We suspect, however, that Rajiv would calculate -- as we do -- that he and his kin would be targets for extremist violence even if he left public office.\" \n \nIn a section called \"Implications for the United States\", the report says \"We believe (Rajiv) Gandhi's death would represent a significant blow to US interests, regardless of the circumstances of the succession.\" \n \nEFFECT ON INDO-US RELATIONS \n \n\"...We believe Indo-US relations could also suffer as a result of domestic political changes following Rajiv's assassination.\" \n \nThe report assessed Rajiv's policies ranging from dealing with extremists, foreign relations (including Sri Lankan Tamil issue) to promoting acquisition of selected foreign technology\" among others, and their outcome. \n \n\"Although some of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's policies will continue to encounter serious resistance over the next several years, we believe his dominance of the Indian political scene is secure until at least the end of his present term of office in December 1989, barring his incapacitation or death,\" it said. \n \nThe report also dealt with the possibility of a \"national government\" taking over in case of a sudden exit by Rajiv, while discounting the possibility of a military coup in such a scenario. \n \nSeveral portions of the 23-page report were deleted before the CIA decided to release it under the Freedom of Information Act. \n \nAlso read: Diary of an assassin","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Indian subcontinent news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Sri Lanka news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"}],"title":"What if Rajiv Gandhi is killed?

Even though we got the ball close to the goal, we still missed some shots.\u201d \n   \nThe Trojans entered the game on a two-game winning streak despite shooting just 34.1 percent against Arkansas State on Jan. 21 and 33.8 percent against Georgia Southern Thursday. The Panthers employed a 2-3 zone, something Rigby said was an anomaly for them, to counter the Trojans. \n   \n\u201cThey picked up on the fact we haven\u2019t been shooting the ball well, and they came out and played the exact zone we\u2019re struggling with,\u201d Rigby said. \u201cWhen they go to a zone, they usually go to a 1-2-2.\u201d \n   \nThe Trojans missed their first 10 shots from behind the arc and were just 2-of-18 from deep in the first half. While Rigby said the shot selection did not disappoint her, she said her team must find different ways to attack the zone. \n   \n\u201cThe coaches have to find a breath of fresh air, a different way to score on a zone,\u201d Rigby said. \u201cWe have to get some things going to the basket more rather than just rotating the ball looking for shooters.\u201d \n   \nDespite the struggles from the floor, the Trojans possessed a 51-50 lead after three quarters of play. \n   \nTroy found itself down 46-34 after a 3-pointer from Astaja Tyghter with 4:13 left but closed the quarter on a 17-4 run to seize the lead. During the stretch, Daleville\u2019s La\u2019Tia Fils-Aime\u2019 and Amanda Mendoza had five points each, while Caitlyn Ramirez had four. \n   \n\u201cWe just kept telling each other \u2018One possession at a time,\u2019\u201d Ramirez said. \u201cStop and score \u2013 that\u2019s something we do in practice all the time. We have to get a stop, turn around and get something positive out of it. We\u2019ve just got to keep pushing through.\u201d \n   \nTroy pushed the lead out to 53-50 on a Ramirez basket early in the fourth quarter, but the offense stagnated with a few turnovers. Georgia State also converted two of the mistakes into four points, building a 56-53 lead on a pair of free throws from Jada Lewis. \n   \nMendoza tied the game at 58 on a trey with 5:25 left, but Georgia State scored eight of the next 10 points to take a 66-60 lead with 1:29 left. The last basket came when Lewis stole the ball from Troy and drove in for an easy layup. \n   \nTroy had 21 turnovers in the game. \n   \n\u201cWe\u2019ve come out with wins with 21 turnovers,\u201d Rigby said. \u201cThat\u2019s a little more than we like, but when you play fast-paced sometimes there are more turnovers.\u201d \n   \nStill, Troy had chances to tie or win the game down the stretch. Ramirez made 1-of-2 free throws with 16 seconds left to cut the deficit to 66-65, and the Trojans forced a turnover on an inbounds play. \n   \nJayla Chills drove inside for a shot attempt but missed. Georgia State\u2019s K.K. Williams rebounded and secured the win with a pair of free throws on the other end. \n   \nTyghter led the Panthers with 19 points, while Lewis followed with 18. Kierra Henry chipped in 15. \n   \nRamirez tied her own Troy Division-I record with 20 rebounds to accompany her 18 points. Mendoza chipped in 14 points.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Jeremy Wise jwise@dothaneagle.com"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Turnovers, poor shooting doom Troy women","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Houston","zipCode":"36302","state":"Alabama","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Dothan","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Army Flier","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"170086534","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Army Flier","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.armyflier.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204290458","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:58:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:28:04Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/dothaneagle.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/d6/1d62c0ea-e5e8-11e6-a0f6-57291488df86/588d8504613c2.image.jpg?resize=300%2C169"}],"video":[]}}

We had a five- or six-minute stretch where they took control of the game at the end of the half.\u201d \n   \nGeorgia State (13-7 overall, 6-2 Sun Belt Conference) entered the contest with a four-game winning streak \u2013 its last loss coming to Troy in Atlanta on Jan. 9. Despite seven turnovers in the early going, the Trojans (11-11, 3-5) pulled within 21-19 on a trey from Jeremy Hollimon with 5:57 left in the first half. \n   \nThat served as Troy\u2019s last basket from the field in the first half, though, as the Trojans\u2019 turnover woes continued. \n   \nTroy managed just three shots in the final 5:57 and committed four turnovers in the stretch. That allowed the Panthers to build a 34-19 lead with 55 seconds left in the half. \n   \n\u201cWe have had some struggles with turnovers, but give them credit. It\u2019s that zone,\u201d Cunningham said. \u201cWhenever we play Georgia State, we talk about keeping your head up because they\u2019ll create some turnovers \u2013 but they turned them into points tonight.\u201d \n   \nKevin Baker broke the scoreless streak with three free throws, but D\u2019marcus Simonds scored on a layup with two seconds left to give the Panthers a 36-22 advantage. Simonds, a freshman, had eight of his 26 points in the stretch. \n   \n\u201cThat was a stretch when we had no answer for Simonds,\u201d Cunningham said. \u201cSimonds really controlled the end of that first half.\u201d \n   \nTroy, though, chipped away at the Georgia State lead in spurts. Jordon Varnado opened the half with a layup then blocked a Panther shot on the other end. \n   \nDeVon Walker rebounded and fed Wesley Person for a trey. After Georgia State hit a free throw, Person buried another long-distance shot, and Troy trailed 37-30 just 1:24 into the second half. \n   \n\u201cWe said we had to play with more energy coming out in the second half,\u201d he said. \u201cA couple of threes and the big block \u2013 some good looks \u2013 kinda sparked us to go on that run.\u201d \n   \nThe Trojans pulled within four on a layup from Alex Hicks with 10:49 left, but the Panthers pushed it out to nine on a layup from Jordan Session with 9:28 left. \n   \nStill, Troy kept making charges. Baker buried a pair of treys \u2013 including a 30-footer \u2013 and Hollimon added a pair of free throws. His last make from the charity stripe cut the Panthers\u2019 deficit to 60-57 with 6:06 left in the game. \n   \nGeorgia State responded, though, with a 7-0 run. Malik Benlevi dunked over the Trojans and followed with a layup. Jeff Thomas, who was 3-of-4 from the outside, followed with a trey to up the Panthers\u2019 lead to 67-57. \n   \n\u201cStops, you got to get stops,\u201d Hollimon said. \u201cYou can\u2019t trade buckets when you\u2019re trying to come back and take the lead. We didn\u2019t get the stops we needed.\u201d \n   \nYet, Troy made one final push. \n   \nDown 74-64, Person notched a trey. Daniel Peace came up with a steal, and Baker found Person for another trey with 49 seconds to go. \n   \nGeorgia State iced the game at the free throw line. \n   \nBehind Simonds, Jeremy Hollowell had 14 points, while Thomas added 11 to pace the Panthers. Person had 25, while Hollimon netted 16. Varnado and Baker chipped in nine each.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Jeremy Wise jwise@dothaneagle.com"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"First-half deficit too much for Troy men","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Houston","zipCode":"36302","state":"Alabama","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Dothan","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Army Flier","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"170086534","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Army Flier","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.armyflier.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204290627","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:03:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:28:04Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/dothaneagle.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/43/8433e8c6-e5e8-11e6-acfc-83175df5424c/588d85b56d40b.image.jpg?resize=300%2C214"}],"video":[]}}

The Facebook page posts sometimes bizarre, sometimes ridiculous images of everyday life in Indonesia without any context. The result is something that's funny, weird, and endlessly shareable. It's amassed a devoted following in less than a year, aided, in no small part, by fans who add their own context to each photo, posting in the same  a e s t h e t i c  as the page's creators.  \n\nBut all of it, the one the site's anonymous admins told me, was unintentional.  \n\n\" SA1945 isn't a funny page and we never told anyone to post comments with spaces between the letters!\" one of the admins told me.  \n\nWhat the S e m i o t i k a  a d i l u h u n g 1 9 4 5 crew have done is create a page where fans either get it or they don't. It's the equivalent of an in-joke between friends, except it's on a national scale and (probably) a million times funnier.  \n\nI wanted to figure out what it all means, so I sat down with one of the anonymous admins\u2014we'll call him A.A.\u2014at a West Jakarta coffee shop to talk about what makes him laugh.  \n\nAll images take from S e m i o t i k a a d i l u h u n g 1 9 4 5 (Facebook) \n\nVICE Indonesia: So why did you guys start S e m i o t i k a  a d i l u h u n g 1 9 4 5 ?  \nA.A.: So on June 7th, 2016, both of us were really fucked up after finishing our finals at college. It was two in the morning and we submitted our final assignments one day before the deadline. The other admin and I usually came up with so many ideas, but we never executed 90 percent of them. So I told him, 'let's create a meme page.' We made it right away, created a Facebook page and posted our first meme.  \n\nIt's just the two of you? \nAt first, yeah. Then I asked another friend to join us. I just said to him, 'you're going to be an admin.' Now we have seven admins in total, all of whom are fresh grads. We all went to the same university. We only recruit people we know to be admins and they must share our sense of humor.  \n\nWhere do you even find these pictures? \nThe photos come from Google searches and our own personal collections. One of us has a folder on his laptop with gigabytes worth of pictures. We also take a lot from Twitter\u2014the ones trending on Twitter\u2014but not from Facebook.  \n\nYou're not exactly the first meme-based Facebook page in Indonesia. What are your influences? \nWe like LSDmeme , redemptoris , and virtual experiences. We also like the Indonesian page Sepi dan Segala Serangga yang Menyangga (\"Loneliness and All the Insects that Hold Us Together\"). We first heard of memes from a local site, actually. \n\nWhat's crossing the line for you? Is there anything you won't post? \nThe other day we saw an ibu-ibu with a Minions  bag. We found it really funny, and we wanted to take her photo, but then we soon realized the consequences. The point is, we need to use common sense. We need to think of the potential impact, of what might happen to her or other people if a photo of them goes viral.  \n\nMaking fun of tragedies is wrong. For example, the Russian ambassador who was shot in Turkey. An hour after the incident, a lot of international meme pages like Criminal Aesthetic were sharing memes about the incident. That was too soon. And their content focuses on tragedy instead of the funny side of life. We think that's insensitive.  \n\nWhat do you all have in common? \nMost of us are dorks, nerds, and antisocial people. And some of us are self-proclaimed cinephiles, so yeah, I guess we're pretty pretentious. We spend a lot of time watching movies that are, if we're allowed to be stereotypes, in the art student/scenester starter pack. A lot of French films, Akira , Pulp Fiction , 2001: A Space Odyssey . We also read books like The Divine Comedy , 1984 , or Brave New World .  \n \nA lot of people say you're all lonely single people with too much time on their hands. \nLook, we shitpost because we're freelancers. We work from our kosan and mostly at night. So we don't have that many choices other than shitposting. It may mean we're lonely, but perhaps it's psychological loneliness, and not because we don't go out.  \n\nBut it's not because we're single. When we created the page, one of us had a girlfriend.  \n \nWhat are you trying to do with the name?   S e m i o t i k a  a d i l u h u n g 1 9 4 5 sounds like it has something to do with philosophy or linguistics. Is that something you're all interested in? \nNot really. We were just trying to come up with two unrelated, but cool words. But one of us read that semiotika [semiotics] is the study of signs, and adiluhung means 'high' [as in 'high culture' not 'stoned'] so semiotika adiluhung means 'high memes.' \n\nAre any of you friends with the people behind  p e n a h a n r a s a b e r a k ? \nWe don't know them URL or IRL. But we do know of them. They don't know us through, because we only stalk them online. One of us has super-advanced/ creepy stalking skills.  \n\n\nIs there a common theme in your posts? \nWe like obscure things. We can find one that went mainstream once, but was then forgotten, because Indonesians are so quick to forget. So when someone posts something, they click it right away. For instance, a photo of Parto shooting in the air, or a photo of a tudeng saji . A lot of people share those photo. It makes us happy.  \n\nWe try to keep the posts local\u2014with a few misses. That includes all the stuff in pop culture, society, politics, the economy, and culture. So the pictures we post are about everyday life in Indonesia. I guess you could say it's Indonesian shitposting. Now, about the funny photos... we like the innocence of a photo. For example, if there's a middle-aged man doing something funny. But he did it because he is so innocent. We find that funny, so we post it. \n\nSo you guys like to laugh at other people's naivety. Like when a woman mistakes a vibrator for a powerbank? Don't you think it's a bit elitist?  \nYeah, we're elitists and we're pretentious. We're aware of everything we do. Even before SA1945 , some of us had a podcast called Pretensius that we intentionally made elitist.  \n\nOK, but what's with the empty captions? You only post photos. There's no context. \nThat's part of the concept. We shitpost out of context. We only want to be a platform. If we take a look at Indonensian meme culture, everything is politically correct or meant to persuade people toward a certain viewpoint. We don't want to do that. We don't want to be politically correct.  \n \nYou recently posted a photo of Sandiaga Uno. Are you endorsing him in the election? \nWe post Sandiaga Uno's photos because he's more meme-able than say, Ahok. ","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Abdul Manan Rasudi"},"topics":[{"name":"Indonesia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Internet latest","group":"Internet"}],"title":"Meet the People Behind the Absurd, Absolutely Hilarious  S e m i o t i k a   a d i l u h u n g 1 9 4 5","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Vice Magazine US","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"349495922","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"954"},"name":"Vice Magazine US","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","InformationTechnology"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://vice.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.facebook.com/semiotikaadiluhung1945/","https://www.facebook.com/memecream/","https://www.facebook.com/InternetRenaissance/","https://www.facebook.com/painwave/","https://www.facebook.com/kesepiansejak1965/"],"sequenceId":"695204290888","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:19:42Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:28:05Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://video-images.vice.com/articles/588bec4316c1d57d28ffa689/lede/1485565941674-01.jpeg"}],"video":[]}}

From Somalia, to her last home in India, and now Texas, the state that abuts another Trump target: Mexico.\n\nMr Haraco, secretary of the Somali Australian Council of Victoria, doesn't know if he should book tickets or wait to see what unfolds when the 90-day period ends.\n\nWill the ban continue? When will he see his elderly mother-in-law again? She is over 70 now; he doesn't want to leave it too long.\n\nConfusion and concern among immigrants and refugee advocates has been widespread, with travellers detained or sent home from US airports.\n\nThere is confusion, too, among the young men that Mr Haraco has brought down to the ocean to mull over the qualities of a leader.\n\nSome have talked about finding it difficult to get a job in Melbourne because of the colour of their skin, or their religion.\n\nThe group also discussed gangs, and young people they know who are dropping out of school, drawn to these groups.\n\nBut the bigger purpose was to inspire them, says council member Abdi Aziz, and he remains convinced that Trump's ruling won't quash their enthusiasm for multiculturalism.\n\n\"Diversity is mainstream in Australia \u2026 but the risk is there. For us it's an important time for our Prime Minister to show political leadership in this area.\"\n\nMany people he had spoken to that morning were feeling a sense of loss, he said.

It guides the reader to get to the root of blockages like excess poundage, release the cause of what was keeping her stuck, to get to that new job, new outfit, new healthy relationship or new health regime. Her book is readily available on Kindle, Amazon, CreateSpace and http://www.padaran.com for easy reading under the category of self-help, personal transformation, and self-help, motivational. Her book\u2019s official launch date is February 11, 2017. \n \nDaya was in a near death car accident and could no longer continue her work as a Yoga instructor or prepare her own food for the family. She had to rely on what the three males in the house could prepare for her, which were often fast foods. While no Yoga or exercise was possible for a very long time, she chose to exercise in her mind using tools she had learned previously in her study of yoga and fitness. This reinforced her understanding of the power of thought, particularly strong before, during and after sleeping, in transforming our reality. \n \nThere is an inherited gift of Creative Mind that is available to each of us. Our Maker is always in Total Agreement with whatever thoughts are held and entertained as truth. Consider these points from Daya's book. \n\n The power and knowledge to work with thoughts and utilize them to transform reality is always available. Consciousness is it! It creates the world from within to without, from mind to manifestation.  Ego uses guilt, anger, blame, judgment or criticism to create a self-reinforcing prison.  Changing perception changes reality.  Daya's words and inspirational story fire up the mental-emotional changes that can lead to a changed body image, enhanced relationships, goals achieved and transformation realized.  \nBookViral\u2019s Review - \"A faith-based and enlightened approach to overcoming life\u2019s challenges, Grow Thin While You Sleep proves a powerful catalyst for positive change. Highly accessible, Daya Devi-Doolin isn\u2019t an author to persuade her readers with undue complexity or make outlandish claims, but by candidly sharing her own experiences she invites her readers to take a step back and consider an alternative perspective. It\u2019s certainly compelling, and whilst you might find similar texts on the subject few authors inspire on the level that Daya Devi-Doolin does, or more importantly succeed in making the vital connection between spiritual and bodily well-being. In clear and concise prose her guidance is easy to visualize and follow. Through her own transformative experiences, both concept and execution are easy to incorporate in our daily regimes. She includes recipes to compliment her holistic methodology, but it\u2019s in the cleansing of body and mind that she opens us up to the possibilities of long-lasting and transformative change in our lives through influences we might otherwise not recognize or act upon.\" http://www.bookviral.com/grow-thin-while-you-sleep/4593174055 \n \nDaya-Devi Doolin\u2019s book \u201cGrow Thin While You Sleep!\u201d has answers that lead to where success lies. This book charts a course through a series of steps, a process that leads from perceived failure to sustained triumph. Daya interweaves her fascinating story within the principles that lead to achievement, even while you sleep. \n \nFor the original version on PRWeb visit: http://www.prweb.com/releases/2017/01/prweb140221","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Author's Helpful Journey on the Path to Transformation","source":{"category":"Press Wire","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"BizWire Express","feed":{"genre":"Press Release","tags":[],"id":"342166156","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"BizWire Express","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Business","Professional","Standard","Wires"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bizwireexpress.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.padaran.com/","http://www.bookviral.com/grow-thin-while-you-sleep/4593174055","http://www.prweb.com/releases/2017/01/prweb14022109.htm","http://www.prweb.com/releases/2017/01/prweb140221"],"sequenceId":"695204297336","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:28:10Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

In addition to showing Miller\u2019s paintings, Art Ventures will exhibit a suite of drawings, drenched in mystery and never before published. Combined with the dreamlike magic of his paintings, these drawings provide glimpses of something mystic and profound. Paton Miller will be attending the opening February 1st, and will be available for media interviews, upon appointment. \n \nAccording to Art Ventures Gallery Director Katharina Powers, \u201cWhat strikes me looking at Paton Miller\u2019s artwork is the purity of his dramatic landscapes. Paton provides an antidote to the so-called \u201cfilter bubble\u201d in which this generation, growing up with the Internet, lives. Paton\u2019s work provides a respite from the Internet and takes us out of algorithmized isolation. He takes us on a journey, and shows us what life is about.\u201d \n \nWriting in Art News, noted critic Donald Kuspit, said about Paton Miller\u2019s work, \u201cThese pictures make clear a familiar, but often forgotten point: that the expressivity of a representational scene often depends upon the abstract intensity generated in response to the medium. Without this visionary intensity, representational painting can become a kind of perceptual journalism. It becomes all the more important when the artist is picturing inner rather than overt horror. The achievement of ecstatic abstractness also indicates that the artist is master of the scene, rather than overwhelmed by what she or he is rendering \u2014 to make it appear magically upon command, which is what Miller\u2019s version of realism does.\u201d \n \nPaton Miller\u2019s work has been awarded the Painting Award at the Florence Biennale and is in public collections at American Embassy in Abu Dhabi and Bogotá, Colombia. Recent exhibitions include shows at White Room Gallery, NYC; Gallery Shchunkin, NYC; Galerie Yoram Gil, Beverly Hills; and Horwitch Newman Gallery, Scottsdale, AZ. \n \nFollowing the opening of his exhibit at the Art Ventures Gallery in Menlo Park, Miller will be in residence at the Art Ventures studio in Saint Helena from July through August. While there, Miller can engage with other visiting artists in the residency program, and create new work. In a program unique in the Bay Area art world, Art Ventures invites rising art stars from Europe to work shoulder to shoulder with their Californian colleagues in a purpose-built painting studio. Following their studio residency artists are invited to curate their own solo show at the Art Ventures Gallery exhibition space. \n \nThe result is groundbreaking: part exhibition space and part art movement. \n \nFor more information about Paton Miller and Art Ventures Gallery email info(at)artventuresgallery(dot)com \nArt Ventures Gallery is located at 888 Santa Cruz Avenue, Menlo Park, CA 94025.

And is now expanding in California. \n \nBayonne, New Jersey. (PRWEB) January 29, 2017 \n \nQuartz Master is a quartz surfaces manufacturer, headquartered in Bayonne, New Jersey. The company produces the highest quality and largest quartz slabs in the industry. It distributes through many select locations in US and Montreal, Quebec, Canada. And is now expanding in California. \n \nThe demand for Quartz Master\u2019s Marble Collection prompted the company to open its first distribution center in California. In June 2016, Quartz Master opened its new 6500 square foot warehouse in Los Angeles to serve Los Angeles County. But within a couple of months, the distribution center was making deliveries to fabricators from as far south as San Diego to as far north as San Francisco. \n \nWhen it opened, the warehouse was stocked with a modest number of slabs, but within weeks it had to be restocked to meet demands. It now has millions in inventory. On January 2nd, they opened an office in San Diego, and on February 1st, an additional warehouse will open in San Francisco on Mariposa Avenue in Mountain View. \n \nQuartz Master is recognized for its Marble Collection. In 2011, after 12 months of laborious engineering, Quartz Master introduced the world\u2019s first marble design to Quartz. And in 2014, they perfected the art of book matching. Today, most all of their marble designs are book matched. Homeowners and interior designers appreciate the low maintenance, durability and unmatched stain resistance of quartz. And they love that they can design a kitchen that has the beauty of natural stone without the expense and hassle. \n \nTo meet demand and high-quality customer service, Quartz Master will have representatives throughout the state, who will supply showrooms, interior designers, and fabricators with samples and customer service. \n \nAbout Quartz Master \nQuartz Master is a world\u2019s experts of quartz surfaces. Quartz Master\u2019s slabs are made of 93% natural quartz and 7% resin, making it the hardest, most durable and non-precious stone in the market. Quartz Master produces the largest quartz slabs, 120\u201d x 64\u201d. Quartz Master is determined to continue to push boundaries in color, design, and manufacturing. \n \nFor the original version on PRWeb visit: http://www.prweb.com/releases/2017/01/prweb14022613.htm","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Quartz Master to Expand Throughout California","source":{"category":"Press Wire","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"BizWire Express","feed":{"genre":"Press Release","tags":[],"id":"342166156","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"BizWire Express","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Business","Professional","Standard","Wires"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bizwireexpress.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.prweb.com/releases/2017/01/prweb14022613.htm"],"sequenceId":"695204298170","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:28:10Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The document covers the technical issues involved in a meet and confer, with an emphasis on being prepared with a solid IG framework and numerous considerations around proportionality. \n \n\u201cThis guide represents years of hard-won practical experience and contains advice around implementing the latest changes to the FRCP,\u201d explains LTPI Board Member Quin Gregor. \u201cIn developing this, while we found a few frameworks, these were either too high level or too in the weeds. None of these laid our vision of how we thought the process should be addressed. With our focus on legal technology and its application our advice is naturally more on the practical than legal. However, we have represented the legal framework as much as we need to within the LTPI purview. We've all witnessed too many drive-by Meet & Confers when one sides ignorance of the process led to shoddy client representation. With this guide, there is no longer any excuse.\u201d \n \nThe guide is broken into 4 stages: pre-conference, activities at the conference, post conference, and \u201ccommon pitfalls\u201d, providing practical guidance and checklist items and related strategic considerations to streamline the process and avoid any missed steps. It is a valuable resource to both the novice and the expert. \n \nThe project team members include Bob Rohlf (Exterro), Peter Pepiton (Dinsmore), Chris Paskach (The Claro Group), P. Sean d\u2019Albertis (Faegre), Kevin Clark (Thompson & Knight), Martin Tully (Akerman), Seth Eichenholtz (Mastercard), Quin Gregor (SigINT), Sunil Ohri (Stein Mitchell), and Noah Lauricella (Goldenberg Law). \n \nLTPI with industry partner ACEDS will host a webinar to discuss the guide and share best practices regarding the technical issues involved in a meet and confer. The webinar entitled \u201cMastering a Meaningful Meet-and-Confer\u201d will take place on February 23, 2017 at 1:00 PM EDT. More information about the webinar including how to register can be here . \n \nThe guide is currently open for public comment for the next 30 days by the legal community before being finalized and released. \nTo learn more about the Meet and Confer Guide, visit https://www.legaltechpi.org/Meet-and-Confer . \n \nLTPI is open to suggestions for new projects and accepting new project members. Requests for new projects can be submitted at https://legaltechpi.org/Projects-New-Project-Proposal or sent to programs(at)legaltechpi.org. \n \nAbout LTPI \nLegal Technology Professional Institute ( http://www.legaltechpi.org ) is a nonprofit legal association for legal practitioners who are involved in the use of technology utilized by the legal industry, including eDiscovery in litigation and investigations, and information governance.

Excluding transportation-related goods, orders rose 0.5 percent, the sixth straight increase. \n \nThe report adds to recent evidence that manufacturers are climbing out of a roughly two-year rut. A strong U.S. dollar and falling oil and gas prices had sliced demand for factory products, as drillers ordered less steel pipe and other equipment. Yet demand has risen since oil prices have stabilized. \n \nOrders for industrial machinery rose 0.4 percent last month, while demand for computers, semiconductors and electronic goods jumped 2.4 percent. Orders for autos climbed 2 percent, a sign automakers expect additional sales growth. \n \nOther measures of the U.S. manufacturing sector have also improved. A private survey earlier this month found that manufacturing activity in December rose to its highest level in two years, led higher by strong increases in new orders and production. \n \nAnd manufacturing output rose 0.2 percent in December, according to a report from the Federal Reserve. Auto sales reached a record level in 2016, and automakers continued cranking out vehicles through the end of the year. \n \nStill, manufacturing has not yet fully rebounded. Manufacturing output rose just 0.2 percent in all of 2016, according to the Fed. \n \nAnd business investment in long-lasting goods fell 3.4 percent last year, despite the gains of the past three months.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"CHRISTOPHER S.

It's un-American' \n\nUpdated: Jan 29, 2017 03:20 AM EST \n\nG. Morty Ortega/ \n\nRelated content \n\n(CNN) - More protests against President Donald Trump's immigration policies are set for Sunday across the country after hundreds of demonstrators converged on airports the day before.. \n\nProtests are scheduled today in Washington, Orlando, Boston, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Seattle, and Chicago, mostly at airports. \n\nThis is the second weekend of demonstrations, with more than 1 million people coming out last weekend for the Women's March. \n\nOlivia Katbi Smith told CNN affiliate KATU she showed up Saturday at Portland International Airport because she believes Trump's immigration policies are cruel. \n\n\"I think it's horrific and terrible and we are basically condemning people to death by not allowing them to come here,\" she said. \n\nShe said the event appeared to be impromptu. She heard about it on Twitter and thinks most people did the same. \n\nIn New York City, a large crowd massed at John F. Kennedy International Airport to protest the detention of two Iraqis who were later released. \n\n\"Mr. President, look at us,\" said US Rep. Nydia Velazquez, a New York Democrat. \"This is America. What you have done is shameful. It's un-American.\" \n\nThe protesters gathered in Terminal 4 at JFK and carried signs reading, \"We are all immigrants!\" and \"No ban! No wall!\" \n\nSeveral New York officials showed support for the protests. \n\nGov. Andrew Cuomo ordered the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to reverse an earlier decision to restrict passage aboard the JFK Airport AirTrain to ticketed passengers and airport employees only. \n\nHe also instructed state police and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to assist with security and transportation for protesters. \n\n\"The people of New York will have their voices heard,\" Cuomo said. \n\nNew York Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted: \"What's happening at JFK is shameful. @NYCImmigrants Affairs Commissioner Nisha Agarwal is on the ground now working to help.\" \n\nAirport arrests \n\nOne of the detained Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh, was released early Saturday afternoon. He worked with the US government for 10 years after the United States invaded Iraq. \n\nThe other detained Iraqi, Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been granted a visa to join his wife, who worked for a US contractor in Iraq, and son, both of whom already live in the United States as refugees. Alshawi was released later Saturday. \n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union argued Saturday evening in a federal court in New York for a nationwide stay that would block the deportation of all people stranded in US airports under what the group called \"President Trump's new Muslim ban.\" \n\nA federal judge in New York granted an emergency stay Saturday night for citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries who have already arrived in the US and those who are in transit, and who hold valid visas, ruling they cannot be removed from the US. \n\nThat move limited part of President Trump's executive order barring citizens from those countries from entering the US for the next 90 days. \n\nRep. Jerrold Nadler, another Democrat from New York, said 10 other travelers were detained, but their status was unclear Saturday night. \n\nVirginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe joined protesters at Dulles International Airport outside Washington. \n\n\"This executive order is antithetical to the values that make America great, and it will make our country less safe,\" he said in a statement. \n\nIn Portland, one demonstrator carried a sign that said, \"Portland coffee comes from Yemen,\" one of the seven Muslim-majority nations on the no-travel list. \n\nLucia Martinez told KATU she used to be a \"hashtag activist\" but felt compelled to protest at the airport. \n\n\"This was the last straw,\" she said of Trump's policies. \"We're all immigrants.\" \n\nA group of community activists, attorneys and others gathered at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago. \n\nProtests also took place at airports in Boston; San Francisco, Denver, Dallas and Newark, New Jersey.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Political unrest news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Religion news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Protests against Trump's 'Muslim ban' continue","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Craven","zipCode":"28560","state":"North Carolina","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"New Bern","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WCTI12.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"191384910","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"42"},"name":"WCTI12.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Politics","Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wcti12.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204307807","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:28:15Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

On Thursday\u2019s Morning Drive on the Golf Channel, live at the Orange County Convention Center, the STAR EV Sirius took center stage along with big industry names like Club Car, E-Z-Go, and Garia. \n \nAlthough primarily associated with golf, the golf car industry now encompasses a wide range of small vehicles from LSVs (a street legal low-speed vehicle) to utility vehicles to the classic golf course companion. STAR EV kept the golf course-to-neighborhood overlap in mind with the ground-up creation of the new Sirius model, which boasts automotive conveniences like an electronic locking trunk, USB port, LED illuminated dashboard, and self-cancelling turn signals. But it is still golf course worthy, with optional golf ball holder inserts, and a large bagwell, or the option of a 2-in-1 Combo Seat (a patented design that turns a rear seat into a golf bag holder without tools). \n \nSTAR EV revealed two prototypes at its PGA show exhibit; a standard Sirius with 2-in-1 Combo Seat, and a \u201ctricked-out\u201d version to show how customizable the Sirius will be. The front trunk gives the golf car the look of a hood that can be painted a different color from the main body, like the sleek matte black trunk on the deep metallic maroon prototype. STAR EV also offers a variety of wheels, with rim finishes in machined aluminum, matte black, dura chrome, black PVD, and special color accents. \n \nWhile the models at the show were standard 2 and 4-passenger vehicles, the Sirius line will expand to include 6 and 8 passenger models like the STAR EV Classic.

That is to be truly free.\u201d as he stressed his statement. \n \n\u201cHappiness with a health body and a health mind is almost what everyone wishes to possess,\u201d as the Zen master clarified, \u201cHigh conscious intelligence, from Healing to Health with Harmony and Happiness penetrates and permeates into all the communities of Zen world, further prevailing into all conscious beings around the globe.\u201d \n \nAccording to DeRu, Zen sees one conscious world, and one conscious being with one breath and one source of origin, from nothing to everything, expanding to apparent visible world as one sees with naked eye. However; the invisible potentiality is unlimited and infinite. The high conscious intelligence continues its path to infinite potentiality to everlasting-limitless universe. \n \nDeRu further explained: \"Zen sees the reality of potentiality is in the emptiness within and between the visible worlds. It is that emptiness of potentiality makes the universe going with consistent and constant expanding in infinity.\" \n \nThis is how the Zen Master sees the world, \"The high conscious mind of the universe guides and decides the direction of the universe expansion and development. When one follows the heart of the high conscious universe, one believes and achieves one\u2019s dream with unwavering faith and confidence. One will eventually be intotal communication and merge with that of infinite oneness.\" \n \n\u201cIt is that Zen mind propagates and instigates Imagination which opens the 3rd eye to vision the infinite Potentiality of the true reality of the universe.\" according to DeRu. \u201cWe are all part of, and microcosm of the universe. Our body particles are universal participles and our atoms are part of the universe atoms. Our conscious Qi waves are closely connected with the Qi waves of the universe consciousness which set the parameter to guide each step of our path if we wish to discover within the happiness and health.\u201d \n \nZen philosophy along with Zen way of living has been in lead in high conscious living beings for thousands of years. Zen Master DeRu sees Quantum theory along with scientific experiment of quantum physics gives lights, like taking many pictorial shots of reality of the world, to ordinary conscious beings, believers and non believers alike to observe and see the truth of the world, and the conscious universe in communication and expansion with unlimited potentiality without time or space limitations. \n \nDeRu firmly believes, \"In that Zen world one begins to see, In lieu of the fittest and fiercest fight for victory and survival with competitiveness from the selected few, humanity leading all conscious beings together claim victory by synergy and cooperation with compassion and love.\u201d \n \nDeRu maintains, \"war and fierce competition is for ignorant self-serving few, leading to self-destruction, it is, he said, the synergy in peace with harmony in cooperation leading all beings to greater development in advancement of conscious beings.\" \n \n\"Leaving Newton as a hero of the past,\" he insists, \"we must move on, following vision of the Ancient Chan in all conscious, subconscious and superconscious communication, human beings shall explore further. seeing beyond and through that visible illusionary world into that true universe intelligence and wisdom, and see the true potential world beyond time and space with the guidance of Albert Einstein, Max Planck and Niels Bohr\u2019s scientific minds.\" \n \nMaster Shi DeRu a 31 generation Shaolin Chan (Zen) Master has been teaching Living Zen Mind and Zen meditation with TaGong for over three decades worldwide, especially in China and the US. \n \nHe has been hosting his Annual Qi Retreat in the US for the last two decades with various theme topics on health and happy living.

She has been with DATAMARK for 17 years, starting her career with the company in 2000 as a software developer. \n \n\u201cNina\u2019s long track record of success in delivering business process improvement solutions to our clients will be an asset in her new role as VP of Sales and Marketing,\u201d said DATAMARK President Bill Randag. \u201cNina\u2019s experience as a technical sales specialist and her deep understanding of the roles that people, process and technology play in business process management make her the ideal candidate for this position.\u201d \n \nBrown assumes the role of VP of Sales and Marketing during an exciting time of growth and expansion for DATAMARK. As a result of this recent growth, DATAMARK recently announced the opening of a second service delivery center in India, located in the country\u2019s financial and commercial center of Mumbai. DATAMARK\u2019s service footprint currently extends across multiple locations in the U.S., Mexico and India. \n \nAfter joining DATAMARK in 2000, Brown played an active role in leading software development projects for clients in the financial services, insurance and healthcare payer sectors, helping achieve new levels of process efficiency and cost savings. Brown later took on significant roles as a project manager, leading large-scale BPO transitions, including the launch of new consolidated mailroom services for a prominent leader in the banking industry in 2006. She then continued to partner with Sales and Marketing to expand partnerships, services, and locations and was instrumental in driving initiatives which led to over $15 million in new revenue for DATAMARK, including the expansion of a partnership in 2010 with a Fortune 100 financial services client, yielding the opening of a new domestic operational facility. \n \nIn 2012, Brown established DATAMARK\u2019s Business Engineering Department, to serve as a team of technical sales specialists for the company, and also introduced Consulting as a new service in the company portfolio. In this capacity, she and her Engineering department were involved in engagements which led to multiple new client partnerships as well as significant incremental revenue increases over the years. Thus, soon after, she was promoted to DATAMARK\u2019s Senior Management Team as Director of Engineering, responsible for oversight of the Business Engineering and Software Development and Validation departments. In this role, she continued to exceed client expectations, establishing DATAMARK as an industry leader in core business technology to enhance operational services, including the DATAMARK proprietary Document Tracking System and INDIGO Processing System. With her extensive experience with technology and process improvement, Nina has been uniquely poised to identify opportunities for business optimization and business growth, thus continuously working to strengthen and expand the DATAMARK client base. \n \nThroughout her career at DATAMARK, she has worked closely with the Sales and Marketing teams, applying her process redesign expertise to RFP responses and business process improvement solutions for clients. Brown has also represented DATAMARK as a subject matter expert in numerous webinar presentations, marketing videos, and at industry events and tradeshows. In her new role, Brown will integrate Business Engineering with Sales and Marketing, creating a cohesive structure for business development aligned with technical sales. \n \n\u201cI\u2019m delighted to be leading our Sales and Marketing teams as DATAMARK moves to add new clients to our BPO and contact center services portfolio,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWe will continue to build on our reputation as a business service provider that brings together best-fit technology solutions and a talented international workforce that acts with integrity to exceed the expectations of our partners for customer service, quality, timeliness and security.\u201d \n \nBrown is certified in Action Selling, is an ASQ-certified Six Sigma Black Belt (CSSBB) and a certified Project Management Professional (PMP). \n \nAbout DATAMARK \n \nDATAMARK, Inc. is a leading business process outsourcing company specializing in high-volume digital mailroom management, document processing/document management, contact center services, and process improvement consulting for Fortune 500 companies and other large enterprises. \n \nHeadquartered in El Paso, Texas, DATAMARK employs nearly 2,000 people in its U.S., Mexico and India facilities.

If that comes to pass, she won't be the only one making a big play for attention this year. \n \nAdvertisers from first-timer 84 Lumber to veteran Hyundai are ramping up the marketing stunts in order to stand out from the crowd during the big game. Some will air live ads, or at least teasers for their campaigns; one will even shoot its commercial during the game. Others are deliberately courting controversy. \n \nSuper Bowl LI, in which the Atlanta Falcons will take on the New England Patriots, is expected to be the biggest live TV event of the year. \n \nThe war for attention \n \nEvery year, more than 30 advertisers vie to create the most-remembered 30 to 90 seconds of the Super Bowl by stuffing commercials with celebrities, slapstick humor and cute animals. \n \nBut now that so many ads get pre-released online or teased ahead of the game, advertisers have a harder time making a lasting impression. And with more than 110 million people expected to tune in on Feb. 5 and 30-second spots going for around $5 million, they need to scramble hard. \n \nSo this year, marketers are turning to stunts. \n \n\"It used to be, 'We need a Super Bowl spot.' Then, it was, 'We need a Super Bowl spot and program,' \" said Mark DiMassimo, CEO of ad agency DiMassimo Goldstein in New York. \"Now, it's 'We need a Super Bowl stunt or event. It needs to be newsworthy, social and surprising - and it needs to be much bigger than 30 seconds.' \" \n \nGoing live \n \nSnickers said Wednesday it will air a live Super Bowl ad in the third quarter starring Adam Driver (\"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\"). The Mars brand will also live-stream the set of the commercial for 36 hours ahead of the spot. \n \n\"The actual ad is only part of the equation,\" said Allison Miazga-Bedrick, a Snickers brand director, who promises \"over 30 hours of original content\" streamed live leading up to the game. \n \nSimilarly, Wix - an Israeli website hosting service- turned to Facebook Live and YouTube Live on Jan. 17 to debut teasers for its Super Bowl ad. The teaser - which was prerecorded and only streamed live - starred Israeli actress and model Gal Gadot, who plays Wonder Woman in her own film later this year, and the English actor Jason Statham (\"The Fast and the Furious\"). \n \nThe company said it's the first time a Super Bowl campaign has been launched live. \n \nBetting on rejection \n \nFirst-time Super Bowl advertiser 84 Lumber pulled a vintage ad stunt when the company went public with claims that Fox rejected its original ad because it was too \"controversial.\" \n \nThe Pennsylvania building materials supplier bought a 90-second ad during the game - a huge commitment for a regional brand. But Amy Smiley, the company's director of marketing, said its first ad was rejected because some of its imagery, including a border wall that supposedly prevented people from working in the U.S., steered too close to political rhetoric about the Mexican border from President Donald Trump. \n \nFox declined to comment, ensuring that 84 Lumber got plenty of press well ahead of the game. \n \nShooting on the fly \n \nIn perhaps the biggest gamble, Hyundai is teaming with director Peter Berg (\"Deepwater Horizon\") to actually film a 90-second ad while the Super Bowl is underway. Hyundai said the ad will show \"off the field\" moments captured during the game, and will air right after the contest ends. \n \nTraditionally, ads that air before or after the Super Bowl itself aren't very successful at drawing eyeballs. But the on-the-fly aspect of this ad could make it hard to ignore. \n \n\"The challenge for all of these companies is, 'How do you stand out?' \" said Tim Calkins, a marketing professor at Northwestern University. \"As a result, we're going to see this year people try some very curious approaches.\" \n \nDean Evans, Hyundai's chief marketing officer, said the shoot-during-the-game approach is all about buzz. \n \n\"We wanted to test ourselves,\" Evans said. \"We thought we would have to do it in a new and nontraditional way to really show the U.S. public that we're back in the game.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"MAE ANDERSON Of The"},"topics":[{"name":"Hyundai Motor Company news","group":"Companies"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: American football news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Super Bowl ads are going for stunts","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Nez Perce","zipCode":"83501","state":"Idaho","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Lewiston","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Lewiston Tribune","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169718949","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"740"},"name":"Lewiston Tribune","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Business","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.lmtribune.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204311798","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:28:16Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/lmtribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/b/1d/b1df03ff-8c23-5960-b6bf-c7662479bbc4/588bdf4784461.image.jpg?resize=300%2C230"}],"video":[]}}

Would you consider \u2018nationalism\u2019 as a major obstacle for the process of \u2018globalization\u2019? \n \nAs in all things, it is complicated. For example, there can be a positive relationship between them as, for example, in the global trend toward increased nationalism during WW I and II. There could also be a negative relationship as in the global trend away from nationalism after those wars and their disastrous effects. At the moment, of course, the trend toward nationalism is serving as an obstacle to globalization. But these things are dialectical and sooner or later the pendulum will swing back. \n \nCan we see Trump\u2019s election to presidency, UK withdrawal from EU and rise of right-wing parties in Europe as a failure for process of globalization? Or it\u2019s better to regard them as temporary phenomena? \n \nAs implied in the answer to question 1, it is temporary (of course, temporary could last years or even decades). I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a \u201cfailure\u201d of globalization, but rather another moment in its ebb and flow. \n \nWhat is the role of religion in the globalization process, given that religions such as Christianity and Islam claim universal values; can we suppose the religion as rival for globalization? \n \nNo, religion is one of the most important globalizing forces both historically and contemporaneously. Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Judaism, and others have globalized and have had a wide-scale impact on the world. I think you are assuming, as most people do, that globalization equals economic globalization, but from my point of view it is one of a number of aspects of globalization (this communication between us is another minor example) \n \nSome countries and cultures resist against globalization, justifying their resistance by the premise that it would devastate cultural diversity in our world; instead, they put emphasis on local values and cultures. Would you think that the localization is a barrier to globalization? Or it can enrich our world and globalization process? \n \nBoth! Localization is a barrier to many forms of globalization and in that sense can be a barrier to the enrichments associated with globalization. On the other hand, the local is a source of great diversity and much of that can be, and has been, globalized. Of course, the exclusionary power of the local can limit or eliminate the spread of that diversity. \n \nDoes globalization equal westernization or Americanization? Or you recognize a model of multipolar world which includes China, Europe and Islamic-Arabic countries? \n \nNo, but they have been the most powerful globalizing forces in the last two centuries. With their decline we will have an increasingly multipolar world. China will be an increasingly important globalizing force, especially economically, in the years to come. Europe is part of the west, but its independent influence on globalization is declining with the problems in the EU. At the moment, at least under Trump, the U.S. is opting for a smaller role globally. Islam has had a powerful effect historically and to this day. Unfortunately, its positive influence today has been obscured by the tendency, at least in much of the West, to associate it, or at least its more radical elements, with terrorism. \n \nYou can also read the interview in ARABIC.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Asia-Pacific latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"China news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"China rising globalizing force thanks...","source":{"category":"Organisation","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"South-Eastern Asia","countryCode":"ID","country":"Indonesia"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Organization of Asia-Pacific News Agencies","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169667991","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"10"},"name":"Organization of Asia-Pacific News Agencies","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Organisations"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.oananews.org"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204311963","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:28:16Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The country\u2019s courts convict and imprison peaceful dissenters and have failed to hold officials accountable for torture and other serious rights violations. \n\nEdward Corrigan said Western countries are more concerned about their strategic alliance with the Al-Khalifa regime than about human rights or the wishes of the majority of the population in Bahrain. \n\nHe warned if the population of Bahrain explodes in anger over the repression and discriminatory treatment, it will put in jeopardy the presence of the United States and Britain, given their long history of support for the Al-Khalifa dictatorship. \n\n\u201cStrategic relationship with the Al-Khalifa regime is due to its strategic location of Bahrain which allows the United States and Britain to project their power in the Persian Gulf area,\u201d Corrigan noted in an exclusive interview with Mehr News Agency: \n\nWhat is the outcome of Bahraini government\u2019s suppression of pro-democracy activists? How do you evaluate the role of international community in countering the crimes and torture in Bahrain? \n\nThe brutal repression of peaceful marchers who are protesting the execution by firing squad of the three young activists is only going to intensify the resistance to the Al-Khalifa regime. If the regime does not allow peaceful protest and recognize the right to free speech and address the concerns of the majority Shia population there will be more violence. If one suppresses peaceful protest then it makes it inevitable that violent protest will result if there is no other alternative. \n\nIn September 2016 in a joint statement signed by 35 countries, the UN Human Rights Council expressed serious concern about human rights violations in Bahrain including imprisonment of those exercising their rights to freedom of expression, assembly and association, and lack of accountability. \n\nIn response to the executions the international community has been more vocal in their criticism. The United Nations Human Rights Commissioner issued a harsh rebuke saying that it was appalled by the executions. The UN Commission said they had \u201cserious doubts whether the accused were provided with the right to have a fair trial.\u201d \n\nThe UN Committee was extremely critical of the trials and executions. In a Press Release they wrote: \u201cWe are appalled at the execution by firing squad of three men in Bahrain on Sunday. The men had been convicted of a bombing in Manama in 2014 that killed three police officers. They were found guilty after being allegedly tortured into making false confessions and their lawyers were not given access to all the evidence against them nor allowed to cross-examine prosecution witnesses during court hearings.\u201d \n\nThey were joined by the United States who said they were \u201cconcerned\u201d about the executions. France also condemned the executions. Great Britain and the European Union deplored the use of the death penalty in this situation. Many other countries including Iran, and Iraq strongly condemned the executions of what they called \u201cpolitical\u201d prisoners. \n\nHere is what Human Rights Watch wrote about the trials: \u201cThe UN Human Rights Committee, which interprets the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which Bahrain has ratified, has said that \u201cin cases of trials leading to the imposition of the death penalty scrupulous respect of the guarantees of fair trial is particularly important and that any death penalty imposed after an unfair trial would be a violation of the right to life. Human Rights Watch opposes the death penalty in all circumstances because of its inherent cruelty.\u201d \n\nAmnesty International has made similar criticism of the trials and called them \u201cunfair\u201d and they noted that the confessions were based on torture. The trials did not meet the required international standards. \n\nHow do you analyze the role of other countries, including US and UK, in raising tensions in Bahrain resulting in human rights abuses? \n\nThe muted protests of the United States, Great Britain and other Western powers is appalling. They are more concerned about their strategic alliance with the Al-Khalifa regime than about human rights or the wishes of the majority of the population in Bahrain. Britain has a military presence in Bahrain which they wish to protect. The United States 5th Fleet is based in Bahrain. The Americans also provide other support. In June 2016, the US government lifted its embargo on arms sales to the Bahrain National Guard and Bahrain Defense Forces. In August 2016 approved an US$150 million deal to supply military aircraft parts, ammunition and communications equipment to Bahrain. These actions reward the Manama regime for its violation of human and political rights. \n\nIf the population of Bahrain explodes in anger over the repression and discriminatory treatment, it will put in jeopardy the presence of the United States and Britain, given their long history of support for the Al-Khalifa dictatorship. \n\nWhy human rights pretenders like the US and UK not only are silent against Bahraini government curtailing freedoms of expression, association and assembly and cracking down on dissent, but also provide the country with financial aids? \n\nAgain it is the perceived \u201cstrategic relationship\u201d with the Al-Khalifa regime and the strategic location of Bahrain which allows the United States and Britain to project their power in the Persian Gulf area that dominates the thinking of the Western Powers. The importance of oil and the ongoing support of the British, and now the Americans, for the monarchical dictatorships in the Persian Gulf region necessitates a military presence to prop up the autocratic feudal regimes in the area. There is a realization on the part of the West that if they did not support the Persian Gulf States with weapons, money and military force if needed, these regimes would collapse given their precarious nature. \n\nDo you think the Conflict, Stability and Security Fund (CSSF)- a financial pool worth more than £1bn a year- is evidence of the militarization of Britain\u2019s development budget and UK complicity in abuses? \n\nYes. This budget is largely without oversight and is controlled by the Conservative British government at the present time. There has been funding to Bahrain in the amount of two million pounds. It does appear that this fund is being used to support dictatorships and not development. \n\nMany activists, NGOs and Human rights campaigners in Bahrain, like the Labor party in Britain, complain about the lack of transparency surrounding how the reserves are spent and about a high degree of ambiguity about the status of the CSSF fund. What do you think about this? \n\nThis money is reportedly to help Bahrain to improve its justice system and to improve human rights in the tiny Persian Gulf monarchy. However, as critics have pointed out that the justice system in Bahrain is getting much worse. Torture is being used against prisoners and being used to convict activists with some receiving the death sentence. In addition there is violent suppression of peaceful demonstrators, the killing of unarmed demonstrators and the revocation of citizenship from more than 200 Bahrainis. Freedom of speech and political rights are under severe attack in Bahrain. There have been calls in Britain by the Labor Opposition and by human rights groups to stop sending money to Bahrain until the Al-Khalifa regime substantially improves its human rights record. This money should be used to improve human rights and not to reward human rights abusers. \n\nEdward C.

The loss is a calculation of revenue and expenses at the port's container dock, a large warehouse, its rentals and a telecommunications network it is constructing, according to the port's annual audit. \n \nOne of the largest expenses was depreciation at $406,469, which has to be deducted as infrastructure ages, but is not real dollars going out the door. \n \nThe port experienced losses in the same category of $92,435 in fiscal year 2013, $445,497 in fiscal year 2014 and $401,917 in fiscal year 2015. \n \nPort officials contend the losses are not an accurate picture of the port's overall financial health. \n \nThe port's net position was $24.3 million at the end of fiscal year 2016 and $21.9 million at the end of fiscal year 2013. \n \nThat number includes the port's capital assets, which were $19.6 million in fiscal year 2016 and $17.3 million in fiscal year 2013, according to an email from port Manager David Doeringsfeld. \n \nIt also contains the more than $400,000 the port receives each year in property taxes and more than $1 million in gains from property sales. \n \nThe port used to ship dried peas and lentils from its container dock until the overseas carriers that took them to their final destinations stopped calling on the Port of Portland. That service is expected to resume in the future, but it is \"unlikely\" to return during the present fiscal year, according to the audit. Plenty of cargo still originates in Lewiston at the Lewis Clark Terminal that handles bulk agricultural commodities. \n \nSt. Joseph Regional Medical Center: No deal yet \n \nThe wait to see what will happen to the area's largest hospital continues. \n \nThe Idaho Attorney General's Office received a two-month extension to finish its review of the matter, citing a need for more time to obtain information such as the due diligence St. Joseph Regional Medical Center completed in selecting a buyer. The decision had been due on Jan. 18. It now can be issued as late as March 20. \n \nRCCH Regional Healthcare Partners in Brentwood, Tenn., is poised to acquire St. Joe's from Ascension in a $109 million deal. \n \nThe would-be buyer is part of the investment firm, Apollo Global Management, and operates a network of 17 regional health care systems in other areas. Ascension is based in St. Louis. It is the largest not-for-profit health system in the United States and the biggest Catholic medical organization in the world. \n \n57 channels and no FOX on \n \nA notice about an ongoing dispute is all Cable One viewers see when they turn on KAYU-FOX. The cable company that serves the Lewiston-Clarkston Valley and the owner of the Spokane network affiliate don't see eye to eye on a retransmission agreement. (See accompanying stories.) The standoff shocked many Cable One customers. It started on New Year's Day and prevented many viewers from seeing the Seattle Seahawks beat the San Francisco 49ers in a regular-season finale aired on KAYU-FOX. \n \nA new face for Thunder Jet \n \nBrunswick didn't skimp on talent when it chose a leader for its recent Clarkston acquisition, Thunder Jet. Erik Bon Fleur, an engineer who's completing his master's in administration, is in charge of the operations, which employ close to 100. Brunswick, a multinational company with 16,000 employees, intends to keep all of the Thunder Jet operations in Clarkston, where it is renovating and expanding. Thunder Jet provided Brunswick an entrance into the heavy-gauge welded aluminum boat market, a sector that serves those who pilot boats in tough conditions such as whitewater and the ocean. \n \nMore hamburgers anyone? \n \nHamburgers are one of the foods diners order most when they go out to eat.

The airlines want to work together on setting prices and schedules, which is forbidden without an exemption from antitrust laws. \n \nThe Obama administration rejected immunity for the deal, but airline-industry officials believe that the new Trump administration will be friendlier. \n \n\"We are hopeful that the Trump administration will give the Qantas joint venture a second and more favorable look,\" said Stephen Johnson, American's executive vice president. \n \nJohnson added that American, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines are also asking the administration to re-examine whether Middle Eastern carriers Emirates, Qatar Airways and Etihad Airways are violating an open-skies treaty by receiving unfair subsidies from their governments. The Obama administration did not act on the U.S. carriers' complaints. \n \nAt airports around the country, momentum is clearly swinging toward higher fares. \n \nAmerican predicted that total revenue for every seat flown one mile in the first quarter would be 2.5 percent to 4.5 percent higher than in early 2016. That is a more optimistic forecast than rivals have offered, although comparisons can be tricky - American includes some revenue, such as from credit-card deals, that other airlines don't include. \n \nThe same figure rose 1.3 percent in the fourth quarter, the first such increase in so-called unit revenue since the last quarter of 2014, American said. \n \nThat trend is not an accident. Airlines have been slowing their growth to tighten the supply of seats and drive up average fares. American said it would add only 1 percent to passenger-carrying capacity this year. \n \nAmerican is taking other steps to boost revenue. Next month it will start selling \"basic economy\" tickets designed to win over passengers from discount airlines like Spirit and Frontier. It also plans to offer \"premium economy\" tickets on international flights that would be better than a regular economy seat but less expensive than business class. \n \nAmerican's costs, however, are rising sharply. Because of profit sharing and higher wages in new union contracts, the company spent $2.8 billion on labor in the fourth quarter, an increase of more than $400 million in a year, which CFRA Research analyst Jim Corridore called alarming. And American predicted that costs per mile would jump 9 percent in the first quarter. \n \n\"It's great that they've got unit revenue moving in the right direction, but investors are very focused on costs,\" Corridore said. He said that concern explained the stock's slide on Friday.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"DAVID KOENIG Of The"},"topics":[{"name":"Airline industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Stockwatch","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Finance latest","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Earnings news","group":"Finance"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"American Airlines matches Wall Street forecast for 4Q despite decline in profits","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Nez Perce","zipCode":"83501","state":"Idaho","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Lewiston","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Lewiston Tribune","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169718949","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"740"},"name":"Lewiston Tribune","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Business","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.lmtribune.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204317032","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:28:16Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

They can also be purchased at places like Deranleau's, Walgreens, Shopko, Rite Aid and Walmart, sometimes appearing in the \"As Seen On TV\" displays. The cost ranges from $12 to $30, but finding one might be tough. Deranleau's has struggled to keep them in stock this month. The down side to antennas is that bad weather can interfere with reception, said Dan Jimenez, sales manager at Deranleau's in Lewiston. \n \nQ: What if I want to watch more than the major networks? \n \nA: First get high-speed internet. Cable One has options starting at about $50 a month for the service, but the price can vary depending on how much speed and data you want. Other providers that serve this market include Century Link, Rodeo Internet and First Step Internet. \n \nSubscribe to a service such as Sling TV, Hulu, Netflix or Amazon Prime. Look at the offerings first to find a good match for your tastes. Sling has a 30-plus channel package with ESPN, ESPN2, ESPN3, CNN, Newsy and Bloomberg Television for $20 per month. \n \nHulu, Netflix and Amazon Prime carry a variety of television shows and movies. Hulu starts at $8 per month for an option that has commercials. It offers current season shows from major U.S. networks the day after they run. Netflix is as little as $8 per month and doesn't have commercials. Amazon Prime runs $11 per month and includes other services such as free expedited shipping on Amazon orders. \n \nThese services include other features. They have multiple seasons of shows, so you can binge watch something you missed. You may or may not save money depending on which options you pick. One of Cable One's most popular cable packages costs $80 per month. \n \nYou could also skip the subscriptions entirely and instead budget for an amount each month to buy movies or shows on digital video discs. \n \nQ: What do I need to get content I purchase from one of those services to appear on my television? \n \nA: First, check the streaming media player in your television. About seven or eight years ago, most televisions began to be sold with the technology that connects the televisions to the internet, said Bill Steiner, an owner of Steiner Electronics in Lewiston. Gaming devices such as Sony PlayStation, Microsoft Xbox and Nintendo Wii have similar capabilities. \n \nIf what you already own doesn't have the applications for the content you have selected, look into a stand alone streaming media player, which can be connected to your television, Steiner said. Some examples are the Amazon Fire TV Stick ($40), Apple TV (about $150) or a Roku (about $100). \n \nQ: What about satellite television? \n \nA: Offerings such as DISH and DIRECTV can cost as little as $40 per month and provide content similar to cable. Keep in mind that weather conditions can occasionally interfere with reception and just like cable, satellite television customers sometimes are cut off from networks. Cable companies and satellite providers both negotiate deals to air major networks and other content. \n \n--- \n \nWilliams may be contacted at ewilliam@lmtribune.com or (208) 848-2261.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"ELAINE WILLIAMS of the Tribune"},"topics":[{"name":"Internet latest","group":"Internet"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Ready to cut the cable?","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Nez Perce","zipCode":"83501","state":"Idaho","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Lewiston","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Lewiston Tribune","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169718949","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"740"},"name":"Lewiston Tribune","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Business","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.lmtribune.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204323981","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:28:19Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/lmtribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/f/66/f6661374-aa61-5d7d-bdb4-245b8e13ba5e/588be35ea8347.image.jpg?resize=300%2C257"}],"video":[]}}

City officials last week were unable to find the results of subscriber surveys that are required by the agreement once every five years. \n \nWhat Cable One offers has been evolving in recent years. The company dropped Viacom channels such as MTV in 2014. It is not carrying KAYU-FOX because of a disagreement over retransmission fees. \n \nCable One has stated previously it has no intention of leaving the cable business, but it has told stock market analysts it's putting its emphasis on pursuing high-speed internet customers. \n \nIt's too early to know if Lewiston's elected officials will view negotiating a new contract as an opportunity to influence how Cable One approaches the Lewiston market, said Lewiston Mayor Jim Kleeburg. \n \nWhatever direction Lewiston goes would likely involve cooperation with the city of Clarkston and Asotin County. \n \nThose municipalities have similar agreements with Cable One, but they end at different times. Clarkston's runs through 2019, and Asotin County's ends in either 2023 or 2024 (the current contract lists both years). \n \nWere a company other than Cable One to seek to serve the Lewiston-Clarkston Valley, it would likely have to acquire the cable provider's infrastructure, said Joe Poire, executive director of the Port of Whitman County, who spent 11 years in the cable industry. \n \nThe public telecommunications network being constructed by the ports of Lewiston and Clarkston wouldn't have the capacity to serve a new company without significant investment that goes beyond what's contemplated, Poire said. \n \nNo law requires communities to be served by cable companies, according to the Federal Communications Commission, which regulates the industry. \n \nBut the chances of the Lewiston-Clarkston Valley ending up without cable services are low, regardless of what happens in the telecommunications industry, Poire said. \n \n\"The ... market is big enough it's a viable asset.\" \n \n--- \n \nWilliams may be contacted at ewilliam@lmtribune.com or (208) 848-2261.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"ELAINE WILLIAMS of the Tribune"},"topics":[{"name":"Cable industry news","group":"Media"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Lewiston's pact with Cable One expires at the end of December","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Nez Perce","zipCode":"83501","state":"Idaho","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Lewiston","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Lewiston Tribune","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169718949","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"740"},"name":"Lewiston Tribune","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Business","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.lmtribune.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204324935","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:28:20Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Cut his head!!! \n \n\"If they are busy killing Christians and nothing is happening, we will kill them and nothing will happen\". \n \nALSO READ: DSS invites clergyman over inciting comments \n \nAnd then he mimics someone else: 'Enh, Pastor why are you saying they should kill somebody?' \n \nSuleman's answer came from Suleman: \"Didn't David kill Goliath?

His message of love and not returning an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth, was being trod on in Kaduna, North of Nigeria. \n \nFor his reward, Suleman was guest of Governor Ayodele Fayose of Ekiti State the week after clips of his hate sermon went viral. \n \nIt had to be Fayose. \n \nFayose would spend some 10 odd minutes eulogising the Pastor for always speaking truth to power, before a crowd of crusade attendees. \n \nWhile in Ekiti, DSS (Department of State Security) operatives made to quiz Suleman, but he rang the Governor who immediately came to his rescue. \n \nWhen he's not flaunting his well tailored suits on the altar, he can be a scared man who has State Governors on speed dial. \n \nApostle Suleman has promised that Nigeria will burn if he spends a day in the custody of security operatives. \n \nHe's been invited to appear at the DSS office in Abuja on Monday, January 30, 2017. \n \nLatest news reports say Suleman has planned to storm the DSS office with as many as 30 lawyers. \n play  Apostle Suleman in action (Punch)  \n  \n \n\u201cSuleman will be appearing before the DSS with about 30 lawyers because we believe that his persecution has become politicised,\u201d one source told Punch newspaper. \n \nWho would have thought that Apostle Suleman will ever call on the services of lawyers?

Every pre-season you want that (success),\" Suckling said. \n \n\"Seeing the boys do it last year doesn't make me any hungrier, that's why you play footy, that's why you keep turning up and working hard each day.\" \n \nSuckling who left Hawthorn as unrestricted free agent at the end of 2015 only played 17 games with the dogs, having already clocked up 102 games with the Hawks. \n \nThe Bulldogs will clash with Melbourne in the opening game of the pre-season competition at Whitten Oval on February 18.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Patrick Bartley"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Matt Suckling keen but careful about return to Bulldog defence","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"4000","state":"Queensland","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Brisbane Adelaide Street","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Brisbane Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169658354","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"191"},"name":"Brisbane Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204330742","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:23:06Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:28:24Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Scientists have discovered a key \u2018survival gene\u2019 that prevents strains of tuberculosis (TB) from mutating into drug-resistant \u2018superbugs\u2019. \n \nResearchers from the Centro Nacional de Biotecnologia in Spain and the University of Sussex in the UK identified the gene called NucS that dramatically reduces mutation rates in mycobacteria \u2013 the infectious microbe which causes TB. \n \nTB, which is spread through the air, is one of the top 10 causes of death worldwide, researchers said. \n \nDrug-resistant strains of TB have already been identified in 105 countries and researchers believe that a key gene, required to suppress mutation rates in mycobacteria, may help understand how \u2018superbugs\u2019 develop. \n \nUsing a genetic screen, which involved individually knocking out nearly every gene (11,000 genes) in mycobacteria, and screening whether mutant strains grew on a specific antibiotic (rifampicin), scientists discovered that a DNA repair enzyme, produced by the NucS gene, dramatically reduces mutations from occurring. \n \nThe researchers also discovered that genetic variations in the NucS gene significantly influence the mutation rates in clinically isolated strains of mycobacteria. \n \nThe scientists believe the discovery could also play a role in understanding the development of antibiotic-resistance in patients already suffering from TB. \n \n\u201cThe rise of antibiotic resistance is a major threat to global health and, if we are to limit its impact on infectious diseases, we first need to identify the mechanisms that prevent bacteria from mutating in the first place,\u201d said Aidan Doherty, a professor at the University of Sussex. \n \n\u201cThis knowledge will then enable us to better understand how pathogens develop into \u2018superbugs\u2019,\u201d Doherty said. \n \n\u201cIncredibly, for many years it was believed that mycobacteria lacked any mutation avoidance genes,\u201d he said. \n \nThe discovery that the NucS gene reduces the rate at which mutations occur in these pathogens is a crucial first step towards identifying the genetic factors that influence the onset of antibiotic-resistance,\u201d said Doherty. \n \n\u201cThis will enable scientists and clinicians to screen for strains that are most likely to develop drug-resistance and figure out strategies to tackle this serious threat,\u201d he said. \n \n\u201cNot only does this study identify that mutations can be reversed in mycobacteria, it reveals that the loss of this DNA repair process can cause a huge increase in the mutation rates, significantly increasing the likelihood of these pathogens acquiring mutations \u2013 which can cause antibiotic resistance,\u201d Professor Jesus Blazquez, from the Centro Nacional de Biotecnologia, said. \n \n\u201cNow we know that that NucS dramatically reduces mutation rates in mycobacteria \u2013 it is vital that we take advantage of this and work towards exploiting this discovery to help doctors and microbiologists to predict and prevent the development of antibiotic resistance during treatments,\u201d said Blazquez. \n \nThe study was published in the journal Nature Communications. \n \nThis is published unedited from the PTI feed.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Press Trust of India"},"topics":[{"name":"Public health

A dramatic weakening of the peso, even below the historic lows it has already set amid Trump's bellicose rhetoric. Soaring inflation, interest rates and unemployment. \n \n\"Mexico is smaller than the U.S. and can be harmed by conflict more than the U.S. would be,\" said Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a Washington think tank that supports free trade. \n \nA trade war with Mexico \"drives down the peso and drives down opportunities for Mexicans to make a living in honest manufacturing jobs,\" he added. \"There will be more desperate Mexicans crossing the border.\" \n \nAnd the U.S. would by no means be immune from the fallout. \n \nMexico is the United States' third-largest trading partner, with about $583.6 billion in cross-border commerce in 2015, according to the Office of the United States Trade Representative. That included a U.S. trade deficit of $58 billion. America buys about 80 percent of Mexico's exports, with automobiles, electrical machinery and fuels topping a long list that also includes agricultural goods such as fruit, vegetables, wine and beer. \n \nThe Trump administration's proposal this week for a 20 percent tax on imports from Mexico to pay for the promised border wall was quickly walked back by officials as just one of multiple \"options.\" \n \nIt could also face stiff opposition in Congress, including from Republicans who favor free trade. Those include Sens. John McCain and Jeff Flake of the border state of Arizona, who publicly came out in support of NAFTA. McCain noted that it has increased his state's exports to Mexico and Canada by $5.7 billion, or 236 percent, since its enactment in 1994. \n \nThe worst case scenario of a trade war is frightening to contemplate, economists said. \n \nIf the U.S. were to slap a tax on Mexican imports, it would violate the terms of NAFTA and nullify the pact, said Alfredo Coutino, Latin America director at Moody's Analytics. \n \nMexico could impose retaliatory tariffs, and the resulting uncertainty would spook investors and businesses, including U.S. companies with operations in Mexico that could pull out. \n \nThe peso, already sorely weakened at about 21 to the dollar, could fall to 25, 28 or even lower, Coutino continued. Unemployment would rise. Mexicans' real purchasing power would plummet as a result, and inflation could soar to double digits by the end of the year. Interest rates could also top 10 percent. The Mexican government would be forced into fiscal tightening measures, putting additional downward pressure on the economy and throwing it into recession. \n \nAmerica would suffer too, but not as much. Moody's forecasts that a trade war would slightly reduce U.S. economic growth and cost 300,000 American jobs after a year. \n \nMexico has been here before, most notably when a sharp peso devaluation in 1994 touched off a nearly 6 percent economic contraction. \n \nHundreds of thousands of Mexican job-seekers poured over the border into the United States, one of the reasons the U.S. organized a $50 billion International Monetary Fund bailout of its southern neighbor in 1995. \n \nIf the U.S. economy keeps improving while Mexico's tanks, experts said, expect more of the same. And bulking up the physical barrier may not keep migrants out, with some estimates saying 40 percent of illegal immigration results from people who come to the U.S. legally and then overstay their visas. Canada does not require visas of Mexican citizens, so there's nothing to stop people from flying to Canada and crossing the United States' porous northern frontier. \n \nCritics said the U.S. president's obsession with illegal migration ignores the fact that the phenomenon has waned dramatically in recent years, and point to the irony that his policies could reverse that trend. The Pew Research Center reported in November that the number of unauthorized Mexican immigrants in the U.S. fell from 6.95 million in 2007, to 5.85 to million in 2014. \n \nCoutino predicted that economic chaos in Mexico would strengthen the cartels that traffic drugs into the U.S. - another stated target of the border wall - as unemployed people are more vulnerable to recruitment by the gangs. \n \n\"You will have a neighbor to the south of your border with unemployment, with social problems, with rising criminality,\" Coutino said. \"Do you want to have a neighbor like that? That's the question that Trump and his team should be asking themselves.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"PETER ORSI and PAUL WISEMAN Of The"},"topics":[{"name":"Central America news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Mexico news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Analysts: Trump's harsh words about Mexico could backfire","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Nez Perce","zipCode":"83501","state":"Idaho","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Lewiston","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Lewiston Tribune","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169718949","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"740"},"name":"Lewiston Tribune","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Business","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.lmtribune.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204332523","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:28:23Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Who knows. I'm not one for ifs and buts,\" the defender said. \"We are just thinking about the future. \n \n\"Pioli has brought in very high-intensity training, we've improved so much physically and I can assure you we are working so hard. \n \n\"The coach has been very clear in giving every one of us our jobs to do. The first defenders are the forwards \u2013 and in this way way he's created a strong group.\" \n \nPescara were buried by the interval as goals from D'Ambrosio and Portuguese midfielder Joao Mario put Inter on cruise control. \n \nBrazilian-born Italy striker Eder came off the bench to complete a comfortable win with just under 20 minutes left as Inter set up next week's showdown with leaders Juventus in perfect style. \n \nInter have other business first however: a midweek Italian Cup quarterfinal against a Lazio side that suddenly finds itself under pressure after a shock home defeat to mid-table Chievo dented their hopes of European football next season. \n \nAtalanta and AC Milan could both move ahead of the Roman club on Sunday after Roberto Inglese's 90th-minute strike, a scrappy close-range effort, saw Chievo snatch the points from a Stadio Olimpico clash that Lazio dominated. \n \nPUNCH THROWN \n \nAnd tempers boiled over after the final whistle when club captain Lucas Biglia was involved in an altercation with a fan hurling abuse at the players heading for the tunnel. \n \nThe Argentinian midfielder had to be ushered towards the changing rooms by stewards after the fan reportedly spat at him. \n \nSpanish-born striker Mamadou Tounkara, who had watched the match from the stands, then got involved and reportedly threw a punch at the fan. The former Barcelona academy prodigy later issued an apology for his conduct via his social media outlets. \n \nHaving coped relatively comfortably with Lazio's territorial domination, the visitors held out through a frantic five minutes of added-on time to claim a win that bolsters the buffer between them and the relegation battle. \n \nFor Lazio it was a second successive defeat after Simone Inzaghi's squad's tame surrender at leaders Juventus last weekend. \n \nAnd the suddenly under-pressure coach admitted he had his work cut out to turn things around. \n \n\"It is a defeat that will take its toll on morale, but as the head of this group I have to be big enough to get it off the players' backs and get them going again. \n \n\"The only thing to say is that we have to be more efficient in front of goal. There are lessons here we can learn from and grow.\" \n \nThe top three are all in action on Sunday with the reigning champions Juventus travelling to Sassuolo looking to hold on to a one-point and one-game-in-hand advantage over Roma, who are at Sampdoria. \n \nThird-placed Napoli host Palermo in Sunday's late match.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: soccer news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: Serie A news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: cricket news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Magnificent seven for Inter, Lazio spit fury","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Southern Africa","countryCode":"ZA","country":"South Africa"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"SuperSport.co.za","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"611212512","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"SuperSport.co.za","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Sports","Soccer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://supercricket.co.za"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204334017","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:28:23Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

That includes legal US residents temporarily out of the country.\n\nThe order has also barred all refugees from entering the US for 120 days and Syrian refugees indefinitely.\n\nAdditionally, Australian citizens who have travelled to the seven countries since March 1, 2011 are no longer eligible to enter the US under the Visa Waiver Program, and are now required to apply for a US visa.\n\nAustralians who are dual citizens of the nominated countries, including government officials, and \"have previously been issued an [Electronic System for Travel Authorisation] are likely to have the ESTA revoked\", according to the Australian government.\n\nNo travellers from Australia are known to have been immediately affected by the ban.\n\n\"The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has not received any requests for consular assistance from Australians unable to board transport to the United States,\" a spokeswoman for Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop said.\n\n\"The Australian embassy in Washington is engaging with US officials on the potential implications of the suspension for Australian travellers, including dual nationals.\n\n\"Travellers are advised that visa and other entry and exit conditions can change at short notice.\"\n\nQantas is advising anyone who thinks they may be affected to contact the airline directly or speak to their travel agent, and said it will provide affected passengers with a number of options, including a refund or a change of destination.\n\n\"Qantas notes the advice from the US government regarding tighter entry conditions,\" a spokesman for the airline said.\n\n\"We will reflect this change in our processes and booking systems, however it is not likely to materially impact Qantas passengers.\"\n\nIt is estimated 100 to 200 people who had already begun their journey when Mr Trump signed the order yesterday have been detained at US airports, according to the American Civil Liberties Union.

When will he see his elderly mother-in-law again? She is over 70 now; he doesn't want to leave it too long.\n\nConfusion and concern among immigrants and refugee advocates has been widespread, with travellers detained or sent home from US airports.\n\nThere is confusion, too, among the young men that Mr Haraco has brought down to the ocean to mull over the qualities of a leader.\n\nSome have talked about finding it difficult to get a job in Melbourne because of the colour of their skin, or their religion.\n\nThe group also discussed gangs, and young people they know who are dropping out of school, drawn to these groups.\n\nBut the bigger purpose was to inspire them, says council member Abdi Aziz, and he remains convinced that Trump's ruling won't quash their enthusiasm for multiculturalism.\n\n\"Diversity is mainstream in Australia \u2026 but the risk is there.

He told them \"attitude is all important\" for the seven-week tour. \n Rare occurrence: The Australians celebrate their series win in India in 2004.  Photo:   \n\"I was very much a follower and believer of most things Steve Waugh was talking to us about. I took that very much on board and tried to do that as much as possible, still do now. I find it a fascinating country,\" Gilchrist, who has business interests in India, told Fairfax Media. \n \n\"It's a country that weighs you down, too. You have highs and lows, it's an emotional roller-coaster, on the field and off the field. \n  \n\"You've got to find a way to escape from it \u2013 if it's in your hotel room, but you don't want to become a prisoner to your hotel room, you have to get out there. \n \n\"It's [attitude] going to be a huge percentage of what's required. The ingredients to success is a positive attitude, not just positive like you have to use your feet and go after the spinner but everything.\" \n \nGilchrist said Waugh, in a bid to keep morale high, told the players at the start of the tour \"attitudes are contagious, is yours worth catching?\" \n \n\"From that, he extended it, saying this will be a 'no whinge tour',\" Gilchrist said. \"Forever we've come to India and we're beaten before we get here. We're whinging about the food, the conditions, the umpiring and the hotel room, the flights. We weren't allow to whinge, pretty much. It was amazing. \n \n\"It's a great question you can ask yourself every day: how you think is how you feel and that's how you're going to act, is yours worth catching? And that really helped. We didn't get the chocolates on that tour but it was a strong foundation to what lay ahead.\" \n \nAustralia's players were also given a mid-tour break between Tests in 2004, which allowed them to spend time in Singapore and the Maldives with family and partners. The current squad has been given time off between the second and third Tests but they will not be leaving the country. \n \nOn the field, Gilchrist said, Australia needed to buck with tradition and adopt a more conservative game plan like the 2004 team did. Smith has already foreshadowed a more defensive strategy with the bat. \n \n\"That allowed us to get into the game without being blown away and the deeper you take it the more chance you are,\" Gilchrist said. \"The tactics will be important.\" \n \nWhile Ponting has said a competitive series loss would be a positive, Gilchrist is drawing hope from England's strong start to their recent series against India where they fell just short of victory in the first Test. But he said it would be \"frightfully difficult\". \n \n\"There's no reason why they can't get there and start well and build up confidence and be competitive about challenging for the series,\" Gilchrist said. \n \n\"As is the way in India momentum swings, whether it's an innings, a Test or a series, once it's against you it's a hard freight train to stop.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Andrew Wu"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: EPL - Liverpool news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Indian subcontinent news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"India v Australia Test series: Adam Gilchrist tells Australia to embrace India","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"4000","state":"Queensland","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Brisbane Adelaide Street","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Brisbane Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169658354","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"191"},"name":"Brisbane Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Cricket","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204346072","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:24:19Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:28:31Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Hunt Dumont to set aside the verdict and have a new trial ordered.\n\nAfter a two-month civil trial, Bailey was awarded $50,000 in damages and an additional $37,403 on Tuesday, Dec. 20, to cover lost wages when she took a nine-month leave of absence in 2014 after being diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, after a Morris County civil jury found that she had suffered emotional distress and was a victim of harassment because of her gender by higher ranking officers in the department.\n\nBailey received a separate check for $40,000 from the township to cover lost wages in 2014.\n\nHarrison claimed in his motion that the jury was incorrectly told by the judge that Bailey had participated in three counts of \"protected activity\" under . Two of the instances were separate conversations in 2010 and 2011 between Bailey former Randolph Police Chief Robert Mason in which she said it was unfair that female officers be penalized for using sick days to take care of sick children at home according to court documents.\n\nThe conversations took place after Bailey was passed over for a promotion to sergeant in consecutive years.\n\nThe third instance was Bailey's continued efforts to seek that promotion while she maintained a good faith despite her belief that gender discrimination existed within the department.\n\nAttorneys Richard Murray and Omar Lopez, who represented Bailey in the trial, have opposed Harrison's motion.\n\nAccording to court papers, Murray said that Harrison \"failed to demonstrate clearly and convincingly that there has been a miscarriage of justice that warrants a new trial.\"\n\nIn the court papers, Murray argues that Dumont's legal charge to the jury and on the verdict sheet were correct, despite Harrison's claims.\n\nHarrison wrote that the three acts and evidence in the trail did not establish protected activity under Law Against Discrimination and that the only protected activity was the filing of the 2012 lawsuit.\n\nHarrison claimed that Bailey's supervisors did not treat her any differently than they would treat any of the male police officers in the department and called witnesses at the trail to support his claim.\n\nThe verdict sheet did not specify which actions of the ranking officers originally named as defendants by Bailey were found to be offensive or discriminatory towards Bailey and resulted in the award.\n\nBy the end of the trial, Randolph Township was the sole defendant in the case although when she originally filed the lawsuit in 2012, Bailey had sued Mason, current Randolph Police Chief David Stokoe, Lts. William Harzula and Christopher Giuliani and former Township Manager John Lovell.\n\nIn the trail, Bailey alleged that she had been passed over for the promotion to sergeant because of her gender and that after questioning Mason about the results of her sergeants exams, which she did not pass, she was intimidated by Mason.\n\nShe testified that Mason pressed his body up against hers and that she was the target of internal affairs investigations and corrective action mandates, which she alleged were not endured my male officers on the force.\n\nDuring the trial, the jury found that Bailey did not prove that she should have been promoted to sergeant.\n\nA date has not yet been set for the judge to hear Harrison's motion for a new trial.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Police news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Randolph Police Department files motion for new trial in discrimination case","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Rock Island","zipCode":"61265","state":"Illinois","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Moline","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"The Progress","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169670235","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"The Progress","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://newjerseyhills.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.randolphnj.org/","http://www.randolphnj.org/POLICE","http://www.nj.gov/oag/dcr/law.html#LAD"],"sequenceId":"695204346428","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:28:32Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Polk County would see payments almost completely dry up after a reduction from $782,406 to $318. \n \nFor Marion County, the reduction would be from $1.8 million to $186,880, an 89.8 percent reduction. About 25 percent of Marion County, and 26.4 percent of the state of Oregon, is Forest Service land. \n \nThe law had provided gradually reduced payments since 2012 and was authorized a final time at $285 million in April 2015 and expired six months later. \n \nPayments to counties at the previous 25 percent level will start to be sent out in February, said Babete R. Anderson, the national press officer for the Forest Service. \n \n\"We are working through the steps required to process the 25 percent fund payments expeditiously and anticipate making those payments by the middle of February,\" she said. \n \nThe National Association of Counties is trying to drum up support for reauthorizing the program - and some Western lawmakers are listening. \n \nSen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., was a co-author of the 2000 bill and is working with Sen. Mike Crapo and Sen. James Risch, both Idaho Republicans, to craft a solution and called the money a \"lifeline for rural counties\" in a recent statement.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"US Federal Government news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Oregon faces 90 percent reduction in federal timber money","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Nez Perce","zipCode":"83501","state":"Idaho","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Lewiston","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Lewiston Tribune","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169718949","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"740"},"name":"Lewiston Tribune","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard","Local","Geographic"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.lmtribune.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204348692","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:28:34Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/lmtribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/7/7e/77e0cdff-0288-515d-80aa-b261fa875960/588d823973cac.image.jpg?resize=300%2C201"}],"video":[]}}

We plow and sand, but sometimes, even with studded tires, you need chains.\" \n \nThe conference for the Council of Osteopathic Student Government Presidents touched on a variety of topics, including mental health awareness, women in leadership, and political advocacy. \n \nThe service project is a requirement for a school to host the annual conference. \n \nDylan Rodgers, president of the COMP-Northwest Class of 2019, applied in September to have Western U act as COMP-Northwest host. \n \nThe Lebanon campus welcomed 72 student government presidents and vice presidents, as well as an additional 12 students who had previously served as student government leaders. \n \n\"I knew that the family-centered culture of the students, staff, and faculty of COMP-Northwest would provide for an awesome atmosphere for the COSGP to conduct their winter meeting,\" Rodgers said.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"ALEX PAUL Of The Albany Democrat-Herald"},"topics":[{"name":"Education news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Medical students tackle county park cleanup as part of annual conference","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Nez Perce","zipCode":"83501","state":"Idaho","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Lewiston","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Lewiston Tribune","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169718949","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"740"},"name":"Lewiston Tribune","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard","Local","Geographic"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.lmtribune.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204349053","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:28:35Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/lmtribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/e/a4/ea4195b1-d2bc-53fb-8bc5-11c6590a059b/588d8239d2eaa.image.jpg?resize=300%2C191"}],"video":[]}}

This winter, 37 of the birds were noted. \n \nAbout two-thirds of the birds disappeared around mid-December last year as well, so it's unknown if there are fewer only because of the unusual weather. Last February, some of the birds that left returned - then departed again in March. \n \nThere have been five days below zero in January, with the lowest recorded temperature at the Boise Airport dropping to minus 11. \n \nOne bird-watcher who lives in the Garden City area saw an Anna's hummingbird in his yard in December, when the thermometer at his house read minus 8. \n \n\"With any bird, the reason they leave for the winter is not usually dependent on what temperatures they can survive. It's all about food,\" Ware said. \"It's about the food being there.\" \n \nIn general, birds try to consume enough food during the day to have enough fat to shiver through the night, Ware said. Hummingbirds go into \"torpor,\" a state of hibernation that allows them to burn less energy than other birds that don't. \n \n\"There's a lot of evidence that other larger birds aren't doing so well either in this unusual weather,\" Ware said. \"We've seen a number of reports of freezing finches at feeders, barn owls struggling to survive cold temps, and very cold northern flickers and western screech owls roosting under eaves to seek warmth.\" \n \nThe birds were first documented in Southern California in the early 1900s. Their range expanded to northern California by the 1950s, and then as far as Oregon and Washington by the 1960s and 1970s. \n \nThe first Anna's sightings in Idaho were in the mid-1970s and researchers now band the hummingbirds in Idaho to study their breeding and migration patterns. \n \n\"They're adapting and getting whatever resources they can get,\" Ware said.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Birders in Idaho worry harsh winter may cut populations of Anna's hummingbirds","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Nez Perce","zipCode":"83501","state":"Idaho","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Lewiston","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Lewiston Tribune","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169718949","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"740"},"name":"Lewiston Tribune","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard","Local","Geographic"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.lmtribune.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204350801","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:28:34Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Mitchell, 44, is suspected of shooting his cousin, Kelly R. Baker, 43, behind the home where they lived, Coroner Clayton Nolting said Saturday. \n \nWithin minutes afterward, Mitchell likely went inside his home at 1518 Lafayette Ave. and shot himself with a .45-caliber handgun, which is now in the possession of the Columbus Police Department, Nolting said. \n \nPreliminary results of the autopsy for Mitchell, conducted Saturday at Columbus Regional Hospital, showed that he died of a penetrating gunshot wound to the left side of his chest, the coroner said. \n \nPreliminary autopsy results for Baker, conducted in Marion County, indicated she died of multiple gunshot wounds to the chest, Nolting said. \n \nHer death is being considered a homicide, he said. \n \nFinal autopsy and toxicology reports are expected in about two weeks, Nolting said. \n \nForensic evidence connected with the shooting deaths of the two people in the central part of Columbus is consistent with a murder-suicide, Nolting said. \n \nAlthough investigators said they believe Baker was killed and Mitchell took his own life, Columbus Police Department spokesman Lt. Matt Harris said detectives were not prepared to call the deaths a murder-suicide while the case remains under investigation. \n \nUpon their arrival at 1518 Lafayette Ave., officers discovered Baker \u2014 who had been shot several times \u2014 inside a vehicle parked behind the one-story, older model frame home, Harris said. \n \nInvestigators, who were initially summoned after neighbors reported hearing shots being fired two-and-a-half blocks south of Donner Park, talked with a witness who saw a male enter the house after the shots were fired, Harris said. \n \nBaker was first taken to Columbus Regional Hospital, then transported by LifeLine helicopter to Indiana University Health Methodist Hospital in Indianapolis, where was pronounced dead at 11:50 p.m. Thursday. \n \nColumbus police still had concerns that Mitchell might be alive, however, so they activated the department\u2019s SWAT team, Nolting said. \n \nAfter nearly five hours of unsuccessful efforts to make contact with the suspected shooter, police broke out windows of the home to propel canisters of tear gas inside, Harris said. \n \nHowever, the chemical irritant failed to prompt any response from inside the home, he said. \n \nShortly after 2 a.m. Friday, a surveillance robot placed inside the home provided images of Mitchell lying still in a bedroom, Harris said. \n \nWhen police finally went inside, they were able to confirm Mitchell was dead, Harris said. \n \nBaker\u2019s death was the first homicide in Columbus since September 2015, Harris said.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Coroner: Shooter died from single bullet wound","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Bartholomew","zipCode":"47201","state":"Indiana","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Columbus","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Columbus Republic","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657345","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"993"},"name":"Columbus Republic","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.therepublic.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204351435","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:28:35Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Judy Warnick, R-Moses Lake, amends parts of the state law at the heart of the ruling, known as the Hirst decision. County officials, builders, business and farm groups are among supporting the measure, while environmental groups and tribes oppose it. \n \nA competing bill sponsored by Sen. John McCoy, D-Tulalip, supports the court decision and sets up a program to help counties find ways to meet the requirements. \n \nIn October, the high court ruled that Whatcom County failed to protect water resources by allowing new wells to reduce flow in streams for fish and other uses. The court said counties must ensure, independently of the state, that water is physically and legally available before they issue building permits in certain areas. \n \nIn the wake of the ruling, some counties have temporarily halted certain rural development, while others changed criteria for obtaining a building permit. \n \nAt issue is a struggle to balance competing needs of people and wildlife for limited water, a challenge that has played out across the state for years. \n \n\"We face a situation where people in rural areas who don't have the luxury of hooking up to city water now have very few options,\" Warnick said in a statement, noting many people rely on wells that previously were not an issue. \n \nShe said her measure, Senate Bill 5239, supports development in rural areas. It would allow counties to rely on state water rules, as they did before the Hirst decision, and ensure that so-called permit-exempt wells can be used for development. \n \nWater is a \"finite resource, and therefore we all need to work together to protect that resource,\" McCoy said. \"I don't feel that anyone wants to injure anyone's water right or seniority in this process, but we need to get to common ground.\" \n \nHis proposal, Senate Bill 5024, allows counties to set up a program to offset water that otherwise would be withdrawn from a well. The county could, for example, create a \"water bank\" where people who need water obtain it from those who have water rights. \n \nThe bill would give counties five years to come up with alternative ways to get water; meanwhile, people in the program could get a certificate allowing them to build. \n \nCommissioners from Spokane, Mason and Thurston counties told lawmakers their counties have relied on the state Department of Ecology to make water decisions, and they don't have the resources to do the kinds of hydrological studies that would be required. \n \n\"We need a legislative fix, and 5239 is that fix,\" said Mason County Commissioner Terri Jeffreys. \n \nBruce Wishart with the Sierra Club said SB5024 would allow for development to move forward while making sure it is done in a way that protects water kept in rivers for fish as well as for neighboring wells. \n \nDave Christensen of the Ecology Department told lawmakers the agency supported some elements of both bills but couldn't support either as written. \n \nZach Nutting, a Whatcom County resident, begged lawmakers to fix the problem, saying he put thousands of dollars toward building a home on a 5-acre property but hasn't been able to get a building permit because \"the well they told me I could drill, I can no longer drill.\" \n \nTim Ballew, chairman of the Lummi Nation, acknowledged the ruling's impact on people wanting to build a home. But he said recent Supreme Court decisions \"have all protected senior water rights holders that have been based on state laws dating back to 1917.\" \n \n\"I urge legislators to take a deep breath before considering rewriting 100 years of water policy,\" Ballew said.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"PHUONG LE Of the"},"topics":[],"title":"Legislators see competing water bills","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Nez Perce","zipCode":"83501","state":"Idaho","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Lewiston","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Lewiston Tribune","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169718949","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"740"},"name":"Lewiston Tribune","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard","Local","Geographic"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.lmtribune.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204351633","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:28:35Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/lmtribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/45/9453de70-a6eb-5735-b099-051e9c9c32bc/588d82392fd96.image.jpg?resize=300%2C191"}],"video":[]}}

They climbed on the yellow bus that stops just outside their apartment on the Northside and rode out to Mount Jumbo School in East Missoula, the home of Lowell School this year. \n \nOn Jan. 11, Helen Reda, Adhanom's wife, started English classes at the Lifelong Learning Center. \n \nAnd on Jan. 12, Biniam took the written part of his driver's test at the Department of Motor Vehicles office. He passed with flying colors. \n \nUp next: the road test, a driver's license and a job - maybe not in that order. \n \n\"I'm ready,\" Adhanom said with a beaming smile. \"I cannot determine what, but I'm ready to work. And when I find myself working, I'm sure I will grow.\" \n \nAll this was happening with a backdrop of the strange stuff we call \"snow\" that keeps stacking up outside. There's no word for it in Tigrinya, the primary language of their native Eritrea. \n \n\"We are dressing like what the winter season demands,\" Adhanom said. \"We have been given full orientation, how we have to dress during the winter season, and we are up to that.\" \n \nOne of the first things Samrawit and Ermias learned at school, he said, was what \"snowball fight\" means. They're eager to try it out when the snow gets right. \n \nJan. 15 marked one month to the day since Biniam, Helen and the kids touched down in Missoula, refugees who spent the past eight years in Ethiopia, Eritrea's next-door enemy. \n \nThey were the last four of a dozen nationals from the obscure, oppressed country on the Horn of Africa to arrive under the auspices of the International Rescue Committee, the Missoulian reported. \n \nFew if any of the other 49 Congolese, Eritrean, Ethiopian, Iraqi and Syrian refugees who've landed in Missoula since August are better equipped for the new life than Adhanom. \n \nHe chatted affably in mostly understandable English, sitting on a couch in a sparse but comfortable living room. It was an early-out day from school for the kids. Helen, who understands English but isn't sure about speaking it yet, played with the children in a back room while her husband and IRC case worker Jen Barile visited with a reporter. \n \nPolite and what their father called \"very disciplined,\" Samrawit and Ermias showed off their recorder skills to their mother between frequent outbursts of giggles. \n \nThe 36-year-old Adhanom said his command of English is what he's most frequently asked about. \n \nThe explanation: He's earned degrees at two colleges: in education administration at the University of Asmara, in the capital of Eritrea; and in community development, with a minor in social work, at the Ethiopian Adventist College in Shashemene, 150 miles south of the capital of Addis Ababa. For the last 21/2 years he taught at the latter college. \n \nErmias was not yet born when the family fled Eritrea, where Adhanom said a dictatorial government mandates military service of an indeterminate length and personal freedom is a foreign concept. \n \n\"You cannot express your feelings. If you dissent, you'll be caught, you'll be jailed,\" he said. \"Life is so hard there. Lots of things that are very, very hard to explain. Everyone is coming into Ethiopia.\" \n \nA bloody border war broke out in 1998, matching two of the world's poorest nations. It remains unresolved today. \n \nSamrawit was 1 when her parents risked their lives and hers to flee the country on foot. They did it in daylight. \n \n\"Most of the time people do it in the night-time, but if you have kids, that's very dangerous,\" Adhanom said. \"You're coming through a forest at the border and you have hyenas, tigers, lions on the way. When the hyenas are barking, your kids may cry and you'll be caught because, you see, troops are all over.\" \n \nAl Jazeera English, the now-defunct news service, said last March that Ethiopia has the highest number of refugees in Africa - more than 700,000. At least 100,000 are from Eritrea. Most are confined to one of eight dry, barren camps where only the basics of food and water are available. \n \n\"It's out of a town, so you have no electricity,\" Adhanom said. \"Your house you build yourself with bricks.\" \n \nThe family spent a year in one such camp, but Adhanom was one of the few lucky ones. He was offered a college scholarship by the United Nations High Commissioner of Refugees. That paid for his four years in Shashemene. The family spent a year back in Addis Ababa, where Adhanom did volunteer work with orphans. \n \n\"If you work as a volunteer you can more easily get a job,\" he explained. \n \nAdhanom taught back at the college in Shashemene, where the scholarship provided them living accommodations in a house in town. They applied and qualified for admission into the U.N. refugee program, Destination America. \n \nThey were placed under the auspices of the International Rescue Committee, one of nine resettlement agencies contracted by the U.S. State Department and the one that opened an office in Missoula last summer. \n \nA video on a couple of Facebook pages and now on the Missoulian website shows the new Missoula families from Eritrea singing a Christmas song in their native language at the Annunciation Greek Orthodox Church. \n \nA State Department report in 2011 said Eritrea is almost evenly divided between Christians and Muslims. Most of those in the high plateau region, including the capital of Asmara, where Adhanom and Reda are from, are the former. \n \nAll those who've landed in Missoula so far practice the Orthodox Tewahedo faith. They've been welcomed here by the Annunciation church and have enjoyed two Christmases in the last few weeks - on Dec. 25 and on Jan. 7, their traditional celebration of the birth of Christ. \n \nThose events have allowed the four Eritrean families to come together and become friends, Adhanom said. \n \nThey gathered at the home of one of the other families on Missoula's southside, along with some of the mentor volunteers from Soft Landing Missoula they've come to know and rely upon. \n \n\"You have food, you have something to drink, you talk, you chat,\" Adhanom said. \"You feel like as if you are with your own family back there in your home country.\" \n \nAfter just three days of school, Samrawit and Ermias are excited. \n \n\"A lot of things they have seen are different,\" their dad said. \"They like that. Of course, they have a barrier with the language, but hopefully they will improve. Samrawit is now getting good. She's trying to speak it. She has a very, very kind and helping friend.\" \n \nThe winter weather has been \"frustrating,\" Adhanom said, but his family has lived in much worse conditions. Helen is anxious to learn to cook American-style, which features much more meat than the Eritrean culture is used to. \n \nFive years from now they'll be eligible to apply for U.S. citizenship, but before that comes one of Montana's best features: summer. \n \n\"I expect I will see myself in a different way that is better than this,\" Adhanom said. \"I see myself walking outside, getting money, becoming a little bit Missoula.\" \n \nAdhanom knows Missoula is not the most diverse town. He and his family have friends from Africa who in the last five years have settled in California, Texas and Las Vegas, where a dark face isn't so out of place. \n \nThe Orthodox church has been the main source of contact with the rest of Missoula for Biniam and Helen, and he said the people there have been \"very, very kind.\" \n \n\"We (hope) the whole community can be like this,\" Adhanom said. \"The community needs to know who we are.\" \n \nThe IRC stakes new refugees with expense money for the first 90 days. It seems inevitable that someday Adhanom will return to his chosen profession as a teacher. Until then, he's eager to get started in whatever job is out there.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"KIM BRIGGEMAN Of The Missoulian"},"topics":[{"name":"Ethiopia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Africa news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Eritrea news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Eritrean refugee family adjusts to winter in Montana","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Nez Perce","zipCode":"83501","state":"Idaho","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Lewiston","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Lewiston Tribune","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169718949","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"740"},"name":"Lewiston Tribune","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard","Local","Geographic"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.lmtribune.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204352996","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:28:36Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/lmtribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/96/1969b6af-801d-5cf7-8df1-973409c5d20a/588d8239a1a2f.image.jpg?resize=300%2C224"}],"video":[]}}

Dewey was welcomed into heaven after a courageous 1 1/2 year battle against liver cancer. He was born in Springville, Alabama on March 23, 1948 to Milton Aubrey Waddell and Mary Imogene Rowe Waddell. He moved with his family to Leesburg at 2 years old, graduated from Leesburg High School in 1967, and later received his associates degree from Lake-Sumter Community College. On May 22, 1968 Dewey married the love of his life, Laura Margaret Woodward. They eloped to Cairo Georgia after a short courtship and without the consent of their parents. Laura\u2019s father was concerned about how they would make a living being so young. Dewey assured him they would \u201clive on love\u201d! Well, that they did, and it didn\u2019t take long until Dewey had gained his in-laws approval, love and admiration. With the help of Laura\u2019s parents, Dewey and Laura founded M&C Pipe and Supply, Inc in 1973. Together, Dewey and Laura created a family and circle of friends that were blessed by their endless generosity, joy for life, and immense love. Dewey was an adoring father to his daughter and son-in-law Deann and Tim Coop of St. Petersburg and his son and business partner Dewey \u201cDal\u201d Waddell and his girlfriend Lisa Gasque Bell. He was affectionately known as \u201cBig Daddy\u201d to his six grandchildren: Brandon, Connor and Carson Coop; Trey and wife Kaitlyn, Tyler and Maggie Waddell; and his great granddaughter Allison Waddell. He was also known as \u201cUncle Big Dew\u201d to his nieces and nephews, with whom he had very special relationships: Steve Waddell and wife Kathy of Graceville, Chris Waddell of Graceville, Kim Waddell of Leesburg, Dena McKenna and husband Mike of St. Petersburg, Robyn Mitchell and husband Royce of Edgewater, Eric Lackey and wife Natasha of Tampa, Charles and wife Kristin Struth of Destin, and Jessica Struth of St. Petersburg. He is also survived by his sister-in-law and brother-in-law Charlotte and Mike Struth and his loving and faithful companion Barnelia Woodward. He is preceded in death by Laura, his loving wife of 42 years, his parents, and his brother Steven Lynn Waddell. Dewey loved being surrounded by nature. Two of his favorite places to soak it all in were deep in the woods of Steinhatchee at Po\u2019 Boys Hunt Camp and on the beaches of New Smyrna. He was a highly spiritual and peaceful man. People were drawn to his kind, gentle spirit and delighted in his lighthearted sense of humor. He dedicated his life to relationships. Dewey always saw the good in every human being he encountered. Whether it was an old schoolmate, a business acquaintance, or a stranger in a check-out line, he could make a connection. He had a collection of friends from every generation and walk of life and treasured each and every one. As one friend said, \u201cto know him was to love him\u201d. Memorial service will be held on Saturday February 4th at 2pm at St. James Episcopal Church, with a Reception immediately following at his son's home (Dal Waddell), 801 south 9th St., Leesburg. In lieu of flowers the family suggests contributions to the American Cancer Society (Americancancersociety.org/) or the American Diabetes Foundation (Donations Diabetes Org). Online condolences may be left at www.beyersfuneralhome.com.

The executive order signed by US President Donald Trump has barred citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries \u2013 Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen \u2013 from entering the US for 90 days. That includes legal US residents temporarily out of the country.\n\nThe order has also barred all refugees from entering the US for 120 days and Syrian refugees indefinitely.\n\nAdditionally, Australian citizens who have travelled to the seven countries since March 1, 2011 are no longer eligible to enter the US under the Visa Waiver Program, and are now required to apply for a US visa.\n\nAustralians who are dual citizens of the nominated countries, including government officials, and \"have previously been issued an [Electronic System for Travel Authorisation] are likely to have the ESTA revoked\", according to the Australian government.\n\nNo travellers from Australia are known to have been immediately affected by the ban.\n\n\"The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has not received any requests for consular assistance from Australians unable to board transport to the United States,\" a spokeswoman for Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop said.\n\n\"The Australian embassy in Washington is engaging with US officials on the potential implications of the suspension for Australian travellers, including dual nationals.\n\n\"Travellers are advised that visa and other entry and exit conditions can change at short notice.\"\n\nQantas is advising anyone who thinks they may be affected to contact the airline directly or speak to their travel agent, and said it will provide affected passengers with a number of options, including a refund or a change of destination.\n\n\"Qantas notes the advice from the US government regarding tighter entry conditions,\" a spokesman for the airline said.\n\n\"We will reflect this change in our processes and booking systems, however it is not likely to materially impact Qantas passengers.\"\n\nIt is estimated 100 to 200 people who had already begun their journey when Mr Trump signed the order yesterday have been detained at US airports, according to the American Civil Liberties Union.

For one, this place is a boomtown. Colorado was the second-fastest growing state between 2014 and 2015, meaning more kids, a bigger pool of athletes and thus more talent. The explosion of the private training business in the last five years hasn\u2019t hurt either, and plenty of athletes and their families are learning to leverage that training \u2014 and the college connections that come with it \u2014 to advance to the next level. \n \nAnd amid the conditions ripe for both economic and athletic development, Colorado has taken a stranglehold on a couple sports in particular. \n \nThe local girls soccer scene is loaded with top talent, with more than 150 Division I commits in the last three recruiting classes. Top clubs such as Real and Rush continually dominate on a national scale in the Elite Clubs National League, making championship game appearances the norm. That\u2019s not to mention that the future of the United States Women\u2019s National Team, 18-year-old phenom Mallory Pugh, became the youngest American soccer player to score in the Olympic Games last August, just a few months after graduating from Mountain Vista High School. \n Related Articles January 20, 2017   Ex-Ralston Valley hockey standout Tony Salazar battles back from heart attack suffered during first college game   January 15, 2017   D.S.S.T. Stapleton coach Wondame Davis cultivates a family of hoopsters    \nColorado is an epicenter for lacrosse too. It\u2019s partly why legendary college coach Bill Tierney \u2014 who won six titles at Princeton \u2014 decided to ditch the East Coast for the University of Denver, where he has used an influx of homegrown players to build the Pioneers into a national powerhouse. That success is mirrored at the high school level, as the 30-plus Division I commits in the Class of 2017 are defined by guys such as Mountain Vista senior attackman Colin Munro, who in addition to earning a scholarship to North Carolina already gained international recognition by leading the Coquitlam Junior Adanacs to the coveted Minto Cup last summer. \n \nAnd while the state\u2019s two most popular sports, football and boys basketball, are still a long, long way from matching the likes of Texas and California, serious strides have been made in the last decade. On the gridiron, though the majority of Division I talent has become more concentrated within a dozen or so 5A schools, the talent level is increasing nonetheless. The proliferation of the national schedule has helped with that, and Class of 2017 stars such as Valor Christian quarterback Dylan McCaffrey (University of Michigan) and Pomona lineman Jake Moretti (University of Colorado) give promise to more blue-chip recruits in the future. \n \nOn the basketball court, the same trend is becoming evident, with out-of-state tournaments, year-round club ball and names such as 2016 Overland graduate De\u2019Ron Davis (now playing at the University of Indiana) driving more local interest in the game and causing more recruiters to stop by The Centennial State. \n \nAnd as Colorado continues to grow into national prep relevancy \u2014 hockey, wrestling, baseball and softball are on the upswing too \u2014 all local fans who fill the stands can ask is that the athletes keep the hard work coming. If they do that, Colorado could be in the same recruiting realm as Texas and California before you know it.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Kyle Newman"},"topics":[{"name":"Finance latest","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Newman: As National Signing Day looms, Colorado\u2019s recruiting stock continues to rise","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Denver","zipCode":"80202","state":"Colorado","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Denver","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"Denver Post","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169661509","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"35315"},"name":"Denver Post","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.denverpost.com","publisher":"MediaNews Group"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204359262","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:27:15Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:28:38Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/012a0207-copy.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

File photo \n   \nEllison \n    Click here to purchase photos from this gallery  \n\u201cI look back and think about the people (in 1917) that didn\u2019t know what the hospital was about, what it was used for. \n \n\u201cI think it really punctuates how far we\u2019ve come over the years,\u201d Bickel said. \n \nA decision by the Bartholomew County Medical Society to pursue building a public hospital 100 years ago showed a great deal of foresight, Bickel said. \n \nWhen it opened, Bartholomew County Hospital had an average of 25 patients a month. Records show that 351 patients were treated in 1917. \n \nToday, the local hospital system serves about 250,000 patients each year. \n \nIn 2016, Columbus Regional Hospital debuted a new cancer treatment center, followed by the opening of a new emergency department, part of a $30 million investment in health care service upgrades. With state-of-the-art equipment upgrades made at the hospital, Bickel said patients from Indianapolis and Cincinnati are traveling to Columbus for treatment. \n \nBickel, who came to the hospital system about 25 years ago, said one of the things that attracted him to the organization was where leaders saw the hospital evolving. \n \n[embedded content] \n \nThat included moving from a predominately county-based facility to a regional one. \n \n\u201cThat really showed some vision,\u201d he said. \u201cThat whole transformation from county hospital to this regional referral center to me was a very profound milestone.\u201d \n \nA new century \n \nAs Columbus Regional Health enters its second century, the challenges are far different and more complex than when the county borrowed $100,000 to build its first hospital, one of the first county hospitals in Indiana. Even though it seems counter intuitive for a facility built to treat illness, Bickel said the ultimate purpose of Columbus Regional Health is to help people from all walks of life live healthier lives. In addition to providing hospital care, the healthcare system is focused on being a good community partner in all its programming and services, as a way to help people take accountability for their health. That means getting involved in socioeconomic issues that people face in the community which affect their health, Bickel said. \n \nOne example is introducing smoking-cessation classes to help people change habits that can lead to serious illnesses. \n \n\u201cHow do we play a role in helping to support those things that will drive the community to be as healthy as possible?\u201d he asked. \n \nAfter attending a Third House session about pre-kindergarten services Jan. 23, Bickel said he sees the challenges in the economic circumstances of the community\u2019s residents and their ability to stay healthy. \n \n\u201cHealth care and education are so intrinsically linked,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to play a role in that \u2026 We\u2019ve seen the share of health care expenditures increasingly go higher and higher as part of the gross national product and the like, almost to the point it seems insurmountable. We have to get to some of these other root causes that health care traditionally hasn\u2019t had a role in.\u201d \n \nTaking a pro-active stance, Bickel sees the hospital system\u2019s role as making it as easy as possible for people to live the healthiest life possible. \n \n\u201cIt\u201ds not to intervene or to tell people how to lead their lives,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know there are real barriers and challenges out there.\u201d \n \nHelping individuals overcome such obstacles reduces the burden of health care costs and is good for the community\u2019s health in general, he said. \n \nSeamless care \n \nThe hospital system has another goal for the future \u2014 creating a seamless, integrated health care structure within the region to improve care and keep costs down. That has resulted in Columbus Regional Health looking at primary care health providers not only as community partners, but as hospital acquisitions. \u201cWe know across the country there is a shortage of primary care physicians, so we are making deliberate investments in primary care for Columbus Regional Health. Our physician practice \u2014 our medical group \u2014 continues to grow. We\u2019re over 100 providers that are now employed by the health system and we\u2019re seeing that trend continuing, not only here in Indiana but across the country.\u201d \n \nAcquiring the practices and doctor\u2019s services provides a much stronger tie to the health system, Bickel said, describing that trend as a monumental shift from 30 to 40 years ago when independent physicians were the primary healthcare business model. \n \nThat trend continues to develop because of the growing burden on independent physicians to keep up with new technology, such as electronic medical records and infrastructure investments. \n \n\u201cWe want the physicians that are primary care and their office practices part of the system communicating with us in an effort to reduce the fragmentation that\u2019s out there,\u201d Bickel said. \n \nWhat happens in those physician offices and clinics needs to be shared with the hospital system so the patient has a seamless transition from doctor\u2019s office, to hospital to discharge home, he said. \n \nTechnological challenges are looming for the hospital system as well, as even Bartholomew County government is considering adding telemedicine to its insurance plan \u2014 which allows patients to communicate with doctors over the internet rather than in person. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s on our radar to look at,\u201d Bickel said of telemedicine. \n \nWhile patient convenience is important, Columbus Regional Health will want to make sure telemedicine is being used in the most appropriate clinically effective way, he said. \n \n\u201cPhysicians will say it probably has its place,\u201d Bickel said, while recognizing that telemedicine is not appropriate for all medical consultations. \n \n\u201cThose are things we have to work together as a system to figure out,\u201d he said. \n \nAttractive system \n \nMany of the physicians who practice in Bartholomew County and refer patients to Columbus Regional Hospital were first attracted to Columbus initially, said Dr. Thomas Sonderman, the system\u2019s vice president and chief medical officer. After learning about the city\u2019s architectural heritage and experiencing its beauty and the inviting community, Sonderman said many physicians like what they see. Another factor, too, is an evaluation of how the physician\u2019s practice fits into to the health care landscape, Sonderman said. \n \nAre all the needed specialties present? Is there coordination of care? Those are questions that physicians considering Columbus will have, he said. \n \nWhen speaking to medical recruits, Sonderman said the hospital\u2019s independence from the state\u2019s major medical franchises is appealing. \n \nKnowing that Columbus Regional Health is run independently gives physicians a confidence level that decisions are being made locally, and they can have some influence in those decisions, he said. \n \n\u201cMedical care is a team sport,\u201d Sonderman said. \n \nThe recent addition of the new Cancer Care Center and new Emergency Department are also signs to physicians that the hospital wants to be in the forefront when considering capital improvements and technology. \n \nThe latest upgrades show concrete signs that Columbus Regional Hospital is investing in its future, something physicians also consider when choosing where they want to practice, he said. \n \nFull coverage \n \nWhen Bickel arrived in Columbus in 1991, the cancer care initiative was well underway. Looking back, he said that commitment was putting a \u201cstake in the ground\u201d for cancer services locally. As for the emergency department, expansion was mandated by a patient load that was exploding beyond the former facility\u2019s capabilities. \n \nThe former emergency department was sized to handle 20,000 to 25,000 patients a year, but was trying to handle nearly double that capacity when the system created a state-of-the-art facility on the hospital\u2019s east side. \n \nBickel said the emergency department\u2019s usage rate was in part due to a change in patient habits and mindsets. \n \nEmergency rooms, as they were called, were once just used for acute emergency care. But today\u2019s patients are now utilizing hospital emergency departments for routine health procedures and health care \u2014 for matters that could be handled in an urgent care center or primary care physician\u2019s office, Bickel said. \n \nThe patients recognize the convenience of emergency departments being open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, he said. \n \n\u201cThat\u2019s not the most cost-effective side of care. We know that,\u201d Bickel said. \n \nNow the hospital must work upstream so over-utilization of emergency departments can decrease, he said. \n \n\u201cBut for right now, the volume (in the emergency department) has been on a continual upward trajectory,\u201d Bickel said. \n \nColumbus Regional Hospital\u2019s new emergency department was built so that some of its space could be repurposed if eventually it isn\u2019t needed for emergency care, he said. \n \n\u201cI don\u2019t know that we will ever see that. But it\u2019s one of the things we are thinking about.\u201d \n \nBickel pointed to the entire spectrum of Columbus Regional Health services \u2014 oncology, cardiovascular, surgical \u2014 and how they work together to help patients receive care close to home. \n \nIn the early 2000s, the hospital system launched into providing open-heart and bypass surgeries after bringing a cardiac program to the region. \n \nColumbus Regional Hospital has a catheterization lab, with not just diagnostic, but interventional capabilities. \n \n\u201cYou have a blockage in your artery, we go into the cath lab, open that up, put in a stent,\u201d Bickel said. \u201cThat service is important in this region because we\u2019re the only interventional cath lab outside of the major metropolitan areas \u2026 the speed in which you get into the cath lab and get that vessel opened up, the better the outcome for the patient.\u201d \n \nColumbus Regional Health has partnered with IU Health to provide cardiac surgery services at the hospital, tapping into that health system\u2019s bench depth and clinical expertise \u2014 without patients having to travel to a metropolitan area, Bickel said. \n \nFuture plans \n \nZack Ellison, who leads the Columbus Regional Health board of trustees, said the county continues to focus on investing in the latest technology and capital improvements for the hospital. Describing Columbus Regional as the crown jewel for the county and Columbus, Ellison said the nonprofit hospital has continued to be economically healthy enough to provide money that can be re-invested in the hospital itself and its technology. He credited management of the hospital over the years with its continued success, along with the county\u2019s commitment to keep it locally operated. \n \n\u201cLook around to the counties around us, and you will see county hospitals being sold,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m proud of the community for keeping our hospital a county-owned hospital,\u201d Ellison said. \n \nWhen speaking to new employees in a group, Bickel said he always makes sure to talk about the hospital system\u2019s values and how they are demonstrated in the community. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s what makes Columbus, Columbus \u2014 everybody pitching in.

From Somalia, to her last home in India, and now Texas, the state that abuts another Trump target: Mexico.\n\nMr Haraco, secretary of the Somali Australian Council of Victoria, doesn't know if he should book tickets or wait to see what unfolds when the 90-day period ends.\n\nWill the ban continue? When will he see his elderly mother-in-law again? She is over 70 now; he doesn't want to leave it too long.\n\nConfusion and concern among immigrants and refugee advocates has been widespread, with travellers detained or sent home from US airports.\n\nThere is confusion, too, among the young men that Mr Haraco has brought down to the ocean to mull over the qualities of a leader.\n\nSome have talked about finding it difficult to get a job in Melbourne because of the colour of their skin, or their religion.\n\nThe group also discussed gangs, and young people they know who are dropping out of school, drawn to these groups.\n\nBut the bigger purpose was to inspire them, says council member Abdi Aziz, and he remains convinced that Trump's ruling won't quash their enthusiasm for multiculturalism.\n\n\"Diversity is mainstream in Australia \u2026 but the risk is there.

He had to be restrained by teammates and then received a third technical foul that was subsequently issued to the New Zealand bench. \n   \nThe Kings held an unassailable 32-point lead at three-quarter time, allowing coach Andrew Gaze to empty his bench and rest some of his stars. \n   \nSydney's next game is at home on Saturday against Melbourne United, while the Breakers are away on the same day to the Adelaide 36ers. \n   \nSydney coach Andrew Gaze said this weekend was do or die. \n   \n\"The guys knew the urgency of the situation and they stepped up.

It has nothing to do with the election, the president, the Congress or the White House.\n\nNow that you're breathing a collective sigh or relief, do read on.\n\nMy first born, Samantha, who is 18, really has a pretty clear idea of what she wants out of life.\n\nShe sure didn't get that from me. I still don't know!\n\nShe got her acceptance letter from Fairleigh Dickinson this past week. She wants to study engineering, in keeping with her tradition of being on the award-winning Mount Olive High School robotics team for the past four years. She knows what she wants to study, and even knows that she wants to come back to the high school as a mentor, to work with the up and coming robotics team kids.\n\nShe's busy looking for women in engineering scholarships, with an impressive \"resume\" of having been key to the robotics team at the high school for four years.\n\nShe's got it all kind of figured out.

I was terrible at science.\n\nBut I guess I could write pretty well, even back then. Still, where to go with that? I just had no clue. No ideas at all.\n\nIn high school, I wrote absolutely nothing for the Lenape Valley newspaper. Nothing. It never even would have dawned on me. I remember one time being asked what my favorite junk food was. And my name made it into the school newspaper. I thought that was a pretty big thrill. But other than that, my only writing experience was in creative writing. I remember once writing a kind of gruesome horror short story.\n\nThe result of that was a trip to the school psychologist, just to make sure I was operating on all thrusters.\n\nWhen it came time for college, I knew I had to do it, or should do it, but I wasn't enthused. I wasn't looking forward to much of anything, except when the next Star Trek movie was coming out. (Come to think of it, I'm still often in that mindset!) I was just kind of going through the motions, not really knowing what I wanted to do. I never dreamed back then that this keyboard I'm sitting at now and composing this literary masterpiece would ever play such a big role in my life.\n\nMy mom had to beg me to take a typing class. And yes, those were the days when it was still a \"typing\" class. I was hesitant. \"What will I ever need that for?\" I recall asking.\n\nOut of high school, I quickly liked the notion of attending County College of Morris. Not only was it a highly rated school, but they had a good journalism program. Kind of by default, I chose my major.\n\nWhat would I later do it it I had no idea. But, CCM was close enough to Byram, and would still leave me lots of time to pursue other interests? Like what? Good question! Well, attending Star Trek conventions. Going to movies. Visiting Circle Lanes in Ledgewood You know, that really important kind of stuff.\n\nThe point was, I just didn't that much care. And I certainly wasn't excited about school. I didn't totally hate it. I just wasn't excited. It was kind of just there. I have always been afraid of change, so it took some getting used to.\n\nBut, I fell in kind of comfortably at CCM. Part of the requirement of the journalism curriculum was to choose a \"beat\", about which I would be required to regularly submit an article. And it wasn't easy! I wound up with the social sciences department! Talk about boring. I can remember pestering Jackie Crimmel, the department secretary, for a story idea every week. Years later, I'd be after her for quotes and comments again, when I got this job and found out she was on the Roxbury school board. We always joked about the days I'd visit her office and ask \"what's going on\" in the exciting field of the social sciences department.\n\nTypically, my story would be something like \"Teacher to revise sociology text book\" or some other equally exciting subject.\n\nIt wasn't until I wrote my first-person account of meeting President Richard Nixon outside his home in Saddle River that things started to get exciting. I can remember that week's paper, and all the teachers talking about it, and kids asking me was I the one who made that trip. It was fun. I started to like having my stuff read.\n\nLater, commuting to William Paterson, I again didn't write much for the student newspaper, but I began freelancing for a now defunct newspaper covering meetings in Byram, Stanhope and Netcong, mostly.\n\nUnlike the other kids in class, I was actually out there doing it. While the professors were talking about the life of a journalist, I was experiencing it. That was kind of neat. I remember one professor critiquing one of my masterpieces in front of the class. That didn't go too well. I like to think I've gotten better.\n\nAnd then, out of school, I found Roxbury. And Roxbury found me. It has been a pretty happy union for the past two decades.\n\nAnd now, I count Harding, and all of the towns The Citizen covers as \"my towns.\" And I have to admit, it has been pretty enjoyable.\n\nJust don't ask me what I want to do next.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"MIKE CONDONEditor"},"topics":[],"title":"AS I SEE IT: A clear path ahead, and a total lack of one","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Rock Island","zipCode":"61265","state":"Illinois","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Moline","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"The Progress","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169670235","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"The Progress","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://newjerseyhills.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204363246","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:28:40Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/newjerseyhills.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/e9/6e908f08-f907-5c7a-b128-a8e36b98cff6/5874fd8456630.image.jpg?resize=200%2C297"}],"video":[]}}

The weeks-long conflict had become one of the biggest internal challenges yet to Francis' efforts to modernize the 1.2 billion member Roman Catholic Church.\n\nAt issue was the Order's reaction to the discovery that condoms had been distributed by one of its aid projects in Myanmar. The Order had fired its Grand Chancellor, Albrecht Freiherr von Boeselager, whom it held responsible for the condom distribution. Von Boeselager declined to comment for this article.\n\nThough condom use goes against Catholic teaching, the Vatican had ordered an investigation into the firing of von Boeselager. It subsequently publicly castigated Festing, who had refused to cooperate with the investigation.\n\nBacking down, Festing, a former Sotheby's art auctioneer, gave a hand-written resignation letter to Francis in the pope's private residence, according to a senior Vatican source. Festing, who has the title of prince, declined an interview request.\n\nInstead of quelling the conflict, however, Festing's resignation was followed by yet another challenge to Francis' authority -- led by vocal pope critic American Cardinal Raymond Leo Burke, according to Vatican and Knights sources.\n\nIn particular: Burke tried to convince Festing to withdraw his resignation and keep fighting the pope, these sources say. On Saturday, the Knight's Sovereign Council accepted Festing's resignation and re-instated von Boselager, a clear defeat for Burke.\n\nBurke declined to comment for this article.\n\nThe tussle suggested Francis is still battling to consolidate his power over the Church almost four years into his tenure, Vatican insiders say.\n\nBeyond a fight over condoms, the clash pointed to lingering divisions between the Church's conservatives and more progressive factions who support the pope's reformist agenda, they add.\n\nFrancis is trying to make the Church less dogmatic and more welcoming to whose who have felt excluded, such as homosexuals and the divorced.\n\n\"While this whole saga was an internal matter that probably should have stayed that way, it metamorphosed into a clash that showed the divide between conservatives and progressives,\" said Andrea Tornielli, author of several books on Pope Francis.\n\nThe Vatican declined to comment on the clash and on Pope Francis' efforts to consolidate his power.\n\nIt directed Reuters to two public statements. One, on Dec. 22, relates to the Vatican order to investigate the firing of von Boeselager. The second, on Jan. 17, followed a pledge by Festing on the Knights' web page not to cooperate with the Vatican. It decried his resistance and ordered members of the order to cooperate.\n\nGERMAN ARISTOCRAT\n\nThe all-male top leaders of the Knights of Malta are not clerics, but they take vows of poverty, chastity and obedience to the pope.\n\nA German aristocrat whose father participated in a failed plot to kill Hitler in World War Two, von Boeselager was fired by Festing in December, and accused of having allowed the use of condoms while he was head of the Knights' global humanitarian projects.\n\nFesting fired him in Burke's presence, arguing that the German had hidden the condom use from the order's leaders when he was named Grand Chancellor, according to Knights and Vatican sources.\n\nImmediately, the firing set off the conflict between the Knights' hierarchy and the Vatican.\n\nVon Boeselager , a devout Catholic, said in a statement on Dec. 23 that he was fully behind Church teachings. He closed two projects in the developing world when he discovered condoms were being distributed but kept a third running in Myanmar for a while because closing it would have abruptly ended all basic medical services to poor people.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Italy news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Malta news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Religion news","group":"Society"}],"title":"The Knights of Malta-Vatican feud - a tale of chivalry and sovereignty","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Yahoo!

It has been warm and wet start to 2017. According to the National Weather Service records for Toledo, we broke the record for the most consecutive days above freezing for the month of January, beating the previous record of eight days set back in 1998. \n \nHere\u2019s a bit of my favorite meteorology geek data: The last time we felt the temperature drop below freezing was Jan. 16, where we were at 20 degrees for the daytime high. Also, according to the National Weather Service, January made the top 10 of the wettest months on record for Toledo with 4.4 inches of rain. \n  \nEnlarge \n  \nThat\u2019s because the warmer temperatures have caused the frozen soil to thaw. According to Michigan State University, soil temperatures in southeast Michigan near the state line have been hanging just above the freezing mark all month. At a 4-inch depth, they have been fluctuating from 38.7 degrees to 32.5 degrees. \n \nSpring-like weather has been easy on the pocketbook but has taken some of our plants out of their winter slumber. If you had a chance to take a look at some of the plants around your yard, you might see some of the early bloomers like forsythia and lilac already pushing their buds out on each branch. Some of the early blooming bulbs may also have some of their foliage peeking above the soil line. \n \nBut now it is back to average temperatures around the freezing mark for the daytime high and overnight lows in the teens, with a bit of white stuff flying in the air. It may take a few weeks below zero to get the ground frozen solid again. So what will this warm January weather do to your plants? \n \nAmy Stone, Ohio State University Extension Agent for Lucas County, said, \u201cAt this point there isn't a lot gardeners can do but wait and watch.\u201d She said many plants could see a bit of tip damage when the temps go back to average and the ground freezes again, but they will be able to survive the warm-up. \n \nHobbyists and professionals who hunt for sugar maple trees and live near a sugar bush were watching the weather closely. Maple trees will start their sap flow when we get bright sun during the day with warmer temperatures and crisp nights. We didn\u2019t have exactly those conditions, but the warmer temperatures were tempting the trees to come out of dormancy. \n \nStone said, \u201cThose that tap for maple syrup are very anxious, but at this point it is a wait-and-see. It might be a rough year for those with sugar bush.\u201d \n \nStone continued: \u201cIf gardeners have planted perennials, shrubs, and even trees last fall, keep your eyes open as temperatures fall and the ground freezes that there isn\u2019t any heaving of the root ball. The act of heaving can push root balls up and expose roots, and when temperatures drop \u2014 and they will \u2014 they could be exposed and there could be some winter injury.\u201d \n \nThe warm-up isn\u2019t all bad. \n \n\u201cOn the positive side, if silver maples bloom during a warm-up, the temperatures are sure to go down and will hopefully kill the flowers and therefore we won't have the fruit or samaras,\u201d said Stone. \n \nSpring isn\u2019t far off. Spring equinox is March 20, but hey, who\u2019s counting? \n \nContact Kelly Heidbreder at: getgrowing@gmail.com","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"What does a warmer winter mean for plants?","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Lucas","zipCode":"43660","state":"Ohio","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Toledo","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Toledoblade.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169665113","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3374"},"name":"Toledoblade.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Lifestyle","Home"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.toledoblade.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204371972","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:28:48Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

We've experienced the excitement of falling hard for each other, we've challenged our resilience with a move across the country with each other (and a very grumpy cat), and we've started over in a new city with no money and few friends. We've celebrated births of family members together and mourned the loss of them, too. We've experienced the novelty of the honeymoon phase wearing off and a deeper, more peaceful kind of love settling in. Falling in love is easy; staying in love is something you have to work at daily. Over the years I've seen little signs (often at the time not realizing what they were) that helped me decipher what true love really is and what that means. Here's what I've learned. Love is seeing a person every day and still missing them when you're apart.  Love is listening.  Love is using the bathroom with the door open because they were in the middle of the story and you really had to go.  Love is smiling at them while they're sleeping.  Love is picking up their favorite treat on the way home so they will be surprised when they get there.  Love is respect, but not submission.  Love is challenging each other to be the best people you both can be.  Love is asking for forgiveness.  Love is forgiving.  Love is letting them be their own person and always being your true self with them, too.  Love is committing to them and meaning it.  Love is addressing problems and challenges, not avoiding them.  Love is holding their hand when they are sad or scared - or just because.  Love is the absence of judgments.  Love is compromise.  Love is cleaning up the cat, dog, or baby poop, even if it's not your turn to.  Love is arguing, but not attacking.  Love is honest, even when it hurts.  Love is letting them know you'll always be there for them.  Love is finding a balance.  Love is recognizing the value of the other person and telling them.  Love is selfless.  Love is saying \"I love you\" any chance you get.  Love is support and encouragement.  Love is patience when things don't go as planned.  Love is eating at your favorite restaurant and talking about your days.  Love is laughing at inside jokes no one else will ever understand.  Love is something that makes you both happy.  Love is losing sleep because they haven't come home yet.  Love is sometimes admitting you're wrong.  Love is supporting their passion, even if you don't share that passion.  Love is never, ever watching a new episode of your favorite show without them.  Love is corny as hell.  Love is chemistry.  Love is loving their friends and family (or at least trying to).  Love is letting them pick the next trip you take.  Love is being partners.  Love is sharing the covers.  Love is imperfect.  Love is letting the small things go.  Love is skipping the party and going to bed together early.  Love is a kiss on the forehead.  Love is laughing at stupid things together.  Love is not just talk, but action.  Love is boring.  Love is exciting.

I'm not going to stir the hornet's nest, but a number of other teams have had the opportunity to control where they've played this year.\"\n\nAnother sticking point is training.\n\nUnited can train throughout the week at McKellar for minimal cost, but would get limited access to Canberra Stadium.\n\nLast time the Mariners were in town, Canberra played its season opener against Melbourne City as part of a Canberra Stadium double-header, losing that game 2-1.\n\nThey were unable to train on the ground in the lead-up to that match.\n\nUnited co-captain Ellie Brush reiterated Dower's preference, but added they'd be ready regardless of where the game was.\n\n\"This is our favoured home, but ... we don't really mind where we suit up, we know the crowd will get out and support us. Just two more [wins] to go,\" she said.\n\nDower said Brush's fellow co-captain Michelle Heyman was unlikely to be ready for the semi, although she had returned to training with the main group as she continued her comeback from toe and ankle injuries.\n\nThe Matildas striker has been out since she rolled her ankle against the Melbourne Victory at the end of December.\n\n\"She was back training [Friday], which was a great sight to see her out here at McKellar juggling, jogging laps, kicking the ball around,\" Dower said.\n\n\"It was really great. Next week might be asking too much, but at least she's back in the frame now and she's running herself around.\"\n\nW-LEAGUE SEMI-FINAL\n\nCanberra United v Melbourne City\n\nA-LEAGUE ROUND 18\n\nSunday: Central Coast Mariners v Adelaide United at Canberra Stadium, 5pm.

Photo: Bureau of Meteorology If this January has seemed hotter and drier than usual, that's because it has been - especially at night.\n\nMaximum daytime temperatures in Sydney last January averaged 27.4 degrees. This January has so far averaged 29.1 degrees, which should rise with two more hot days to end the month.\n\nMeanwhile, Sydney has smashed the previous record for hot nights in January, with four nights (so far) staying above 24 degrees. The previous record was two.\n\nSydney is on track to break the record for the number of summer days above 35 degrees, with just two more needed to break the all-time record\n\nMr Taggart said this January has been \"almost certainly one of the hottest on record\".\n\nAnd the heat won't end this week. Next weekend is forecast to again hit 40 degrees, Mr Taggart said, as the Bureau forecasts a \"hotter than average\" February with hot conditions pushing into March.\n\nJanuary is also likely to end with less than half the month's average rainfall. So far the city has had 48.8mm, much lower than the average of 102.5mm.\n\nIt's also significantly less than last year when Sydney received 249.8mm during January.\n\nElsewhere in the state, Moree is in the middle of a remarkable hot streak, with the town sweltering through 34 consecutive days above 35 degrees. Mr Taggart expects that to stretch to 41 days based on current forecasts, close to the state record.\n\n\"The forecast for the next seven days is pretty horrific,\" Mr Taggart said. \"That heat is completely unrelenting.\"\n\n\"The forecast seems bad for Richmond and Sydney, but it's nothing compared to Moree.\" The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Josh Dye"},"topics":[{"name":"Weather news","group":"Science"},{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Education news","group":"Society"}],"title":"NSW weather: Heatwave, severe fire danger as students return to school","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"5253","state":"South Australia","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Murray Bridge","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Murray Valley Standard","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169916815","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2"},"name":"Murray Valley Standard","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.murrayvalleystandard.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204378296","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:05:24Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:28:54Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/b1388d02-e7af-480c-8629-bb881cc357f5.jpg/r1_0_727_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Consulting an astrologer will definitely help because some movements in the ether, which you are unaware of plays a very vital role in your life. \n \nThe birth chart is an astrological chart or map which shows the position of the planets and the astrological houses at the exact time of a person's birth. It can define personal traits and these celestial bodies\u2019 light years away, can change your destiny as they move along their defined path.  \n \nOur ancestors have observed these planets and their impact on our lives for thousands of years, whence is the base of astrology. Pioneers in the domain kept enhancing the knowledge base and finally in the course of time astrology has advanced a lot to empower us with information about our future. Astroyogi experts consider three main components in a birth chart, the signs, planets, and the houses. Twelve birth signs refer to different constellations and the area corresponding to them, through which the planets, the sun, and moon moves. \n \nAt the time of birth, the birth chart maps the position of each planet, sun, and moon with respect to these signs. For instance, mercury in Aries would mean that at the time of a person's birth mercury was in the space corresponding to Aries constellation. Each planet, the sun, and the moon represent various aspects of a person's personality and houses refers to through the planetary positions against the zodiacs. It shows where an energy is received in the form of human experience. \n  © astroYogi.com According to astroyogi experts, there are a few key planets and houses which would be analyzed thoroughly to predict one's fame and success. The second house relates to wealth, when the 10th, 11th, and 12th relate to a person's career choices, social life and limitations, these houses are crucial to one's success and fame. When it comes to planets sun, the moon, mercury, and mars plays a major part in determining how successful and famous an individual would be. Having said that our astrologers also reminds that astrology is a complex science to interpret, in order to make a prediction an astrologer needs to synthesize the whole chart and draw a holistic picture. Often predictions made out of particular aspect in the birth chart, like a planet or house without considering other\u2019s positions, impact and implications would result in wrong predictions.  \n \nThis needs expertise and knowledge which only an experienced astrologer would possess. \n \nWhile there is a plethora of automated astrology applications available online, astrological predictions could never be the output of a computer programs. It requires human perspective and experience to be accurate. If you feel like there is something special about you which can help you excel in life consult an astrologer to discover your destiny. \n \nYou may also like: \n \nThe best careers for your zodiac sign \n \n The Best Careers for Your Zodiac Sign","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Can astrology help you find fame and success?","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"MSN News US","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"530694805","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"MSN News US","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Lifestyle","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.news.msn.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.astroyogi.com/talk-to-astrologers/"],"sequenceId":"695204380652","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:28:54Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

In this moment we feel really bad.\" \n \nLiverpool, fourth in the Premier League, have won only one game out of eight in January and their chances of lifting a trophy this season look bleak. \n \n\"It is a perfect moment to turn because it is not possible to go lower,\" Klopp said. \n \nWycombe were on course to trump Wolves, with a genuine giant-killing away to Premier League title hopefuls Tottenham Hotspur as two goals by Paul Hayes gave them a 2-0 halftime lead at White Hart Lane. \n \nGarry Thompson then restored their lead seven minutes from time after Tottenham had battled back but Dele Alli equalised and an own goal salvaged a 4-3 victory for Tottenham. \n \nLincoln did hold on for an upset though. They went doen 1-o to brighton before coming back to take a 3-1 victory. \n \nBrighton weren't the only Championship high-flyer brought undone with Newcastle United succumbing to a humbling 3-0 defeat at League One's Oxford United. \n \nWhile those two slipped, Aaron Mooy came off the bench for Huddersfield Town to give a late assist as they ran out 4-0 winners over lowly Rochdale. \n \nThere was precious little drama at Stamford Bridge though as Premier League leaders Chelsea beat second tier Brentford 4-0, or at Selhurst Park where Manchester City outclassed Crystal Palace 3-0 in an all Premier League clash. \n \nTwo other Premier League sides made progress with Middlesbrough beating Accrington Stanley 1-0 and Burnley seeing off Bristol City 2-0. \n \nBlackburn Rovers won a north west derby 2-0 against Blackpool in a game memorable for protests against their clubs' respective owners by both sets of fans. \n \nNZN","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: EPL - Liverpool news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: soccer news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: Premier League news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Woeful Liverpool lose on day of upsets","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"NZ","country":"New Zealand"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Newshub","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"602226314","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"36"},"name":"Newshub","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://feeds.feedburner.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204385255","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:28:51Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

She heard about it on Twitter and thinks most people did the same. \n \nIn New York City, a large crowd massed at John F. Kennedy International Airport to protest the detention of two Iraqis who were later released. \n \n\u201cMr. President, look at us,\u201d said US Rep. Nydia Velazquez, a New York Democrat. \u201cThis is America. What you have done is shameful. It\u2019s un-American.\u201d \n \nThe protesters gathered in Terminal 4 at JFK and carried signs reading, \u201cWe are all immigrants!\u201d and \u201cNo ban! No wall!\u201d \n \nSeveral New York officials showed support for the protests. \n \nGov. Andrew Cuomo ordered the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to reverse an earlier decision to restrict passage aboard the JFK Airport AirTrain to ticketed passengers and airport employees only. \n \nHe also instructed state police and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to assist with security and transportation for protesters. \n \n\u201cThe people of New York will have their voices heard,\u201d Cuomo said. \n \nNew York Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted: \u201cWhat\u2019s happening at JFK is shameful. @NYCImmigrants Affairs Commissioner Nisha Agarwal is on the ground now working to help.\u201d \n \nOne of the detained Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh, was released early Saturday afternoon. He worked with the US government for 10 years after the United States invaded Iraq. \n \nThe other detained Iraqi, Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been granted a visa to join his wife, who worked for a US contractor in Iraq, and son, both of whom already live in the United States as refugees. Alshawi was released later Saturday. \n \nThe American Civil Liberties Union argued Saturday evening in a federal court in New York for a nationwide stay that would block the deportation of all people stranded in US airports under what the group called \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s new Muslim ban.\u201d \n \nA federal judge in New York granted an emergency stay Saturday night for citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries who have already arrived in the US and those who are in transit, and who hold valid visas, ruling they cannot be removed from the US. \n \nThat move limited part of President Trump\u2019s executive order barring citizens from those countries from entering the US for the next 90 days. \n \nRep.

The American Administration has come to conclusion that Sudan has a pivotal political and economic status in the region and in the international arena so the move is indispensable amid the changing world. \n\nSudan has made no compromise for the lift of sanctions. Sudan has managed to overstep the impacts of the unfair economic sanctions unilaterally imposed by US. \nPresident Al Bashir has initiated national dialogue to resolve national issues peacefully by engagement of both political and armed groups. The move was appreciated and recognized by international community. \n\nMoreover, Sudan has cooperated with international community in the fight against terrorism and illegal migration. The move was appreciated by United States which has mistakenly blacklisted Sudan. \n\nSince the stability of Sudan is the stability of the whole region, the Sudanese army was strong enough to crush the rebel groups in all fronts and restore peace in any troubled area without foreign help. \n\nRegarding ICC's claims, the Sudanese government has exposed the real intention of the ICC known of its hunt of only African leaders leaving the true predators free. Sudan has unified the African leaders against the Court. This has resulted in unanimous African decision to walk out of the body. \n\nThe African decision is a real blow to the court's credibility and fairness.

It's un-American' \n\nUpdated: Jan 29, 2017 12:24 AM PST \n\nG. Morty Ortega/ \n\nRelated content \n\n(CNN) - More protests against President Donald Trump's immigration policies are set for Sunday across the country after hundreds of demonstrators converged on airports the day before. \n\nProtests are scheduled Sunday in Washington, Orlando, Boston, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Seattle, and Chicago, mostly at airports. \n\nThis is the second weekend of demonstrations, with more than 1 million people coming out last weekend for the Women's March. \n\nOlivia Katbi Smith told CNN affiliate KATU she showed up Saturday at Portland International Airport because she believes Trump's immigration policies are cruel. \n\n\"I think it's horrific and terrible and we are basically condemning people to death by not allowing them to come here,\" she said. \n\nShe said the event appeared to be impromptu. She heard about it on Twitter and thinks most people did the same. \n\nIn New York City, a large crowd massed at John F. Kennedy International Airport to protest the detention of two Iraqis who were later released. \n\n\"Mr. President, look at us,\" said US Rep. Nydia Velazquez, a New York Democrat. \"This is America. What you have done is shameful. It's un-American.\" \n\nThe protesters gathered in Terminal 4 at JFK and carried signs reading, \"We are all immigrants!\" and \"No ban! No wall!\" \n\nSeveral New York officials showed support for the protests. \n\nGov. Andrew Cuomo ordered the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to reverse an earlier decision to restrict passage aboard the JFK Airport AirTrain to ticketed passengers and airport employees only. \n\nHe also instructed state police and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to assist with security and transportation for protesters. \n\n\"The people of New York will have their voices heard,\" Cuomo said. \n\nNew York Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted: \"What's happening at JFK is shameful. @NYCImmigrants Affairs Commissioner Nisha Agarwal is on the ground now working to help.\" \n\nAirport arrests \n\nOne of the detained Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh, was released early Saturday afternoon. He worked with the US government for 10 years after the United States invaded Iraq. \n\nThe other detained Iraqi, Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been granted a visa to join his wife, who worked for a US contractor in Iraq, and son, both of whom already live in the United States as refugees. Alshawi was released later Saturday. \n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union argued Saturday evening in a federal court in New York for a nationwide stay that would block the deportation of all people stranded in US airports under what the group called \"President Trump's new Muslim ban.\" \n\nA federal judge in New York granted an emergency stay Saturday night for citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries who have already arrived in the US and those who are in transit, and who hold valid visas, ruling they cannot be removed from the US. \n\nThat move limited part of President Trump's executive order barring citizens from those countries from entering the US for the next 90 days. \n\nRep. Jerrold Nadler, another Democrat from New York, said 10 other travelers were detained, but their status was unclear Saturday night. \n\nVirginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe joined protesters at Dulles International Airport outside Washington. \n\n\"This executive order is antithetical to the values that make America great, and it will make our country less safe,\" he said in a statement. \n\nIn Portland, one demonstrator carried a sign that said, \"Portland coffee comes from Yemen,\" one of the seven Muslim-majority nations on the no-travel list. \n\nLucia Martinez told KATU she used to be a \"hashtag activist\" but felt compelled to protest at the airport. \n\n\"This was the last straw,\" she said of Trump's policies. \"We're all immigrants.\" \n\nA group of community activists, attorneys and others gathered at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago. \n\nProtests also took place at airports in Boston; San Francisco, Denver, Dallas and Newark, New Jersey.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Political unrest news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Religion news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Protests against Trump's 'Muslim ban' continue","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Santa Barbara","zipCode":"93109","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Santa Barbara","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"KEYT3","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169681321","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"188"},"name":"KEYT3","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Politics","Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.keyt.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204393542","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:29:01Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale\u2019s Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\u201cThe judge\u2019s order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US \u2014 it doesn\u2019t immediately order that they be released from detention,\u201d he told CNN. \n \n\u201cWe are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\u201d \n \n\u201cWe are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\u201d he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \u201cour courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\u201d \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU\u2019s Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \u201cpreserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\u201d \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump\u2019s controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \u201cextreme vetting\u201d of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \u201cdozens and dozens\u201d of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump\u2019s order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \u201conly for nationals of countries for whom\u201d members of Trump\u2019s Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump\u2019s order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\u201cAmerica is the land of freedom,\u201d he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \u201cAmerica is the greatest nation.\u201d \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump\u2019s order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump\u2019s inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump\u2019s order and pledged continued action. \n \n\u201cThis should not happen in America,\u201d Velazquez said following Darweesh\u2019s release. \u201cOne by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\u201d \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\u201cBecause the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\u201d the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK\u2019s Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\u201cWhen Mr. Darweesh\u2019s attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, \u2018Who is the person to talk to?\u2019 the CBP agents responded, \u2018Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\u201d the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\u201cOur courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump\u2019s order puts those who have helped us in harm\u2019s way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\u201d said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nTrump\u2019s executive order, titled \u201cProtection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\u201d makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\u201cI am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\u201d Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \u201cWe don\u2019t want them here.\u201d \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \u201cwill continue to enforce all of the president\u2019s Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\u201cThe president\u2019s Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\u201cThe president\u2019s Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America\u2019s borders and national security.\u201d \n \nClick here to read full story »","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Wyandotte","zipCode":"66113","state":"Kansas","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Edwardsville","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"KCMO Talk Radio","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"503781759","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"13"},"name":"KCMO Talk Radio","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society","Politics"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://kcmotalkradio.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/29/politics/ny-immigration-order-stay/index.html"],"sequenceId":"695204396541","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:14:19Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:29:01Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country.

These are priced between Rs 8.78 lakh and Rs 10.63 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi). \n \nWhen contacted a MSI spokesperson told PTI: \"In this segment (1.6 litre engine), customers go for highest trim that has all the features. Therefore, it is business prudence to keep the number of variants at an optimum level in line with customers requirements.\" \n \nThe models performance is in line with the companys expectation, the spokesperson added. \n \n\"We started a new segment called premium crossover with S Cross. Volume-wise, S-Cross continues to do an average of 2,000-2,100 units monthly,\" the spokesperson said. \n \nS-Cross, the first model from the stable of MSI to be sold through its premium retail chain NEXA, has had a chequered history. \n \nMSI had introduced the S-Cross in two options of 1.6 litre and 1.3 litre engines in 2015 coinciding with the launch of its premium retail outlet chain Nexa. However, pricing issues hindered sales of the vehicle forcing the company to go for price correction. \n \nLast year, the company had cut price of the vehicle by over Rs 2 lakh. The reduction in the price of 1.6 litre variant was Rs 2,05,000 for all the three trims, while that of 1.3 litre variant ranged from Rs 40,000 to Rs 66,000. \n \nS-Cross along with Vitara Brezza have helped the company enhance its market share in the utility vehicle (UV) segment. \n \nWhile Vitara Brezza has been a runaway hit, S-Cross has been a slow starter for the company. \n \nAcknowledging the fact, the spokesperson said: \"Every brand has a specific role in the overall portfolio. While some are mass models that sell in big numbers, others may not sell as much as a mass model but contribute to the overall brand objectives of the company for the medium and long term\". \n \nS-Cross helps Maruti Suzuki in expanding its range and presence with an eye on the future, the spokesperson added. \n \nGrowth in the UV segment for MSI is over 120 per cent for the April-December period this fiscal. Volume wise the company has sold 1,43,254 units during the April-December period as compared to 63,924 units in the previous fiscal. \n \nThe company now commands over 65 per cent market share in the total UV segment.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Maruti discontinues sale of lower variants of S-Cross","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"PK","country":"Pakistan"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"KunMail.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"612368866","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"KunMail.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.kunmail.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204405917","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:12:48Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:29:10Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Those who were not on American soil when the decree came into effect are not able to re-enter for three months \u2013 separating them from their families and putting their jobs at risk. \n \nSome green card holders who were flying home to the US when the executive order was signed have been taken into custody at airports upon arrival \u2013 with dozens of immigration lawyers attempting to help the stranded. \n \nA judge has ruled those who have already landed in the US with valid visas or are en route to the country can be temporarily allowed to stay in the country. \n \nAs of Saturday night, customs and border protection officials had denied entry to more than 170 people. \n \nOthers who were about to board flights back to America have been told they cannot travel \u2013 and the Homeland Security Department has been contacting airlines and recommending them to deny boarding to certain passengers. \n \nEnforcement of the executive order for those landing in the States has been described as patchy and disorganised, and some American airports have been more lenient than others. \n \nAccording to the executive order, exceptions can be made when it is in the \u201cnational interest\u201d, but one federal law enforcement official said: \u201cIt\u2019s unclear at this point what the threshold of the national interest is.\u201d \n \nThe International Air Transport Association has been told that the ban also applies to flight crew who are from one of the listed countries. \n \nProtests are taking place across the US \u2013 including airports in New York, Washington DC, Los Angeles, Chicago and Dallas. \n \nThe decree has also created uncertainty for refugees who were about to begin a new life in the States, as all resettlements have been suspended for at least 120 days while tougher vetting rules are established. Syrian refugees have been specifically barred from the US indefinitely. \n \nOne aid organisation said it knew of 2,000 refugees who had been scheduled to relocate to the US next week. \n \nNo refugees were on planes heading to America when the order came into force, but 350 people who had already begun their journeys are now stuck in Kenya. \n \nWashington Governor Jay Inslee, speaking at Sea-Tac Airport, condemned the \u201cchaos and cruelty\u201d of Mr Trump\u2019s policy \u2013 and warned it was provocative, incompetent, ineffective and damaging to the economy. \n \nBritish citizens who carry passports for one of the seven affected countries have also been caught up in the disruption. \n \nHamaseh Tayari, a Scottish vet who holds an Iranian passport, told the Guardian she has been left stranded in Costa Rica as her flight back to Glasgow was scheduled to go via New York. \n \nShe and her boyfriend now face the possibility of having to pay an extra £2,000 to fly to Madrid in order to get home. \n \nPresident Trump has said the executive order is a necessary step to stop \u201cradical Islamic terrorists\u201d from coming to the US \u2013 but stressed the decree is \u201cnot a Muslim ban\u201d. \n \nHe has faced condemnation from leaders around the world, with Iran\u2019s Foreign Minister warning Tehran is going to stop issuing new visas to US citizens in retaliation to the ban. \n \nAmerican technology giants have also responded furiously to the immigration clampdown. \n \nApple chief executive Tim Cook said his company does not support the policy. In an apparent reference to its co-founder Steve Jobs, the son of a Syrian immigrant, Mr Cook said: \u201cApple would not exist without immigration, let alone thrive and innovate the way we do.\u201d \n \nGoogle has urged its employees from the seven countries affected to cancel any travel plans outside the US. \n \nThe impact on foreign students is also unclear. Figures from the Homeland Security Department suggest that 17,000 students from the blacklisted countries were allowed into the US in 2015/16. \n © Sky News, 2017, All Rights Reserved.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Trump\u2019s immigration ban sparks \u2018chaos and cruelty\u2019 worldwide","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","county":"West Midlands","zipCode":"B1","state":"England","countryCode":"GB","zipArea":"Birmingham","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Free Radio","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"261386305","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"10"},"name":"Free Radio","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.freeradio.co.uk"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204408829","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:57:20Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:29:11Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It was specifically tasked with discrediting opposition parties, and pushing pro-ANC propaganda. \n \nWhile the war room would have no official links to Luthuli House, it would establish a publication (The New South African) and talk shows featuring stories of ANC successes, while using so-called \u2018influencers\u2019 online to shift public discourse. \n \nIn response, both the ANC and activist Shaka Sisulu, the other alleged war room architect, tried to distance the party from the campaign. \n \n\u201cTheir activities were not sanctioned by the ANC.We distance ourselves [from] any insinuation that any such campaign was known to or approved by the ANC,\u201d the party said. \n \nHowever, recordings of the meeting on November 25, as well as two other meetings at Luthuli House, suggest that the ANC had lied about the extent of its involvement in the creation of the war room. The recordings were taken by Bolani using her smartphone unbeknownst to the other members of the meeting. \n \nThe recordings show: \n The war room was set up specifically to \u201cdig\u201d at the ANC\u2019s opponents. the EFF and DA would be the two main targets of the War room.  It had been set up to address the problem that \u201cthe public discourse (in South Africa) was run by white capital.\u201d  The initial R50 million budget was correct and not as Sisulu had claimed, \u201ca figment of someone\u2019s imagination.\u201d  The recordings implicate minister in the presidency Jeff Radebe as the main orchestrator of the War room. All War room reports were reportedly handed over directly to him.  The recordings also point to the direct involvement of two senior ANC officials \u2013 Joseph Nkadimeng and Ingnatius Jacobs who both heard speaking in the recordings.  Jacobs (who chaired the meeting) was well aware of the War room but concerned that money from ANC donors may have been misspent.  Jacobs held meetings with War room members during the campaign to get feedback, but became frustrated when he did not see the desired results.  \nJacobs has subsequently denied all allegations of impropriety against him his attorney, Mfana Gwala, said in a letter to City Press. In addition he had instructed them to pursue a case of defamation against Bolani. \u201cOur client has also written to the ANC leadership and indicated to them that he is prepared to subject himself to an investigation and disciplinary process.\u201d \n \nThe following report can be found in the 29 January 2017 edition of the City Press. \n \nRead:  Alleged ANC \u2018War Room\u2019 leader denies involvement in \u2018secret R50 million smear campaign\u2019","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"South Africa news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"New recordings reveal who was really behind the ANC\u2019s war room: report","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Southern Africa","countryCode":"ZA","country":"South Africa"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Businesstech.co.za","feed":{"genre":"Press Release","tags":[],"id":"237387006","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"10"},"name":"Businesstech.co.za","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Politics","Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.businesstech.co.za"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204411577","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:02:26Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:29:13Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Qantas is offering refunds to any passengers travelling from Australia to the United States who are affected by a new entry ban. Dozens of travellers have been detained at US airports and protests have erupted around the country. The executive order signed by US President Donald Trump has barred citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries \u2013 Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen \u2013 from entering the US for 90 days.

From Somalia, to her last home in India, and now Texas, the state that abuts another Trump target: Mexico.\n\nMr Haraco, secretary of the Somali Australian Council of Victoria, doesn't know if he should book tickets or wait to see what unfolds when the 90-day period ends.\n\nWill the ban continue? When will he see his elderly mother-in-law again? She is over 70 now; he doesn't want to leave it too long.\n\nConfusion and concern among immigrants and refugee advocates has been widespread, with travellers detained or sent home from US airports.\n\nThere is confusion, too, among the young men that Mr Haraco has brought down to the ocean to mull over the qualities of a leader.\n\nSome have talked about finding it difficult to get a job in Melbourne because of the colour of their skin, or their religion.\n\nThe group also discussed gangs, and young people they know who are dropping out of school, drawn to these groups.\n\nBut the bigger purpose was to inspire them, says council member Abdi Aziz, and he remains convinced that Trump's ruling won't quash their enthusiasm for multiculturalism.\n\n\"Diversity is mainstream in Australia \u2026 but the risk is there. For us it's an important time for our Prime Minister to show political leadership in this area.\"\n\nMany people he had spoken to that morning were feeling a sense of loss, he said.

Interestingly, however, it is actually IBM (IBM) that is silently walking away with a fair share of the market. IBM 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of IBMPeter Lynch Chart of IBMThanks to the company's legacy business streams that continue to weigh down on Big Blue's growing parts, everyone appears to be talking only about how IBM continues its revenue decline instead of how IBM is building these new business units for the future.\n\nFor starters, Microsoft and Amazon are both racing towards $20 billion in annual cloud revenues by 2018, but IBM's Analytics unit single-handedly posted $19.5 billion in revenues for 2016. No other company comes even close to it in the niche space that analytics occupies.\n\nIBM practically bulldozed its way into the cloud by going on a shopping spree for the past several years, spending billions of dollars to build a cloud services portfolio. In the process, the company ended up building a huge services line-up around Watson, its AI-powered data analytics platform.\n\nThe $19.5 billion in sales represented a growth of 9% compared to the previous year. Clearly, this unit must have something working in its favor to allow it to post near-double-digit growth despite its size. Analytics is a niche area where there are several smaller players, but no big player in the market. Mainstream cloud solutions providers aren't in this space in a big way. Amazon relentlessly focuses on IaaS services, and Microsoft wants to be in control of collaborative software (Office) and is also slowly moving towards the enterprise software space where Oracle and Salesforce have significant stakes.\n\nNone of these companies have a product that can compete with IBM Watson on an even scale. Considering the size of the unit, IBM has already run away with the market. That lack of competition is what is helping IBM steadily expand its numbers in analytics, and there is no other product of such size and scale to compete with them, simply because it's not easy to build something similar.\n\nAmazon and Microsoft can, but they have their focus on other areas where they can play to their strengths. Furthermore, with IBM firmly entrenching itself in the analytics segment, the incentive for Microsoft and Amazon to enter into that segment is only getting smaller. There's nothing stopping IBM from building the deepest and widest AI-based analytics product portfolio in the world and, in turn, gaining a moat wide enough to withstand any future onslaught.Disclosure: I have no positions in the stocks mentioned above and no intention to initiate a position in the next 72 hours.\n\nStart a free seven-day trial of Premium Membership to GuruFocus.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.

I sort of did it as a fanboy. I wanted to honor his film, but also say what I needed to say. After that, I don't take any responsibility.\" \n \nAs for the franchise post-Aliens, \"I don't think it's worked out terribly well. I think we've moved on beyond it. It's like, okay, we've got it, we've got the whole Freudian biomechanoid meme. I've seen it in 100 horror films since. I think both of those films stand at a certain point in time, as a reference point. But is there any validity to doing another one now? I don't know. Maybe. Let's see, jury's out. Let's see what Ridley comes up with.\" \n \n\"Let me just add to that \u2014 and don't cut this part off, please \u2014 I will stand in line for any Ridley Scott movie, even a not-so-great one, because he is such an artist, he's such a filmmaker. I always learn from him. And what he does with going back to his own franchise would be fascinating.\" \n \nMeanwhile, Cameron will regain the screen rights to the Terminator film franchise in 2019, and reportedly wants Deadpool's Tim Miller to direct another installment/reboot. Cameron is also developing multiple sequels to his 2009 blockbuster Avatar, the highest-grossing film of all time.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"},{"name":"Entertainment: video game news","group":"Entertainment"},{"name":"Entertainment: movie news","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"James Cameron Thinks 'We've Moved on Beyond' Alien Franchise","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Western Asia","countryCode":"AE","country":"United Arab Emirates"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"IGN Middle East","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"288876546","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"IGN Middle East","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Film","Arts","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.me.ign.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.vulture.com/2017/01/james-cameron-atlantis-rising-alien-covenant.html"],"sequenceId":"695204424258","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T18:32:35Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:29:25Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://sm.ign.com/t/ign_me/news/j/james-came/james-cameron-thinks-weve-moved-on-beyond-alien-franchise_x8wx.300.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Made up of riddles, visual challenges, and brain teasers, it\u2019s great for both long play sessions and short bursts. It\u2019s this engrossing playstyle and the stunning animated presentation that make it an exceptional short-term antidote to stress. \n Animal Crossing: New Leaf  \nPaying off a loan may not seem like the most chilled out pastime, but spend any amount of time with Animal Crossing: New Leaf and you\u2019ll soon realize its potential. Whether you\u2019re socializing with other villagers or collecting fish, bugs, and fossils to pay off your debt, you\u2019ll quickly become engrossed in this lifestyle sim. Its simple premise and colorful visuals make for a perfect break away from the hustle and bustle of modern day life. \n We Love Katamari  \n\n \nThe best word to describe We Love Katamari is cathartic. In the title, you assume the role of a prince who must roll up the world into a ball at the behest of his fans. Starting with small objects, you\u2019re gradually able to gather larger items, before moving onto enormous skyscrapers and entire solar systems. It\u2019s a surprisingly therapeutic venture, made so by its satisfying core mechanics as well as its delightfully eclectic score composed by multiple Namco veterans. \n Stardew Valley  \nBuilding on the framework of popular games like Harvest Moon and Rune Factory, Stardew Valley, developed by Concerned Ape, transports you to a bucolic paradise where you can create the farm of your dreams. Boasting an impressive variety of objectives and building tools, you\u2019ll soon find yourself settling into your new rural lifestyle. And who knows? You may even get married. With its plentiful possibilities, Stardew Valley is an absorbing title that\u2019s bound to settle the nerves. \n Monument Valley  \nThere\u2019s simply no ignoring Monument Valley\u2019s outstanding atmosphere. Utilizing a sparse electronic score and pleasant sound effects, the audio design consistently lulls you into a state of calm, as you navigate its collection of puzzling dioramas. Every beep and every chime is just as pleasing to the ears as the last. You\u2019ll want to take your time experimenting with each level, which explains why it\u2019s so effective for alleviating anxiety. \n The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition  \nThe Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim isn\u2019t all about bloody sword fights with bandits and furious dragon shouts. It\u2019s also about the hours spent adventuring alone, gazing at the ancient stone structures and the aurora spiraling away in the night sky. It\u2019s these intimate moments that make the game so comforting to play for hours on end. So why not put away your greatsword and go for a blithe stroll through this enchanted fantasy realm? Once you experience the continent of Tamriel, you may never want to leave its shores again. \n Alto's Adventure  \nIn addition to being one of the best endless runner released in recent memory, Alto\u2019s Adventure doubles as an excellent way to chill out. So much so, the developer Snowman has added a Zen Mode for players using the game specifically for this purpose. By selecting this mode, players can snowboard down the mountain, accompanied by an ambient soundtrack, without fear of being rushed off their feet by boulders or aggressive elders. It\u2019s a delightful distraction and one that I wholly recommend to anyone in need of a quick pick-me-up. \n Burly Men at Sea  \nHave you ever wanted to leave it all behind? To sail away and see where the wild wind takes you? Burly Men at Sea grants you this very opportunity. In the game, you\u2019re put in control of three bearded men, who set off on an adventure to complete a mysterious map that they\u2019ve found in a bottle. You proceed by swiping either left or right and clicking on key objects, with your choices impacting upon the story being told. Burly Men at Sea features an endearing picture book art style, humorous writing, and a tremendous folk soundtrack \u2014 elements that make it gratifying to play more than once. \n Dragon Quest Builders  \nDragon Quest Builders isn\u2019t the most original game ever made, but it sure knows how to tick all the right boxes. It riffs on conventions set by Minecraft, Dragon Quest, and The Legend of Zelda to bring you an overall experience that\u2019s both familiar and reassuring. In Dragon Quest Builders, you\u2019re responsible for building towns and protecting the villagers that move in, but you can also choose to wander the map and explore, if you so choose. This option allows you to adopt a carefree style of play that prioritizes relaxation over more stressful components, like boss fights and fetch quests. \n Windosill  \n\n \nWindosill is an environmental puzzle game that requires players to solve problems to advance through its 11 successive rooms. Every item on the screen is interactive and has a corresponding sound effect that\u2019s activated whenever you touch it. This means that when you perform an action, you\u2019re immediately rewarded with some cool tone or audio clue to aid progression. These encouraging sounds and the steady rate of progression are the key ingredients that make the game so worthwhile. \n Samorost 3  \nDeveloped by Amanita Design, Samorost 3 is the third title in a trilogy of bizarre point-and-click adventures. It follows a small space gnome and his attempts to locate the owner of a magical flute. Featuring clever audio design and breathtaking artwork fashioned from real photographs, you\u2019d be hard pressed to find another game series that\u2019s quite like Samorost. Its mesmerizing soundtrack alone will probably be enough to see you off to sleep. \n \nWhat\u2019s your favorite game to kick back with and unwind? Let us know in the comments!","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: video game news","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"11 Calming Games to Help You Relax","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Western Asia","countryCode":"AE","country":"United Arab Emirates"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"IGN Middle East","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"288876546","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"IGN Middle East","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Recreation","Games"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.me.ign.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://oyster.ignimgs.com/wordpress/stg.ign.com/2016/12/katamari.jpeg","http://oyster.ignimgs.com/wordpress/stg.ign.com/2016/12/windosill1.png"],"sequenceId":"695204424582","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:19:23Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:29:25Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://sm.ign.com/t/ign_me/feature/1/11-calming/11-calming-games-to-help-you-relax_m3pp.300.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

The celebration has become an important platform for local people to learn more about Chinese culture and for promoting mutual understanding and cultural exchanges between central Japan and China. \n\nCopyright © 2000 - 2015 XINHUANET.com \n\nAll Rights Reserved.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Global news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Asia-Pacific latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"China news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Japan news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Spotlight: Spring Festival celebrations in Japan attract appreciation for Chinese culture","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Eastern Asia","countryCode":"CN","country":"China"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"Xinhua News Agency","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169587760","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"142"},"name":"Xinhua News Agency","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard","Global","Geographic"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.xinhuanet.com/","publisher":"Xinhua News Agency"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204425159","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:29:26Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

She heard about it on Twitter and thinks most people did the same. \n \nIn New York City, a large crowd massed at John F. Kennedy International Airport to protest the detention of two Iraqis who were later released. \n \n\u201cMr. President, look at us,\u201d said US Rep. Nydia Velazquez, a New York Democrat. \u201cThis is America. What you have done is shameful. It\u2019s un-American.\u201d \n \nThe protesters gathered in Terminal 4 at JFK and carried signs reading, \u201cWe are all immigrants!\u201d and \u201cNo ban! No wall!\u201d \n \nSeveral New York officials showed support for the protests. \n \nGov. Andrew Cuomo ordered the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to reverse an earlier decision to restrict passage aboard the JFK Airport AirTrain to ticketed passengers and airport employees only. \n \nHe also instructed state police and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to assist with security and transportation for protesters. \n \n\u201cThe people of New York will have their voices heard,\u201d Cuomo said. \n \nNew York Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted: \u201cWhat\u2019s happening at JFK is shameful. @NYCImmigrants Affairs Commissioner Nisha Agarwal is on the ground now working to help.\u201d \n \nOne of the detained Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh, was released early Saturday afternoon. He worked with the US government for 10 years after the United States invaded Iraq. \n \nThe other detained Iraqi, Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been granted a visa to join his wife, who worked for a US contractor in Iraq, and son, both of whom already live in the United States as refugees. Alshawi was released later Saturday. \n \nThe American Civil Liberties Union argued Saturday evening in a federal court in New York for a nationwide stay that would block the deportation of all people stranded in US airports under what the group called \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s new Muslim ban.\u201d \n \nA federal judge in New York granted an emergency stay Saturday night for citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries who have already arrived in the US and those who are in transit, and who hold valid visas, ruling they cannot be removed from the US. \n \nThat move limited part of President Trump\u2019s executive order barring citizens from those countries from entering the US for the next 90 days. \n \nRep. Jerrold Nadler, another Democrat from New York, said 10 other travelers were detained, but their status was unclear Saturday night. \n \nVirginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe joined protesters at Dulles International Airport outside Washington. \n \n\u201cThis executive order is antithetical to the values that make America great, and it will make our country less safe,\u201d he said in a statement. \n \nIn Portland, one demonstrator carried a sign that said, \u201cPortland coffee comes from Yemen,\u201d one of the seven Muslim-majority nations on the no-travel list. \n \nLucia Martinez told KATU she used to be a \u201chashtag activist\u201d but felt compelled to protest at the airport. \n \n\u201cThis was the last straw,\u201d she said of Trump\u2019s policies. \u201cWe\u2019re all immigrants.\u201d \n \nA group of community activists, attorneys and others gathered at O\u2019Hare International Airport in Chicago. \n \nProtests also took place at airports in Boston; San Francisco, Denver, Dallas and Newark, New Jersey. \n \nClick here to read full story »","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Political unrest news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"More protests against Trump\u2019s immigration policies planned","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"San Francisco","zipCode":"94111","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"San Francisco","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"KSFO.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"561327038","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"48"},"name":"KSFO.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.ksfo.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/29/politics/us-immigration-protests/index.html"],"sequenceId":"695204426982","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:29:24Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

She has won 10 major titles since turning 30 and has made eight out of the last grand slam 10 finals. \n\nWilliams believes she is in the form of her life. \n\n\"I was thinking yesterday on the practice court, 'gosh I'm playing better than I have ever before I think',\" Williams said.\n\n\"I'm moving better, I've always been a fast mover but I stopped moving a bit in the middle of my career because I was like, I don't have to move so much.\n\n\"But I was like, 'man I'm hitting really well'. It feels good to be playing this well at the moment.\"\n\nBy her own high standards, 2016 represented a disappointing season for Williams.\n\nThe American only added a Wimbledon title to her tally and also surrendered the world number one spot to Angelique Kerber after a shock US Open defeat to Karolina Pliskova.\n\n\"Winning this one was very important,\" Williams' coach Patrick Mouratoglou said.\n\n\"I feel when you end the season with a loss, especially in a grand slam, you cannot feel the same way and cannot have a good feeling.\n\n\"She had confidence but not the same kind as when you win. That's why this one was very important for the rest of the season.\"\n\nWilliams has struggled at times with the weight of expectation, crumbling at the 2015 US Open when a calendar grand slam was in sight and then stumbling again there in September when on the brink of breaking Graf's record.\n\nShe has appeared far more relaxed in Melbourne, on and off court, with her new fiance Alexis Ohanian here supporting from her box throughout.\n\n\"I've been trying to live it for some time now, this tournament I was able to do it,\" Williams said.\n\n\"I was okay with not losing but I also knew I didn't have to win here to make my career. It settled with me this time. I don't know why I felt like that but I want to know because I want it again.\"\n\nSurpassing Graf's 22 major triumphs adds statistical weight to the now almost indisputable argument that Williams is the greatest female player of all time.\n\nShe could pass Court's mark at Wimbledon this summer, although 13 of the Australian's 24 successes came before the Open era, when grand slams were still not fully professional.\n\n\"Graf's record is more important because with all the respect for Margaret Court, it's another era,\" Mouratoglou said.\n\n\"The draws were like 16 players, they were not professionals. Of course the record is there and we definitely want to beat it but there is a professional era and the record was Steffi Graf.\n\n\"Serena was not motivated by 22, she was motivated by grand slams. That's her motivation.\n\n\"This won't change until one day she wakes up and is not motivated to win grand slams but for now she is, so that's enough.\n\n\"Is that day close? I don't think so. I am not in her head but I don't think so.\"\n\nWilliams did take some motivation from reclaiming her place at the top of the world rankings, which she will when the list refreshes on Monday.\n\nTo avoid adding any extra pressure, however, Mouratoglou told his charge at the start of the tournament that victory would not return her to number one.\n\n\"In the beginning of the tournament, I was like, 'if I win, will I be number one?'\" Williams said.\n\n\"Patrick said, 'no, no, no.' So I was like whatever. Then on the court when they were said, 'and number one', I was like, 'whoa, really'?\" \n\nWilliams later added: \"Kerber played unbelievable, she definitely deserved to have that position. I t didn't hurt or p*** me off, to me it just looked weird. I'd never felt like number two.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: tennis news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Serena Williams: I'm in the best form of my life after 23rd grand slam","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","county":"Somerset","zipCode":"BA1","state":"England","countryCode":"GB","zipArea":"Bath and North East Somerset","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"This is the West Country","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169663569","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"This is the West Country","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.thisisthewestcountry.co.uk","publisher":"Newsquest Media Group"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204428164","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:45:53Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:29:21Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.thisisthewestcountry.co.uk/resources/images/5939734/"}],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale\u2019s Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\u201cThe judge\u2019s order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US \u2014 it doesn\u2019t immediately order that they be released from detention,\u201d he told CNN. \n \n\u201cWe are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\u201d \n \n\u201cWe are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\u201d he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \u201cour courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\u201d \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU\u2019s Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \u201cpreserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\u201d \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump\u2019s controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \u201cextreme vetting\u201d of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \u201cdozens and dozens\u201d of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump\u2019s order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \u201conly for nationals of countries for whom\u201d members of Trump\u2019s Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump\u2019s order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\u201cAmerica is the land of freedom,\u201d he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \u201cAmerica is the greatest nation.\u201d \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump\u2019s order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump\u2019s inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump\u2019s order and pledged continued action. \n \n\u201cThis should not happen in America,\u201d Velazquez said following Darweesh\u2019s release. \u201cOne by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\u201d \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\u201cBecause the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\u201d the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK\u2019s Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\u201cWhen Mr. Darweesh\u2019s attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, \u2018Who is the person to talk to?\u2019 the CBP agents responded, \u2018Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\u201d the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\u201cOur courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump\u2019s order puts those who have helped us in harm\u2019s way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\u201d said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nTrump\u2019s executive order, titled \u201cProtection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\u201d makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\u201cI am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\u201d Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \u201cWe don\u2019t want them here.\u201d \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \u201cwill continue to enforce all of the president\u2019s Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\u201cThe president\u2019s Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\u201cThe president\u2019s Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America\u2019s borders and national security.\u201d \n \nClick here to read full story »","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"San Francisco","zipCode":"94111","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"San Francisco","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"KSFO.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"561327038","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"48"},"name":"KSFO.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.ksfo.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/29/politics/ny-immigration-order-stay/index.html"],"sequenceId":"695204431954","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:29:25Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The 24GM77-B is LG's least expensive 24\" gaming monitor at a $299 MSRP, and it offers both a high 144Hz refresh rate as well as a plethora of gaming-specific features. Before we jump in, the manufacturer-provided specs: \n \n\n Design and Features  \nThe 24GM77-B isn\u2019t exactly a stylish monitor although the black body with red accents give it a \"gaming\" look. The non-reflective, anti-glare panel is framed by a pretty standard-sized 0.6-inch bezel. The monitor itself is supported by a glossy black plastic base with a telescoping arm that provides 4 inches of height adjustment. The panel can tilt up to 25 degrees and pivot a full 90 degrees from landscape to portrait. VESA holes on the back of the unit can be used for mounting it to a wall too. There are no speakers, but most gamers use external speakers or headphones. There is a small control panel under the bottom bezel that lets you access and adjust the monitor's gaming specific features, which is a much easier way to do it than dealing with an on-screen display. It contains two arrow buttons (left and right), a Black Stabilizer button, Game Mode button, and a Dynamic Action Sync (DAS) button. All controls and their navigation are intuitive. The Black Stabilizer brightens up dark scenes and I found this pretty helpful while searching for hidden enemies in the shadows. DAS minimizes input lag and it makes sense to leave this on all time, although you can\u2019t use DAS and Motion 240 blur-reduction at the same time. Motion 240 blur reduction does what you'd think it does, but it only works at 100Hz or 120HZ, and it's LG\u2019s attempt to make moving images appear smoother and more fluid and it\u2019s better for watching video than for playing a game though because of the increased input lag. \n \n\n \nThe included Game Modes are something a detail-oriented gamer will find indispensable as it lets you group together settings for brightness, contrast, sharpness, gamma, color temp, black stabilizer, response time, DAS mode, and Motion 240. It\u2019s helpful to be able to manage so many different settings as a group. This will be of the greatest benefit to gamers who play a variety of games under a variety of ambient lighting conditions as they can tweak setting to their heart\u2019s content and then save them as presets for ready access. Game Modes include Gamer 1, Gamer 2, Gamer 3, FPS 1, FPS 2, and RTS and the only rub is that enabling them also turns on a feature called Super + Resolution, which sharpens the edges of images in a way that I didn\u2019t like. You can change the parameters of all of these settings and more using the full on-screen display (OSD). \n Performance  \nThe 24GM77 has great gaming performance and handled everything that I threw at it with ease. I tested using my PS4 connected via HDMI and my gaming rig connected via DVI. One note, to run at 144Hz, you'll have to use either DVI (dual-link) or DisplayPort as HDMI is limited to 60Hz. Playing Call of Duty Infinite Warfare on both the PS4 and the PC was very smooth and fast. With DAS enabled everything looked and felt snappy and responsive. Overall the 24GM77 provided a great gaming experience. \n \n\n \nTurning on the Motion 240 blur-reduction has a detrimental effect on performance and a decrease in contrast. Motion 240 can\u2019t be used at a 144Hz refresh rate and it also prevents the use of the lag reducing DAS. A higher refresh rate with DAS on provides such strong gaming performance that turning off Motion 240 and accepting the slightest amount of blur is the way to go. The 24GM77 provides accurate colors that are slightly on the warm side, although not overly deep and rich. Colors were bright and evenly saturated. Grays are very good, although not perfect. Black contrast is very strong. When viewing grays and blacks together, the grays have a tendency to look a little washed out. Viewing angle performance is good but not great. With the 24GM77 in landscape mode, horizontal viewing angles are excellent with virtually no color shifting or loss of brightness almost up to 180 degrees. However, viewing from a 60 degree top angle resulted in a washed out image and viewing from a similar bottom angle resulted in a significant decrease in brightness and color accuracy. When I rotated the 24GM77 to portrait mode, the horizontal viewing angles were terrible. Fortunately, you\u2019ll never play a game in portrait mode. One final performance note, I\u2019m not a big fan of the plastic arm used to adjust panel height. It does not slide up and down very smoothly, so when I tired to lower it a hair it would drop three inches instead. You\u2019re going to want to set it once and then leave it alone. \n \n The Verdict  The LG 24GM77 is an excellent choice for gamers champing at the bit for a 24-inch monitor with a high refresh rate and smooth performance. Colors are accurate and brightness is outstanding, but viewing angle performance is lacking and it's especially noticeable in portrait mode.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: video game news","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"LG 24GM77-B 144Hz Gaming Monitor Review","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Western Asia","countryCode":"AE","country":"United Arab Emirates"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"IGN Middle East","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"288876546","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"IGN Middle East","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Recreation","Games"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.me.ign.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://oyster.ignimgs.com/wordpress/stg.ign.com/2017/01/specs2.png","https://r.zdbb.net/u/229u"],"sequenceId":"695204432281","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:33:31Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:29:25Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://sm.ign.com/t/ign_me/review/l/lg-24gm77-/lg-24gm77-b-144hz-gaming-monitor-review_wz44.300.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

From Somalia, to her last home in India, and now Texas, the state that abuts another Trump target: Mexico.\n\nMr Haraco, secretary of the Somali Australian Council of Victoria, doesn't know if he should book tickets or wait to see what unfolds when the 90-day period ends.\n\nWill the ban continue? When will he see his elderly mother-in-law again? She is over 70 now; he doesn't want to leave it too long.\n\nConfusion and concern among immigrants and refugee advocates has been widespread, with travellers detained or sent home from US airports.\n\nThere is confusion, too, among the young men that Mr Haraco has brought down to the ocean to mull over the qualities of a leader.\n\nSome have talked about finding it difficult to get a job in Melbourne because of the colour of their skin, or their religion.\n\nThe group also discussed gangs, and young people they know who are dropping out of school, drawn to these groups.\n\nBut the bigger purpose was to inspire them, says council member Abdi Aziz, and he remains convinced that Trump's ruling won't quash their enthusiasm for multiculturalism.\n\n\"Diversity is mainstream in Australia \u2026 but the risk is there.

The number was bigger at 79,000 for people killed in road crashes in the age group of 15 to 34 years. This was 54% of all road deaths that India recorded in 2015. The data also show how nearly 42% of people dying on roads was due to speeding beyond the permitted limit. \n\nIt's no different across the globe. The latest global status report on road safety by World Health Organisation says road crashes are the biggest killer of people in the age group of 15-29 years and the numbers are much more than lives lost in suicides, HIV/ AIDS, homicide or lower respiratory infection. \n\nWhile increasing penalty for fatal offences such as speeding, dangerous driving, drunk driving and using mobile phone while behind the wheels are key to tame the unruly and risky drivers, experts said what India lacks is the mechanism to ensure every traffic offence, at least in urban areas, is caught. \n\n\u201cUntil there is fear of getting caught everytime you violate traffic norms, most of the people won't mend their ways. States and cities need to take quick steps to monitor every violation, which the Centre is pursuing with them since this is a state subject,\" said K K Kapila of International Federation.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Every third person died in road accidents is a youth","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Economic & India Times Auto.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"594642922","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Economic & India Times Auto.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Industrials","AutomobilesComponents"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://auto.economictimes.indiatimes.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204433330","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:21:32Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:29:27Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

expected to ramp up spending in its latest budget this week, seeking to ease the pain from a ban on high-value banknotes that slammed the brakes on the world's fastest-growing major economy. \nAhead of a series of elections, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley will unveil a budget on Wednesday that analysts say will aim to offset the impact from the so-called demonetisation programme with stimulus measures. \n \n\"The overarching focus of the budget will somehow indicate a gain from pain mentality -- how the pain of demonetisation helped the government get some extra resources that it can now spread around,\" Rajeev Malik, senior economist at brokerage CLSA, told AFP. \n \n\"It's going to be a budget that is meant to soothe the pain.\" \n \nBefore Prime Minister Narendra Modi's shock decision in November to pull all 500 and 1,000 rupee notes from circulation, the International Monetary Fund had forecast India's economy would grow 7.6 percent in 2016, faster than any other major country. \n \nBut as authorities struggled to print replacement notes fast enough, causing consumer spending to plunge, the IMF knocked a percentage point off its forecast. The government's prediction is 7.1 percent growth. \n \nBy painting demonetisation as a blitz on corruption and cash-hoarding that will ultimately boost tax revenues, Modi has so far escaped a major backlash. While there were massive queues outside banks in the weeks afterwards, they have now subsided while limits on withdrawals have eased. \n \nElectoral  test \nBut voters in four states -- including the key battlegrounds of Uttar Pradesh and Punjab -- will have a chance to deliver their verdict when they begin going to the polls in multi-phase elections from February 4. \n \nAnalysts say the polls are another reason why the government will be tempted to increase spending on health, education and a rural employment scheme. \n \nThere are also expectations of a support package for small and medium-sized businesses which have been particularly hard hit as they are heavily cash-dependent. \n \n\"We 100 percent expect a social focused budget,\" said Malik as he considered the calculations for Modi half way through his five-year term. \n \n\"The focus in the first two-and-a-half years was on reviving growth... We're at the half way point now and there are some elections ahead so the shift is towards the social sector.\" \n \nBig business, hit by a drop in manufacturing and construction activity after the cash crunch, also wants help. \n \nPankaj Patel, president of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry , said his members hoped for a cut in corporate tax from 30 percent to 25 percent and increased infrastructure spending. \n \n\"We're in an uncertain world and we need the support of the government,\" Patel told AFP. \n \n'Uncertain world' \nAnalysts are worried about how the government plans to fund that support. \n \n\"The central question before the government is whether a fresh round of fiscal stimulus is required to offset some of the ill effects of currency delegalisation,\" Devendra Pant, chief economist at India Ratings & Research, said in a recent note. \n \n\"The fiscal room for stepping up expenditure has to either come from higher revenue collection or higher fiscal deficit . With growth expected to fall... the government is clearly staring at lower tax collection.\" \n \nOne area that offers some wriggle room is the budget deficit target. \n \nThe current deficit is 3.5 percent of GDP and the government had said it would reduce that to three percent for the fiscal year starting in April. \n \nBut in the face of lower tax earnings and a probable stimulus budget, analysts now expect a revised target of around 3.3 percent. \n \nIn a recent note, Morgan Stanley said \"the pace of fiscal consolidation will be slower than expected\" as the government \"will find it difficult to cut back spending aggressively because the economy is recovering\" from demonetisation. \n \nNevertheless, analysts say investors will be unimpressed by any dialing back of fiscal consolidation plans. \n \n\"Foreign investors will be cautious about this shift in political orientation,\" said Malik. \"It doesn't change India's structural story, but it takes away a bit of the shine in terms of growth expectations.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Indian subcontinent news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Economics news","group":"Society"}],"title":"India looks to ease pain from demonetisation in union budget 2017","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Economic & India Times Auto.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"594642922","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Economic & India Times Auto.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Industrials","AutomobilesComponents"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://auto.economictimes.indiatimes.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204434042","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:04:28Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:29:28Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Lujan said he makes frequent calls to local legislators to flex their \"state muscle.\" \n \n\"It's up to us now,\" Lujan said. \"When we were in the shadows, when we were hidden, we didn't have the voice we have today.\" \n \nA Medford Latina woman who asked not to be identified said her family lives in fear that her husband of 24 years will be deported \u2014 for the fourth time. Each time he was sent back to Mexico, he risked life-threatening treks through the desert to return to the only family he has. Once he was robbed at gunpoint and held for $3,000 ransom. The woman said she was too scared to contact police, so she complied. \n \nThe Mail Tribune granted the woman anonymity to protect her husband, who works as a migrant worker under the table. \n \n\"It's constantly on TV,\" she said. She describes herself as \"not a political person,\" but her husband insists on tuning in when the president talks about immigration. \n \nThey've been saving for a house in Mexico should he be deported again, even though the country isn't her home and her husband has no extended family there. \n \n\"This is all he's known,\" the woman said. \"He's been here since he was 14.\" \n \nTrump's executive order \"Border Security and Immigration Enforcement Improvements\" is the first step toward carrying out a campaign promise to build a physical barrier at the Mexico border, but immigration lawyers say Trump's other order Wednesday, \"Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States,\" is more concerning to locals because it challenges the state's longstanding sanctuary city law. \n \n\"The wall is symbolic,\" Medford immigration lawyer John Almaguer said. \n \nSince 1987, no state or local law enforcement agency in Oregon can use their resources for apprehending individuals solely because they are violating federal immigration laws. Trump's executive order targets the state law as well as sanctuary cities, such as Ashland and Portland, by threatening to withhold federal funding. \n \nState Republican lawmakers, including Medford state Rep. Sal Esquivel, are working toward overturning the law with a 2018 ballot measure. \n \nIf the law were to be struck down, Almaguer envisions places such as Ashland remaining as sanctuary cities, while other cities might enter into contracts with the federal government to arrest people solely because they're in the country illegally. \n \n\"It's going to be tough traveling through the state,\" Almaguer said. \n \nIn the short term, Trump's executive order could create a much broader definition of criminal aliens than the Obama and Bush administrations, according to Almaguer and fellow immigration lawyer Kevin Stout. \n \nThough Almaguer said it's \"way too early\" to know how the law will be enforced, he's concerned unlawful acts many undocumented immigrants do to get by, such as falsifying a job application or using a fake Social Security number, could be considered fraud or willful misrepresentation in the Trump administration. \n \n\"We have this expansion into the definition of 'criminal,'\" Almaguer said. \"You don't even need to have a charge or conviction.\" \n \nStout said he's concerned that the law will shift enforcement priorities away from President Obama's nuanced approach targeting deportation efforts at immigrants convicted of felony crimes. \n \n\"Now it's throwing a much broader net with the same amount of agents and the same amount of resources,\" Stout said. \n \nDeportation hearings for Stout's clients are more than a year away; that's before Trump's executive order removed President Obama's priorities and protections, he said.  \n \n\"It's a short-sighted and poorly crafted executive order that won't have the desired effect,\" Stout said. \n \nThere are only about seven Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in the Medford area, whom Stout described as highly trained. Though Trump's executive order could expand hiring in the Department of Homeland Security and Department of Justice, Stout said recruiting and hiring qualified people typically can't happen right away. \n \n\"It's hard to train these guys,\" Stout said. \n \nStout said a more immediate concern is that it'll drive people in the Latino community underground, undoing efforts by Medford police and Jackson County sheriff's deputies to build trust and communication with the Latino community. \n \n\u201cIf they\u2019re afraid of going to court, it\u2019s just going to be more dangerous for all of us,\u201d Stout said. \n \nJackson County Sheriff Nathan Sickler said the department intends to continue its efforts to build and maintain relationships with underrepresented communities that started under former Sheriff Corey Falls. Since 2014, the sheriff's department has undergone implicit bias training and held citizen's academy events in Spanish to better serve the Latino community. Sickler said another bilingual citizen's academy is set for later this year. \n \n\"We'll continue to do a lot of the same things,\" Sickler said. \"It's important that we have everybody's trust in the community.\" \n \nMedford police declined to comment, but the agency has held its own outreach to the Latino community, including a Spanish-language Latino Citizens Academy in 2016, organized with bilingual Caminos Magazine and Medford Cultural Liaison Coordinator Lilia Caballero. \n \nWhen a victim reports a crime, dispatchers and sheriff's deputies don't even ask about citizenship, Sickler said.  \n \nA statement issued Friday from Washington County Sheriff Pat Garrett, president of the Oregon State Sheriff's Association, said that \"immediate changes to police practices are unlikely\" and that the order is only binding for federal agents. Sickler said his department draws guidance from the OSSA, which abides by law enforcement industry standards and practices. \n \n\"For the time being, Oregon Sheriffs are bound to follow state law, which currently only allows exchange of information with ICE when a foreign-born person is arrested,\" Garrett's statement said. \n \nShould the law change, Sickler said his department isn't at liberty to pick and choose what laws to enforce, but said his department would handle changes to the law in a responsive and transparent way. \n \nThe sheriff's office doesn't have the resources to act as ICE agents or sweep neighborhoods, and deputies wouldn't want to violate trust they've gained in the Latino community, Sickler said. \n \n\"We're not going to go door-to-door,\" Sickler said. \n \nSickler said there must be an accompanying crime or warrant signed off by a judge to keep someone in custody with an ICE hold. Oregon police officers and corrections deputies are allowed to communicate with ICE regarding crimes and frequently do so, according to the OSSA.  \n \nBecause Oregon jails can't hold people on ICE requests to detain alone, the OSSA is concerned the state could be considered a \"sanctuary state\" and may be threatened with the loss of federal grant funding. \n \n\"At this time the 'sanctuary' definition is unclear,\" the OSSA statement says.  \n \nRegardless of how the law may change, the president's anti-immigration statements impact the way Latinos live their daily lives, the immigration lawyers said. \n \nAlmaguer said strangers have approached his clients who have legal residency and asked them when they'll be leaving the United States. \n \nLujan said he lost a friend from the northern part of the state to suicide, which he said was partly a result of stress and depression over the fact she was undocumented. \n \n\"That's when it truly hit me close to home,\" Lujan said. \"It's been devastating to our community for sure.\" \n \nLujan, who's majoring in Business Administration with a focus on nonprofit management, said he's driven to prove those skeptical of undocumented immigrants wrong by working to be a contributing member of society, pay his taxes and live above board. \n \n\"I've always viewed myself as an American,\" Lujan said. \n \n\u2014 Reach reporter Nick Morgan at 541-776-4471 or nmorgan@mailtribune.com.

Mr Trump's controversial executive order on Saturday suspended entry to the US for refugees for 120 days and barred Syrians indefinitely. It will also block entry for citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. \n\nThough the crackdown was expected, US Homeland Security officials continued interviews of refugees held by Australia on Nauru as late as Friday. Ms Horrigan-Dixon received the medal of the Order of Australia in last week's Australia Day honours, recognition for more than 30 years of work to support waves of refugees arriving in Australia, including from Europe, China, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos and Thailand.\n\nShe said Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull should immediately explain how many people would go to the US. \"Australia needs to start thinking about how we can work with local groups in Canada,\" she said. \n\n\"The major problem remains the 1500-odd people being held on Manus Island and in Papua New Guinea, because no other country will accept them. \n\n\"Justin Trudeau and his government have welcomed people. Maybe we need a delegation over there, and Australia could take people Canada would have otherwise taken to get people off these islands.\" \n\nAn adviser to the St Mary's House of Welcome project in Fitzroy and founder of a series of local engagement and English-language programs, Ms Horrigan-Dixon said the Coalition and Labor had denied thousands of people the chance to build successful lives in Australia's cities and towns. \n\nShe said the reinstatement of temporary protection visas by the Abbott government in 2013 meant many asylum seekers living in the community were in limbo, while those given permanent resettlement were thriving. \n\n\"They want to be here and they want to work and settle. The thing they say they love the most is our democracy, our stable system of government and the inclusion and safety of Australia,\" Ms Horrigan-Dixon said. \n\n\"What we set out to do is think how would we treat these people if they were our own children?\n\n\"Everything has been teamwork, because we've had a common cause.\"\n\nCanada has accepted 39,671 Syrians since November 2015.\n\n\"After these poor people have suffered for years on Manus and Nauru, they need to be somewhere welcoming and Justin Trudeau has shown he's prepared to provide that,\" she said. \n\nFollow Tom McIlroy on","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Tom McIlroy"},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Negotiate with Trudeau for refugee resettlement, says advocate","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"4000","state":"Queensland","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Brisbane Adelaide Street","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Brisbane Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169658354","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"191"},"name":"Brisbane Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Politics","Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://plus.google.com/109383571713437469303","https://twitter.com/TomMcIlroy","https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.brisbanetimes.com.au%2Ffederal-politics%2Fpolitical-news%2Fnegotiate-with-justin-trudeau-for-refugee-resettlement-advocate-anne-horrigandixon-20170126-gtyye7.html&title=Negotiate+with+Justin+Tr","https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.brisbanetimes.com.au%2Ffederal-politics%2Fpolitical-news%2Fnegotiate-with-justin-trudeau-for-refugee-resettlement-advocate-anne-horrigandixon-20170126-gtyye7.html&text=Negotiate+with+Justin+Trudeau+for+refuge","https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.brisbanetimes.com.au%2Ffederal-politics%2Fpolitical-news%2Fnegotiate-with-justin-trudeau-for-refugee-resettlement-advocate-anne-horrigandixon-20170126-gtyye7.html&title=Negotiate+with+Justin+Trudeau+for+r","http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.brisbanetimes.com.au%2Ffederal-politics%2Fpolitical-news%2Fnegotiate-with-justin-trudeau-for-refugee-resettlement-advocate-anne-horrigandixon-20170126-gtyye7.html&title=Negotiate+with+Jus","http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.brisbanetimes.com.au%2Ffederal-politics%2Fpolitical-news%2Fnegotiate-with-justin-trudeau-for-refugee-resettlement-advocate-anne-horrigandixon-20170126-gtyye7.html&title=Negotiate+with+Justin+Trudeau+for+re","https://www.facebook.com/tcmcilroy","https://www.facebook.com/PoliticsFairfax/","https://twitter.com/PoliticsFairfax","http://www.facebook.com/brisbanetimes","https://twitter.com/brisbanetimes"],"sequenceId":"695204441079","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T18:50:53Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:29:34Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/content/dam/images/g/t/z/y/b/u/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.gtyye7.png/1485672653203.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

The festival needs money to sign contracts with musicians for the event, which is scheduled to run from Sept. 29 to Oct. 1 in downtown Medford. \n \n\u201cWe need to reach that goal of $50,000 by March 1 to continue this festival,\u201d said Ramsden. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be sustained. We are looking for new, sustaining sponsors, businesses or individuals.\u201d \n \nTwo individuals who died had contributed the bulk of the money, while Providence Medford Medical Center had contributed $10,000. Ramsden declined to identify the individuals. \n \n\u201cThese were all loyal donors. They have been with us for years,\u201d said Ramsden. \u201cWe were going along fine, and all of a sudden you just get whacked. If anything, we are one of the outstanding festivals in the country.\u201d \n \nMusicians including Tom Rigney and Flambeau, Gator Nation and Bob Draga with Friends have appeared at the event several times. \n \n\u201cThe bands are basically on hold right now. They are doing everything they can to accommodate us,\u201d said Ramsden. \u201cI can\u2019t get them contracts now. There is a time element.\u201d \n \nRamsden plans to mail postcards to 5,000 people in the festival\u2019s database as part of the fundraising effort, and a professional fundraiser has volunteered her expertise, he said. \n \nRamsden said he is optimistic the effort will succeed. \n \n\u201cI\u2019ve been here long enough to know when something happens, the community gets involved,\u201d said Ramsden. \n \nMusician Larry Bernard and others started the event as the Medford Jazz Jubilee in October 1989, and it has been held annually since. Originally a Dixieland festival, the event now encompasses a broad range of music. It was renamed the Medford Jazz Festival in 2009 and became the Southern Oregon Music Festival in 2014. \n \nLast year, the festival sold 1,800 passes for events at five venues over three days, offering 100 hours of music from 15 bands. Passes range from single events to the entire festival, and sales were up from the previous year, Ramsden said, adding that about 60 percent of attendees come from out of town. \n \nAbout half the festival\u2019s budget comes from pass sales, while donations comprise the other half, said Ramsden. A portion of proceeds is used for educational programs. \n \nProvidence has been aligning fulfillment of sponsorship requests more closely with groups that support the organization\u2019s mission of health care, said Gary Walker, director of communications for Providence in Oregon. \n \nBased on a community assessment, groups that prioritize food and meals, access to care and homeless services have been funded. Providence\u2019s decision on funding was made locally, Walker said. \n \nNational Public Radio\u2019s eTown recently gave the festival an eChievement Award for its Leave a Legacy program, which makes used instruments available to students in Jackson and Josephine counties. The program was launched four years ago and has supplied 200 instruments. \n \nSince its start, the festival has contracted two bands to arrive a week early and give performances in primary and middle schools. Last year, 15,000 students heard the bands in 30 performances. \n \n\u2014 Tony Boom is an Ashland freelance writer.

When that happens, all the revenue above the forecast must be returned to taxpayers. There's also a corporate kicker, but the surplus generated by that kicker now goes to schools. \n \nIf the revenue comes in at 1.99999 percent higher than predicted, the state gets to keep it. But if it hits 2 percent, the entire amount is refunded. Taxpayers get a refund equal to the amount exceeding the forecast, so if it's 3 percent over, individual taxpayers would get 3 percent off their next tax bill. The state formerly sent out rebate checks but said it was more efficient and less expensive to connect the payments to the next tax bill rather than sending out checks by the hundreds of thousands. \n \nBut again, Max, the rebates occur only when revenues exceed the state economists' prediction by at least 2 percent. So if the economists predicted a 20 percent increase in revenues \u2014 not likely, by the way \u2014 and it came in under 22 percent, the state would get to keep it. \n \nThe reported $60.2 million in marijuana taxes could impact the likelihood of the kicker kicking. The refund announced in 2015 amounted to $402 million, which represented 3 percent more than what economists predicted. \n \nCritics of the kicker say that it is a faulty process, as circumstances can greatly change in the two years of the biennium, making those predictions a bit of a crapshoot. Kicker supporters say it is a way to keep state government from growing too fast and to keep more money in private hands. \n \nIf there is a kicker attached to the current biennium, it would be announced following the end of the biennium, which is July 31. The announcement usually occurs in August. \n \n\u2014 Send questions to \u201cSince You Asked,\u201d Mail Tribune Newsroom, P.O.

Ryan Zinke, R-Montana. The remark was met with cheers from the crowd. \n \nParker Thaler, senior specialist for the California State Water Resources Control Board's Water Quality Certification Program, provided the meeting's attendees with an overview of the history of the Klamath dams and the legal processes surrounding them over the past years. \n \nIn September 2016, the Klamath River Renewal Corporation \u2014 a then newly established 501(c)(3) nonprofit \u2014 jointly filed with PacifiCorp for a license transfer application that seeks to divide the Klamath hydroelectric project into two pieces: the Klamath Hydroelectric Project and the Lower Klamath Project. The KHP would consist of the East and West Side Powerhouses on the Link River, Keno Dam on the Klamath River and Fall Creek Dam on a tributary of the Klamath River. The LKP would include J.C. Boyle Dam, Copco 1 and 2 dams and Iron Gate Dam. \n \nIf the transfer application is approved, PacifiCorp would maintain ownership of the Klamath Hydroelectric Project, while the KRRC would take over the Lower Klamath Project. The application is pending before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. \n \nKRRC also filed a license-surrender application with FERC that seeks to decommission sufficient portions of the Lower Klamath Project, with the goal of creating a free-flowing Klamath River and volitional fish passage. According to the Yreka Fish and Wildlife Office, \"Volitional means that fish will be migrating around a dam through an upstream fish ladder or downstream bypass system as opposed to being trapped and hauled around the dam or attempting to move through hydropower turbines where many would be killed.\" \n \nSpeakers at Thursday's meeting largely were in favor of keeping the dams in place, including those who said removing the dams would cause the Klamath to become muddy and smelly during the summer because they believe removal would significantly decrease the river's flow during that time. In that same vein, concern that the river would flood in colder months was also mentioned numerous times. \n \nMany farmers and ranchers spoke in favor of the dams, tying them to the livelihood they have enjoyed in the agricultural industry. \n \nSami Jo Difuntorum spoke on behalf of the Shasta Nation, posing the hypothetical that the tribe's ancestors who are buried along the river would be washed away by potential flooding if dam removal occurred. \n \nSeveral Copco Lake residents expressed concern for their safety, views and property values if the dams come out. The 2014 Copco fire was mentioned repeatedly. Residents noted that water had been drawn from the lake to protect their homes and hoped the dams would stay in, allowing the lake to continue to be used as a fire protection resource. \n \nThose who voiced support for dam removal included members of the Yurok tribe, who believe that removing the dams will restore the Klamath's Salmon population, an important resource for their people. \n \nKonrad Fisher, executive director of Klamath Riverkeeper, an organization in favor of dam removal, said that he believed that people on both sides of the dam argument wanted the same things, but disagreed about the way to obtain them. He praised the SWRCB's actions thus far, and voiced support for the science it had used. \n \nThe SWRCB will be taking comments on the matter through 5 p.m. Wednesday, Feb. 1. Written comments can be emailed to WR401program@waterboards.ca.gov.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Danielle Jester Siskiyou Daily News"},"topics":[{"name":"Energy industry news","group":"Industry"}],"title":"Yreka meeting attendees say no to dam removal","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Jackson","zipCode":"97501","state":"Oregon","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Medford","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Medford Mail Tribune","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169687916","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2404"},"name":"Medford Mail Tribune","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.mailtribune.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204443519","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T04:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:29:32Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Celebrations traditionally run from the evening preceding the first day, to the Lantern Festival on the 15th day of the first calendar month.\n\nThis year, the first day of the Chinese lunar new year falls on Jan. 28, initiating the year of the Rooster, based on the Chinese zodiac. The Chinese zodiac assigns an animal to each year of a 12-year cycle, beginning with rat and continuing through ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, goat, monkey, rooster, dog and finally pig.\n\nOn Jan. 28, the first day of the Chinese Lunar New Year, the Chinatown in Yokohama, capital city of eastern Japan's Kanagawa prefecture, was filled with festival atmosphere. Tens of thousands of visitors came to Yokohama Chinatown, the largest Chinese communities in Japan, to feel the festive atmosphere.\n\nWith red lanterns and flags hung high on the Chinese-styled buildings along the streets, the whole area of the Chinatown is adorned in red and gold banners theming happiness, wealth and good luck, and is alive with people from all parts of the world.\n\nThere are a series of special events in Yokohama's Chinatown to celebrate the New Year until March started with lion dance.\n\nThe \"lions\" performed Cai Qing, which literally means \"picking the greens\" in Chinese. With a history of hundreds of years and as a tradition in China during the lunar new year, Cai Qing is a ritual in which lion dancers overcome obstacles to get a bunch of green vegetables which comes with a red packet.\n\nThe \"lions\" danced in front of and inside the shops and restaurants alongside the Chinatown to pray for prosperity and drive away the evil spirits.\n\nThe \"greens\" used to be vegetables hung in or outside shops, but nowadays they are red envelopes within which is a payment to the lion dancers. Cai Qing supposedly brings good luck and fortune to the business and the dancers receive the money in the envelop as payment.\n\nThe \"lion\" collected the envelopes in its mouth and swallowed them down. Firecrackers were set off and the crowd erupted in applause amidst the smoke and merriment.\n\nThe event drew lots of visitors and many of them said it's a fun and amazing scene.\n\n\"It was very good. We don't know anything like this in England. So it's a privilege to see,\" Charlotte, a British visitor to Japan told Xinhua.\n\nAnother British visitor, Francis, told Xinhua that, \"It was very interesting. Some of the movements, like in and out of the shop, different... We are visiting Japan. we realize it is the Chinese New Year and there will be a festival here. We thought we should come and check it out. \"\n\nLocal people were also fascinated by the performance. \"This is my first time to watch the show and I was very surprised. It was very lively and the sound of the firecrackers really surprised me. It was very good, \" a Yokohama resident told Xinhua.\n\nChinese Student of Waseda University, Xiao Yi, told Xinhua that, \"This place is filled with festive atmosphere. I come with a bunch of my classmates...I brought my Japanese classmates here to introduce our Chinese culture.\"\n\n\"I like Chinese food the most and I like China very much. Compared with the quietness in European countries, I like Chinese festivals better as they are livelier, \" said a Japanese student of Waseda University.\n\nIn the town of Hakone, a popular sightseeing spot situated in the southwestern part of Kanagawa prefecture, a Japanese shop adopted the Chinese custom of giving lucky money, an old tradition during the Spring Festival. The shop gave every Chinese customer five yen as lucky money to wish them good fortune, as the pronunciation of five yen in Japanese means fate with good luck.\n\nIn central Japan's Nagoya, a three-day celebration for the Spring Festival was carried out earlier this month.\n\nThe celebration was held on Hisaya Square in downtown Nagoya, where red lanterns and flags hung high, and people cheered and smiled, creating a festival atmosphere.\n\nA number of Chinese artists gave shows on a spectacular stage set up at one end of the square, including facechanging stunt of Sichuan opera, acrobatics and lion dances.\n\nPeople also lined up before the dozens of booths around the square which sold traditional Chinese cuisine, including dumplings, candy gourds and others.\n\nA number of exhibitions were also held on the square, including a show featuring photos of Chinese scenery shot by Japanese photographers.\n\n\"The three-day festival is expected to attract a total of some 120,000 visitors this year, including overseas Chinese, as well as Japanese citizens and tourists from other countries,\" said Wang Libao, a member of the executive committee of the Spring Festival celebration.\n\nThe celebration has also become a grand event for the local people. \"The yearly Spring Festival celebration in Nagoya has helped promoting understanding between Chinese and Japanese people and livening up local economy,\" said Hideaki Ohmura, Governor of Aichi Prefecture of Japan.\n\nHe also said that Aichi prefecture, with Nagoya as its capital, has a rather close relationship with China, with nine of its cities having sister cities in China, and tens of thousands of Chinese living in the prefecture.\n\n\"This year marks the 45th anniversary of the normalization of China-Japan diplomatic relations, and next year marks the 40th anniversary of the Treaty of Peace and Friendship between China and Japan. The two countries now are facing new opportunities for enhancing bilateral ties, \" said Cheng Yonghua, Chinese Ambassador to Japan.\n\n\"I hope that cultural exchanges such as spring festival celebrations in Japan, will flourish and make new contributions to improving bilateral relations,\" he added.\n\nOverseas Chinese have been holding Chinese Lunar New Year celebrations in Nagoya since 2007. The celebration has become an important platform for local people to learn more about Chinese culture and for promoting mutual understanding and cultural exchanges between central Japan and China.

He hit 12 of 18 field-goal attempts and 8 of 16 free-throw attempts and added six rebounds and three assists. \n\nBronson Koenig added 10, four on free throws in the overtime, but made just 2 of 10 3-pointers and 2 of 13 shots overall. \n\nUW made 3 of 25 3-point attempts (12.5 percent) and 20 of 60 shots overall (33.3 percent). \n\nNigel Hayes added seven points, a game-high 11 rebounds and four assists. He had five points in the overtime, as well as an assist on a basket by Happ. \n\nThe Badgers (18-3, 7-1 Big Ten) continued their run through the league with their fifth consecutive victory since suffering an 11-point loss Jan. 8 at Purdue. \n\nUW won for the 14th time in the last 15 games overall and improved to 6-3 away from the Kohl Center this season (3-1 neutral site, 3-2 road). \n\nGuards Corey Sanders and Nigel Johnson scored 15 and 13 points, respectively, for Rutgers. \n\nRutgers, which suffered a 20-point loss to UW in Madison, saw its record fall to 1-8 in the league and 12-10 overall. \n\nThe Scarlet Knights entered the day as the Big Ten's worst shooting team in league play but the Badgers appeared determined to steal that title. \n\nThe Badgers, shooting 40.2 percent from 3-point range and 46.4 percent overall in Big Ten play, looked as if they hadn't practiced shooting for weeks. \n\nThey made 1 of 13 3-pointers (8.3 percent), 5 of 25 shots overall (20 percent) and went the last 10:36 of the half without a field goal. \n\nKoenig was 0 of 5 from 3-point range and 0 of 6 overall. Vitto Brown was 0 of 2 from 3-point range and 0 of 4 overall. Hayes was 0 of 2, leaving the trio a combined 0 of 10 for the half. \n\nIf not for the early burst of Happ, who scored 10 of his 11 points in the first 4:15, UW's deficit would have been greater than five points. \n\nUW missed its last 12 field goal attempts of the half and lost the battle for points in the paint, 14-8 to Rutgers. \n\nThe Badgers missed their first six shots of the second half before Happ scored inside, with 16:44 left. \n\nThat ended UW's run of misses at 18 in a row and a span of 13:52. \n\nOuch.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"JEFF POTRYKUSMilwaukee Journal Sentinel"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: US college sports news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest scores","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Happ helps Wisconsin escape Rutgers in OT, 61-54","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Fayette","zipCode":"40507","state":"Kentucky","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Lexington","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Kentucky.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169658700","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4463"},"name":"Kentucky.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.kentucky.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204456262","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:29:41Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Without funds for an attorney, I accepted deferred probation. It has followed me my entire life. \n \nI graduated from college, law, and graduate school, yet I had to endure a hearing to ascertain my fitness to practice. It also caused employment rejection. \n \nLater, as assistant county attorney in El Paso, and elected district attorney in Willacy County, I routinely dismissed pot cases. Prosecutor\u2019s offices have limited budgets, yet mountains of cases. Dismissing marijuana offenses, allowed me to send more dangerous criminals to prison. \n \nEven probation for pot was wasteful. Curfews and reporting requirements should be for prowlers and burglars, not pot smokers. \n \nThis problem persists, as 620,000 Americans were arrested for pot last year. Yes, illegal marijuana creates jobs for probation officers, prosecutors, bailiffs, chemists, clerical staff and many more; however taxpayers get soaked. \n \nCalifornia and three other states legalized marijuana on Nov. 8. Voters were persuaded by the Colorado experience, where $2.4 billion in revenues and 17,000 jobs were created in legalization\u2019s first year. Some of this boom comes from visiting Texans. \n \nThe Denver Post polled, \u201cWould you repeal legalization?\u201d The answer; \u201cNo\u201d, by a 51 percent to 36 percent margin. Gallup\u2019s 2016 poll showed support for legalization has grown to 60 percent nationally, and recent studies demonstrate no increased use among youngsters since legalization. Colorado is booming, and other states want what they\u2019re smoking. \n \nThe old \u201cReefer Madness\u201d arguments against marijuana have been dispelled. Today\u2019s legalization opponents such as Insys Therapeutics, which develops synthetic painkillers, poured $500,000 into the \u201cNo\u201d vote in Arizona. It\u2019s these legal painkillers which cause so much addiction and harm. \n \nPrescription drugs increase our health costs and Big Pharma doesn\u2019t want competition. The Catholic Church was also a huge contributor, with the Boston Archdiocese donating $850,000 to oppose Massachusetts\u2019 marijuana initiative. \n \nOne lingering anti-pot argument is that people will ingest and drive. This happens anyway and it will be illegal everywhere. \n \nNot satisfied, opponents wonder how they will test for marijuana. Field tests still work, but how about we just arm each officer with a chocolate bar, and they could cuff the stoned drivers as they grab for it. \n \nLegalization will come eventually, as it\u2019s only the oldest age groups who are opposed. \n \nAn estimated 15 million Americans use marijuana regularly, and about half our population has admitted trying marijuana. \n \nMarijuana decriminalization bills for the 2017 Texas Legislature, have been filed, including one by El Paso\u2019s own Joe Moody. \n \nRepublicans are increasingly in favor, because of the fiscal benefits and individual freedom arguments. Democrats are already there, and almost everyone wants to decrease the power of the violent drug cartels who smuggle pot across our border. \n \nLet\u2019s legalize it, and have Mexico put up the wall to keep Texans from trafficking marijuana into their country. \n \nEl Paso attorney Steve Fischer has been a professor of criminology and a Texas State Bar director.

TE  \u2013   O.J. Howard , Alabama  \u2013  Arguably the top prospect on either team at any position, Howard is blessed with tight end size and wide receiver speed. Athletically he\u2019s as good of a prospect as one will ever scout at the position. At 250 pounds, he\u2019s still thin for his 6-foot-5½  frame, but he holds his own in run blocking. Watching Howard jump offsides and have an easy drop makes one question his focus at times, but that\u2019s nitpicking when trying to decide just how high he should go in the first round.  \n \n2. OT/G \u2013 Forrest Lamp , Western Kentucky \u2013 An injury on Day 1 limited him the rest of the week, which is a shame because we would have loved to have seen more of him. What he showed in that short time, however, was impressive. There might be some concern about his size playing left tackle \u2013 he\u2019s just under 6-4 and 305 pounds \u2013 but he passed the test on the first day in pass protection. When he gets locked onto a defender, they don\u2019t get away. He was beaten once with a swim move. He\u2019s considered an early-round pick for good reason, but it will be interesting to see if he ends up at tackle or guard. \n \n3. OT \u2013 Conor McDermott , UCLA \u2013 He is on the other end from Lamp. While Lamp is on the shorter end of offensive tackles in the NFL, McDermott is on the taller end at 6-8, 305 pounds, but he can still move. He does a good job of keeping his hands inside and riding pass-rushing defensive ends wide of their target \u2013 a lot of defensive ends seemed to end up on the ground by getting off-balance and too wide against him. He might need to improve his foot quickness some and be careful not to set too wide, as he got beat at least once by an edge rusher setting him up outside and beating him inside. \n \nhttp://www.scout.com/nfl/story/1748877-senior-bowl-south-weigh-ins-measu... \n \n4. G/C \u2013 Jon Toth , Kentucky \u2013 Other interior linemen came in rated higher than him by analysts, but we like what we saw. Is he a guard or a center? He actually looked more comfortable at guard, where he can anchor down against power defenders and hold his own on most occasions. He\u2019s good at sliding down the line, so we could see him being an effective pulling guard at the next level. He always seems to be in position, but has to be careful about getting beat by quick swim moves. \n \n5. WR  \u2013   Artavis Scott , Clemson  \u2013  Scott has the dimensions of a slot receiver at 5-10¼ and 194 pounds. He\u2019s strong enough to take the ball inside, but he has the body control to play outside and uses his body to play much bigger. He comes in and out of his breaks quickly and catches everything near him. Not a No. 1, but an ideal No. 2 or No. 3.  \n \n6. QB  \u2013   Josh Dobbs , Tennessee  \u2013  Blessed with the best combination of size, arm strength, and athleticism, Dobbs made all of the necessary throws. He was plagued by interceptions at Tennessee, and that\u2019s going to be a concern for whoever drafts him, but in this setting he was the top quarterback prospect on either team.  \n \n7. G \u2013 Antonio Garcia , Troy \u2013 He grew on us as the week progressed. On Day 1, he seemed to lunge and lose his balance too much, but he appeared quicker off the snap and more in control as practices continued throughout the week. He has a good anchor, can move defenders off the line in the running game and follows the action. He may not make the projection of a Day 2 pick in the draft, but he should be able to develop into a solid guard for years in the NFL. \n \n8. WR - Chad Willliams, Grambling State  \u2013  At 6-0½ and 204 pounds, Williams is a strong, physical receiver ever who helped his draft stock as much as anyone in attendance. Williams not only held his own against \u201cbig-school\u201d defensive backs, he flourished. Williams showed an extra gear with the ball in his hands that led the coaching staff to try and get it to him on reverses and quick hitters.  \n \n9. WR  \u2013   Josh Reynolds , Texas A&M  \u2013  Reynolds is 6-2¾ which gives him a height advantage in this crowd. He takes advantage of it with his ability to elevate. Reynolds had an early drop in the week, but shook it off to have a productive showing and seemed to form a nice combination with quarterback Josh Dobbs. \n \n10. TE -  Evan Engram , Ole Miss - Engram is a bit of a tweener for the NFL tight end position, but he was being used out of the backfield as an h-back as well as tight end. Looking for comparisons on the field, Engram's game shows a lot of similarities to former fourth round pick of the New England Patriots. Hernandez was 6'2 and 245 pounds at the NFL Combine, and Engram 6'3 1/18\" and 236 pounds at the Senior Bowl and should weigh in over 240 at the combine. Engram has the size to bully safeties and the quickness to run around linebackers. He's a serviceable blocker, which is all a team will need when one considers his plus skills in the pass happy NFL. \n \nScott Kennedy contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: American football news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: NFL news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Best of the Senior Bowl: Top 10 South OffenseSome of the skill positions might be lacking in depth, but there was one standout there and several good linemen to choose from on the Senior Bowl\u2019s South squad offense.by Tim YotterScout NFL NetworkFriday at 5","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Travis","zipCode":"78759","state":"Texas","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Austin","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Nevada Insider","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"170881350","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Nevada Insider","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["AmericanFootball","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.nevada.scout.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204463782","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:29:42Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

NT - Stevie Tu'ikolovatu , USC  - We asked Tu'ikolovatu how what the key is to anchor down in the middle and keep double teams from moving him back too far. He wasn't sure how he does it, but we have a pretty good idea - he's a powerful 6-foot-1, 350 pounds. That helps. But don't think about the big uglies with the massive guts. He's built solid and strong and loves to trash talk \u2026 then smile about it. He was incredibly consistent from day to day, making big plays in the running game, even when he was double-teamed. Some draft analysts had him as a late-round pick prior to Senior Bowl week, but his stock should be rising.  \n \nhttp://www.scout.com/nfl/story/1749495-best-of-the-senior-bowl-top-10-so... \n \n2. DE -   Chris Wormley , Michigan  - An ideal blend of size (6-foot-5½, 297) and speed for an NFL defensive end in a 4-3 system, nobody displayed better and more consistent pass-rushing speed in Mobile this week than Wormley. He's quick off the snap, good at splitting double teams and can get to the quarterback. He also has one of the biggest wingspans among Senior Bowl players. \n \n3. CB - Rasul Douglas , West Virginia  - At 6'2 and 204 pounds, Douglas has the size at corner that NFL general managers crave. Because he moved so well in drills, Douglas didn't seem to be that big. he moved like a 5'10 corner with a lower center of gravity. He is incredibly physical and uses his hands well in press and to knock away a ball. The biggest knock on him has been his health, but out at Senior Bowl practice, Douglas looked healthy, and terrific \n \n4. Safety - John Johnson  , Boston College   - When watching the defensive backs go through drills, Johnson had a different gait with his back pedal, turn and run; he glides. He could visibly accelerate in his backpedal, and there was no wasted motion when he would flip his hips and run deep. Johnson checked in at 6'0 5/8\" and 205 pounds. He has the skills to play corner in some schemes, but he can also drop right in and play free safety in the NFL. When the practices went to seven on seven or full scrimmage situation, Johnson was as solid in coverage as he looked in drills. He was the best looking safety on either team. \n \n5. CB -  Desmond King ,  Iowa  - At 5'10 1/8\" and 206 pounds, King doesn't have the height that Douglas does at corner, but he still has plenty of size and strength packed into that frame. The most fundamentally sound of the corners for the North, King had great technique. He might be the most ready of the defensive backs to step in right away in the NFL.  \n \n6. OLB - Haasan Reddick,  Temple - Reddick immediately caught our eyes during drills because of his athleticism. Checking the roster, he was listed at 6'1 and 230 pounds, standing eye to eye with Michigan's Ben Gedeon who was listed 6'3 and 247. Something didn't measure up. When the official heights and weights were released, Reddick was 6'1.5 and 237 pounds, while Gedeon was 6'1 5/8\" and 243 pounds. That's more like it. Reddick's athleticism in agility drills translated to production on the field as he was the North's best pass rusher from the linebacker spot, and he was good in coverage as well. While not blessed with proto-type height, Reddick has plenty big enough, and has plus athleticism. \n \n7. CB - Jourdan Lewis ,  Michigan   - At 5'10 and 188 pounds, Lewis plays much bigger than that because he's so physical at the line of scrimmage. Lewis didn't look as comfortable in his turn and release as other defenders like Douglas and King, but he jammed receivers at the line as well or better than either of the two corners who had roughly twenty pounds on him. Ideally suited for a press and release type of scheme or to drop into the slot to cover shorter, quicker receivers in tight spaces. Lewis is a disrupter more than a smooth outside cover man. \n \n8. ILB - Ben Gedeon ,  Michigan   - Yes, there was a lot of Wolverine representation on the North Defense. Michigan didn't finish No. 1 in the nation in total defense for nothing. Gedeon (6'1 5/8\" / 247) was a standout against the run in all three days of practice. He's strong and physical with good instincts. He struggled at times on his pass rush drills, but he may be best suited as a two down inside linebacker who goes to the sidelines in passing situations anyway. \n \n9. DT -  Jaleel Johnson , Iowa  - Considered a Day 2 pick, we're not sure he's going that high. He didn't display a lot of great pass-rushing moves, but he has a knack for following and getting to the action. He would struggle during one on one drills, and then he'd live in the backfield during the scrimmages. He seems to get penetration by finding the right angle rather than a big array of moves, but there have been plenty of smart players to overcome potential athletic limitations. \n \n10. OLB - Carroll Phillips , Illinois  - Phillips checked in at 6'3 1/4\" and 237 pounds and was a standout on the pass rush. With good length and quickness Phillips was using quickness to beat offensive linemen and tight ends for sacks in both drills and scrimmage situations. \n \nTim Yotter contributed to this report","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: American football news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: NFL news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Best of the Senior Bowl: Top 10 North DefenseScout takes a look at the Top 10 defensive prospects from North squad at the Senior Bowl.by Scott KennedyScout NFL NetworkFriday at 6:45 AM","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Travis","zipCode":"78759","state":"Texas","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Austin","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Nevada Insider","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"170881350","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Nevada Insider","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["AmericanFootball","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.nevada.scout.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://bleacherreport.com/mobile","http://www.twitter.com/ScoutKennedy"],"sequenceId":"695204464117","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:29:42Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

From Somalia, to her last home in India, and now Texas, the state that abuts another Trump target: Mexico.\n\nMr Haraco, secretary of the Somali Australian Council of Victoria, doesn't know if he should book tickets or wait to see what unfolds when the 90-day period ends.\n\nWill the ban continue? When will he see his elderly mother-in-law again? She is over 70 now; he doesn't want to leave it too long.\n\nConfusion and concern among immigrants and refugee advocates has been widespread, with travellers detained or sent home from US airports.\n\nThere is confusion, too, among the young men that Mr Haraco has brought down to the ocean to mull over the qualities of a leader.\n\nSome have talked about finding it difficult to get a job in Melbourne because of the colour of their skin, or their religion.\n\nThe group also discussed gangs, and young people they know who are dropping out of school, drawn to these groups.\n\nBut the bigger purpose was to inspire them, says council member Abdi Aziz, and he remains convinced that Trump's ruling won't quash their enthusiasm for multiculturalism.\n\n\"Diversity is mainstream in Australia \u2026 but the risk is there. For us it's an important time for our Prime Minister to show political leadership in this area.\"\n\nMany people he had spoken to that morning were feeling a sense of loss, he said.

The only thing preventing a bigger afternoon was the scoreboard. Ryan had 271 yards by halftime and 343 yards after the first drive of the third quarter. \n \nThe Packers\u2019 shoddy pass defense started with Sam Shields\u2019 concussion in Week 1. Shields, who spent the rest of the season on injured reserve, was at the Georgia Dome. \n \nHe said he\u2019s still dealing with the aftereffects of that concussion \u2013 the fourth of his professional career. \n \n\u201cSome days it\u2019s tough headaches, some days it\u2019s mild,\u201d Shields said in the bowels of the Georgia Dome near the Packers\u2019 locker room after the game. \u201cIt varies. I never know. I\u2019m so used to it that it\u2019s just normal. Each day it\u2019s getting better.

But I\u2019m going through this, what I\u2019ve got to go through. Just take it one day at a time.\u201d \n \nWhy risk himself and the possibility of another serious head injury? \n \n\u201cI understand why you ask that,\u201d Shields said. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I just love the game, man, and I feel that I can get back out there and play. If not, then not. But right now it\u2019s just day by day.\u201d \n \nShields is under contract with the Packers through next season. He carries a salary-cap charge of $12.125 million \u2013 a huge figure given the concussion history. If the Packers were to release him, they\u2019d save $9 million of base salary and roster bonuses. \n \nBill Huber is publisher of PackerReport.com and has written for Packer Report since 1997.

During the first half on Sunday, they didn't make any against the Atlanta Falcons. \n \nATLANTA \u2013 The Green Bay Packers got blown out by the Atlanta Falcons, 44-21, in Sunday\u2019s NFC Championship Game. \n \nAnd yet, there was a feeling of what might have been. \n \nThe Packers had chances to make some momentum-changing plays. They just didn\u2019t make any of them. Those are the type of plays that championship teams made, and the Falcons made them to advance to the Super Bowl against New England. \n \n\u201cWe didn\u2019t. That\u2019s the fact of the matter,\u201d coach Mike McCarthy said. \u201cBut we feel confident, with our offense, with Aaron Rodgers, that we can go, we can score with anybody. We needed to do that today and we didn\u2019t get that done.\u201d \n \nThe Falcons finished with 493 yards, including 325 in the first half, when they rolled to a 24-0 lead. But it\u2019s worth wondering: \n \nWhat would have happened had Mason Crosby not missed a field goal, which would have cut the deficit to 7-3? Crosby had made an NFL playoff-record 23 consecutive field goals, including the 56- and 51-yarders to beat Dallas last week. \n \n\u201cMy job is to make that kick and get us points there on the first drive,\u201d Crosby said. \u201cI feel sick about it. I wish I would've hit that through. I had a great year. This team had such a great run. Obviously, it hurts.\u201d \n \nWhat would have happened had fullback Aaron Ripkowski not fumbled around the Falcons\u2019 10-yard line and the Packers in position to cut the deficit to 10-7? \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s a big momentum swing,\u201d Ripkowski said. \u201cYou never want to turn the ball over and that was really tough for us to bounce back from. I don\u2019t know exactly what happen. If I had to guess it was just a double wrap by the defensive back. He got his hands in there and got it out. We\u2019ll go in, watch the film and figure out what happened.\u201d \n \nWhat would have happened had linebacker Jake Ryan pounced on a botched trick play in which receiver Taylor Gabriel fumbled at the Falcons\u2019 40? With a 17-0 deficit, the Packers would have been in position to get on the scoreboard. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating, you know?\u201d Ryan said. \u201cI was almost there but the ball is 20 inches and it bounces in different ways. Stuff like that happens but you\u2019ve got to execute when you get those opportunities. When you get them, you\u2019ve got to \u2026 You\u2019ve got to create turnovers.\u201d \n \nWhat would have happened had either safety Marwin Evans or cornerback LaDarius Gunter come up with interceptions on the Falcons\u2019 final drive? That possession ended with Matt Ryan\u2019s third-and-1 touchdown pass to Julio Jones that made it 24-0 at halftime. \n \n\u201cIt just wasn\u2019t happening for us today,\u201d linebacker Julius Peppers said of the missed opportunities. \u201cToday just wasn\u2019t our day at all.\u201d \n \nNot at all. The Packers, so resilient during their eight-game winning streak, couldn\u2019t withstand the Falcons\u2019 assault. The Packers, who dominated the turnover ledger at plus-16 during that late-season surge, were minus-2 on Sunday. \n \n\u201cWe just played a hot team. You\u2019ve got to give them credit,\u201d quarterback Aaron Rodgers said. \u201cMatt (Ryan is) playing incredible right now, and that\u2019s a pretty good offense. Their defense played really well last week and did some good things today. I feel like we kind of hurt ourselves in the first half more than they really stopped us but, no, they have a good football team. There\u2019s a reason they\u2019re moving on to the Super Bowl. They\u2019re going to be tough to stop.\u201d \n \nBill Huber is publisher of PackerReport.com and has written for Packer Report since 1997.

Going in numerical order, the Packers lost safety Kentrell Brice, nickelback Micah Hyde, linebacker Jake Ryan, guards Lane Taylor and T.J. Lang, right tackle Bryan Bulaga and running back Ty Montgomery. The Packers only had seven offensive linemen active. Without Taylor, Lang and Bulaga, the Packers turned to defensive tackle Letroy Guion to play right guard on the final series. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s never easy to watch your players get injured, especially if it\u2019s in a serious nature,\u201d Packers coach Mike McCarthy said. \u201cFrankly, I\u2019m a little numb to it. This is kind of how we\u2019ve had to deal with it, we\u2019ve been able to overcome it. Today we could not. Today we couldn\u2019t overcome the pace that these guys were playing at. They played lights out and it got away from us. You have to overcome all those things when you compete in these big games.\u201d \n \nNelson overcame his broken ribs to catch six passes for 67 yards and one touchdown. He wore padding to protect the injury. \n \n\u201cEveryone\u2019s banged up right now,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cWe needed everyone out there, so everyone did their job to get healthy enough to go play. That\u2019s what we tried to go out and do; we just didn\u2019t execute well enough.\u201d \n \nAfter the Falcons drove to an opening touchdown, Nelson had receptions of 27 and 15 yards and Adams, who clearly was slowed by an injured ankle, caught a pass for a gain of 6. The drive bogged down \u2013 Nelson was livid that Falcons cornerback Robert Alford was not flagged for defensive holding on a third-down incompletion \u2013 and Mason Crosby missed a 41-yard field goal. The Falcons drove to another field goal to make it 10-0 and the rout was on. \n \nNelson\u2019s touchdown, a 3-yarder late in the third quarter, made it 37-15. \n \n\u201cI\u2019m so proud of Jordy. It\u2019s incredible that he was out there,\u201d Rodgers said. \n \nAdams wasn\u2019t nearly as productive. That he wasn\u2019t himself was evident during warmups. He caught two passes for 8 yards, including Green Bay\u2019s first touchdown. \n \n\u201cIt felt pretty bad all game,\u201d Adams said, \u201cbut I did what I had to do to try and put this team in a position to win and be successful and be out there with my teammates.\u201d \n \nBrice, who enters in the dime package, suffered a shoulder injury on the opening kickoff. Most of the injuries, however, came after the Falcons had seized control. Taylor, the team\u2019s right guard, injured a knee with less than 3 minutes left in the first half. Hyde was not on the field for Atlanta\u2019s final drive of the first half due to an injured shoulder. Ryan (shoulder) and Montgomery (ribs) were injured early in the third quarter. Lang re-injured his broken left foot late in the third quarter. Bulaga was being evaluated for a concussion late in the game. \n \n\u201cIt never fully healed in the first place,\u201d Lang said. \u201cThe past month, I kept aggravating it a couple times. \u2026 I never really gave it the time to completely heal. The past six, seven games, it\u2019s been hurting pretty bad but good enough where I could play. Today just set me back all the way to the beginning. Obviously, that doesn\u2019t help on top of the loss. I\u2019ve played through a lot of stuff before and I\u2019ll be OK.\u201d \n \nWhether that will be with Green Bay remains to be seen. Hyde and Lang will be free agents at season\u2019s end. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s a tough day, physically and emotionally,\u201d Lang said. \u201cA lot of thoughts going through my head. Proud of the way this team fought, though. We were down in the dumps after 10 games but sticking together, fighting, pulling off an incredible run and getting to this point, you can\u2019t ignore that. It\u2019s disappointing the way today ended and the season ended. It\u2019s just tough. Tough.\u201d \n \nBill Huber is publisher of PackerReport.com and has written for Packer Report since 1997.

The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the official wasn't authorized to publicly discuss details of the matter. \n\nTrump's order Friday barred citizens of seven Muslim-majority nations from entering the United States for 90 days. That meant that even those with permanent residency \"green cards\" or other visas risked not being let back in to the United States. \n\nHowever, the official said all green card holders from the seven countries who sought to enter the U.S. Saturday were granted special permission. \n\nIt's not clear if other green card holders will be admitted. The official said cases are being reviewed individually. \n\n\u2014 Alicia Caldwell \n\n--- \n\n9:40 p.m. \n\nA federal judge in New York has issued an emergency order temporarily barring the U.S. from deporting people from nations subject to President Donald Trump's travel ban. \n\nU.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly issued the order Saturday evening after lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union filed a court petition on behalf of people from seven predominantly Muslim nations who were detained at airports across the country as the ban took effect. \n\nCheers broke out in a crowd of demonstrators outside a Brooklyn courthouse as the decision, effective nationwide, was announced. \n\nThe order barred U.S. border agents from removing anyone who arrived in the U.S. with a valid visa from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nIt also covered anyone with an approved refugee application. \n\nIt was unclear how quickly the order might affect people in detention. \n\n--- \n\n7 p.m. \n\nNew York City's Kennedy Airport became a scene of anguish Saturday for relatives of people detained after arriving in the U.S. from nations subject to President Donald Trump's travel ban. \n\nLawyers and advocates working at the airport say they didn't have a hard count on the number of people taken into custody after getting off their flights. \n\nYosre Ghaled was among about a dozen distraught people waiting at a terminal Saturday to see if loved ones would be released or deported. \n\nShe says her mother-in-law's sister had been detained. \n\nThe 67-year-old Yemeni citizen had flown to the U.S. to live with family because she is sick from heart problems and diabetes. \n\nTwo members of congress joined hundreds of protesters at the airport, demonstrating against the detentions. \n\n--- \n\n1 a.m. \n\nThe government of Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto is taking exception to the Israeli prime minister's praise of a border wall to keep out illegal immigration. \n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Twitter Saturday that \"President Trump is right\" for building a wall. \n\n\"I built a wall along Israel's southern border,\" he wrote. \"It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea.\" \n\nMexico's Foreign Ministry said in a communique that it had expressed its \"profound surprise, rejection and disappointment in the prime minister's message on Twitter\" to Israel's ambassador. \"Mexico is Israel's friend and should be treated as such.\" \n\n---- \n\n12:20 a.m. \n\nPresident Donald Trump says his crackdown on refugees and citizens from seven majority-Muslim countries \"is not a Muslim ban.\" \n\nA day after signing an executive order implementing the ban immediately, Trump says it's \"working out very nicely.\" \n\nBut confusion, worry and outrage boiled over Saturday as airlines blocked people from traveling to the United States and legal challenges were mounted. \n\nIncluded is a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. The U.S. refugee program is suspended for 120-days. \n\nTrump's order imposed the most aggressive ban on Syrians, indefinitely blocking entry to the U.S. by anyone from that country, including those fleeing civil war. \n\n--- \n\n12:10 a.m. \n\nAirlines around the world are turning away passengers, refunding tickets and rebooking flights in the aftermath of President Donald Trump's immigration order. \n\nThe order signed Friday included a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen. It also suspended the U.S. refugee program for four months. \n\nThat forced airlines to tell some customers they couldn't proceed on flights to the U.S. \n\nDubai-based Emirates said a small number of its passengers were affected Saturday, and it was helping them rebook. Delta Air Lines and British Airways both said they were offering refunds for passengers who couldn't complete their trips. \n\nSeveral airlines, including Qatar Airways, posted travel alerts on their websites warning customers about the changes. \n\n---- \n\n11:50 p.m. \n\nIn Tehran, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif says his country's decision to not issue give Americans visas will not be retroactive. \n\nZarif says on Twitter: \"Unlike the U.S., our decision is not retroactive. All with valid Iranian visa will be gladly welcomed.\" \n\nU.S. visa restrictions that took effect on Saturday for people from several countries, including Iran, ban travel even for those who already had American visas. \n\n---- \n\n11:20 p.m. \n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has a message for refugees rejected by U.S. President Donald Trump: Canada will take you. \n\nTrudeau tweeted Saturday \"To those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada .\" \n\nTrudeau also tweeted a picture of him greeting a Syrian child at Toronto's airport. \n\nTrudeau oversaw the arrival of more than 39,000 Syrian refugees soon after he was elected in late 2015. \n\nThe young prime minister has been reluctant to criticize President Donald Trump. His government has been trying to balance his liberal view of the world while not offending the new Trump administration. \n\nMore than 75 percent of Canada's exports are to the U.S. \n\n--- \n\n10:20 p.m. \n\nAn Iraqi who was detained overnight at a New York City airport because of President Donald Trump's ban on refugees from certain Muslim nations has called America \"the land of freedom\" after being released from custody. \n\nHameed Khalid Darweesh worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Army when it invaded Iraq in 2003. Later he was a contract engineer for the U.S. \n\nHe was granted permission to relocate to the U.S., but was detained along with another traveler from Iraq after arriving at John F. Kennedy Airport Friday night. \n\nLawyers petitioned a federal court early Saturday to let them go. Two Democratic U.S. Representatives, Nydia Velazquez and Jerrold Nalder, were at the airport trying to get 11 other detainees released. \n\nAfter he was freed Saturday, Darweesh told a waiting crowd that \"America is the greatest nation, the greatest people in the world.\" \n\n--- \n\n9:50 p.m. \n\nIn Somalia, people are reacting with dismay and warnings that countries could retaliate against the United States' new immigration and visa policies with restrictive policies of their own. \n\n\"I am shocked beyond words. This will mean that my new husband will never be able to join me in the U.S.,\" said Fatima Ashkir, a Somali-American woman from Florida who came to Mogadishu to marry her Somali boyfriend. \n\nOthers say they are not surprised at President Donald Trump's executive order imposing a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Somalia. \n\n\"His intentions of hurting rather than to help were clear from the very beginning,\" said Ahmed Abdullahi, a university student in Mogadishu. \"But you have to know that this will have a serious effect on relations between Americans and the Muslim world. A tit-for-tat response by Muslim countries, in which Americans could be barred from entering countries affected, is likely to be seen.\" \n\n--- \n\n8:30 p.m. \n\nIran's foreign ministry is suggesting the country will limit issuing visas to American tourists in retaliation for U.S. President Donald Trump's suspension of immigration and visas for nationals from Muslim countries including Iran. \n\nThe official IRNA news agency Saturday carried a statement by the Iranian foreign ministry that says Iran will resort to \"counteraction\" to Trump's executive order. \n\nThe statement says: \"Iran, to defend the dignity of the great Iranian nation, will implement the principle of reciprocity until the removal of the insulting restriction against Iranian nationals.\" \n\nThe statement adds: \"It will apply corresponding legal, consular and political actions.\" \n\nThe two countries have had no diplomatic relations since 1979 when militants stormed the U.S. embassy. \n\n--- \n\n8 p.m. \n\nCairo airport officials say five U.S.-bound Iraqi migrants from one family who have been prevented from boarding an EgyptAir flight to New York's John F. Kennedy airport would return to Iraq. \n\nThey said the five will spend Saturday night at Cairo airport and leave for Irbil, capital of Iraq's Kurdish region, Sunday morning. \n\nThey added that the sixth U.S.-bound migrant, a Yemeni national, left the airport to return to Cairo, where he resides. \n\nThe officials said Saturday's action by the airport was the first since President Donald Trump imposed a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nThe officials said the six migrants, escorted by officials from the U.N. refugee agency, were stopped from boarding the plane after authorities at Cairo airport contacted their counterparts in JFK airport. \n\nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media. \n\n(This story corrects the number of U.S.-bound Iraqi migrants to five, not six) \n\n\u2014 Hamza Hendawi. \n\n--- \n\n7:05 p.m. \n\nDutch airline KLM says it has had to turn away seven would-be passengers because they would no longer have been accepted into the United States under President Donald Trump's ban on immigration from seven Muslim-majority nations. \n\nManel Vrijenhoek, at KLM's press office, said: \"We would love to bring them there. That's not the problem. It's just that this is what the U.S. sprang on the rest of the world \u2014 that these people are no longer welcome.\" \n\nShe said the seven were due to fly with KLM from different airports around the world. Vrijenhoek said she had no specifics on their nationalities, although she confirmed they were from countries affected by the three-month immigration ban: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nTrump signed the order Friday. \n\n--- \n\n6:40 p.m. \n\nA U.S. federal law enforcement official says any non-U.S. citizen from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen is now barred from entering the United States. \n\nThat covers legal permanent residents \u2014 green card holders \u2014 and visa-holders from those seven countries who are out of the United States after Friday, when President Donald Trump signed an executive order with the temporary ban. They cannot return to the U.S. for 90 days. \n\nThe official says there's an exemption for immigrants and legal permanent residents whose entry is in the U.S. national interest, but it's unclear how that exemption will be applied. \n\nThe official says visa and green card holders already in the U.S. will be allowed to stay. \n\nThe official wasn't authorized to publicly discuss the details of how Trump's order is being put in place and spoke only on condition of anonymity. \n\nCustoms and Border Protection is notifying airlines about passengers whose visas had been canceled or legal residents scheduled to fly back to the U.S., and the airlines are being told to keep them off those flights. \n\n\u2014 Alicia Caldwell \n\n--- \n\n6:35 p.m. \n\nIsrael's leader has endorsed President Donald Trump's plan to build a wall along the Mexican border. \n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tweeted Saturday that Israel's wall along its border with Egypt has been successful in stopping a swell of African migrants. \n\n\"President Trump is right. I built a wall along Israel's southern border. It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea,\" he wrote, with images of the Israeli and American flag. \n\nThe tweet marked a rare public foray for the Israeli leader into a charged American domestic affair. The two leaders spoke earlier this week and Netanyahu is planning to visit Trump in the White House next month. \n\nAfter repeated clashes with President Obama, Netanyahu has high expectations for Trump, who has signaled he will take a kinder approach. \n\n--- \n\n5:45 p.m. \n\nMalala Yousafzai, shot in the head by the Pakistani Taliban in 2012 to stop her campaigning for girls' education and co-winner of the 2014 Nobel peace prize, says she is heart-broken by U.S. President Donald Trump's ban on refugees from entering the United States for four months. \n\nThe order Friday suspends a program that saw around 85,000 people displaced by war, political oppression, hunger and religious prejudice resettled in the U.S. last year. Trump indefinitely blocked people fleeing Syria's civil war, and imposed a 90-day ban on U.S. entry from seven Muslim majority nations. \n\nIn a statement Saturday, Yousafzai implores Trump \"not to turn his back on the world's most defenseless children and families.\" \n\nRefugees and immigrants, she says, have \"helped build your country.\" \n\nTrump's mother was born in Scotland. \n\n--- \n\n5:15 p.m. \n\nQatar Airways is advising passengers bound for the United States from seven newly banned majority Muslim countries that they need to have either a U.S. green card or diplomatic visa to travel. \n\nA statement on the company's website says: \"Nationals of the following countries: Sudan, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Yemen ... may travel to the U.S. only if they are in possession of a permanent resident card (Green card) or any of the below visas.\" \n\nIt listed foreign government, United Nations, international organization and NATO visas. \n\nPresident Donald Trump has issued a 90-day ban on all entry to the U.S. from countries with terrorism concerns, including Syria, Iraq and Libya. \n\n--- \n\n3 p.m. \n\nCairo airport officials say seven U.S.-bound migrants \u2014 six from Iraq and one from Yemen \u2014 have been prevented from boarding an EgyptAir flight to New York's John F. Kennedy Airport. \n\nThe officials said the action Saturday by the airport was the first since President Donald Trump imposed a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nThe officials said the seven migrants, escorted by officials from the U.N. refugee agency, were stopped from boarding the plane after authorities at Cairo airport contacted their counterparts at the Kennedy airport. \n\nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media. \n\n\u2014 Hamza Hendawi. \n\n--- \n\n2:45 p.m. \n\nThe head of a leading refugee aid agency says President Donald Trump's decision to ban Syrian refugees hurts innocents fleeing violence. \n\nJan Egeland of the Norwegian Refugee Council tells The Associated Press on Saturday that Trump's decision \"will not make America safer, it will make America smaller and meaner.\" \n\nTrump on Friday suspended refugee admissions for four months and indefinitely banned those from war-torn Syria, pending program changes that are to ensure refugees won't harm national security. \n\nEgeland says the decision dealt a \"mortal blow\" to the idea of international responsibility for those fleeing persecution. He says the U.S. is leading a \"race to the bottom\" in which politicians in wealth countries provide \"zero moral leadership.\" \n\n--- \n\n1 p.m. \n\nIran's President Hassan Rouhani says the time has come for removing walls between nations rather that building new ones. \n\nRouhani did not name any particular country but his remarks come shortly after President Donald Trump's executive order Friday suspending all immigration and visa processes for nationals from a handful of countries with terrorism concerns, including Iran, for 90 days. \n\nRouhani said Saturday that, \"It is not the day for creating distance among nations.\" \n\nSpeaking at a tourism conference broadcast on state TV, Rouhani said that those seeking to create such walls, \"have forgotten that the Berlin Wall collapsed years ago.\" \n\n--- \n\n12:30 p.m. \n\nThe International Rescue Committee is calling President Donald Trump's suspension of the U.S. refugee resettlement program a \"harmful and hasty\" decision. \n\nIn a statement issued late Friday night after the suspension was announced, IRC President David Miliband said, \"America must remain true to its core values. America must remain a beacon of hope.\" \n\nThe IRC statement declared that the U.S. vetting process for prospective refugees is already robust \u2014 involving biometric screening and up to 36 months of vetting by \"12 to 15 government agencies.\" \n\nMiliband praised The United States' record as a resettlement destination and said, \"This is no time for America to turn its back on people ready to become patriotic Americans.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Libya news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Egypt news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Israel news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Yemen news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Somalia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"The Latest: Official says ruling will not affect travel ban","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Merced","zipCode":"95340","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Merced","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Merced Sun-Star","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169661579","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"15"},"name":"Merced Sun-Star","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.mercedsunstar.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204472803","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:29:46Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Saturday's meeting addressed crime and violence in the 61605 area, and how police and the community can work together to restore their trust in each other.\n\nAbout 30 people were present and involved in the two-hour afternoon discussion held at Carver Community Center.\n\nPeoria Police Chief Jerry Mitchell spoke about the Residential Officer Program and said results already are having a positive impact in certain areas of town. An officer moves to a neighborhood where there is a high rate of crime with the purpose of \"bringing that community back.\"\n\n\"If you have an officer in your neighborhood, in your block, it has a tendency to quiet down,\" Mitchell said.\n\nAccording to Mitchell, Peoria police had noticed in the past a 19.8 percent crime reduction in a period of three years since an officer has moved in to an area of high crime. Mitchell said the city could use 10 of its officers in the residential program \u2014 at the moment there are four \u2014 but because of budget restraints it may take several years to actually put the plan into action.\n\nMitchell said community residents need to join the conversation and point out what their priorities are when the City Council gets into budget talks.\n\n\"Crime can remain the same, but community relations can improve,\" Mitchell said.\n\nRita Ali, chairwoman for the Advisory Committee on Police Community Relations, addressed residents' concerns about figuring out the root causes of crime in town.\n\n\"One major problem we identified was being the lack of trust between police and the community,\" Ali said. \"Another was perception, and related to the perception of the south side and the East Bluff in terms of the reputation of those sides of town in Peoria, and possible oversurveillance of police in those areas, so you're likely to be ticketed more in some of those higher crime places.\"\n\nErnestine Jackson, a member of the Peoria Public Schools Board of Education, said people need to understand the importance of speaking up when they see something wrong.\n\n\"We cannot sit back, as a community, knowing certain things are happening near your garage and not saying anything and then getting sad because someone is dead, or somebody's been shot,\" Jackson said.\n\nMitchell and Ali agreed there is a need to address the whole community to be able to make those changes, and that goes beyond law enforcement's job.\n\n\"I can't educate your children, I am not a teacher,\" Mitchell said. \"I can't create jobs, I can't create those opportunities. All we can do is foster that relationship to say that we're not out here to cause you any issue, we're here to give you direction. This is community-based.\"\n\n\"I've been tired of it,\" he said of violence in the city. \"There is nobody here that goes to bed with bad news and wakes up with more bad news than me, but it needs to come from the community, or we will not succeed. There has to be opportunity, education, awareness, jobs. Otherwise, we\u2019re going to be talking about this for several years.\"\n\nAli suggested that another meeting for the 61605 ZIP code was needed. It was tentatively set for Feb. 25, although the date and location are yet to be confirmed.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Elisa  Marques"},"topics":[],"title":"Peorians share ideas at Town Hall meeting in effort to curb violence","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Peoria","zipCode":"61643","state":"Illinois","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Peoria","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"PJStar.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169668761","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1892"},"name":"PJStar.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.pjstar.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204473133","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T01:02:04Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:29:46Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

This has been in effect since 1 January 2016, although some of it only provisionally because ratification by the Netherlands is still outstanding. \n \n\u201cFirstly, the \u201cUkraine Model\u201d corresponds to the British objectives in that it contains substantial market access but does not require the application of EU law or compliance with the case law of the ECJ, nor does it provide for free movement but it does allow free trade agreements with third countries. Thus the United Kingdom\u2019s four key requirements are met.\u201d \n \nHere is the CEP\u2019s table, illustrating the benefits of a Ukraine-style deal: \n \nCentre for European Policy \n  \nThe think-tank does acknowledge that issues could arise with a Ukraine-style deal for the UK, particularly when it comes to the financial services sector \u2014 which has been one of the most contentious issues since the Brexit vote. \n \nBanks currently have the right to \u201cpassport\u201d their financial licences in one EU market to another, preventing them having to go through the costly and complicated process of being regulated in each market where they operate, but that passport could be lost after the Brexit process has been completed, causing chaos for Britain\u2019s financial services industry. \n \nRoughly  13,500 companies use financial passporting  in relation to the UK with all types of businesses from newspapers to removals companies, all the way to a body that represents acupuncturists holding passports. \n \n\u201cThe agreement with the Ukraine is unlikely to satisfy the United Kingdom as regards the scope of trade liberalisation because it contains numerous restrictions on market access particularly for cross-border services. The United Kingdom will probably require better access to the EU internal market, primarily in the interests of the British finance industry,\u201d the report notes. \n \nThat\u2019s where the \u201cPlus\u201d comes in, with the UK creating a bespoke deal that includes many of the features of the Ukrainian agreement, but also includes concessions to the banking and finance sectors. \n  NOW WATCH: Theresa May: \u2018No partial membership of EU\u2019   \n\n\n Please enable Javascript to watch this video","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Will Martin"},"topics":[{"name":"Eastern Europe news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Europe news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Ukraine news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"European Union news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"},{"name":"UK business news","group":"Business"}],"title":"Britain could strike a \u2018Ukraine Plus\u2019 style Brexit deal","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"South-Eastern Asia","countryCode":"MY","country":"Malaysia"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Business Insider Malaysia","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"536283493","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"50"},"name":"Business Insider Malaysia","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Business"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.businessinsider.my"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.cep.eu/fileadmin/user_upload/cep.eu/Studien/cepAdhoc_Brexit/cepAdhoc_Ukraine_Plus_as_a_model_for_Brexit.pdf","http://uk.businessinsider.com/morgan-stanley-on-brexit-uk-canada-plus-2017-1","http://uk.businessinsider.com/theresa-may-brexit-speech-leaving-single-market-immigration-control-2017-1","http://uk.businessinsider.com/brexit-eu-financial-passport-city-of-london-2016-11","http://www.businessinsider.com/theresa-may-britain-european-union-eu-hard-brexit-europe-2017-1"],"sequenceId":"695204484156","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:29:55Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It is rated as one of the top six intersections that need safety improvements in Region 5, which covers 15 counties in Southwest Colorado. \n   \nCDOT wants to redirect traffic to County Road CC for travelers heading west off the highway to the Pleasant View community and on to farms, oil and gas fields, and nearby national monuments. Road CC intersects with U.S. 491 a mile north of Road BB, and has favorable sight distance. \n   \n\u201cThe BB intersection has been vetted as a priority and is in need of safety improvement, and we\u2019re obligated to do something about it for the safety of the traveling public,\u201d CDOT program manager Ed Archuleta, said Wednesday during a packed meeting at the Pleasant View School. \n   \nBut locals are heavily opposed to any major change to the Road BB intersection because it is considered a key access point for residents, farmers and ranchers. \n   \nThey say improved safety signage, a left turn lane and lower speed limit would mitigate the danger. Also, concern was expressed that redirecting traffic to Road CC would send it all by the Pleasant View school, causing a safety hazard. \n   \nResidents hotly contested CDOT\u2019s claims that the Road BB intersection contributes to a lot of accidents. \n   \n\u201cHow many were actually caused by the intersection?\u201d asked one resident. \n   \n\u201cMoving access to Road CC, there will still be accidents,\u201d said another. \u201cYou can\u2019t fix stupid.\u201d \n   \nResident Merle Root said restricting or closing the intersection \u201cwill hurt local residents.\u201d She has lived at the intersection for 30 years and has seen animals cause more accidents than the problematic intersection. \n   \nIncreased traffic CDOT records show nine vehicle accidents at the intersection, including one fatality, since 1996. Five of the nine are listed as intersection-related. \n   \nHighway use continues to increase, Archuleta said, making accidents there in the future more likely. In 2015, there were 4,300 annual daily traffic counts on U.S. 491, compared with 3,900 in 2012. He said cutting down the highway hill at the Road BB intersection to improve sight distance would be cost-prohibitive. \n   \n\u201cIt would cost at least $4 million, which is the entire budget for road safety improvements for 15 counties,\u201d he said. \u201cThe transportation budget is limited.\u201d \n   \n\u201cThe simple solution would be to drop the speed limit there from 65 mph to 45 mph,\u201d responded local resident Joe Black. \n   \nThe CDOT deal CDOT, which controls the intersection right of way, offered the county a solution, which is also heavily resisted by the locals. \n   \nCDOT has offered the county $630,000 to close the Road BB intersection. By closing the intersection, the county could spend the money to improve Pleasant View area roads. Areas under consideration include chip-sealing sections of Roads 15, 16, CC and 10, and building a truck turnaround at Road 15.5 to serve the livestock loading chute and corrals. \n   \n\u201cIt\u2019s a chunk of money that will benefit the community,\u201d said county road supervisor Rob Englehart. \u201cIf the county does not close the road, we won\u2019t get the funds, and CDOT probably puts in the right-in, right-out.\u201d \n   \nA public hearing on the matter will be held at 1:30 p.m. on Monday, Jan. 30, in the county commission room. At the hearing, the commissioners could decide whether the Road BB intersection at the highway will be closed or not. \n   \nCommissioner James Lambert said he believes CDOT will move forward with the right-in, right-out alternative if the county does not shut the road. But regarding his vote on whether to close it, he said he sent out letters to Road BB and Road CC residents asking them what they want. \n   \n\u201cWhatever the majority is will be how I vote on the matter,\u201d he said. \n   \nIf the traffic is diverted down Road CC, the Montezuma-Cortez Re-1 School District and county said they will work together to install safety fencing around the school and traffic warnings.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"CDOT intersection plan might come down to the money","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Montezuma","zipCode":"81321","state":"Colorado","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Cortez","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Cortez Journal","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169876103","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"222"},"name":"Cortez Journal","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.cortezjournal.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204486699","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:29:57Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

She grew up on Long Island, N.Y., surrounded by a large Sicilian family. \n \nShe was predeceased by her husband, Frank GJ; daughter, Patricia; and her brother, Thomas, who passed prior to her birth. \n \nAfter graduating from Mepham High School, she attended Buffalo State College, where she met her husband, Frank. They married and moved to College Park, Md., where he then completed his degree. They moved to Warren, where Eleanor lived for 30 years before returning to Maryland. \n \nAfter their four children were in school, Eleanor returned to college and earned her bachelor\u2019s degree in education. She briefly taught and then worked at the Warren Public Library until she retired in 1998. Eleanor went further to earn her master of library science from Kent State University. To Eleanor, working at the library was a job she loved so much that she would have done it for free. \n \nTwo of Eleanor\u2019s greatest pleasures were reading and traveling. She was known to finish, on average, two books a week. Historical fiction was her favorite genre. Eleanor traveled extensively throughout her life, first with her husband, and after his death, with various tour groups. Europe was her favorite destination. She traveled from the fjords of Norway to the sunny south of Spain. Throughout the years, there were two trips that she always said were her favorites. The first was a trip to Germany and Austria with her daughters, Tina, Beth and daughter-in-law, Maridy. The other was a cruise to the Greek Isles with her daughter, Beth. Pictures of Eleanor from these trips highlight her adventurous spirit. \n \nAfter retiring from the Warren Public Library, she moved to Annapolis, Md., where she worked part-time at the Anne Arundal Public Library and Borders Book Store. Reading and books were a passion she obviously could not live without. She always said that she continued working past retirement so that she could continue to travel. \n \nEleanor is survived by her son, Michael (Adriana) of Maryland; daughters, Tina (Maridy) Boyer of Concord and Beth Horn of Groveport; grandchildren, Jennifer Snell, Jennifer Horn (Matt) Neff, Jaremie (Susan) Horn, Josh (Amanda) Horn, Jodi Horn and Jacob Horn; and 10 great-grandchildren. \n \nThe family wishes to thank the staff of Morningside Assisted Living of Concord, Kestrel Ridge Family Home and Universal Healthcare, for the excellent care she received in the past eight years. \n \nAccording to the family\u2019s wishes, there will be no services. Interment will be at Annapolis National Cemetery. \n \nIn lieu of flowers, the family would like donations made to your local public library. In Eleanor\u2019s honor, read a book or read a book to a child. \n \nHartsell Funeral Home of Concord is serving the Boyer family. \n \nOnline condolences may be made at www.hartsellfh.com \n \n(special notice)","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Eleanor M.

That was all just a year and half into the campaign and before the terrorist group made massive forays into Afghanistan and Libya. But what has it gotten in return? Castigations and denigrations that defy human reasoning. \n \nPresident Trump\u2019s predecessor, Barack Obama has been blamed for the rise of the ISIS by withdrawing US troops from Iraq in 2011 but it is important to note that the Status of Forces agreement made by the Bush administration set a 2011 withdrawal date. This much was said by Bush when he held a famous joint press conference with the then Iraqi prime minister, Nouri Al Maliki and moments after saying that, he was stoned by an Iraqi journalist. That was the extent to which most Iraqis had grown to abhor the United States presence in their country. They saw the US troops as illegitimate occupiers and causes of civilian deaths. Al Maliki summed up the sentiment when he said: \u201cThe incomplete sovereignty and presence of foreign troops have been the most dangerous, most complicated and most burdensome legacy since the dictatorship. Iraq should get rid of them to prevent its young democratic experiment\u201d. \n \nThe US merely complied with the wishes of the Iraqi people by pulling the stops on a war that had cost it $1trillion at that time, so I find it utterly disgusting to hear people say they left earlier than they should. The oppression of the Sunni minority by the Shiite majority after the Americans left ensured an emerging ISIS had a lot of sympathisers from the Sunnis who had been instrumental in helping the US troops fight Al Qaeda. There have been many reports on how complacent the Iraqi army got when they were left to stand on their own and this made the ISIS grow in confidence. It is not Obama\u2019s fault that the Sunni/Shiite conflict had been going on for centuries or that Al-Maliki rubber stamped the oppression of the minority Sunni after the US left and killed hundreds of those who dared to protest neither is it his that the Iraqis didn\u2019t make the over $20 billion spent by the US in rebuilding its armed forces just a year after its withdrawal, count. \n \nThe start of the Syrian civil war in 2011 meant the ISIS had more than enough land across the border to comfortably grow in. While I am not disputing the fact that the US may have covertly armed unrecognized forces severally to help fight a common enemy and that this could very much be said to have created a situation where weapons were left in the hands of people very prone to being swayed by the ISIS,it is important to understand its motive which simply put is, helping a people fight a just cause. \n \nTake Syria, for example, where Bashir Al Assad had ruled for about 10 years as at the time of the famous revolt in some Arab nations against the perpetual leadership in 2010 popularly referred to as the Arab Spring.He had taken over from his father who had ruled for 29 years and Assad was the most vicious of all the rulers turned against by their own people. He went as far as dispersing protests with life bullets and attacking his own people with chemical weapons. It was obvious the war had taken a new dimension and arming and training those willing to stand up to the government was a great service to the Syrian people. That a lot of Syrian fighters with arms thought the ISIS cause a worthier one at some point is not America\u2019s fault. Here in Nigeria, when a lot of people in the South East and South South turned to armed robbery after the civil war because of the abundance of arms in the region, governments fought hard to curb the scourge rather than blaming who was supplying the Biafrans arms during the war. \n \nAs elementary as this may sound, it still remains the truth. The problem lies first with the extremists, their warped understanding of Islam and the individuals and countries supporting them. Terrorism has been helped by the advancement of the social media which has allowed the extremists prey on vulnerable minds and show off their might more easily.Then you also have the fact that the weaker groups are now uniting with the stronger ones instead of fighting themselves. \n \nThey may be a plethora of other reasons why terrorism is growing but it is certainly not because of the United States of America.The world owes it loads of gratitude for its efforts at making it a better place and not condemnation. \n \nTrump is the new man on board and he has promised to spend less on helping others fight their wars.It makes sense if you consider the money that has being pumped into that by previous governments and what he wants to use funds for.The new \u2018big brother\u2019 wants everybody to fend for themselves and it has dawned on quite a number of people especially those who kept hating the US for helping them that America doesn\u2019t owe anybody anything. \n \nOp\u2013ed pieces and contributions are the opinions of the writers only and do not represent the opinions of Y!/YNaija \n \nUmar Sa\u2019ad Hassan is a lawyer based in Kano. \n \nThe author tweets @alaye26 \n  \nFollow @ynaija on Twitter \n -- \n  Comments","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Ezinne Ajoku"},"topics":[{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Opinion: America doesn\u2019t owe anybody anything","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Western Africa","countryCode":"NG","country":"Nigeria"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"YNaija.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"561999471","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"956"},"name":"YNaija.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://ynaija.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://twitter.com/ynaija"],"sequenceId":"695204498963","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:23:27Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:29:59Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It's great that we are again in a moment like this.\" \n \nAs Nadal and Federer arrived at Melbourne Park as ninth and 17th seeds, therefore, the first drafts of the obituaries of two great sporting careers were being prepared. \n \nThey were hurriedly dropped back into the files, however, as it became apparent the duo were playing vintage tennis: Federer all fluidity and peerless shot-making, Nadal at his brutal best from the baseline. \n \nThe early departures of reigning champion Novak Djokovic and top seed Andy Murray, the players who had joined Federer and Nadal to make up the \"Big Four\", then opened up the path to a grand final reunion. \n \nAlthough it has often felt more like 2007 than 2017 at Melbourne Park this week, even great champions are not immune to the ravages of time. \n \nAt 35, Swiss Federer is the oldest men's grand slam finalist since Ken Rosewall lost the US Open final in 1974 at the age of 39. \n \nNadal might be five years younger but has been on tour since his late teens and the effort required for his attritional playing style puts tremendous strain on his body. \n \nAnd while Federer has been able to rest up after his three-hour semi-final victory over Stan Wawrinka on Thursday, Nadal must recuperate as best he can after his epic five-hour victory over Grigor Dimitrov on Friday. \n \n\"That's what I'm going to try,\" the 14-times grand slam champion said. \"I did it in 2009. I am seven, eight years older.\" \n \nThat five-set 2009 victory over Federer earned Nadal his sole Australian Open crown and another would make him the only man in the open era apart from Roy Emerson to have won all four grand slams twice. \n \nFederer has four Australian Open titles but just a single French Open crown, his path to Roland Garros glory more often than not blocked by Nadal. \n \nImmediately after his semi-final, as he was finally able to ponder meeting his great rival, the 17-times grand slam champion suggested his 11-23 record against Nadal might have been in part due to them meeting on clay so often early in their careers. \n \nAfterwards, in his news conference, he was less candid, noting only that the pace of the Rod Laver Arena this year allowed him to be more aggressive. \n \n\"Now it's a different time,\" he said. \"A lot of time has gone by. I know this court allows me to play a certain game against Rafa that I cannot do on centre court at the French Open.\" \n \nNadal has a 6-2 edge over Federer in grand slam finals but few are making a call with any confidence over who will win Sunday's contest. \n \n\"I just know that two of the greatest players of tennis are going to square off on Sunday, and it's going to be a freakin' amazing match,\" Dimitrov said on Friday.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: tennis news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Live Australian Open 2017, Day 14: Roger Federer faces Rafael Nadal in final","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Firstpost.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"232003819","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"97"},"name":"Firstpost.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.firstpost.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204504609","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:30:05Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

If we're going to play defense like that, we're not going to win many games.\" \n \nRandolph bullied defenders in the post throughout the night and Gasol worked the Utah defense both inside and out, routinely hitting turnaround fade-away jumpers and going 4 of 5 on 3-pointers. \n \nThe Grizzlies took a 52-43 lead into halftime after a 13-2 run gave Memphis a 10-point lead. Randolph had his way with the Jazz post defenders and scored 10 of his 14 first-half points in the second quarter. \n \nThe Jazz shot just 26.3 percent from the field in the second quarter and never led in the second half. \n \nConley helped keep the Jazz at bay in the fourth quarter and finished with 23. \n \nRodney Hood led the Jazz with 20 points. \n \n\"Any time we have breakdowns, it's because we're not talking to each other and we're not helping each other out,\" Hood said. :I think that's the biggest thing. It's tough to lose when you know you can do better on that end. So, we've just got to get back to the drawing board.\" \n \n\"They have a lot of guys down there that are capable of putting up high numbers every night,\" said Jazz point guard George Hill, who had 16 points and 5 assists. \"They have good players and we've got to respect that, but a lot of breakdowns in coverages gave them some looks and they hit a lot of tough shots late in the shot clock also.\" \n \nQuin Snyder decided to rest starting power forward Derrick Favors. \n \nThe Jazz could have moved into the 4th seed in the Western Conference with a victory, but instead remain a half game back of the L.A. Clippers. \n \nUtah next hosts Milwaukee Wednesday night.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: NBA - Utah Jazz news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: NBA - Memphis Grizzlies news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest scores","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Jazz lose to the Big 3 of Memphis, 102-95","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Salt Lake","zipCode":"84104","state":"Utah","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Salt Lake City","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Good4Utah.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"496147166","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"402"},"name":"Good4Utah.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.good4utah.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204513500","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:30:11Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

At present, Railways is running a pilot project for senior citizens who are entitled for rail concessions. \n \nThe concessional tickets cost the Railways about Rs 1,600 crore in 2015-16, with the bulk being accounted for senior citizens. \n \nAs per the government data, over 100 crore Aadhaar cards have been issued so for covering bulk of India's population. The government has decided to end the 92-year-old practice of presenting a separate Railway budget and merged it with the General Budget.

Those 111 appearances have come over around four years, and he's failed to establish himself as a regular in Liverpool's starting XI under Klopp, with the German often preferring versatile playmaker Roberto Firmino in the central striking role. \n \nThe Reds boss has become frustrated with Sturridge's history of injuries and conceded that the England international simply doesn't play enough games for him to have a future under him at the club. \n \n\n \nKlopp is aware that, at his best, Sturridge is capable of being one of English football's most clinical goalscorers, but numerous fitness issues have clearly taken a toll on the 27-year-old, who now appears to be a shadow of the player he was two or three years ago. \n \nWith that said, the former Borussia Dortmund manager believes that the end of the season is the right time to let arguably his most talented and most recognised centre-forward go. \n Who would replace him?  \nKlopp would surely love a reunion with Dortmund hitman Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, although the deadly pace merchant is on the radar of giants like Chelsea, Manchester City and Real Madrid . \n \n\n \nPromising Athletic Bilbao forward Inaki Williams is the name most often linked with a move to Anfield, while for Sturridge, it would be very difficult to find a club of the same size as Liverpool. \n \nEvery top side in England already seems to have a top-class striker, from Zlatan Ibrahimovic at Manchester United and Arsenal 's Alexis Sanchez to Chelsea's Diego Costa and Man City talisman Sergio Aguero. \n \nDo YOU think Klopp should sell Sturridge in the summer, or is it still too soon to say?

Sad to hear I\u2019ll be banned from the USA based on my country of birth. \n \nA sad, sad day to feel like a second-class citizen. Sad day for the USA. \n \nDowning Street said Mrs May\u2019s team would be in touch with the White House if Britons were affected by the order. \n \nWe are studying this new executive order to see what it means and what the legal effects are, and in particular what the consequences are for UK nationals, Number 10 said. \n \nIf there is any impact on UK nationals then clearly we will make representations to the US government about that. \n \nThe US Embassy in Ireland has also confirmed that the new restrictions are being implemented at immigration pre-clearance facilities at Dublin and Shannon airports. \n \nLabour and Conservative MPs had reacted with horror to Mr Trump\u2019s policy, and Mrs May\u2019s initial refusal to condemn it. \n \nOther world leaders, including Canada\u2019s Justin Trudeau and French President Francois Hollande, were more forthright in speaking out against the ban. \n \nOutspoken Tory MP Heidi Allen tweeted the Prime Minister directly to say: Strong leadership means not being afraid to tell someone powerful when they\u2019re wrong. It\u2019s an ethos this country is proud of Theresa May. \n \nAnd Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: President Trump\u2019s executive order against refugees and Muslims should shock and appal us all. \n \n(c) Sky News 2017: Theresa May \u2018does not agree\u2019 with Trump\u2019s refugee ban  Comments  \ncomments","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Theresa May \u2018does not agree\u2019 with Trump\u2019s refugee ban","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","county":"West Sussex","zipCode":"BN11","state":"England","countryCode":"GB","zipArea":"Worthing","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"MoreRadio","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"607988942","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2"},"name":"MoreRadio","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://moreradio.online"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://news.sky.com/story/travellers-turned-away-after-trump-visa-halt-10745854"],"sequenceId":"695204515663","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:30:12Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

As a result, the incidence of oral disease among young children has dropped. Advocates would like to do the same for adults, but the hurdles are significant. \n \nThe state\u2019s Medicaid reimbursement rate for adult dental care is one of the lowest in the nation, about 29 percent of what private insurers pay. In many instances, that\u2019s not enough to cover a dental office\u2019s costs, meaning they can take a loss for every Medicaid patient they see. \n \nLess than one-quarter of adults with Medicaid coverage have access to dental care. Those without access delay their care until it becomes an emergency. From 2011-14, the Legislature largely dropped adult dental coverage to balance budgets. Coverage has been restored, and now dentists are seeing a surge in people who had to postpone needed care. \n \nThe Washington Dental Services Foundation wants the state to increase the Medicaid reimbursement for the adult Medicaid population, but it also knows the Legislature is consumed with funding basic education this session. \n \nSo the foundation, a nonprofit supported by insurance provider Delta Dental, is making a small request of $1.5 million to help fund a pilot project aimed at covering pregnant women and adult diabetics by increasing their reimbursement rates. \n \nPregnant women are targeted as the next step to the foundation\u2019s efforts to allay unfounded fears (from patients and dentists) about pregnancy and dental care, and to encourage families to move up a child\u2019s first visit to age 1 rather than age 3. Women can transmit oral diseases to their babies before and after delivery, so they shouldn\u2019t avoid the dentist. Dental caries is the most common childhood disease and is totally preventable. \n \nDiabetes is targeted because it makes people more prone to gum disease, which makes it more difficult to control blood sugar. It\u2019s important that diabetics have regular dental care to forestall serious health consequences. \n \nSpokane would be a natural choice as one of the pilot sites, because of its historic commitment to expanding dental access.

Proponents say this would reduce drug prices and Medicare costs for the federal government. Medicare pays for about 29 percent of prescription drugs in the U.S. and would have considerable leverage. \n \nTrump would be taking on the leaders of his own party, starting with House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin. Most Republicans have long argued that giving Medicare such power is tantamount to government price-setting, which ideologically they oppose and which they say would stifle innovation and research in the drug industry. Many of them receive huge campaign contributions from the industry\u2019s sizable political war chest. \n \nThere are arguments over the merits and effects, but the politics are clear cut. In a Kaiser Foundation poll last autumn, the public, by 82 percent to 17 percent, favored allowing the federal government to negotiate lower drug prices. Huge majorities say costly drug prices \u2013 in recent years they have risen about four times the rate of inflation \u2013 are a major concern. \n \nThese costs are felt by some of Trump\u2019s strongest supporters, non-college educated whites. And liberals, led by politicians like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, champion a robust government role to keep drug prices down. \n \nIf Trump is serious, he\u2019ll have to do some heavy arm-twisting on Capitol Hill. Speaker Ryan says the current system is working \u201cextremely well,\u201d and suggests the president consult his designated Health and Human Services secretary, Tom Price. Like Ryan, Price is a small-government conservative skeptical of such interventions. \n \nThe clout of the drug industry shouldn\u2019t be underestimated. When the Medicare prescription-drug law was passed in 2003, the industry and its Republican allies, including President George W. Bush, insisted on a provision that explicitly bans Medicare from negotiating prices. \n \nDrug-industry interests made $18 million in political contributions to congressional candidates of both parties in the past election cycle. Even one of Trump\u2019s closest allies, Rep. Chris Collins, R-New York, opposes the idea of the cost negotiations. Collins, who is the president\u2019s go-to man on legislative relations, got $84,750 from the drug industry in the last election. Ryan received $326,949. \n \nThere was an instructive vote in the Senate this month on a closely related issue, allowing the importation of cheaper drugs from Canada. It failed 52 to 46. But it garnered the support of 10 Republicans, including deficit hawks like Rand Paul of Kentucky and Utah\u2019s Mike Lee. \n \nHowever, 13 Democrats (including Washington Sens. Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell), most of them beneficiaries of industry political contributions, voted against the measure. Subsequently, they have gotten a lot of flak from liberal groups, which especially have targeted Cory Booker of New Jersey. He received $49,830 from the industry in the last election. \n \nIf Trump goes all out on this issue, it will be near impossible for most of these Democrats to side with the industry over a Republican president whom they accuse of representing the interests of the rich. And, knowledgeable Congress watchers say, a number of Republicans, in the face of White House pressure and public opinion, would cave, too. \n \nAlbert Hunt is a Bloomberg View columnist. \n \nPublished Jan. 29, 2017, midnight   in: Donald Trump, drug prices, House Speaker Paul Ryan, Sen.

Warren Harding pioneered the political use of radio, which was perfected by Franklin Roosevelt, whose ambitions were aided by having a good radio voice. Not everyone was a fan of the medium. When a radio microphone was put in front of diplomat Elihu Root, he is said to have responded: \u201cTake that away. I can talk to a Democrat, but I cannot speak into a dead thing.\u201d \n \nJohn Kennedy\u2019s political appeal was unimaginable without televised images of his youth, vigor and physical grace. Ronald Reagan talked to the camera like an old, single-eyed friend. \n \nBut no president has really possessed the technical means to routinely avoid edited, moderated mass communication until now. President Trump holds his office, in part, because of his talent for Twitter. He has shown a remarkable ability to dominate the news cycle and redirect the national conversation in increments of 140 characters. For Trump, this medium is a living, snarling and hungry thing. \n \nMake no mistake: This is not only change, it is regression. I make this judgment both as a fogey and a former speechwriter. A presidential speech may be two or three thousand words, every one of them run through the staffing process (in which senior White House officials can comment), fact checked and approved by the president before delivery. A good presidential speech is the result of both thought and craft. A great presidential speech reflects literary, historical and moral inspiration and can speak far beyond its moment. \n \nI understand the usefulness of social media in aggregating flows of information that people trust, enjoy and need. It allows people to essentially be their own editors (the value of which is determined by the news literacy of the user). And some people have a remarkable knack for communicating in vivid fragments. Pope Francis (with 10 million Twitter followers) distributes little bits of wisdom and comfort like virtual communion wafers. Katy Perry (with more followers than the population of Germany) says, well, whatever it is that Katy Perry says. \n \nBut in politics, Twitter has dramatic limits and can become a disturbing substitute for disciplined thought. \n \nOne hundred and forty characters are suitable to expressing an impulse, but not an argument. It is the rhetorical equivalent of a groan, a shriek, a sneer or a burp. If reason and persuasion are what our politics lacks and needs, Twitter is not the answer. \n \nTrump\u2019s mastery and extensive use of Twitter are revealing in a way he does not intend. This is the only area in which Trump can be considered a great communicator. His stump speech was a disorganized, repetitive, unfocused mess. His inaugural speech was memorable only in ways \u2013 such as its dark, shrunken view of America itself \u2013 that deserve to be forgotten. His recent speech at the CIA was strangely inappropriate and offensive. So he often returns to the comfort zone of Twitter. He claims Hillary Clinton lost in a \u201clandslide,\u201d or goes after a specific news organization, or makes entirely unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud. \n \nSome feel that journalism would be better served by ignoring such shiny objects. But the shallowness of Trump\u2019s preferred form of communication indicates deeper things. His mind seems perfectly suited to a medium that rewards impulsiveness, that ignores fact-checking and that encourages incivility. Those are not generally the traits we hope for in a new president. \n \nAnd Trump\u2019s use of Twitter raises the prospect of a serious abuse of power. A private citizen with 22 million followers (as Trump has) can be a vindictive jerk, attacking the owner of the Cubs, the head of the United Steelworkers or a Gold Star family by name. A president with 22 million followers, including the shock troops of Internet bullying, can destroy an individual\u2019s life as surely as targeting by the FBI or the IRS. \n \nAt moments of frustration, Trump will be sorely tempted to attack specific people on Twitter. But a government official should not be allowed to take the reputation or peace of any citizen without due process. It is the president\u2019s job to enforce laws without distinction, not to choose specific men and women for harm. This would be the practice of personal rule, and a scary detour toward Putinism. \n \nMichael Gerson is a columnist for Washington Post Writers Group. \n \nPublished Jan. 29, 2017, midnight   in: Donald Trump, tweets, twitter","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Michael Gerson"},"topics":[],"title":"Michael Gerson: Trump\u2019s tweets are touch and go - Sun, 29 Jan 2017 PST","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Spokane","zipCode":"99201","state":"Washington","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Spokane","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Spokesman-Review.com","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169685632","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4935"},"name":"Spokesman-Review.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://spokesmanreview.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204518211","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:30:15Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Those who were not on American soil when the decree came into effect are not able to re-enter for three months \u2013 separating them from their families and putting their jobs at risk. \n \nSome green card holders who were flying home to the US when the executive order was signed have been taken into custody at airports upon arrival \u2013 with dozens of immigration lawyers attempting to help the stranded. \n \nA judge has ruled those who have already landed in the US with valid visas can be temporarily allowed to stay in the country. \n \nAs of Saturday night, customs and border protection officials had denied entry to more than 170 people. \n \nOthers who were about to board flights back to America have been told they cannot travel \u2013 and the Homeland Security Department has been contacting airlines and recommending them to deny boarding to certain passengers. \n \nEnforcement of the executive order for those landing in the States has been described as patchy and disorganised, and some American airports have been more lenient than others. \n \nAccording to the executive order, exceptions can be made when it is in the national interest, but one federal law enforcement official said: It\u2019s unclear at this point what the threshold of the national interest is. \n \nThe International Air Transport Association has been told that the ban also applies to flight crew who are from one of the listed countries. \n \nProtests are taking place across the US \u2013 including airports in New York, Washington DC, Los Angeles, Chicago and Dallas. \n \nThe decree has also created uncertainty for refugees who were about to begin a new life in the States, as all resettlements have been suspended for at least 120 days while tougher vetting rules are established. Syrian refugees have been specifically barred from the US indefinitely. \n \nOne aid organisation said it knew of 2,000 refugees who had been scheduled to relocate to the US next week. \n \nNo refugees were on planes heading to America when the order came into force, but 350 people who had already begun their journeys are now stuck in Kenya. \n \nWashington Governor Jay Inslee, speaking at Sea-Tac Airport, condemned the chaos and cruelty of Mr Trump\u2019s policy \u2013 and warned it was provocative, incompetent, ineffective and damaging to the economy. \n \nBritish citizens who carry passports for one of the seven affected countries have also been caught up in the disruption. \n \nHamaseh Tayari, a Scottish vet who holds an Iranian passport, told the Guardian she has been left stranded in Costa Rica as her flight back to Glasgow was scheduled to go via New York. \n \nShe and her boyfriend now face the possibility of having to pay an extra £2,000 to fly to Madrid in order to get home. \n \nPresident Trump has said the executive order is a necessary step to stop radical Islamic terrorists from coming to the US \u2013 but stressed the decree is not a Muslim ban. \n \nHe has faced condemnation from leaders around the world, with Iran\u2019s Foreign Minister warning Tehran is going to stop issuing new visas to US citizens in retaliation to the ban. \n \nAmerican technology giants have also responded furiously to the immigration clampdown. \n \nApple chief executive Tim Cook said his company does not support the policy. In an apparent reference to its co-founder Steve Jobs, the son of a Syrian immigrant, Mr Cook said: Apple would not exist without immigration, let alone thrive and innovate the way we do. \n \nGoogle has urged its employees from the seven countries affected to cancel any travel plans outside the US. \n \nThe impact on foreign students is also unclear. Figures from the Homeland Security Department suggest that 17,000 students from the blacklisted countries were allowed into the US in 2015/16. \n \n(c) Sky News 2017: Trump\u2019s immigration ban sparks \u2018chaos and cruelty\u2019 worldwide  Comments  \ncomments","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Trump\u2019s immigration ban sparks \u2018chaos and cruelty\u2019 worldwide","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","county":"West Sussex","zipCode":"BN11","state":"England","countryCode":"GB","zipArea":"Worthing","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"MoreRadio","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"607988942","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2"},"name":"MoreRadio","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://moreradio.online"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204524794","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:30:13Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The sight of pink hats as far as the eye could see was awe-inspiring. I loved that we shared it as three generations, which will bind us tighter forever. \n \nA rich and vibrant discussion, mostly over social media, arose about the intention and meaning of the Women\u2019s March. The reasons are as diverse as the individuals who attended (not to mention the sea of colorful and creative signs they carried). \n \nI marched for her. Having no idea what to expect before the event, I was focused on imprinting a life memory in the mind of my daughter \u2013 one of the few crystal clear instances we remember within the haze of childhood. I hoped it would be etched into her very core and form the roots for the woman she grows into. There wouldn\u2019t be a specific moment in her life when she realized that her body is her own, or that she demanded equal rights, or that she believed that all humans are worthy of respect. Instead, it would be woven into her fabric, something that was always her. \n \nSince the march, when the flood of people submerged cities around the world, there have been critics who feel it was unnecessary, inappropriate or simply a waste of time. Facebook friends have decried it, saying it did not represent them or their views as a woman. One woman argued that a better way to support women\u2019s issues is to take all the money used for airplanes, hotels and taxis and donate it to cancer research or a domestic violence shelter. \n \nWhile we marched down Pennsylvania Avenue toward the White House chanting, \u201cTHIS is what democracy looks like!\u201d my mind swirled with the many reasons I was there. While those reasons remain crucial, what I hope my daughter takes away is this: You show up. There is value in just being there, surrounded by thousands of strangers united in presence. There are times that it is simply not enough to express your views on Facebook, or donate to an issue you care about or go to a board meeting. Sometimes you must show up. To stand in solidarity, to use your voice, to feel powerful. \n \nSometimes you refuse to accept that life is a pendulum swinging away from your beliefs. Sometimes you chant, \u201cHear my voice!\u201d And sometimes you march. \n \nI also marched for him. One of my own crystal clear memories is when my dad showed up for me. Big time. I was 11 years old and had just made the boys select soccer team until the coach told me that the city would not allow girls on the team. I remember the exact spot I was standing when he said those words. I also remember the exact spot I was standing when my dad said, \u201cThat is unacceptable.\u201d \n \nAfter threats of a lawsuit and weeks of negotiating, I was on that team. The message from my dad was clear: I will show up for you. That memory is impressed on my mind and woven into my fabric. \n \nPart of me hopes the Women\u2019s March is emblazoned on my daughter\u2019s mind. One of those moments she is proud to tell people about as an adult. The beginning of her strength, the day she found her voice. But another part of me hopes it will be a distant, faded memory of an archaic time when \u201cmy mom dragged me to D.C. because back then women were paid less than men.\u201d \n \nSometimes it is hard to show up. You are the only one and your voice can feel shaky and raw. Other times it is easy or joyful, like when you are surrounded by others with a common purpose fueling each other to make your singular voice louder. In many ways the Women\u2019s March was the latter. We were in the majority that day, which is both empowering and the easier path. No one telling you to be quiet or that you are wrong. That questioning feeling of \u201cam I doing the right thing?\u201d that can turn your face red and hot vanishes. I hope she will do both.

The old that is strong does not wither, Deep roots are not reached by the frost.\" JRR Tolkein\n\nMany people won't believe me but I'm going to come out and say it.\n\nI love February.\n\nThere's something about the energy of a fresh start, the invigorating cold air and crisp golden winter sun but without all the garden neediness and exertion of late spring and summer.\n\nOf course the RHS and garden shows will come out with a list of tasks you should be doing in the garden at this time of year but actually I think it's a good time to give the garden a break from meddling and just enjoy it.\n\nThis is where a little thoughtful laziness in autumn comes in hand.\n\nBy not cutting back the flowering stalks of last summer's herbaceous exuberance you get to appreciate the sculptural elements of plants.\n\nSome are better suited to this approach than others and generally it is the later flowering varieties that survive best.\n\nFor frost covered outdoor artworks look for plants that have rigid stems, bulky seed cones or a light airiness that can stand up to rain and wind.\n\nThose whose wild origins lie in wind-drenched prairies and grasslands such as coneflower (Echinacea) and sneezewort (Helenium), both from North America, produce large dark cones that show up well against lighter colours or grasses.\n\nThe small red, pink or white flowers of the Great Burnets (Sanguisorbas), especially the taller ones, look good as they darken to a mass of tiny suspended black buttons.\n\nYarrow (Achillea) is another plant of meadow origin whose dried, cloud-shaped umbels in winter provide a horizontal contrast to the verticals of say foxgloves or Veronicas.\n\nAny sea holly (Eryngium) is sculptural from the word go, but I think many of those with pale blue flowers in summer actually look better in winter.\n\nBut the granddaddy of all hoary floral delights has to be to the delicate spent flower clusters of fennel (Foeniculum vulgare), if only because the crystallised flowers are suspended so high up in the air.\n\nIn my front garden I use the feathery foliage and then bright yellow flowers of fennel to form an ideal backdrop to the rich, rust red cones of Helenium Moorheim Beauty.\n\nOrnamental grasses are also one of the highlights of the winter garden.\n\nRobust grasses that stand up to battering from wind and rain but retain much of their golden hue through winter, such as Stipa gigantea, Molinia varieties and Calamagrostis, look fabulous when covered in frost in the crisp winter sun.\n\nTo make these golden jewels stand out even more why not contrast them with the bright red and yellow branches of a dogwood (Cornus) or red-leaved evergreen plants such as Berberis, Phormium or Nandina domestica.\n\nTo this frosty combination you can add a few evergreens for additional structure.\n\nThe strappy leaves of Crocosmia, Phormium or Libertia grandiflora will give further shape.\n\nAnd there is a certain appeal in the repeated rounded forms of topiarised box, yew or beech \u2013 if placed in a pattern on open ground they can look a secret gathering of plants in some parallel world.\n\nHave fun with winter colour but give your garden a rest in February.\n\nIt's sleeping through the bitter cold of winter .. much like the rest of us would like to.\n\nRobert Kennett can be contacted on 07968 113546 or via his website robertkennett.co.uk.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Gardening blog: Robert Kennett on the delights of a frost covered winter garden","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","county":"Dorset","zipCode":"DT10","state":"England","countryCode":"GB","zipArea":"North Dorset","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Blackmore Vale Magazine","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"170187327","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Blackmore Vale Magazine","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://blackmorevale.co.uk","publisher":"Local World"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204535663","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:30:20Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.blackmorevale.co.uk/images/localworld/ugc-images/276450/Article/images/30089556/15822487.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

The refills are totally free with no pressure to buy anything else, but we find often people buy a coffee or cake at the same time.\n\n\"Refill not only saves customers money but, for a café, it can also cut down rubbish and recycling bills. Most importantly it means they can show that they're a friendly business that cares about their customers and local environment, which is increasingly important in building customer loyalty.\"\n\nWhilst most businesses involved are cafes and coffee shops, there are some more unusual ones: a couple of charity shops, a community centre and even an estate agency have agreed to join the scheme.\n\n#RefillDorset is also supported by Dorset Wildlife Trust, which has all its visitor centres as refill stations and sells refillable bottles at Kimmeridge and Chesil Beach.\n\nJulie Hatcher, Dorset Wildlife Trust's Marine Awareness Officer said: \"Plastic drink bottles and lids are among the commonest types of litter we find on beaches. The Refill campaign aims to tackle this problem at its source and offer people a healthier and cheaper option at the same time.\n\n\"All Dorset Wildlife Trust's centres are happy to offer free tap water refills. Just call in and ask.\"\n\nEach business proudly displays a 'Refill here' blue sticker in their window to show customers it's ok to ask.

At that time, many other enterprises also tried to seek opportunities from overseas markets, but they did not move ahead and waited to see if FPT could succeed with its business before making decisions. \n\nFive to eight years later, some companies begin exploiting foreign markets. \n \nRelating the story, Binh said if everyone tries to \u2018play safe\u2019, they will waste time and miss great opportunities. Foreign markets have helped FPT grow rapidly, as they are vast markets which bring a high growth rate of hundreds of percent. \n FPT and Viettel, two large telecom and IT corporations, which have reaped initial successes from making outward investments, say they will join forces with other Vietnamese businesses to exploit foreign markets.  \nIn the last few years, FPT has been providing IT and telecom services to Cambodia, Bangladesh and Myanmar to get money to offset decreases in the domestic market. \n\nNguyen Trung Chinh, president of CMC, said foreign markets brought the 200 percent growth rate to CMC last year and he believes the growth rate would be even more satisfactory in the time to come. \n\nAccording to Viettel\u2019s CEO Nguyen Manh Hung, people should not think that business should grow in the domestic market first before trying to reach foreign markets, because opportunities may be missed. \n\n\u201cBusinesses can develop the domestic and foreign markets just like walking on two feet,\u201d he said. \u201cThe domestic market will get saturated, and therefore, foreign markets will be the playing fields for enterprises that want to expand.\" \n\nViettel\u2019s success in overseas markets has inspired many other enterprises. Vuong Quang Khai, deputy CEO of VNG, admitted that VNG learned many lessons from Viettel when developing Zalo. \n\nAfter four years of providing the service and attracting 60 million users in Vietnam, Zalo decided to march towards Myanmar and it has attracted 4 million users in the market. \n\nAccording to Khai, once obtaining 60 million users, it would be very difficult to maintain high growth in the domestic market. In this case, it would be better to seek new development way in overseas markets. \n\n\u201cWe thought if we failed in Myanmar, we would still attack other important markets in ASEAN, Asia and non-Asian markets,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be good even if only two out of 10 markets bring success.\" \n\nTran Dinh Thien, head of the Vietnam Economics Institute, commented that it is the right time to apply policies to support Vietnamese enterprises so they can make money overseas.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Asia-Pacific latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Vietnam news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Southeast Asia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Vietnamese businesses make more outward investments","source":{"category":"Government","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"South-Eastern Asia","countryCode":"VN","country":"Viet Nam"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Mic.gov.vn","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"198292571","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"9"},"name":"Mic.gov.vn","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.mic.gov.vn"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204536231","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T10:08:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:30:20Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

This was just a mistake in something I hastily tweeted, not malicious fake news. \u2014 Dana Schwartz (@DanaSchwartzzz) Note that her website and Twitter bio both identify her as someone most of us would call a \u201cjournalist\u201d and she falls back on the dodge that she can\u2019t be held accountable for #FakeNews because, well, she has the correct politics and everyone knows it is only the right that does #FakeNews.\n\nAs I noted earlier in the week, this has become a familiar refrain from the media. The throw out stories of any kind with no sourcing and when caught out they plead \u201chonest mistake.\u201d You can compare Scharwtz\u2019s self-serving blame averting to her triumphal original tweet and see that she clearly thought it was true. Also, look at the number of RTs on the original tweet and compare that to the RTs on any of her explanations.

But now that Barclays is finally making tentative progress towards solving the problems that have plagued it since the Financial Crisis, can shares of the British bank catch up to those of the much smaller BGEO group? \n \nNow on the face of it, comparing BGEO, the holding company for Bank of Georgia, and Barclays seems a bit like comparing apples and oranges. However, a retail bank with low operating costs, a very profitable investment bank, no legacy misconduct issues and stunning profitability shows that Bank of Georgia is what Barclays should aspire to be. And the phenomenal returns of BGEO over the past five years show exactly why investors should cheer for this. \n \nThe driving forces behind its success have been steady mid-single-digit GDP growth for the past decade in Georgia, and a successful programme of taking market share from competitors by offering best-in-class retail banking capabilities. The bank now has around 30% market share in the country and growing scale has allowed it to keep operating costs much lower than comparable British banks. In first nine months of 2016, Bank of Georgia's cost-to-income ratio was a stunningly low 37.7%, while return on average equity was a very impressive 22.8%. \n  \nThis high level of profitability combined with top line growth boosted profits by 57.9% year-on-year to £112.2m in the first three quarters of 2016. And with return on equity steadily rising and the bank targeting 20% annual growth in the retail operation over the medium term, there's plenty of potential future profit growth. This is great news for investors as the bank's policy of returning 50% of profits in dividends means analysts are pencilling in a 3.5% dividend yield in the year ahead. BGEO shares are very pricey at 2.4 times book value, but if Bank of Georgia continues to impress, this lofty valuation could make sense in the long term. \n Cheap for a reason?  \nMeanwhile, shares of Barclays are still trading well below their tangible book value at 0.78. There's good reason for this. Return on tangible equity (RoTE) reduced year-on-year in the first nine months of 2016, from 5.8% to 4.4%, as the £44bn of non-core bad assets ran up a staggering £1.4bn loss. While management is making progress in divesting these assets, it's slow going and they will continue to be a drag on the overall group for some time to come. \n \nOn the bright side, core operations excluding exceptional items RoTE was a much better 10.7% in the period, driven by solid returns from the UK retail bank and stunning 21.3% RoTE from credit card operations. Unfortunately, fantastic returns from Barclaycard continue to be obscured by the billions of bad assets on the books as well as the massive transsatlantic investment bank whose RoTE in the period was a meagre 8.7%. \n \nWith billions of bad assets still to be sold, a management team clinging to an investment bank whose returns lag its cost of capital, a stubbornly high cost-to-income ratio of 73%, and dividends slashed, I'd bet on Barclays' shares continuing to underperform BGEO's in the coming years. \n \nIan Pierce has no position in any shares mentioned. The Motley Fool UK has recommended Barclays. We Fools don't all hold the same opinions, but we all believe that considering a diverse range of insights makes us better investors.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Finance latest","group":"Finance"},{"name":"European banking news","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Investment banking news","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Banking news","group":"Finance"},{"name":"UK business news","group":"Business"},{"name":"European business news","group":"Business"}],"title":"Can this tiny bank continue to outperform Barclays plc by over 150%?","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"GB","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"AOL UK","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169662251","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"AOL UK","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Financials"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.aol.co.uk"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.fool.co.uk/company/BGEO+Group/?ticker=LSE-BGEO","http://www.fool.co.uk/company/Barclays/?ticker=LSE-BARC","https://www.fool.co.uk/help/disclaimer/what-does-it-mean-to-be-motley/"],"sequenceId":"695204542798","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:30:22Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The senior added nine of her game-high 19 points in the final quarter and grabbed 12 rebounds in the contest. \n \n\u201cIzzy was trying to do too much at the beginning of the year and now she is playing within herself and she is doing what she does best,\u201d Hoquiam head coach Mark Maxfield said. \u201cShe has a beautiful jumper and she has nice moves to the basket. She is very heady defensively and had lots of steals tonight.\u201d \n \nAberdeen (6-10) attacked the basket, jumped ahead early and led by three, 20-17, at halftime, but Hoquiam switched from its man-to-man defensive attack and came out in a 1-3-1 zone in the second half. The change forced the Bobcats the work the ball outside and the shots didn\u2019t fall for Aberdeen. \n \nThe Bobcats made just two shots over the first 6 1/2 minutes of the second half as the Grizzlies forced six turnovers and built a 5-point lead. \n \nThe teams traded the lead midway through the fourth quarter, but Hoquiam led 48-45 with 24 seconds left. On a missed foul shot by Hoquiam, it appeared Aberdeen\u2019s Angel Jones had grabbed the rebound. However, the referee ruled Jones had made contact with Hernandez on her way to the ball. Aberdeen head coach Jeff Niemi disagreed with the call and was assessed a technical foul. \n \nHernandez made three of her four shots and put the Grizzlies out of reach for good. \n \n\u201cI\u2019m really happy for our seniors,\u201d Maxfield said. \u201cIt has been a struggle this year and I think we are finally coming together. We are a man team, but we wanted to change the tempo and we weren\u2019t able to get our running game going on the man so I figured if we went to 1-3-1 they would have to shoot threes and I was hoping they\u2019d miss them and we could get our transition game going and it worked.\u201d \n \n\u201cIt was a fun game to coach and I was happy with how we played,\u201d Niemi said. \u201cIt is hard because it was a good game and I wish we could have had a chance to execute at the end. Unfortunately, that didn\u2019t happen. It was a tough pill to swallow, but it was a lot of fun. Both teams played really hard and I think we bring out a lot of good things out of each other and both teams brought up there game a little.\u201d \n \nAberdeen attacked the basket early in the contest and it paid off with five separate trips to the charity stripe in the first quarter. The Bobcats went 8-for-10 from the free throw line in the first eight minutes and grabbed a 12-6 lead. \n \nThe rivals traded buckets in the second with Aberdeen maintaining a narrow lead at half. \n \nHoquiam\u2019s defensive switch helped the Grizzlies grab control back in the third. Kyra Gallinger hit a 3-pointer to give Aberdeen the lead back midway through the quarter, but Hoquiam went on an 8-0 run, capped on a jumper by Hernandez, to pull back in front. \n \nHoquiam started out the fourth quarter with back-to-back layins from Maya Jump and looked to be running away with the game, but Aberdeen pulled back again. The Bobcats went on a 9-to-2 run, which included a 3-pointer by Jones and was capped by a steal and two free throws by Gallinger. \n \nAfter the technical with 22 seconds to go in the contest, Hoquiam shot 6-for-8 from the free throw line down the stretch to close the door on the Bobcats. \n \nRylee Vonhoff finished with eight points and six rebounds for the Grizzlies. \n \nThe Bobcats were led by 12 points and two steals from Glanz, while Gallinger finished with 10 points. Jones, Jillian Swor and Dani Buckman each added seven points for Aberdeen with Swor grabbing 12 rebounds and Buckman dishing out three assists. \n \nAberdeen travels to Centralia on Tuesday, while Hoquiam travels to Montesano on Friday. \n \nHoquiam 6 11 16 23 \u2014 56 \n \nAberdeen 12 8 11 14 \u2014 45 \n \nHoquiam (56) \u2014 Mode 5, Hernandez 19, Parson 2, Krohn 6, Vonhof 8, Cox 6, Jump 6, Bagwell 4, German.

Lower Columbia led by as many as 16 in the second half, but that came on a game-clinching 17-3 run after Grays Harbor got to within two, 57-55, with 8 minutes remaining. \n  \nSlowly, but surely, the Chokers got stops on defense and key baskets from sophomore sharpshooter Jacob Rainey, who led the team with 21 points. However, Rainey\u2019s teammates stepped up to support him and give GHC more options to score. \n \nAfter trailing 34-26 at the half, GHC got key baskets to close to within two for the first time since the early seconds of the game, 50-48, with 10:40 remaining. Three-point baskets from John Robinson and Kodi Leslie, along with drives from Rainey and Jordan Phillips and inside work from Malik Redmond, keyed the comeback. \n \nRainey scored four points on back-to-back possessions to keep the Red Devils from getting away and a top-of-the-key trey from Leslie trimmed the deficit back to two, 57-55, with 8:18 left. Then, the NWAC-ranked visitors got their run \u2014 a 17-3 sprint keyed by inside baskets from Elijah Cotton-Welch and Devin Johnson and two big 3-pointers from Keun Palu-Thompson \u2014 for a 74-58 lead with 3:41 remaining. \n \nGHC tried one last comeback, finishing the game with a 9-3 spurt, but ran out of time and possessions. \n \n\u201cI really think Lower Columbia is the best team in the NWAC and they are in our division,\u201d GHC head coach Alonzo Cole said. \u201cIf they play hard, we can beat them. We went into the half down by six and we felt like we could have been up by 10. (Jacob) knew he had to step up and be the alpha male out there. Since last year, he\u2019s our go-to guy. If we need the points, he\u2019ll get it. We just need a few other players to support him.\u201d \n \nRobinson added a double-double \u2014 10 points and 13 rebounds \u2014 for the Chokers and Phillips added 11 points. \n \nWomen \n \nRed Devils 69, Chokers 54 \n \nThe opportunities were there for Grays Harbor to stay close and make it rough on Lower Columbia in the opener of this divisional doubleheader, but the Chokers didn\u2019t take them. \n \nAfter playing toe-to-toe with the Red Devils for most of the first quarter, the Chokers watched the visitors take the game over by finishing the opening frame with a 15-3 run and a 28-17 lead that was never relinquished. GHC led 14-13 on a Alexia Thrower jumper from the top of the key with 3:13 left in the quarter before the run. \n \nAn evenly played second quarter ushered in haltime, a 42-30 Lower Columbia lead, and then Grays Harbor got a chance to get back into the contest. The Red Devils had a slow third quarter, giving away 11 turnovers and shooting just 4-for-13 from the field. \n  \nHowever, the Chokers couldn\u2019t take advantage \u2014 seven turnovers and just 2-for-15 shooting from the field \u2014 to fall further behind, 55-35, after three. The Red Devils emptied their bench in the fourth quarter and the Chokers finished the contest with a 16-6 run in the final 6 1/2 minutes. \n \n\u201c(LCC\u2019s) energy, coming in with 15 players, gave them the open holes they needed,\u201d GHC head coach Chad Allan said. \u201cOnce they hit those threes and took the lead, we\u2019d try to cut the lead.

She was my biggest ally. She gave everything, she gave a tremendous, very complex performance,\u201d Villeneuve, 49, told AFP at the Producers Guild Awards (PGAs) in Beverly Hills. \n \nTaking its cue from classics such as Close Encounters Of The Third Kind (1977) and Contact (1997), Arrival was filmed in Villeneuve\u2019s native Quebec for a relatively small US$50 million. \n \nAdams, 42, was universally lauded for her portrayal of Louise Banks, a linguist enlisted by the army after alien pods pop up worldwide, to help figure out what their occupants want. \n \nThe picture pairs Adams with fellow American Hustle star Jeremy Renner, playing against type as a shy, soft-spoken mathematician. \n \nThe best actress Oscar nominations went to Emma Stone (La La Land), Natalie Portman (Jackie), Ruth Negga (Loving), Isabelle Huppert (Elle) and Meryl Streep (Florence Foster Jenkins). \n \nVilleneuve told AFP he had spoken to Adams several times since the nominations and that she had been nothing but magnanimous. \n \n\u201cAmy Adams is the incarnation of grace,\u201d said the director, who made Sicario (2015) and has just finished filming the much-anticipated sequel to iconic sci-fi favourite, Blade Runner. \n \n\u201cShe just said to me, \u2018Danny \u2014 it\u2019s all right. The movie is nominated, you are nominated, it\u2019s all good. Don\u2019t think about it, please just celebrate.\u2019\u201d \n \nArrival was competing for best film at the PGAs alongside Deadpool, Fences, Hacksaw Ridge, Hell Or High Water, Hidden Figures, La La Land, Lion, Manchester By The Sea and Moonlight. \n \nBlade Runner 2049, which comes out in October, some 35 years after the cult neo-noir original, sees Harrison Ford reprising his role as Rick Deckard, this time opposite Ryan Gosling. \n \n\u201cIt was like the most powerful and intense cinematic experience of my life. It\u2019s tough to talk about it \u2014 I\u2019m still in it \u2014 but it was a very powerful experience,\u201d Villeneuve told AFP. \n \nDescribing his 74-year-old star as his \u201cchildhood hero\u201d, he admitted to being in awe of Ford when filming began last summer in Budapest, Hungary. \n \n\u201cA good thing is that Harrison is a very humble, very funny, generous human being. He broke the ice,\u201d Villeneuve said.

The Bucks have lost three in a row and eight of nine. \n\nBoston built a six-point lead in overtime, but Tony Snell hit consecutive 3-pointers to tie it at 108. Crowder made two free throws on the ensuing possession with 28 seconds to go and two more to seal it with 10 seconds left after Antetokounmpo missed a contested shot in the lane. \n\nThe Celtics got out to a double-digit lead quickly and never gave it up. Crowder scored eight of the Celtics' first 11 points to help Boston get out to a nine-point lead in the first 21/2 minutes. \n\nThat was just the beginning of what ended up as a 42-point first quarter for the Celtics. With Crowder leading the way with 11 points and Thomas chipping in 10, the Celtics picked apart the Bucks' defense on the way to 63.2 percent shooting from the field in the period in addition to 11-of-11 shooting from the free-throw line. Gerald Green put the exclamation point on the quarter by making a 25-footer before the buzzer that gave the Celtics a 42-27 lead after 12 minutes. \n\nIn that opening stanza, the Bucks got nothing from Antetokounmpo and Jabari Parker. Milwaukee's leading scorers combined to go 0-of-8 from the field as Michael Beasley shouldered the scoring load off the bench with 11 points. \n\nAntetokounmpo made his first three shots of the second quarter, including a pair of dunks, to highlight an 8-0 run that brought the Bucks within eight, but that was as close as they would get. That's because Thomas subbed back in and went on a tear. He got fouled shooting a 3-pointer and made all three free throws, made a 26-footer and a 30-footer and hooked a left-handed layup over Snell on the way to scoring 13 points in the final six minutes of the second quarter, putting him at 23 at the half.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"MATT VELAZQUEZMilwaukee Journal Sentinel"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: NBA - Milwaukee Bucks news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: NBA - Boston Celtics news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest scores","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Thomas shines again as Celtics hold off Bucks for 112-108 OT win","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Sacramento","zipCode":"95816","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Sacramento","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Sacramento Bee","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169672618","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4516"},"name":"Sacramento Bee","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Basketball","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.sacbee.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204555821","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:30:26Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Trump\u2019s executive order, signed on Friday, bars immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the US, halts refugees worldwide from entering the US for 120 days, plus bans Syrian refugees indefinitely. Protests ensued around the country, including at Logan, as passengers were detained or turned away. \n\nThis federal ruling applies to individuals from the seven countries in Trump\u2019s policy who \u201cabsent of the executive order, would be legally authorized to enter the United States.\u201d\n\nThe professors, Mazdak Pourabdollah Tootkaboni and Arghavan Louhghalam, are permanent residents of the United States who left the country for an academic conference, the petition said. They arrived at Logan around 5:30 p.m. Saturday and were held \u201csolely pursuant to an executive order issued\u201d by Trump, the petition said. Attorney Susan Church, who leads the New England chapter of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said the professors were released three hours later. \n\nThe immigration lawyers and the ACLU of Massachusetts filed the lawsuit on the professors\u2019 behalf. The judge\u2019s decision also ordered secondary screenings be limited to comply with the regulations in the executive order and that US Customs and Border Protection should notify airlines with incoming flights to Logan to ensure the court order is followed.\n\nAlso Saturday night, a federal judge in New York who have been detained at airports across the country should not be deported.\n\nAround 10 p.m., about 10 immigration lawyers gathered at the John Joseph Moakley Courthouse in a late-night attempt to ensure Massachusetts would be included in any national legal action. \n\nFor hours, the group of lawyers, mostly women, debated legal arguments and scan documents on their cellphones.

Now, renowned French designer Philippe Starck and peer Jerome Olivet are challenging the undisputed norm ten years later with their concept design for a post-iPhone smartphone. Called the Alo, the phone features no screen and instead relies on holograms, voice control and haptic feedback. An always-on camera would also track the user's face to aid with 3D hologram displays. \n \nCompletely removing the screen allows for Alo's much more fluid form. It incorporates a molded aluminum alloy core coated by a translucent, gelatinous exterior layer that not only provides vibration and heat-based feedback, but also heals itself in case of any scratches. While far from becoming reality -- the phone's operation relies on voice recognition far advanced than what's available today -- it's an interesting thought experiment on the current smartphone form.

Labour will not support any SNP plan to force another independence referendum on the people of Scotland.\"  \n \nThe expert group is also considering whether the Scottish pound's value should be pegged to sterling, the euro or allowed to float freely on the world's markets.  \n \nThe source added: \"The idea is to get way beyond where the debate was before - do we still use the pound or adopt our own currency - and come up with detailed analysis and proposals.  \n \n\"So not only do we have a strong case for whatever option is put forward but it is backed by the proper infrastructure so the case is entirely secure and that the Scottish Government can put it forward.\"  \n \nThe Scottish Greens have already backed the idea of a separate currency and the National Institute for Economic Research concluded it would be a \"prudent option\" should Scotland become independent.  \n \nHowever, the SNP would still have to overcome the fact that if an independent Scotland were to join the EU, it would have no choice but to adopt the euro under the Treaty of Maastricht.  \n \nLast night, a party spokesman said: \"The SNP has established a Growth Commission which, as well as making recommendations for measures to boost Scotland's economy, will consider the most appropriate monetary policy arrangements to underpin a programme for sustainable growth in an independent Scotland.

But generally speaking it\u2019s already set for the whole season.\u201d \n \nMouratoglou said numbers alone were not the main factor behind Serena\u2019s continuing hunger, even in her 20th year on tour. \n \n\u201cShe was not motivated by 22, she was motivated to win grand slams,\u201d he said. \n \n\u201cThat\u2019s her motivation. This won\u2019t change until she maybe one day wakes up and is not motivated to win grand slams, but for now she is. That\u2019s enough. The record is not the thing that makes her play.\u201d \n \nMouratoglou also said Serena would not obsess over the record of 24 held by Court. \u201cWith all the respect for Margaret Court, it was another era, the draws were like 16 players and they were not professionals. \n \n\u201cOf course, the record is here and we definitely want to beat it, but there was a professional era and the record was Steffi Graf.\u201d REUTERS","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: tennis news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Serena Williams to play fewer tournaments to aid grand slam quest","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"South-Eastern Asia","countryCode":"SG","country":"Singapore"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Today Online","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169666105","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Today Online","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Tennis","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.todayonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204565029","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:30:28Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

That person was awarded with 250 gallons of gas from Masco Petroleum. \n   \nThe annual Black and White Gala fundraiser for the United Way was held at the Quinault Beach Casino in Ocean Shores Saturday evening.

So this matter must not be left unattended to,\u201d the group appealed. \n \n\u201cWe call on Mr Agyarko to take legal actions to redeem his image because at his vetting, he gave us reasons why some decisions taken by the erstwhile Mahama administration were seen to be acts of corruption supervision and for him [Boakye Agyarko] to have allegedly made a u-turn to offer a bribe for his approval, then it is a cause for worry of which he must not let go and die a natural death.

Bishop TD Jakes tweeted: \n \n\u201cOur prayers for the family of @BishopEddieLong and @newbirthmbc during this time of loss. May the God of Peace comfort you.\" \n \nByron Cage, a worship leader at NBMBC, wrote: \n \n\u201cSee you in the rapture Bishop Eddie Long. It was my honour to serve New Birth for 12 years.\u201d \n \nLong\u2019s daughter Taylor put a loving tribute on Instagram, stating: \n \n\u201cI love you Dad. Thank you for being perfect. I cherish every moment I\u2019ve shared with you even up to your last breath. \n \n\u201cI don\u2019t blame God for wanting \nyou back, I would too.\u201d \n \nThese tributes are understandable. \n \nBishop Long, the son of a minister, was one of the black community\u2019s foremost religious leaders. During his years at NBMBC, the congregation grew from 300 to 25,000 members to become one of the foremost black megachurches in the US, achieving success attracting men \u2013 a demographic missing from many black churches \u2013 and running numerous youth projects and community programmes. \n \nBishop Long was a dynamic preacher, who exuded visionary leadership and strength. Many people from across the world were impacted by his ministry. \n \nOne high point in Long\u2019s ministry was when his church presided over the homegoing service of Coretta Scott-King, the widow of civil rights hero Martin Luther King. Four former US presidents were in attendance. \n \nAdditionally, for many years Long was a regular guest speaker at Kingsway International Christian Centre's (KICC) Gathering of Champions event. \n \nAlongside the positive and respectful tributes following Long\u2019s death, there were also negative ones. Some took to social media in the wake of his death to highlight the scandal that engulfed Long in 2010, when four young men filed lawsuits alleging that Long used his position to get sexual favours from them. Long denied the allegations and settled the case out of court \u2013 but his ministry was never the same. \n \nHe remained hopeful and trusting in God up until the end and was able to preach at NBMBC during Christmas and the New Year. \n \nLong is survived by Vanessa, his wife of 27 years, four children and three grandchildren. \n \nRead every story in our hardcopy newspaper for free by downloading the app.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Religion news","group":"Society"}],"title":"The legacy of Bishop Eddie Long","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","county":"Greater London","zipCode":"E14","state":"England","countryCode":"GB","zipArea":"Tower Hamlets","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Voice Online","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169698193","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"22"},"name":"Voice Online","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.voice-online.co.uk"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204579354","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:50:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:30:35Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Morty Ortega/ \n\nRelated content \n\n(CNN) - More protests against President Donald Trump's immigration policies are set for Sunday across the country after hundreds of demonstrators converged on airports the day before. \n\nProtests are scheduled Sunday in Washington, Orlando, Boston, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Seattle, and Chicago, mostly at airports. \n\nThis is the second weekend of demonstrations, with more than 1 million people coming out last weekend for the Women's March. \n\nOlivia Katbi Smith told CNN affiliate KATU she showed up Saturday at Portland International Airport because she believes Trump's immigration policies are cruel. \n\n\"I think it's horrific and terrible and we are basically condemning people to death by not allowing them to come here,\" she said. \n\nShe said the event appeared to be impromptu. She heard about it on Twitter and thinks most people did the same. \n\nIn New York City, a large crowd massed at John F. Kennedy International Airport to protest the detention of two Iraqis who were later released. \n\n\"Mr. President, look at us,\" said US Rep. Nydia Velazquez, a New York Democrat. \"This is America. What you have done is shameful. It's un-American.\" \n\nThe protesters gathered in Terminal 4 at JFK and carried signs reading, \"We are all immigrants!\" and \"No ban! No wall!\" \n\nSeveral New York officials showed support for the protests. \n\nGov. Andrew Cuomo ordered the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to reverse an earlier decision to restrict passage aboard the JFK Airport AirTrain to ticketed passengers and airport employees only. \n\nHe also instructed state police and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to assist with security and transportation for protesters. \n\n\"The people of New York will have their voices heard,\" Cuomo said. \n\nNew York Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted: \"What's happening at JFK is shameful. @NYCImmigrants Affairs Commissioner Nisha Agarwal is on the ground now working to help.\" \n\nAirport arrests \n\nOne of the detained Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh, was released early Saturday afternoon. He worked with the US government for 10 years after the United States invaded Iraq. \n\nThe other detained Iraqi, Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been granted a visa to join his wife, who worked for a US contractor in Iraq, and son, both of whom already live in the United States as refugees. Alshawi was released later Saturday. \n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union argued Saturday evening in a federal court in New York for a nationwide stay that would block the deportation of all people stranded in US airports under what the group called \"President Trump's new Muslim ban.\" \n\nA federal judge in New York granted an emergency stay Saturday night for citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries who have already arrived in the US and those who are in transit, and who hold valid visas, ruling they cannot be removed from the US. \n\nThat move limited part of President Trump's executive order barring citizens from those countries from entering the US for the next 90 days. \n\nRep. Jerrold Nadler, another Democrat from New York, said 10 other travelers were detained, but their status was unclear Saturday night. \n\nVirginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe joined protesters at Dulles International Airport outside Washington. \n\n\"This executive order is antithetical to the values that make America great, and it will make our country less safe,\" he said in a statement. \n\nIn Portland, one demonstrator carried a sign that said, \"Portland coffee comes from Yemen,\" one of the seven Muslim-majority nations on the no-travel list. \n\nLucia Martinez told KATU she used to be a \"hashtag activist\" but felt compelled to protest at the airport. \n\n\"This was the last straw,\" she said of Trump's policies. \"We're all immigrants.\" \n\nA group of community activists, attorneys and others gathered at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago. \n\nProtests also took place at airports in Boston; San Francisco, Denver, Dallas and Newark, New Jersey.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Political unrest news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Religion news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Protests against Trump's 'Muslim ban' continue","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Yuma","zipCode":"85364","state":"Arizona","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Yuma","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"KYMA KSWT KECY News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"553405030","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"6"},"name":"KYMA KSWT KECY News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Politics","Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.kyma.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204583259","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:30:37Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}
