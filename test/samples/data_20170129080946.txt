Large-scale looting of commercial and business premises and even motorists was reported from the 10 worst affected districts.\n\nIn a communication to senior officers in districts, the Haryana government last week directed that security of all major critical points like drinking water supply to Delhi in Karnal and Sonipat, traffic movement on the G.T. road (National Highway No 1) and roadways depots should be secured.\n\nHaryana Director General of Police K.P. Singh said earlier that if anyone was found indulging in any illegal activity or causing loss to public property, action would be initiated against him.\n\nChief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar has said people should refrain from participating in any agitation.

Without funds for an attorney, I accepted deferred probation. It has followed me my entire life. \n \nI graduated from college, law, and graduate school, yet I had to endure a hearing to ascertain my fitness to practice. It also caused employment rejection. \n \nLater, as assistant county attorney in El Paso, and elected district attorney in Willacy County, I routinely dismissed pot cases. Prosecutor\u2019s offices have limited budgets, yet mountains of cases. Dismissing marijuana offenses, allowed me to send more dangerous criminals to prison. \n \nEven probation for pot was wasteful. Curfews and reporting requirements should be for prowlers and burglars, not pot smokers. \n \nThis problem persists, as 620,000 Americans were arrested for pot last year. Yes, illegal marijuana creates jobs for probation officers, prosecutors, bailiffs, chemists, clerical staff and many more; however taxpayers get soaked. \n \nCalifornia and three other states legalized marijuana on Nov. 8. Voters were persuaded by the Colorado experience, where $2.4 billion in revenues and 17,000 jobs were created in legalization\u2019s first year. Some of this boom comes from visiting Texans. \n \nThe Denver Post polled, \u201cWould you repeal legalization?\u201d The answer; \u201cNo\u201d, by a 51 percent to 36 percent margin. Gallup\u2019s 2016 poll showed support for legalization has grown to 60 percent nationally, and recent studies demonstrate no increased use among youngsters since legalization. Colorado is booming, and other states want what they\u2019re smoking. \n \nThe old \u201cReefer Madness\u201d arguments against marijuana have been dispelled. Today\u2019s legalization opponents such as Insys Therapeutics, which develops synthetic painkillers, poured $500,000 into the \u201cNo\u201d vote in Arizona. It\u2019s these legal painkillers which cause so much addiction and harm. \n \nPrescription drugs increase our health costs and Big Pharma doesn\u2019t want competition. The Catholic Church was also a huge contributor, with the Boston Archdiocese donating $850,000 to oppose Massachusetts\u2019 marijuana initiative. \n \nOne lingering anti-pot argument is that people will ingest and drive. This happens anyway and it will be illegal everywhere. \n \nNot satisfied, opponents wonder how they will test for marijuana. Field tests still work, but how about we just arm each officer with a chocolate bar, and they could cuff the stoned drivers as they grab for it. \n \nLegalization will come eventually, as it\u2019s only the oldest age groups who are opposed. \n \nAn estimated 15 million Americans use marijuana regularly, and about half our population has admitted trying marijuana. \n \nMarijuana decriminalization bills for the 2017 Texas Legislature, have been filed, including one by El Paso\u2019s own Joe Moody. \n \nRepublicans are increasingly in favor, because of the fiscal benefits and individual freedom arguments. Democrats are already there, and almost everyone wants to decrease the power of the violent drug cartels who smuggle pot across our border. \n \nLet\u2019s legalize it, and have Mexico put up the wall to keep Texans from trafficking marijuana into their country. \n \nEl Paso attorney Steve Fischer has been a professor of criminology and a Texas State Bar director.

But they're better right now. Until we improve, they're going to keep beating us.\"\n\nRivers mostly sat and witnessed his team go down in the third quarter under an avalanche of Stephen Curry three-point slings and Warriors points that sent the Clippers to their eighth consecutive defeat to Golden State.\n\n\"If I won eight games in a row, I would have a mental edge,\" Rivers said.\n\nCurry, supposedly playing with a sore left quadriceps, detonated for 25 of his 43 points in the third quarter. He was five for eight from three-point range in the period, during which he seemed to be playing alone.\n\nFor the game he was 15 for 23 from the field, nine for 15 from three-point range.\n\nOf all the 72 points the Clippers surrendered in the first half, the most painful had to be when Curry eased up the court and casually and knowingly hoisted a three-pointer from half court that splashed through the net as the halftime buzzer sounded.\n\nThe fans went crazy. The Warriors celebrated, none more so than Draymond Green, who chest-bumped Curry so hard he fell on the court. Curry stayed on his belly for a few seconds, his arms extended.\n\nThe Clippers could only solemnly trudge to their locker room.\n\n\"We can talk about, like, being who we are. But who are we?\" Clippers guard J.J. Redick said. \"To me, we're the most inconsistent team, maybe in the league. Like, we're inconsistent. That's who we are. So, like, if we're going to be inconsistent, we can't expect to come in here and play these guys and be inconsistent and play well. It's not realistic.\"\n\nThe Clippers have lost four of five games since point guard Chris Paul had surgery for a torn thumb ligament that is expected to sideline him six to eight weeks.\n\nBut they will see the Warriors again Thursday night at Staples Center knowing it's going to take a better effort than this one.\n\nBlake Griffin, in his second game back after missing 18 games following right knee surgery, had 20 points for a Clippers team that was never in this game.\n\nThe total destruction by the Warriors notwithstanding, Rivers has been unsure what has put him in a weakened state.\n\n\"It has been three weeks now, so it's not been a fun stretch,\" he said. \"I'll get through it. I just want to find out what the hell it is to be honest.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"BRODERICK TURNERLos Angeles Times"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: NBA - Golden State Warriors news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: NBA - Los Angeles Clippers news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest scores","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Curry, Warriors clobber Clippers, 144-98","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Stanislaus","zipCode":"95350","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Modesto","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Modesto Bee","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657476","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"584"},"name":"Modesto Bee","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Basketball","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.modbee.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201179610","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:04:43Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.modbee.com/static/images/modbee/facebook.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

But they're better right now. Until we improve, they're going to keep beating us.\" \n\nRivers mostly sat and witnessed his team go down in the third quarter under an avalanche of Stephen Curry three-point slings and Warriors points that sent the Clippers to their eighth consecutive defeat to Golden State. \n\n\"If I won eight games in a row, I would have a mental edge,\" Rivers said. \n\nCurry, supposedly playing with a sore left quadriceps, detonated for 25 of his 43 points in the third quarter. He was five for eight from three-point range in the period, during which he seemed to be playing alone. \n\nFor the game he was 15 for 23 from the field, nine for 15 from three-point range. \n\nOf all the 72 points the Clippers surrendered in the first half, the most painful had to be when Curry eased up the court and casually and knowingly hoisted a three-pointer from half court that splashed through the net as the halftime buzzer sounded. \n\nThe fans went crazy. The Warriors celebrated, none more so than Draymond Green, who chest-bumped Curry so hard he fell on the court. Curry stayed on his belly for a few seconds, his arms extended. \n\nThe Clippers could only solemnly trudge to their locker room. \n\n\"We can talk about, like, being who we are. But who are we?\" Clippers guard J.J. Redick said. \"To me, we're the most inconsistent team, maybe in the league. Like, we're inconsistent. That's who we are. So, like, if we're going to be inconsistent, we can't expect to come in here and play these guys and be inconsistent and play well. It's not realistic.\" \n\nThe Clippers have lost four of five games since point guard Chris Paul had surgery for a torn thumb ligament that is expected to sideline him six to eight weeks. \n\nBut they will see the Warriors again Thursday night at Staples Center knowing it's going to take a better effort than this one. \n\nBlake Griffin, in his second game back after missing 18 games following right knee surgery, had 20 points for a Clippers team that was never in this game. \n\nThe total destruction by the Warriors notwithstanding, Rivers has been unsure what has put him in a weakened state. \n\n\"It has been three weeks now, so it's not been a fun stretch,\" he said. \"I'll get through it. I just want to find out what the hell it is to be honest.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: NBA - Golden State Warriors news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: NBA - Los Angeles Clippers news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest scores","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Curry, Warriors clobber Clippers, 144-98","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Merced","zipCode":"95340","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Merced","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Merced Sun-Star","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169661579","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"15"},"name":"Merced Sun-Star","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Basketball","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.mercedsunstar.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201181771","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:04:46Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

They play Adelaide twice and the three teams immediately above them once. \n \nIn the weekend's only other game, Dandenong (14-6) defeated Melbourne 78-66 to initially keep top spot, a position they held until Sunday's loss.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Narrow wins, but big WNBL prize for Sydney","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"AU","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Special Broadcasting Service","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169662250","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"168"},"name":"Special Broadcasting Service","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Sports"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.sbs.com.au/"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201182345","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:04:46Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 37 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Sebastian","zipCode":"72904","state":"Arkansas","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Fort Smith","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"4029 TV","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659416","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"195"},"name":"4029 TV","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.4029tv.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201190037","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:04:49Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 38 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Forsyth","zipCode":"27116","state":"North Carolina","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Winston Salem","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WXII 12","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169688608","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"92"},"name":"WXII 12","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wxii12.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201193175","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:04:48Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

She heard about it on Twitter and thinks most people did the same. \n \nIn New York City, a large crowd massed at John F. Kennedy International Airport to protest the detention of two Iraqis who were later released. \n \n\"Mr. President, look at us,\" said US Rep. Nydia Velazquez, a New York Democrat. \"This is America. What you have done is shameful. It's un-American.\" \n \nThe protesters gathered in Terminal 4 at JFK and carried signs reading, \"We are all immigrants!\" and \"No ban! No wall!\" \n \nSeveral New York officials showed support for the protests. \n \nGov. Andrew Cuomo ordered the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to reverse an earlier decision to restrict passage aboard the JFK Airport AirTrain to ticketed passengers and airport employees only. \n \nHe also instructed state police and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to assist with security and transportation for protesters. \n \n\"The people of New York will have their voices heard,\" Cuomo said. \n \nNew York Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted: \"What's happening at JFK is shameful. @NYCImmigrants Affairs Commissioner Nisha Agarwal is on the ground now working to help.\" \n \nAirport arrests \n \nOne of the detained Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh, was released early Saturday afternoon. He worked with the US government for 10 years after the United States invaded Iraq. \n \nThe other detained Iraqi, Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been granted a visa to join his wife, who worked for a US contractor in Iraq, and son, both of whom already live in the United States as refugees. Alshawi was released later Saturday. \n \nThe American Civil Liberties Union argued Saturday evening in a federal court in New York for a nationwide stay that would block the deportation of all people stranded in US airports under what the group called \"President Trump's new Muslim ban.\" \n \nA federal judge in New York granted an emergency stay Saturday night for citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries who have already arrived in the US and those who are in transit, and who hold valid visas, ruling they cannot be removed from the US. \n \nThat move limited part of President Trump's executive order barring citizens from those countries from entering the US for the next 90 days. \n \nRep. Jerrold Nadler, another Democrat from New York, said 10 other travelers were detained, but their status was unclear Saturday night. \n \nVirginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe joined protesters at Dulles International Airport outside Washington. \n \n\"This executive order is antithetical to the values that make America great, and it will make our country less safe,\" he said in a statement. \n \nIn Portland, one demonstrator carried a sign that said, \"Portland coffee comes from Yemen,\" one of the seven Muslim-majority nations on the no-travel list. \n \nLucia Martinez told KATU she used to be a \"hashtag activist\" but felt compelled to protest at the airport. \n \n\"This was the last straw,\" she said of Trump's policies. \"We're all immigrants.\" \n \nA group of community activists, attorneys and others gathered at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago. \n \nProtests also took place at airports in Boston; San Francisco, Denver, Dallas and Newark, New Jersey. \n \nTM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Eight years in the NFL spent on underperforming teams, and having seasons potholed by injuries have that effect.\n\nSo when the veteran was asked this week whether the chance to earn a ring was on his mind when he signed with the Patriots this offseason, he didn\u2019t hesitate to answer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the whole reason I came here,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody wants to win.

Rodgers shot a 67 as he goes for his first PGA Tour victory.\n\n\u201cExactly where I want to be, in the last group here,\u201d Snedeker said. \u201cThis is obviously a tough golf course. There\u2019s a lot of guys within a couple shots of the lead, so it doesn\u2019t really mean a whole lot.\u201d\n\nSnedeker and Rodgers were at 9-under 207, and Snedeker has been around long enough to know that a share of the 54-hole lead means nothing.\n\nFifteen players were within three shots of the lead.\n\nFormer Oregon star Aaron Wise shot a 73 and is nine shots off the lead with a 216.\n\nThe last time Snedeker had a share of the 54-hole lead at Torrey Pines was in 2007, his rookie year.\n\n\u201cTiger won,\u201d he said with a laugh as he walked out the door.\n\nTiger Woods was long gone after missing the cut, along with Dustin Johnson, Jason Day and Rickie Fowler. Phil Mickelson is still very much in the picture after a 68 left him four shots behind.\n\nRodgers is the latest player from the high school class of 2011 with a chance to shine, an athletic and powerful player who has been patiently waiting his turn. He picked up a little extra motivation from watching one of his best friends, former roommate Justin Thomas, sweep the Hawaii swing. \n\nBefore Thomas, it was Jordan Spieth who picked up big trophies at an alarming rate.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t sit here and say it hasn\u2019t been hard at times,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cObviously, these are my best friends so I\u2019m happy every time they have success.

Oil plummeted \u2014 bottoming out at around $26 a barrel \u2014 energy firms declared bankruptcy and more than 80,000 local workers lost their oil-related jobs over the past two years. While this wasn\u2019t as bad as the infamous oil bust of the 1980s and the city\u2019s economy is now more diversified, it still hit Houston hard. Office space and newly built apartments stood empty, car sales fell and local tax revenues dropped.\n\nEconomists say the worst seems to be over and the Super Bowl will be a welcomed addition to the ongoing recovery as the game is expected to provide up to a $350 million economic impact as well as a psychological boost as local leaders and residents get a chance to show off Houston and highlight that the city is no longer only about oil and traffic, with a much more diverse economy and population.\n\n\u201cHouston is demonstrating that we are so much more than the current price of oil,\u201d said Jeff Shellebarger, the locally based president of Chevron North America Exploration and Production Co.\n\nStephen Klineberg, a sociology professor at Rice University in Houston, said the Super Bowl spotlight will also help show people how Houston has become the most ethnically diverse major city in the U.S. About one in four residents are foreign-born, and minorities make up more than 70 percent of the population, according to Census figures.\n\n\u201cMost Americans have no idea about Houston,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not the city that is part of the image that so many people have of cow town and rodeos. The city is happy to have the world come to Houston and see what we\u2019ve done.\u201d\n\nSallie Sargent, president & CEO of the Houston Super Bowl Host Committee, said the game will also be \u201ca great way to put a shot in the arm of the people of Houston ... By showcasing Houston on a world stage, it gives people a change to have a point of pride and really bolster them around how things are turning around.\u201d\n\nAbout 140,000 visitors are expected to come and fill up most of the city\u2019s 84,000 hotel rooms. More than 1 million people are expected to stop by downtown\u2019s Discovery Green, a nearly 12-acre park that will be hosting the free Super Bowl Live fan festival.\n\nHouston Mayor Sylvester Turner said about $1.5 billion has been spent on various downtown projects to get ready for the Super Bowl, including a new 1,000-room hotel and a refurbishment of the convention center.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just excited (for) all the people in this city and I know we are going to be a super host for the Super Bowl,\u201d he said.\n\nFormer NFL player Owen Daniels said after retiring last year, it made sense for him to return to Houston, where he spent eight seasons as a tight end with the Texans, to raise his family.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a super-friendly city,\u201d said Daniels, who also played with Baltimore and Denver. \u201cThere is the country Texas flavor to it. But then you have people from all over the world, a melting pot of people here. Hopefully the people that are traveling (to the Super Bowl) recognize that.

They started out playing together in Compton, Calif., hardly a hotbed for tennis, with their father Richard and mother Oracene as coach and mentor. And they still practice and travel together around the world.\n\nThey met for the first time at a major at Melbourne Park in 1998 \u2014 Venus won that one. In 2003, when the younger of the Williams siblings completed her \u201cSerena Slam\u201d of four consecutive titles, Venus was on the other side of the net. She didn\u2019t reach another Australian final for 14 years.\n\nWhen Serena sat on the court, holding both arms up to celebrate on Saturday, Venus walked over to her sister\u2019s side of the net for a hug.\n\n\u201cThis was a tough one,\u201d Serena said. \u201cI really would like to take this moment to congratulate Venus, she\u2019s an amazing person \u2014 she\u2019s my inspiration. \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way I would be at 23 without her \u2014 there\u2019s no way I would be at one without her. Thank you Venus for inspiring me to be the best player I can be and inspiring me to work hard.\u201d\n\nAsked if it felt awkward to be on the receiving end of so many losses to her sister, the 36-year-old Venus didn\u2019t flinch.\n\n\u201cNo, because I guess I\u2019ve been here before,\u201d she said. \u201cI really enjoy seeing the name Williams on the trophy. This is a beautiful thing.\u201d\n\nVenus won the last of her seven majors in 2008 at Wimbledon. She didn\u2019t make the second week of a major for a few years as she came to terms with an energy-sapping illness after being diagnosed with Sjogren\u2019s syndrome in 2011. And she only made it back to the semifinals last year at Wimbledon.\n\nAnother shot at a first Australian Open title was a sign of progress, she said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly where I want to be standing during these Grand Slams, is on finals day, having an opportunity,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the highlight of all this, is to be in that moment.\u201d \n\nSerena Williams, meanwhile, enjoyed the fact she made history in Melbourne. Only Margaret Court, with 24, is in front of her in terms of overall Grand Slam singles titles, although the Australian great won 13 of her Grand Slams before the Open era began in 1968.\n\n\u201cMy first Grand Slam started here, and getting to 23 here, but playing Venus, it\u2019s stuff that legends are made of,\u201d Serena said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have written a better story.\u201d\n\nThe match didn\u2019t live up to its classic billing, with nerves and tension causing uncharacteristic mistakes and unforced errors, with four consecutive service breaks before Venus finally held for a 3-2 lead in the first set. That included a game when Serena had game point but served back-to-back double-faults and three in all to give up the break.\n\nThere were six service breaks in total. Both players were relatively subdued, except when Serena smashed her racket in the third game.\n\nAfter the fourth game, however, Serena Williams didn\u2019t face another break point in the 1-hour, 22-minute match.\n\n\u201cSerena Williams, that\u2019s my little sister,\u201d Venus said. \u201cI have been right there with you. Some of them I have lost right there against you. It\u2019s been an awesome thing, your win has always been my win.\u201d\n\nMore Tennis","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"John Pye"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Serena slams way to record","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Lane","zipCode":"97408","state":"Oregon","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Eugene","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Register-Guard","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169668374","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4312"},"name":"Register-Guard","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.registerguard.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201201613","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:04:52Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://registerguard.com/csp/cms/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=3Ho2yvIH57d4lMEyq17Ng8$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYtZtyUJRUROjdJUx$uAGNSYWCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg"}],"video":[]}}

That experiment in Bihar had succeeded and there was a view among common people that there could be a coalition of like-minded secular people or people who are close to being secular or those who were once secular but because of political compulsions lost their way and again want to take that path, so those people should come together and contest elections,\u201d Khan told PTI. He was asked about the Samajwadi Party\u2019s decision to contest the UP Assembly polls in coalition with Congress, a party which he has often criticised in the past and has accused of making false promises to the Muslim community. Khan, who is the most prominent Muslim face of the SP, said the Muslim community has a long history of association with the Congress from the days of the freedom struggle and people including Maulana Azad, M A Jinnah and Allama Iqbal have been Presidents or prominent leaders of the party. The Congress was even the champion of the freedom struggle and even 50 years after Independence, the Muslims stayed with Congress despite the fact that there some were big incidents, Khan said.\n\nHowever, the Babri Masjid incident, the \u2018shilanyas\u2019 episode etc. did hurt and led to introspection as to whether the community had made a mistake by not going to Pakistan in 1947, he added. \u201cWe are not giving (Congress) a clean chit. We are choosing the lesser evil,\u201d Khan said. Asked to elaborate on his comment, the SP leader said it is lesser evil in a way that while he does not know what compulsions Congress may have had, but the \u201cvery agenda of BJP and RSS is against the weak, Dalits, backward and minorities.\u201d\n\nKhan, however, added that this is not a time to discuss these issues and these questions could be answered better after the elections. Asked about his opinion on various corruption charges levelled against the Congress, Khan said demonetisation is in itself a much bigger \u201cscandal\u201d than anything that may have happened during a Congress regime. On whether the Congress-SP tie up would be extended to 2019 Lok Sabha elections as well, Khan said it can\u2019t be said now but added that the the tie up in \u201c2017 would yield benefits in 2019 as well.\u201d\n\nAsked about the BSP\u2019s bid to woo the Muslim community, as the party has given 97 tickets to candidates belonging to the community, Khan said that if the party really wanted to please Muslims it should have given them 403 seats. \u201cThis is less, they should have given them 403 seats, if they really wanted to please the Muslims. Muslims have brought their (BSP) government in the state four times. We deserve this much,\u201d he said. Asked to comment on the differences between SP leader Mulayam Singh and his son UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, Khan said that he had all along tried to be a bridge and tried to ensure that SP comes to power in the state.\n\nKhan also also referred to remarks made by RSS leader Manmohan Vaidya in Jaipur, saying that despite the \u201cheavy loss\u201d in Bihar, RSS leaders keep making remarks against reservation as it is an attempt to test the mood of the people. \u201cThey are waiting for the day when they would say that there should be no reservation and the reaction is mild or not there. Then they would withdraw it,\u201d Khan alleged.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Samajwadi Party opted for \u2018lesser evil\u2019 Congress in UP: Azam Khan","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"Indian Express","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169660698","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"351"},"name":"Indian Express","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.indianexpress.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201202608","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:02:22Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:04:52Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/09/azam-khan-4801.jpg?w=480"},{"url":"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/09/azam-khan-4801.jpg?w=450"}],"video":[]}}

It shook off an 0-for-8 first half to make 5 of 11 after halftime, starting with Jackson\u2019s back-to-back makes which provided the first of several leads in a back-and-forth half. Kansas led throughout the final seven minutes.\n\nThe Jayhawks shot 59 percent in the second half, and Jackson finished with 20 points and 10 rebounds.\n\n\u201cI find making threes gets kind of contagious,\u201d the freshman said. \u201cI think it kind of opened it up for us a little bit.\u201d\n\nKansas got this big victory at the end of a tumultuous week for the program.\n\nAfter the Jayhawks\u2019 85-69 loss Tuesday night at No. 18 West Virginia, campus police in Lawrence announced they were investigating an alleged rape of a 16-year-old girl at the team\u2019s dormitory. Coach Bill Self said Thursday that the investigation had become a \u201cmajor distraction.\u201d Self also suspended forward Carlton Bragg Jr. this week for a violation of team rules that he said wasn\u2019t connected to the investigation.\n\nMason had 13 second-half points, and Landen Lucas contributed 13 points \u2014 including a layup with 4:41 remaining to cap an 11-0 run for a 69-59 lead \u2014 and five rebounds before fouling out. \n\nKentucky (17-4) got within 77-73 before Sviatoslav Mykhailiuk\u2019s two free throws with 16 seconds left sealed the hard-fought win.\n\n\u201cCoach told us to focus on the things we can control and we did a pretty good job of that,\u201d Mason said. \u201cWe just have to do that, not get distracted and focus on what we can control.\u201d\n\nKansas used a variety of defenses, including a zone, to effectively slow Kentucky. Malik Monk and Derek Willis each had 18 points for the Wildcats (17-4), but Monk had just six in the second half as the Wildcats dropped their second straight.\n\nThe Jayhawks forced 17 turnovers for 21 points and outscored Kentucky 44-34 in the paint. Devonte\u2019 Graham had 12 points, and Mykhailiuk provided a big lift in place of Bragg with eight points.\n\n\u201cI thought this could get ugly really fast,\u201d Self said. \u201cThe key part of the game for us was the last five minutes to get it to five (32-27) at halftime. ... Then Josh\u2019s two threes to start the second half took the lid off, and we were pretty good after that.\u201d \n\nAlso Saturday\n\nNo. 3 Gonzaga 96, Pepperdine 49: Przemek Karnowski scored 16 points and Silas Melson had 15, helping Gonzaga (22-0, 10-0 West Coast Conference) easily roll past Pepperdine. \n\nNo. 5 Baylor 78, Mississippi 75: Manu Lecomte scored 17 points, Johnathan Motley and Jo Lual-Acuil Jr. each added 16 and Baylor rallied to beat Mississippi in the SEC-Big 12 Challenge. Baylor (20-1) rallied from a 15-point deficit in the first half to win its fifth straight game. The Bears trailed 50-40 early in the second half.\n\nSyracuse 82, No. 6 Florida State 72: Andrew White scored 24 points, John Gillon had 21 points and matched his career high with 11 assists, and Syracuse beat Florida State. Syracuse (13-9, 5-4 Atlantic Coast Conference) won its second straight close game and gained its first victory over a ranked team. Tyler Lydon had 14 points, 11 rebounds and a career-high six blocks for the Orange, who led 44-26 at halftime. Tyler Roberson added 10 points and seven boards. Dwayne Bacon and Jonathan Isaac each had 19 points for Florida State (18-4, 6-3), and Xavier Rathan-Mayes finished with 16. Isaac also grabbed 12 rebounds and blocked two shots.\n\nMiami 77, No. 9 North Carolina 62: Freshman Bruce Brown scored a career-high 30 points, and Miami snapped North Carolina\u2019s seven-game win streak. The Hurricanes (14-6, 4-4 ACC) had success with a swarming zone defense. The Tar Heels\u2019 point total was a season low and 27 below their average, and they shot only 35 percent. Miami also had a 41-36 edge in rebounding against the Tar Heels (19-4, 7-2), who lead the nation in that category. Justin Jackson led North Carolina with 21 points. Joel Berry II went 0 for 8 and scored two points, 13 below his average.\n\nGeorgetown 85, No. 11 Butler 81: L.J. Peak scored 22 points, and Jessie Govan beat the shot clock with a key three-pointer with 1:03 left, helping Georgetown top Butler. Govan finished with 20 points as the Hoyas (12-10, 3-6 Big East) stopped the Bulldogs\u2019 14-game home winning streak with their second victory against a ranked opponent this week. They were coming off a 71-51 victory against No. 16 Creighton on Wednesday. Kelan Martin scored 22 points for Butler (18-4, 7-3), which lost for the first time in five games.\n\nGeorgia Tech 62, No. 14 Notre Dame 60: Josh Okogie made a fast-break layup as time expired, Tadric Jackson had a career-high 25 points and Georgia Tech earned another surprising victory over a ranked opponent. The inexperienced Yellow Jackets (13-8, 5-4 ACC), in their first year under coach Josh Pastner, already had two wins over top-10 opponents before taking down the Fighting Irish (17-5, 6-3). V.J. Beachem scored 23 points for the Irish, and Bonzie Colson had 13 points and 13 rebounds.\n\nNo. 15 Wisconsin 61, Rutgers 54: Ethan Happ scored seven of his career-high 32 points in overtime, helping Wisconsin get the win at Madison Square Garden. Happ was 12 for 18 from the field. He was the only player for Wisconsin (18-3, 7-1 Big Ten) to shoot above 50 percent; the Badgers shot 33.3 percent (20 for 60) from the field, including a 3-for-25 performance from three-point range.\n\nNo. 16 Creighton 83, DePaul 66: Khyri Thomas scored 18 points and Marcus Foster had 15, leading Creighton (19-3, 6-3 Big East) to the win at home.\n\nNo. 17 Duke 85, Wake Forest 83: Luke Kennard hit a three-pointer with 6.6 seconds left, helping Duke rally for the road win. Kennard finished with 34 points \u2014 one shy of his career high \u2014 and Grayson Allen had 19 for the Blue Devils (16-5, 4-4 ACC). Kennard was 6 for 6 from three-point range and Allen went 5 for 11 from that distance. \n\nNo. 18 West Virginia 81, Texas A&M 77: Jevon Carter had 19 points and nine rebounds, helping West Virginia hold on for the win. West Virginia opened a 51-31 lead on Daxter Miles Jr.\u2019s three-pointer early in the second half. But the Mountaineers (17-4) needed two free throws by Esa Ahmad with 4.4 seconds left to finish off the Aggies.\n\nNo. 21 Saint Mary\u2019s 72, Santa Clara 59: Jock Landale had 20 points and 11 rebounds and Saint Mary\u2019s (19-2, 9-1 West Coast Conference) held off a late charge by Santa Clara.\n\nNo. 22 Maryland 85, Minnesota 78: Justin Jackson had a career-high 28 points and 10 rebounds, and Maryland (19-2, 7-1 Big Ten) earned its sixth straight win.\n\nNo. 23 South Carolina 63, Missouri 53: Sindarius Thornwell had 16 points and 11 rebounds, and South Carolina beat Missouri. Rakym Felder had 12 of his 13 points in the first half for the Gamecocks (17-4, 7-1 SEC).\n\nNo. 25 Florida 84, Oklahoma 52: Kevarrius Hayes scored a career-high 20 points to help Florida (16-5) roll to the road win in the Big 12-SEC Challenge.\n\nTop 25 Women\n\nNo. 1 UConn 91, Houston 42: Gabby Williams had 19 points and 10 rebounds to lead UConn (20-0, 8-0 American Athletic Conference).\n\nNo. 24 Green Bay 65, Cleveland State 51: Mehryn Kraker scored 21 points for Green Bay (19-2, 10-0 Horizon League).\n\nNo. 25 Kansas State 74, Oklahoma State 69: Kindred Wesemann scored a career-high 34 points for Kansas State (16-6, 6-4 Big 12.\n\nMore College Basketball","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Kansas leaves up on Kentucky at Rupp","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Lane","zipCode":"97408","state":"Oregon","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Eugene","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Register-Guard","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169668374","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4312"},"name":"Register-Guard","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.registerguard.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201205709","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:04:54Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://uploads.registerguard.com/branding/fb2_app-icon_300x300.png"}],"video":[]}}

California voters approved Proposition 64 in November, which legalizes the recreational use of marijuana. The state has until Jan. 1, 2018, to begin issuing licenses for adult-use pot shops. \n Associated Press   \nFor example, numerous offenses that were previously felonies now are misdemeanors or simple infractions and some offenses, such as possession of an ounce or less of marijuana by an adult 21 or older, are no longer illegal. Possession of an ounce or less by individuals younger than 21 still is illegal and continues to be a $100 infraction. \n   \n\"Basically, some conduct that was criminal before isn't criminal now,\" said San Luis Obispo County Assistant District Attorney Lee Cunningham. \"There are circumstances where (charges) could be a misdemeanor or a felony. It will definitely change the way law enforcement handles (marijuana-related calls).\" \n   \nOn average, 14,000 people a year are arrested in California for marijuana offenses \u2014 a half million individuals were arrested in the last decade \u2014 but with Prop. 64 now on the books, thousands of people no longer will be going to jail for smoking pot, Lyman said.  \n   \nFor example, in all cases, juvenile offenders under 18 won't be subject to criminal punishment (incarceration) but to drug education and community service, which Lyman said is a victory for marijuana reform and criminal justice. \n   \n\"The No. 1 way kids get into the criminal justice system is through marijuana offenses,\" Lyman said. \"Now children can't be arrested or go to jail. That pipeline is closed altogether. Arrest is off the table.\" \n   \nSanta Barbara County Chief Probation Officer Lupe Rabago said the most serious charge among juveniles has shifted over time with a decline in property offenses to an increase in narcotic/drug offenses. \n   \nAdditionally, teens who committed marijuana-related crimes prior to the passage of Prop. 64 and turned 18 after Nov. 8 now can apply to have their records sealed. That means the federal government can't turn down those individuals for student loans based on past criminal convictions, Lyman said. \n   \nAlso, people serving time in jails and prison for marijuana-related offenses can petition the courts for early release or reduced sentences, if the criminal justice changes apply to them. \n   \n\"It's all retroactive,\" Lyman said. \"The criminal justice pieces (of Prop. 64) were huge.\" \n  +2    \nIn this Sept. 16, 2015 file photo, customers shop for marijuana inside a recreational marijuana store, in Denver, Colorado. California voters legalized marijuana for recreational use in November, and the state has to sort through how to implement the new regulations. \n Associated Press   \n Get news headlines sent daily to your inbox  \n   \nBut if pot smokers, or the public in general, were expecting to see sweeping changes in how the state deals with recreational marijuana soon after Nov. 8, they likely will have months to wait, if not the remainder of the year. \n   \n\"I don't know anybody who has noticed any difference since Prop. 64 has passed,\" said Dale Gieringer, CalNORML (National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws) director. \"There has been no impact on day-to-day activity. The big change will come with the cannabis clubs and lounges.\" \n   \nPresently, there are no adult-use pot shops in California. Only registered medical marijuana patients can walk into a dispensary and buy cannabis. However, under Prop. 64, it's not only legal for adults over 21 to possess marijuana, they can also share their pot without fear of arrest. Public consumption, however, still is illegal.  \n   \n\"I could share with you and it would be completely legal,\" Lyman said, adding law enforcement could attempt to arrest an individual for sharing their cannabis but that the officer would \"be wrong in the eyes of the law.\" \n   \nBoth Gieringer and Lyman don't believe the state will begin issuing licenses to establish pot shops any time soon. The state has to sort through how to implement Prop. 64 first, but the deadline for Sacramento to start issuing licenses to those planned cannabis clubs and pot shops is Jan. 1, 2018. \n   \nCities and counties have the ability to put different rules in place.  \n   \n\"Prop. 64 laid out the rules, but it didn't implement them,\" Gieringer said. \"There are two parallel licensing systems with slightly different rules. It's going to be whenever local governments start allowing on-site consumption.\" \n   \nApril Charlton   covers Santa Barbara County for Lee Central Coast Newspapers.

It\u2019s almost as if the game didn\u2019t really end, like someone pushed the pause button so they could resume the rivalry in a couple of days. \n\nIt did end, even if the final score \u2014 Oregon State 43, Oregon 40 \u2014 would have looked better on a halftime box score. The Ducks had a chance in the final minutes, but just like the 11 previous meetings, the Beavers found a way to win. \n\nNow that the teams have gone to their separate corners, let\u2019s talk halftime adjustments. For the Ducks, the biggest adjustment is this: How much can a team grow up in 37\u20091/2 hours? The Ducks played Oregon State to a dead heat for most of the night, but in the last two minutes, the Beavers\u2019 experience took over. Senior Sydney Wiese called her own number and hit a three-pointer in the corner. Then Wiese stole the ball from Oregon freshman Sabrina Ionescu, leading to a layup from junior Breanna Brown. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got veterans making plays,\u201d Rueck said. \u201cI think that\u2019s what you can expect.\u201d \n\nThe Beavers lost a lot from last year\u2019s Final Four team, but they\u2019re still rock solid. Picked fifth in the preseason, they\u2019re now 19-2 with a legitimate shot at a third straight Pac-12 title. \n\nOregon, meanwhile, is still figuring things out. The Ducks seem caught between two extremes, no longer young but not yet fully mature. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve kind of stopped internally, as a coaching staff, talking about our youth,\u201d coach Kelly Graves said last week. \u201cEverybody knows we\u2019re starting three freshmen and we have five freshmen in our rotation. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a young team, but they\u2019re 20 games in now. They\u2019ve had to grow up a little bit, and I think most of them have.\u201d \n\nSomehow, though, we were talking about youth again Friday night, if only to acknowledge the obvious. With the game on the line, Oregon State had players who had won Pac-12 titles and played in the Final Four. Oregon had players who were getting their first taste of the Civil War rivalry. \n\n\u201cThey just have veteran kids who have been through these wars, and they win most of them,\u201d Graves said. \u201cExperience never hurts, especially when it\u2019s good experience.\u201d \n\nOregon is wildly talented, and the Ducks are only going to improve as the season goes along. At 14-7, they\u2019ve put themselves in position for an NCAA Tournament bid if they finish strong. \n\nIonescu is a star in the making, the Pac-12\u2019s version of Russell Westbrook. Post player Ruthy Hebard is putting up Jillian Alleyne-type numbers as a freshman. The only frustrating part is knowing the Ducks can be much better than they already are. \n\nIt\u2019s easy to focus on Oregon\u2019s youth, but between Lexi Bando and Maite Cazorla, the Ducks have two guards who have played big minutes in the Pac-12. They have the pieces to be good right now, not just sometime in the future. \n\nIn Graves\u2019 first season, the Ducks lost back-to-back Civil Wars by scores of 70-37 and 77-48. The next year, it was 60-33 and 59-45. Believing they could win this game was half the battle, and in that sense, Friday night was a success. \n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a belief in them,\u201d Rueck said. \u201cThey\u2019ve had some success. It\u2019s the third year of coach Graves\u2019 tenure, so it\u2019s a natural progression for them. They believe they can win and should win, and that might have been a question for last year\u2019s team.\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s true, past Oregon teams brought some mental baggage into meetings with the Beavers. That\u2019s one advantage of playing a bunch of freshmen: no bad memories popping up at crucial moments. \n\nAt some point, though, the Ducks will need to snap their losing streak or risk passing it on to another generation. Friday night proved they can compete, but when it comes to beating the Beavers, they still haven\u2019t found a way. They had 37\u20091/2 hours to figure it out.

There\u2019s not enough drama. It\u2019s not real NFL football.\n\nBut Incognito, a Buffalo Bills guard, is like the vast majority of the 88 players invited to this all-star gathering Sunday night. He sees the Pro Bowl more as a celebration of achievement and as a way to thank the fans.\n\nHe wouldn\u2019t change a thing.\n\n\u201cIn my mind it\u2019s as good as it should be,\u201d Incognito said. \u201cYou really can\u2019t ask guys to come out here and fly around at full speed when we\u2019ve been off for the last two or three weeks. And some guys are just coming down here after conference championship games. Maybe make it more fan interactive, get the fans involved more, do more of the skills competition.\u201d\n\nThe NFL has seemed open to ways to energize its end-of-the-year showcase that is now sandwiched between conference championship and Super Bowl weeks. A few years ago the league broke from the traditional AFC-NFC Pro Bowl matchup and allowed celebrity coaches to draft two teams.\n\nNow, in hopes of giving the game a lift, the NFL has moved the Pro Bowl from Hawaii to Orlando, where it has become more of a weeklong event, complete with a re-imagined Skill Showdown. The AFC-NFC matchup has also returned after three years of nonconference games.\n\nStill, it remains to be seen if the NFL can continue selling a game that bears little resemblance to the product it puts on the field during the season. The players come to the Pro Bowl to have fun, not get hurt and maybe win.\n\n\u201cThis Pro Bowl for me in a sense is special because you are coming here to celebrate what you\u2019ve accomplished,\u201d said New York Giants receiver Odell Beckham, Jr. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of fun.\u201d\n\nSeattle Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman says the intensity would rise and more invited players would show up if the NFL gave them their weekly game salaries. Under the collective bargaining agreement, each player from the winning team will make $61,000 this week and the losing players will take home $30,000.\n\n\u201cYou pay them what you are paying them and you get this performance,\u201d Sherman said. \u201cIt\u2019s a different element. ... I guarantee you less guys would miss the Pro Bowl if you told them you are going to pay them their normal salary for one more game.\u201d\n\nFormer NFL player and coach Herm Edwards says the game as played now is fine. He says the Pro Bowl is not about the game, it\u2019s about the fans and the players giving back. Thousands of fans have been out at ESPN\u2019s Wide World of Sports complex this week watching both the AFC and NFC practice.\n\nAfter the practices were over, most of the players signed autographs and took pictures in the laid-back atmosphere. All of the practices are short and glorified walk-throughs, and the players are mostly having fun with each other and the fans.\n\n\u201cWe are all ambassadors to this great game of football, and how you conduct yourself once you leave this practice field is more important than how you play the game,\u201d said Edwards, who now works as analyst. \u201cThe fans aren\u2019t going to remember the game. The fans remember if Odell Beckham, Patrick Peterson, or if Drew Brees takes a picture with them, signs an autograph.\u201d\n\nEdwards, however, understands the criticism. He even admits, as a football purist, he doesn\u2019t watch the Pro Bowl.\n\nBut he says if the game does become more fiercely contested it would come at a cost that players, teams and even fans may not want to pay.\n\n\u201cThe only way to make it better is you do this: If you want all of them to show up, make the game worth $500,000,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cThey will all show up and now they play. Here\u2019s the problem: When one of them gets hurt you have the same problem.\u201d\n\nOakland Raiders general manager Reggie McKenzie acknowledges being torn when his players are selected for the Pro Bowl. On one hand, he is excited for their recognition. On the other, he\u2019s concerned about injuries.\n\nMcKenzie would be in favor of more of skills challenge than a game where key players can be injured.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a risk,\u201d said McKenzie, who will have four players representing the AFC on Sunday. \u201cI cringe every time I go to practice, but it\u2019s the nature of the game. It\u2019s what it is. But you do everything you can to set your safety-type precautions. What else can you do? Not play? I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right.\u201d\n\nMore NFL","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Terrance Harris"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"All-star showdown finds newest iteration","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Lane","zipCode":"97408","state":"Oregon","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Eugene","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Register-Guard","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169668374","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4312"},"name":"Register-Guard","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.registerguard.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201206686","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:04:52Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://registerguard.com/csp/cms/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=vUspAzMxBdnkXEV$o7BF7c$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYtJw6EuYOlP2hT1C6Z4nNrMWCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg"}],"video":[]}}

But they're better right now. Until we improve, they're going to keep beating us.\" \n\nRivers mostly sat and witnessed his team go down in the third quarter under an avalanche of Stephen Curry three-point slings and Warriors points that sent the Clippers to their eighth consecutive defeat to Golden State. \n\n\"If I won eight games in a row, I would have a mental edge,\" Rivers said. \n\nCurry, supposedly playing with a sore left quadriceps, detonated for 25 of his 43 points in the third quarter. He was five for eight from three-point range in the period, during which he seemed to be playing alone. \n\nFor the game he was 15 for 23 from the field, nine for 15 from three-point range. \n\nOf all the 72 points the Clippers surrendered in the first half, the most painful had to be when Curry eased up the court and casually and knowingly hoisted a three-pointer from half court that splashed through the net as the halftime buzzer sounded. \n\nThe fans went crazy. The Warriors celebrated, none more so than Draymond Green, who chest-bumped Curry so hard he fell on the court. Curry stayed on his belly for a few seconds, his arms extended. \n\nThe Clippers could only solemnly trudge to their locker room. \n\n\"We can talk about, like, being who we are. But who are we?\" Clippers guard J.J. Redick said. \"To me, we're the most inconsistent team, maybe in the league. Like, we're inconsistent. That's who we are. So, like, if we're going to be inconsistent, we can't expect to come in here and play these guys and be inconsistent and play well. It's not realistic.\" \n\nThe Clippers have lost four of five games since point guard Chris Paul had surgery for a torn thumb ligament that is expected to sideline him six to eight weeks. \n\nBut they will see the Warriors again Thursday night at Staples Center knowing it's going to take a better effort than this one. \n\nBlake Griffin, in his second game back after missing 18 games following right knee surgery, had 20 points for a Clippers team that was never in this game. \n\nThe total destruction by the Warriors notwithstanding, Rivers has been unsure what has put him in a weakened state. \n\n\"It has been three weeks now, so it's not been a fun stretch,\" he said. \"I'll get through it. I just want to find out what the hell it is to be honest.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"BRODERICK TURNERLos Angeles Times"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: NBA - Golden State Warriors news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: NBA - Los Angeles Clippers news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest scores","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Curry, Warriors clobber Clippers, 144-98","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Horry","zipCode":"29578","state":"South Carolina","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Myrtle Beach","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Myrtle Beach Sun News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657695","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1140"},"name":"Myrtle Beach Sun News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Basketball","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.myrtlebeachonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201211248","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:04:55Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It shut down his former team and then the potent Packers to get to the title match with New England.\n\nBefore Quinn begins figuring out how to figure out Brady, Bill Belichick and the rest of the Patriots, his first task is simply guiding the Falcons down a path they aren\u2019t familiar with.\n\nRegardless of how that Super Bowl turned out two years back, at least Quinn has traveled this way twice before, including a romp over Denver in February 2014, when his D was too much for Peyton Manning and the Broncos.\n\n\u201cFor a lot of guys, playing in their first divisional game a couple weeks ago, and playing in their first NFC championship game, and all those experiences are new,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cYou have to have awareness for those. And this experience is different, also. I want to fully recognize that.\n\n\u201cHowever, when we do get to the game, it\u2019s still going to be the game. There\u2019s a lot of hype that leads up to it. There\u2019s more media exposure that goes along with it. But our process of getting ready doesn\u2019t change.\n\n\u201cOur intent of how we\u2019re going to play doesn\u2019t change. The attitude and identity that we want to play with doesn\u2019t change. So those things are going to stay really consistent and really the same.\u201d\n\nReally consistent and really the same is what can be expected from the other side. No team or coaching staff is better at planning for a specific opponent than the Patriots. Belichick, defensive coordinator Matt Patricia and offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels will devise strategies that can rob Atlanta of its most dangerous options.\n\nIf that means shutting down All-Pro receiver Julio Jones, that\u2019s where New England will focus. If it means neutralizing NFL sacks leader Vic Beasley Jr., that\u2019s also where the Patriots will concentrate efforts.\n\nThis is old hat for Belichick, in his record seventh Super Bowl as head coach (he\u2019s 4-2). The spotlight in this matchup will glare on Quinn, and not just because he\u2019s more personable and entertaining.\n\nJust how will he handle the biggest challenge of his career?\n\nTechnically, he\u2019s already into it. Speaking of Brady\u2019s prolific offense \u2014 yes, Atlanta\u2019s was even more prolific in 2016, but the season\u2019s final game is an entirely different scenario \u2014 Quinn was spot-on.\n\n\u201cNumber one, they\u2019re difficult to defend,\u201d he said. \u201cThey use a variety of different formations, personnel groups. They\u2019ve got a huge playbook from the pass game into the run game, the gap schemes, trap schemes and run game, quick game. So I would say it\u2019s offense that\u2019s well-versed. They have different ways to attack you.\u201d\n\nQuinn knows his defense must be doing just as much attacking. He need look no further back than the Patriots\u2019 rout of Pittsburgh last Sunday to see what happens when a team takes the conservative route.\n\nFortunately for the Falcons, Quinn, like mentor Pete Carroll, is often a turn-it-loose coach. Those units that helped carry Seattle to the top of the NFC and to a Lombardi Trophy were assertive, relentless and, well, downright nasty.\n\nHe needs for those traits to spill over into this Super Bowl.\n\nQuinn also must make sure offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan, in what appears to be his final game with Atlanta before taking over as head coach in San Francisco, attacks from the outset, too. Trying to outsmart the Patriots isn\u2019t the trick to winning. Outplaying them is.\n\nWhile Quinn assesses those challenges, Belichick dryly explains what his coaches can use from two years ago.\n\n\u201cYeah, sure, they have some of their own characteristics and of course the players are different, so that makes it different. But schematically there is quite a bit of carry-over,\u201d Belichick said of Seahawks-Falcons similarities.\n\n\u201cI think just kind of at first glance it might be a little more pressure from Atlanta than Seattle ran, but you know, Seattle did some of it, too.\n\n\u201cI think overall the schemes are very similar, so the players that you can relate to those schemes are. Both teams have them: (Kam) Chancellor and (Keanu) Neal,\u201d Belichick said of the big-hitting safeties for Seattle and Atlanta.\n\n\u201cGo right down the line. They\u2019re similar. They play a similar position in a similar defense, so that\u2019s the player. I\u2019m not saying their skills are the same, but that\u2019s what they do.\u201d\n\nNo one is saying the skills of the head coaches are the same right now, at least judging by the resumes. But one thing to remember about Dan Quinn is that he won\u2019t back off.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the best way to take on New England.\n\nMore NFL","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Barry Wilner"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Quinn gets another shot at matching wits with Belichick","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Lane","zipCode":"97408","state":"Oregon","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Eugene","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Register-Guard","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169668374","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4312"},"name":"Register-Guard","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.registerguard.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201214270","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:04:56Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://registerguard.com/csp/cms/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=pY4faniHBMgSSo71fMVcPs$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYs$B59cEbeIBI6xdH_btEj5WCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg"}],"video":[]}}

Walton  said. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotta figure something out. That\u2019s been the story of the season.\u201d \n \nMissouri fell to 5-15 overall and 0-8 in SEC play. \n \nThe Tigers opened the game with a 7-0 run but cooled down quickly after that, scoring just 15 points the remainder of the half. Jordan Geist , Russell Woods  and Walton were the only three Missouri players to score in the first period.  \n \nThe Tigers stayed strong on defense though, making for an ugly contest. South Carolina\u2019s two leading scorers, Sindarius Thornwell  (19.6 ppg) and P.J. Dozier (13.9 ppg), combined to shoot seven for 28 from the field and two for 11 from beyond the arc.  \n \n\u201cObviously, not a great offensive performance by us, but Missouri had a lot to do with it,\u201d South Carolina coach Frank Martin said. \u201cWatching them on film, it\u2019s easy to see they fight you, they guard you.\u201d \n \nMissouri failed to translate its success on defense to offensive efficiency. The Tigers shot a season-low one for 17 (5.9 percent) from 3. The dismal 3-point percentage contributed to another sub-40 percent shooting night from Missouri.  \n \n\u201cObviously, [the Gamecocks] are the best three-point defensive team in the league,\u201d Missouri coach Kim Anderson said. \u201cThey certainly padded that lead after tonight. I thought we settled. We had a really hard time getting the ball inside for awhile.\u201d \n \nThe Tigers eventually attacked the rim and finished with 36 points in the paint compared to USC\u2019s 12. The Gamecocks scored 41 of their 63 points from either beyond the 3-point line or at the charity stripe.  \n \nThornwell led South Carolina with 16 points and 11 rebounds.  \n \nWoods led the Tigers with a career-high 18 points and eight rebounds. The senior forward has posted double-digit point totals in three of his last four games. Walton finished with 12 points on three-for-eight shooting. No other Tigers finished in double figures. \n \nMissouri will hit the road to take on Florida (16-5, 6-2) on Thursday night in Gainesville, Fla. \n \nYou can follow Charlie Clarke on Twitter at  @CWClarke18 . \n \nWant more  BlackAndGoldIllustrated.com  coverage?

Saturday night's ruling came in response to a challenge filed on behalf of two Iraqi men detained Friday night at JFK International Airport and impacted up to 200 others held across the country. \n \nAn unknown number of others intending to come back to the United States are trapped in other countries, unable to board planes. \n\n \nJudge Ann Donnelly's emergency stay, issued after an emergency hearing in Brooklyn, does not allow those detained at airports and those  in transit Saturday to enter or re-enter the United States. Her ruling, however, prevents the government from returning them to their home countries. Dozens of airport arrivals remain in limbo, unable to enter the country. \n \nThe judge also ordered the federal government to turn over a list of everyone currently being detained. \n \nShe did not rule on the constitutionality of Trump's order. And the order did nothing to quell the uncertainty and chaos at U.S. entry points caused by the order, issued without notice and little or no guidance to immigration agents on how to handle those arriving. \n\n \nTrump made no exception for people already vetted and admitted into the country legally but who were out of the country when he signed the executive order. \n \nOne of the Iraqi men, who was handcuffed at JFK Airport, worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Army in Iraq for 10 years. He had been granted a special immigrant visa. He was among dozens of people stopped at airports around the United States on Saturday. At Chicago's O'Hare International Airport , as many as 18 people were reportedly detained, including children and a man with a green card returning from a family wedding in Saudi Arabia . The detentions at the nation's major airports moved thousands of people to arrive at airports in New York, Chicago, Boston, San Francisco and other cities to protest, chanting \"let them in\" and \"this is what democracy looks like.\" \n \n\"We won,\" said the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Voting Rights Project, Dale Ho, reacting to the ruling. \n \nJack Vimo, policy analyst for the National Immigration Law Center, said the lawyers for the two JFK detainees met four crucial factors: \n the executive order causes irreparable harm; they have a likelihood of success on merits; there is no harm to the government; there is a likelihood of receiving class certification. \nVimo tweeted that the ACLU informed the judge the government was putting someone on a plane back to Syria. The judge saw that as putting someone at risk of irreparable harm. \n \nThe ACLU said it will continue to file suits on behalf of anyone who is stopped. \n \nIt was not clear if the government would appeal the judge's ruling. If it does, both sides will file briefs and a hearing will likely be held within days. \n\n \nShortly after the ruling, another judge, hearing a similar case in the federal court in Virginia, struck another blow against Trump's order. \n \nJudge Leonie Brinkema ordered that the government refrain from deporting any green-card holders being detained at Dulles International Airport and allow lawyers to meet with the detainees. \n\nA third federal judge - this one in Washington - also ordered a stay. \n\nJudge Thomas Zilly granted an emergency stay forbidding the government from removing two individuals from the United States until a hearing next week. \n\nThere are also cases pending in Chicago, New York, and other cities. \n \nTrump's executive order \u2014 which exempts certain diplomats traveling to the United States but does not mention those legally residing in the country as lawful permanent residents or with student or employment visas who might be returning to the U.S. \u2014 has created a new class of detainees in the United States. \n\n \nLawyers involved in the case heard in Brooklyn put the number of those held at 100 to 200. \n \nWhile many of Trump's executive orders have been met with criticism for their message, the immigrant ban has already had real impact on real people. \n \nThe seven countries in the order are not named but officials say they include Iraq, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Iran, Yemen and Sudan. Trump's order also bans the resettlement of refugees for four months and indefinitely suspends the entry of Syrian refugees. \n\n \nPeople who had been given visas to enter the United States after putting their families at risk by helping American troops were stopped as they exited airplanes arriving in airports in New York, Philadelphia, Boston, Dallas, and other cities. \n \nThe lawyers for two Iraqis who had been granted visas to enter the United States and were detained at John F. Kennedy airport, also are seeking class certification so that they can similarly represent all individuals covered by the executive order. That includes people with approved refugee applications, holders of valid immigrant and non-immigrant visas and other individuals from the seven countries banned by the executive order but who would have otherwise been granted legal admission to the U.S. \n \nWhen signing the order, Trump said it was aimed at keeping out \"radical Islamic terrorists.\" \n \nLawyers consulted by ProPublica said the ban could apply to hundreds of thousands of people from these countries who already live in the U.S. under green cards or on temporary student or employee visas. Reuters reported that green card holders from the seven countries who are now out of the U.S. will have to be cleared on a case-by-case basis to re-enter. \n \nA State Department statement reviewed by the Wall Street Journal but not been officially released says the ban would also apply to citizens of those seven countries who hold dual nationality. A federal law enforcement official told The Associated Press that those already in the U.S. with a visa or a green card would be allowed to stay. \n \nA senior administration official pushed back on the idea that the order was a Muslim ban, listing several predominantly Muslim countries that were not affected by the ban. \n \n\"We\u2019re dealing with a relatively small universe of people,\" the official said. \"It\u2019s important to keep in mind that no person living or residing overseas has a right to entry to the U.S.\" \n \nAsked about the immigration executive order on Saturday, Trump said it was not a Muslim ban. \n \n\"It\u2019s working out very nicely,\" he said. \"You see it at the airports, you see it all over.\u201d \n \nThe administration is still working to define \"in transit\" for the purposes of the hardship exemption for refugees who have been approved to enter the United States but are currently in a third country, according to the official. \n \nThe ACLU has lawyers stationed at airports across the country. \"If you know someone entering country, tell them not to sign anything before talking to lawyer,\" the ACLU tweeted . \n \nEven after the stay was issued Saturday night, it wasn't immediately clear what would happen to refugees and immigrants detained at airports across the country. \n \nAt JFK International Airport in New York City, dozens of attorneys huddled in the Terminal 1 arrivals hall attempted to explain to anxious family members what would happen to their relatives, who were still in federal custody. \n \nJennifer Johnson, another attorney volunteering Saturday at JFK, said she and others were still being denied access to the detainees. She said that tried to deliver a printed copy of the stay to the airport's CBP headquarters, but officers wouldn't accept it \u2014 so she slipped it under the door. \n \n\"Where are our clients? Where are our friends? Where are our family members?\" she said. \"Let's talk about the people still detained.\" \n\n \nSoon after, one Syrian woman in a wheelchair was released from Terminal 8 at JFK. \n \nIn Chicago, where the international terminal was packed with protesters, both inside and out, tearful reunions took place amid cheers as some detainees were released. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, responding to the O'Hare detentions, blasted the president's actions. \n \nTrump's actions \"have tarnished America's standing as a beacon of hope for the free world,\" Emanuel saidin a statement. \"Following the stay that was granted this evening, I am calling on the federal government to immediately produce a list of the names of anyone currently being detained at O'Hare or Midway airports, and calling on those unjustly affected to immediately be released and allowed access to legal counsel.\" \n\n\nAfter the judge's ruling in Brooklyn, those detained in Chicago were released. \n \nNBC Philadelphia reported two Syrian families detained at Philadelphia Airport were sent home on a return flight. The New York Times reported that the trip of a Syrian family of six headed for a new life to Ohio had been called off. According to the Times, a young Iranian woman and her family were ordered to leave a flight that had stopped in Istanbul. \n\n \nSEE ALSO: \n \nHameed Khalid Darweesh, one of the Iraqis detained at JFK, had worked on behalf of the U.S. in Iraq for 10 years and the other, Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, was coming to join his wife and young son who live in Houston. \n\n \nDarweesh and his family were granted special immigrant visas, according to the lawsuit. Between 2003 and 2013, he worked for the U.S. military and two U.S. government projects. Because of his association with the U.S. Armed Forces, the lawsuit states he was directly targeted twice. To obtain the special immigrant visa, Darweesh had to obtain a Chief of Mission approval from the embassy, a lengthy process that determines whether the applicant provided a \"faithful and valuable service to the United States.\" \n \nAfter receiving COM approval in January 2015, he and his family were granted the visas on Jan. 25, 2017. The suit states that they immediately boarded a flight to the U.S. because of the sensitive and dangerous nature of Darweesh's situation. \n \nDarweesh was later released from detention. Photos posted to Twitter by New York representatives Jerry Nadler and Lydia Velazquez showed Darweesh standing with the two representatives past the passport control and customs section of the airport. \n \nAt a press conference outside the airport, Darweesh thanked those who supported him. \n \n\"This is the humanity, this is the soul of America,\" he said. \n \n\"I'm very happy, really I forget what all I faced, whatever happened to me.\" \n \nAsked by a reporter what he thought of America, Darweesh replied that \"America is the greatest nation, the greatest people in the world.\" \n \nDarweesh worked as an interpreter for Brandon Friedman, who posted a photo of the two from 2003. \n \nThe second man, Alshawi, had been given a Follow to Join Visa to be with his wife and young son. His wife worked as an accountant for a U.S. contractor in 2006, as did her brother, which made them a target for insurgents, according to the lawsuit. She applied for refugee status for her and her son in 2011 and the two currently live in the country as lawful permanent residents. \n \nAlshawi's wife, who identified herself as D to the New York Times , said their 7-year-old son did not know that his father was coming home. \n \n\u201cIt was a surprise for him,\u201d she told the Times. \n \nNew York representatives Nydia Velazquez and Jerry Nadler, went to the airport to help those being detained. Velazquez says she was told by CBP agents that they are waiting for direction from the Department of Homeland Security to act. A protest at JFK  Saturday targeted the detention. \n \nChants of  \"hey hey JFK, no more fascist USA,\" and \"no hate, no hear, Muslims are welcome here,\" could be heard coming from the crowd. Around 300 people were gathered across the street from Terminal 4 at JFK near the arrivals area and the number was swelling. \n \nSpeaking at the protest, Becca Heller, director of the International Refugee Assistance Project, said in addition to Alshawi there were 10 others being detained at JFK but the organization was unable to take legal action on their behalf because their names had not been released.

But they're better right now. Until we improve, they're going to keep beating us.\" \n\nRivers mostly sat and witnessed his team go down in the third quarter under an avalanche of Stephen Curry three-point slings and Warriors points that sent the Clippers to their eighth consecutive defeat to Golden State. \n\n\"If I won eight games in a row, I would have a mental edge,\" Rivers said. \n\nCurry, supposedly playing with a sore left quadriceps, detonated for 25 of his 43 points in the third quarter. He was five for eight from three-point range in the period, during which he seemed to be playing alone. \n\nFor the game he was 15 for 23 from the field, nine for 15 from three-point range. \n\nOf all the 72 points the Clippers surrendered in the first half, the most painful had to be when Curry eased up the court and casually and knowingly hoisted a three-pointer from half court that splashed through the net as the halftime buzzer sounded. \n\nThe fans went crazy. The Warriors celebrated, none more so than Draymond Green, who chest-bumped Curry so hard he fell on the court. Curry stayed on his belly for a few seconds, his arms extended. \n\nThe Clippers could only solemnly trudge to their locker room. \n\n\"We can talk about, like, being who we are. But who are we?\" Clippers guard J.J. Redick said. \"To me, we're the most inconsistent team, maybe in the league. Like, we're inconsistent. That's who we are. So, like, if we're going to be inconsistent, we can't expect to come in here and play these guys and be inconsistent and play well. It's not realistic.\" \n\nThe Clippers have lost four of five games since point guard Chris Paul had surgery for a torn thumb ligament that is expected to sideline him six to eight weeks. \n\nBut they will see the Warriors again Thursday night at Staples Center knowing it's going to take a better effort than this one. \n\nBlake Griffin, in his second game back after missing 18 games following right knee surgery, had 20 points for a Clippers team that was never in this game. \n\nThe total destruction by the Warriors notwithstanding, Rivers has been unsure what has put him in a weakened state. \n\n\"It has been three weeks now, so it's not been a fun stretch,\" he said. \"I'll get through it. I just want to find out what the hell it is to be honest.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"BRODERICK TURNERLos Angeles Times"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: NBA - Golden State Warriors news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: NBA - Los Angeles Clippers news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest scores","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Curry, Warriors clobber Clippers, 144-98","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Ada","zipCode":"83707","state":"Idaho","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Boise","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Idaho Statesman","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169669368","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2631"},"name":"Idaho Statesman","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Basketball","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.idahostatesman.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201224776","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:05:01Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

But here are some things to consider: \n Instead of a home theater, most of us really want something else, like a multi-purpose media room with a larger than usual flat screen TV and game boxes where friends and family can gather for the big games as well as the movies. Maybe you want to use traditional recliners and sofas rather than theater seats. It could be a place as well where you will stream TV programs, movies and music from the Internet. You might also want to eat in that room; maybe you want a small refrigerator for drinks and a sink. You can do all that in a great room or maybe in a dining room or spare bedroom you never use. Or maybe you want to take over all or part of a garage and do a remodel.  Setting up your entertainment space, as you probably know, can cost well into the thousands. If your budget is limited, shop on the Internet for discounted equipment. But always focus on getting the best possible video equipment. Sound quality is important, too, but video is often more important. By the way, prices are dropping all the time while quality is improving, so shop around at several places.  For a sleek, finished look, some homeowners run wires for equipment through walls instead of having them visible all over the room. If you\u2019re comfortable with doing the wiring yourself, fine; but if you\u2019re not sure how to do it, hire a professional. By the way there\u2019s a trend toward using floor standing or bookshelf speakers rather than in-the-wall speakers. These more visible speakers often produce clearer audio. Soundbars are also a possibility.  If you\u2019re planning a traditional type theater with rows of seating, be very careful about the sight lines from all areas of the room. You may need risers to ensure that the back rows of your \u201caudience\u201d have an unobstructed view of the screen. But once you\u2019ve built that riser, it\u2019s tough to change it later on.  More basics to keep in mind if you\u2019re planning more of a real theater: Try to use a rectangular room with the screen and speakers on a short wall; the fewer windows the better. Wall-to-wall carpeting will improve sound; if you have concrete block walls, they must be covered with drywall. Don\u2019t buy too big a screen for the size of your room; you shouldn\u2019t have to move your head from side to side to take in all the action.  Your media room will probably also become a social networking site where phones and tablets can be used to change channels and control the sound system.

The things he was saying really struck a chord. \n \n\u201cI thought he was absolutely on the ball. He wasn\u2019t giving generic answers on anything. He was thought-provoking. \n \n\u201cStanding there, I was evaluating him \u2013 blank canvas \u2013 and I was super impressed. \n \n\u201cI don\u2019t care if Ian Cathro has \u2018never played the game\u2019, because he has been coaching it for years. \n \n\u201cFor the last three or four of those, he has been doing it with top players and top managers, including a Champions League winner in Rafa Benitez. \n \n\u201cHe has been learning from the best. \n \n\u201cHow many Scottish managers right now, today, at any level, have been under a Champions League winner for any amount of time?\u201d \n \nRoss breaks off, searching for an analogy, rapidly finding one. \n \n\u201cPut it this way,\u201d he offers. \u201cIf you want to be a lawyer, you want to go to Harvard, don\u2019t you? \n \n\u201cWhy? Because when you go to Harvard, you learn from the best, you get the benefit of all the first-class experience they have assembled there. \n \n\u201cOnce you\u2019ve got that, then you go and make your own way as a lawyer. So why should it be any different in football? Why should it be different for Ian Cathro? Because he\u2019s not played the game? Because he\u2019s putting a few noses out of joint? Nonsense.\u201d \n Maurice Ross (SNS Group) \nRoss, with four years\u2019 coaching experience in Norway behind him, reckons Craig Levein deserves credit for thinking outside the box and recruiting Cathro at Hearts. \n \n\u201cIf there\u2019s ever a time for this new breed of manager to flourish it\u2019s now,\u201d says Ross. \n \n\u201cJose Mourinho broke the ground for that to happen. In Scotland, we\u2019re only just catching up. \n \n\u201cAt just 30, Ian has already been exposed to Portuguese football, Spanish football, English football and Scottish football. \n \n\u201cSo why should he not be where he is? Why shouldn\u2019t he be at Hearts? \n \n\u201cBecause he didn\u2019t play a few games against Airdrie? I\u2019m not tolerating that argument. \n \n\u201cIf Ian Cathro, with the same principles, the same education and the same experience, had a Spanish name and a fancy haircut, people would be lapping him up. \n \n\u201cThis is where we\u2019re a strange breed. But we need to move away from that because it\u2019s an absolutely archaic mindset. \n \n\u201cI don\u2019t agree with everything Cathro does, but I applaud him for what he\u2019s done so far in his career. He deserves his chance. \n \n\u201cCraig Levein, a guy who is one of the most astute operators in Scottish football, has seen that and acted on it.\u201d \n \nRoss called time on a spell with Norwegian cracks Egersunds IK in November after guiding them to a third-placed league finish. \n \nReturning to Scotland over Christmas, he went to watch Cathro\u2019s Hearts in action at Dens Park, a game they lost after being 2-0 up. But he insists: \u201cIt was a crime that Hearts lost that game. \n \n\u201cThe Hearts players\u2019 distances to the ball, their distances to their team-mates, the angles they were making, their No. 10 drifting wide to get numerical advantage against Dundee\u2019s full-backs \u2013 all of these movements are trained movements. \n \n\u201cI could see it. That was Cathro\u2019s work. 100%. \n \n\u201cNow, ultimately, time will tell. But for me, Cathro needs to be given that time and he needs to be given respect.\u201d \n  Share this","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Sean Hamilton"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: soccer news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Ian Cathro\u2019s critics don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about, insists former Rangers and Scotland star Maurice Ross","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","county":"Dundee","zipCode":"DD4","state":"Scotland","countryCode":"GB","zipArea":"Dundee City","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Sunday Post","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"173210318","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"13"},"name":"Sunday Post","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Consumer","Sports","Soccer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.sundaypost.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201236612","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:01:18Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:05:08Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://www.sundaypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2017/01/13250823.jpg-e1485616416138-150x150.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

But they're better right now. Until we improve, they're going to keep beating us.\" \n\nRivers mostly sat and witnessed his team go down in the third quarter under an avalanche of Stephen Curry three-point slings and Warriors points that sent the Clippers to their eighth consecutive defeat to Golden State. \n\n\"If I won eight games in a row, I would have a mental edge,\" Rivers said. \n\nCurry, supposedly playing with a sore left quadriceps, detonated for 25 of his 43 points in the third quarter. He was five for eight from three-point range in the period, during which he seemed to be playing alone. \n\nFor the game he was 15 for 23 from the field, nine for 15 from three-point range. \n\nOf all the 72 points the Clippers surrendered in the first half, the most painful had to be when Curry eased up the court and casually and knowingly hoisted a three-pointer from half court that splashed through the net as the halftime buzzer sounded. \n\nThe fans went crazy. The Warriors celebrated, none more so than Draymond Green, who chest-bumped Curry so hard he fell on the court. Curry stayed on his belly for a few seconds, his arms extended. \n\nThe Clippers could only solemnly trudge to their locker room. \n\n\"We can talk about, like, being who we are. But who are we?\" Clippers guard J.J. Redick said. \"To me, we're the most inconsistent team, maybe in the league. Like, we're inconsistent. That's who we are. So, like, if we're going to be inconsistent, we can't expect to come in here and play these guys and be inconsistent and play well. It's not realistic.\" \n\nThe Clippers have lost four of five games since point guard Chris Paul had surgery for a torn thumb ligament that is expected to sideline him six to eight weeks. \n\nBut they will see the Warriors again Thursday night at Staples Center knowing it's going to take a better effort than this one. \n\nBlake Griffin, in his second game back after missing 18 games following right knee surgery, had 20 points for a Clippers team that was never in this game. \n\nThe total destruction by the Warriors notwithstanding, Rivers has been unsure what has put him in a weakened state. \n\n\"It has been three weeks now, so it's not been a fun stretch,\" he said. \"I'll get through it. I just want to find out what the hell it is to be honest.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"BRODERICK TURNERLos Angeles Times"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: NBA - Golden State Warriors news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: NBA - Los Angeles Clippers news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest scores","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Curry, Warriors clobber Clippers, 144-98","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Bibb","zipCode":"31201","state":"Georgia","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Macon","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Macon Telegraph","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659292","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"56"},"name":"Macon Telegraph","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Basketball","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.macon.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201237348","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:05:08Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

At a summit of southern European countries in Lisbon on Saturday, Hollande said that he was concerned by Trump\u2019s call for more countries to leave the EU, following in the footsteps of the U.K., and that EU countries had to respond to his rhetoric, according to Agence France Presse. Hollande spoke by phone with Trump later on Saturday. \n\nShortly after meeting U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May on Friday, Trump signed an executive order canceling the arrival of refugees and asylum seekers for four months, and banning citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from arriving in the country. Syrian refugees are also indefinitely restricted from coming to the country. \n\nDuring her stop over in Ankara on the way back from a visit to the U.S., British Prime Minister Theresa May refused to condemn Trump\u2019s Muslim ban after being asked about it three times at a press conference with the Turkish prime minister on Saturday. \u201cThe United States is responsible for the United States\u2019 policy on refugees,\u201d she said. \u201cThe United Kingdom is responsible for the United Kingdom\u2019s policy on refugees.\u201d \n\nBut soon after midnight in London, May\u2019s spokesman put out a statement that \u201cwe do not agree with this kind of approach and it is not one we will be taking.\u201d \n\n\u201cWe are studying this new executive order to see what it means and what the legal effects are, and in particular what the consequences are for U.K. nationals,\u201d the statement added. \u201cIf there is any impact on U.K. nationals then clearly we will make representations to the U.S. government about that.\u201d \n\nThe French were the most outspoken from the start. \n\n\u201cThis can only worry us,\u201d Jean-Marc Ayrault, the French foreign minister, said at a press conference in Paris on Saturday, according to Reuters. Ayrault added that he and Germany\u2019s Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel discussed their concerns over Trump\u2019s move. \u201cWelcoming refugees who flee war and oppression is part of our duty,\u201d Ayrault said. \n\nThe United Nations refugee agency, UNHCR, and the International Organization for Migration also called on Trump to reconsider his decision, according to Reuters. \n\nThe two U.N. agencies said they hoped \u201cthat the U.S. will continue its strong leadership role and long tradition of protecting those who are fleeing conflict and persecution.\u201d \n\nMeanwhile, Google told traveling staff to come back to the U.S. out of fear they wouldn\u2019t be granted re-entry into the country. At least 187 Google employees could be affected by Trump\u2019s order, said the company\u2019s CEO Sundar Pichai in a memo to the company, according to the Wall Street Journal. \n\nThis article was updated on Sunday with a statement from the British government. \n\nTom McTague in Ankara contributed reporting to this article. \n\nName * \n\nEmail * \n\nWebsite \n\nNotify me of new posts by email. \n\nThis is from a country that bans certain women\u2019s clothing on beaches?

Mackenzie Cornell and Hector Garcia led after the preliminaries with a respective 305.5 and 396.95 points. Garcia was especially dominant, as his nearest competitor was Dylan Yurasits of LaSalle with 326.60. \n \nThe top eight for the men and women then advanced to the final, where each diver started back with zero points. \n \nGarcia and Cornell each stayed consistent and won their competitions. Garcia scored 394.75 and Cornell stacked up 302.60 points. Other notable performances by Penn State divers included Connor Scanlon in third and Jack Crow in fourth for the men and Christina Crowell in third and Elaina Faerber in fifth for the women. \n \nGarcia emphasized consistency as key to his dominating performance. \n \n\u201cI pretty much hit every one of my dives,\u201d Garcia said after the meet. \u201cThis sport is about all six dives and if you can\u2019t hit all your six dives, you\u2019re not gonna make it.\u201d \n \nHead coach Dennis Ceppa saw good signs out of his team with postseason events like the Big Ten Championships that include preliminary and final rounds are on the horizon. \n \n\u201cWe\u2019ve been working on trying to figure out as best we can how to compete in a prelims-finals type situation, which is why we\u2019re hosting this event,\u201d he said. \u201cBeing that Hector and Mackenzie won their events in prelims and turned around and won in finals, that\u2019s what this sport takes.

United were crowned W-League premiers on Sunday after Sydney FC lost 5-2 to Adelaide United and Perth Glory could only manage a 1-0 victory over the Western Sydney Wanderers.\n\nCanberra requested to play their semi at McKellar Park on Saturday \u2014 the day before the Mariners come to town. A home final would pocket them about $15,000 in gate takings and given the W-League team is run on a lean budget, that would be a substantial financial boost.\n\nIf they play at Canberra Stadium, then all gate takings would go to the Mariners, but Fairfax Media believes Canberra United would seek financial compensation from the FFA. It's the second game Central Coast will play at Canberra Stadium this summer, having already played the Wellington Phoenix there in November in front of 5497 fans.\n\nCanberra United were expecting a crowd of at least 1500 for their semi \u2014 the perfect number for the boutique McKellar Park.\n\nThe FFA met on Sunday afternoon to decide the semi-final fixtures, although an announcement was not expected to be made until Monday.\n\nDower said they'd pushed for their semi to be played at McKellar and had earned the right to hold it there.\n\nThe sticking point will be Fox Sports will be reluctant to set up television cameras to cover two games at two different venues on different days in Canberra, when they could simply cover them both at Canberra Stadium.\n\n\"That's certainly not our preference, our preference is to play [at McKellar],\" Dower said.\n\n\"This is our home, this is Fortress McKellar so from my perspective a lot of other clubs have had a fair say of where they're allowed to play this year, so I would hope that we got the opportunity to put in our first request and to be granted that as well.\n\n\"Especially if you're finishing No.1 or two on the ladder I think you've earned the right to play at your own home ground.\n\n\"It's out of our control, we can't do anything about it. I'm not going to stir the hornet's nest, but a number of other teams have had the opportunity to control where they've played this year.\"\n\nAnother sticking point is training.\n\nUnited can train throughout the week at McKellar for minimal cost, but would get limited access to Canberra Stadium.\n\nLast time the Mariners were in town, Canberra played its season opener against Melbourne City as part of a Canberra Stadium double-header, losing that game 2-1.\n\nThey were unable to train on the ground in the lead-up to that match.\n\nUnited co-captain Ellie Brush reiterated Dower's preference, but added they'd be ready regardless of where the game was.\n\n\"This is our favoured home, but ... we don't really mind where we suit up, we know the crowd will get out and support us. Just two more [wins] to go,\" she said.\n\nDower said Brush's fellow co-captain Michelle Heyman was unlikely to be ready for the semi, although she had returned to training with the main group as she continued her comeback from toe and ankle injuries.\n\nThe Matildas striker has been out since she rolled her ankle against the Melbourne Victory at the end of December.\n\n\"She was back training [Friday], which was a great sight to see her out here at McKellar juggling, jogging laps, kicking the ball around,\" Dower said.\n\n\"It was really great.

Photo: Bertrand Guay/Pool/AFP \n\nFrench Socialists will choose between reformist ex-prime minister Manuel Valls and left-winger Benoit Hamon in a presidential primary runoff on Sunday, overshadowed by a scandal engulfing the conservative election frontrunner. \n \nValls, 54, says his experience as the president's former right-hand man makes him a more credible choice than Hamon, 49, who is leading the Socialist race with radical proposals on work, state aid and the environment. \n \nWhoever wins will face an uphill task with polls showing the Socialist candidate being eliminated in the first round of the election in April after five years of economic stagnation under unpopular Socialist President Francois Hollande. \n \nThe contest is being watched closely after Britain's vote to leave the EU and Donald Trump's victory in the United States.     \n \nForecasts currently show conservative candidate Francois Fillon and far-right leader Marine Le Pen out in front, ahead of the centrist Emmanuel Macron. The top two candidates from the April 23 first round will go through to the May 7 runoff. \n \nFillon's campaign has, however, been dealt a serious blow by claims that he used public money to give his wife a \"fake job\". \n \nFrench authorities this week opened a preliminary inquiry into allegations that Fillon's Welsh-born wife Penelope collected half a million euros ($534,000) over eight years as a parliamentary aide to her husband and his successor -- for little to no work. \n \nInvestigators are also looking into payments she received from a magazine owned by a friend of Fillon. \n \nFillon, who won the conservative Republicans' nomination last year with promises to slash public spending and restore morality in politics, has insisted that his wife played a real role and complained he is the victim of a smear campaign. \n \nOn Sunday, he will address a Paris rally to try to shore up his support, after an Odoxa poll Friday which showed his approval ratings falling four points to 38 percent. \n \n   H \n \nours ahead of the gathering in the capital he vowed in an interview with the Journal du Dimanche newspaper that he would fight \"to the end\" against the \"forces at work to silence me and to weaken my candidacy\". \n \nThe Socialist primary has confirmed a gaping chasm within the ruling party, between a pragmatic, centre-left camp led by Valls and President Francois Hollande and a staunchly leftist faction around Hamon. \n \nHamon won a first round of voting last week that whittled the candidates down from seven to two, taking 36 percent to Valls' 31.5 percent. One of the biggest potential winners of the primary could be former economy minister Macron. \n \nThe 39-year-old former investment banker, who quit the Socialist government last year to run for president as a centrist, has been drawing large crowds at his rallies and creeping up on Fillon and Le Pen in polls. \n \nHe is tipped for further gains if, as expected, Hamon wins the Socialist nod over Valls, with Socialist moderates turned off by Hamon's tax-and-spend programme expected to decamp to Macron. \n \nValls has said he will not support Hamon's programme if the latter wins. If the tough-talking ex-premier emerges victorious, there could also be a flight from the Socialist camp. \n \nSome left-wingers have said they would shift their support to far-left firebrand Jean-Luc Melenchon, rather than back Valls. Melenchon is currently running in fourth in election polls. \n \nHamon's ideas dominated the primary, particularly his proposal to introduce a universal basic income to offset dwindling work opportunities in an age of automation. \n \nValls argued that the plan for a handout that would eventually reach 750 euros a month would \"ruin\" France and said a Hamon victory would spell \"certain defeat\" for the Socialists in the presidential race. \n \nBoth Valls and Hamon have insisted that everything is still to play for. Valls said Friday that Fillon's woes showed that the election \"was not over\". \n \nLe Pen told TF1 television Saturday that Fillon, who has pledged to quit the race if charged over his wife's payments, faced a \"trust problem\". \n \n\"The French are rightfully asking themselves: who is the real Fillon? Is this not a man who likes money and who manoeuvred to enrich himself?\" she said.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"France news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Left-winger vs reformer in French Socialist presidential primary","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Western Europe","countryCode":"FR","country":"France"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"The Local France","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"204204457","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"52"},"name":"The Local France","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.thelocal.fr"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201265247","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:55:40Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:05:22Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.thelocal.fr/userdata/images/article/w468/11d68c41d3d5c1a09a9a97eeb257b8095bc817fa2d3b77e97703e2a52bd120f0.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Photo: Bertrand Guay/POOL/AFP \n\nFrance's Socialists face a stark choice in Sunday's presidential primary between diehard leftist Benoit Hamon and reformist ex-prime minister Manuel Valls. \n \nHamon, the surprise winner of the first round of the Socialists' primary last weekend, has wooed voters with his staunchly leftist proposals, notably the idea of a universal basic income, dismissed as a \"mirage\" by Valls. \n \nHe also wants to legalise marijuana and tax robots that replace workers. \n \nThe 49-year-old Hamon, round-faced with a schoolboy haircut, has a crowd-pleasing eagerness that contrasts with the square-jawed assertiveness of Valls, 54, who was interior minister before becoming premier. \n \nHamon joined a rebellion against what he saw as the Socialist government's rightward drift under Valls and President Francois Hollande, quitting as education minister in 2014. \n \nThe combative Valls has dismissed him as a dreamer with no hope of becoming president in May. \n \nSocialist voters face a choice between \"certain defeat\" with Hamon as their nominee and \"possible victory\" if they chose him, Valls declared confidently after the first round. \n \nYet polls show neither man making it past the first round in the presidential vote in April, with conservative ex-premier Francois Fillon, far-right leader Marine Le Pen and centrist ex-economy minister Emmanuel \n \nMacron leading the field. \n \nAfter two-and-a-half years as premier Valls believes he is the best-placed to defend France's interests in the face of a new protectionist world order. He has been particularly scathing of his rival's signature proposal for a universal basic income. \n \n\"I want nothing of these mirages that evaporate in an instant and that sow disillusionment (and) bitterness,\" he told an earlier campaign rally. \n \nValls' parents, a Spanish painter father and Swiss-Italian mother, fled the dictatorship of Francisco Franco in Spain to settle in France, though they travelled back to Barcelona for his birth in August 1962. He gained French citizenship when he was 20. \n \nHe has four children from his first marriage to a teacher. In 2010 he remarried, to concert violinist Anne Gravoin. Valls makes no apologies for his pro-business stance and desire to modernise the Socialist party. \n \nBut his use of decrees to ram through contested economic reforms as prime minister, as well as a failed proposal to strip dual-national terrorists of their French citizenship, alienated many in the party. \n \nHamon, who hails from western Brittany, is the son of a dockworker father and secretary mother. \n \nHe began his political life as a student activist in the 1980s. In 1986, aged 18, he joined massive student protests against proposed reforms which then rightwing president Jacques Chirac was forced to withdraw. \n \nA father of two with his partner Gabrielle Guallar, Hamon has a degree in history. \n \nValls has warned \"the left could die\" unless two \"irreconcilable\" factions -- one pragmatic and open to reforms, the other wedded to the class struggle -- unite. \n \nSuch statements have drawn comparisons to former British prime minister Tony Blair who dragged his Labour party towards the centre and won three successive elections. \n \nBut in recent years leftist voters across Europe have soured on the centre-left, preferring hard left leaders like Labour's Jeremy Corbyn in Britain or far-left parties like Spain's Podemos. \n \nValls is not the only one making dire warnings of a lasting rift within the party that swept the board in general elections just five years ago. \n \n\"The PS (Socialist Party) elephants have already broken everything in the china shop,\" said Yann Marec, deputy editor of the southern Midi Libre newspaper said. \n \n\"Hamon the Breton and his promises against Valls the Catalan and his thrusting chin: the spectacle smells of blood.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"France news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"French socialist primary: 'utopian' Hamon or 'fighter' Valls?","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Western Europe","countryCode":"FR","country":"France"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"The Local France","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"204204457","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"52"},"name":"The Local France","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.thelocal.fr"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201265492","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:33:26Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:05:22Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.thelocal.fr/userdata/images/article/w468/cf6e55624e82498c86d088f508ef3de8bd8696323b02d5f22b4a3b9dc2656c0e.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Long Beach Fire Department paramedics responded and transported the victim, with severe injuries and in critical condition, to a local hospital where she later succumbed to her injuries. \n \nThe victim has been identified as 78-year-old Jackie Morris, a resident of Long Beach. \n \nCollision Investigation detectives also responded to the scene. The preliminary investigation revealed the vehicle was traveling in the #1 lane when it struck the pedestrian who was pushing a shopping cart and attempting to cross Redondo Avenue mid-block. The vehicle stopped momentarily after the collision then sped away northbound Redondo Avenue, past 7th Street. \n \nThanks to the assistance of a proactive local business owner and others, detectives were able to recover video footage. The suspect vehicle appears to be a 2013 to 2015 silver four-door Nissan Sentra sedan, possibly with tinted windows. Detectives believe the vehicle may likely have minor to moderate front-end damage and a missing the driver's side mirror. The vehicle remains outstanding. \n \nThe investigation remains ongoing and detectives are hopeful that by releasing video and photos, someone who recognizes the vehicle or was in the area of 7th Street and Redondo at the time of the incident will come forward. \n \nAnyone with information is urged to call Collision Investigation Detective Brian at (562) 570-7355.

It's a federal law (passed by Congress) that states in pertinent part: \n  \n(a) In general \n \nNotwithstanding any other provision of Federal, State, or local law, a Federal, State, or local government entity or official may not prohibit, or in any way restrict, any government entity or official from sending to, or receiving from, the Immigration and Naturalization Service information regarding the citizenship or immigration status, lawful or unlawful, of any individual. \n \n(b) Additional authority of government entities Notwithstanding any other provision of Federal, State, or local law, no person or agency may prohibit, or in any way restrict, a Federal, State, or local government entity from doing any of the following with respect to information regarding the immigration status, lawful or unlawful, of any individual: \n(1) Sending such information to, or requesting or receiving such information from, the Immigration and Naturalization Service. \n(2) Maintaining such information. \n(3) Exchanging such information with any other Federal, State, or local government entity... \n  \nIn 2013, California's legislature enacted the TRUST Act (AB 4) which took effect on Jan. 1, 2014. It prohibits law enforcement officials from detaining an individual on the basis of a United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement hold after that individual becomes eligible for release from custody, unless certain conditions are met, including among other things that the individual has been convicted of specified crimes. \n \nOn Jan. 25, the Long Beach Police Department released the following statement: \n  \n[LBPD statement per City of Long Beach] Enforcing immigration at the local level undermines the trust and cooperation with immigrant communities, which are essential elements of community oriented policing. Long Beach follows the California TRUST Act, and our current practice is not to hold individuals on immigration violations alone. The Long Beach Police Department supports measures to either continue incarceration or to deport violent and serious offenders who pose a threat to our community. We evaluate our policies and procedures as any new legislation is enacted, but it would be premature to speculate on any changes, at this time. \n  \nPolicies of the City of Long Beach are the responsibility of, and determined by, a majority of the LB City Council. City management departments (including LBPD through its Chief of Police) carry out Council-directed policies. Under LB's City Charter, LB's Mayor can recommend and suggest (or \"tweet\" his views) but has no independent executive authority to make policy. \n Sponsor \n\n Sponsor \n\n \nOn Jan. 25, L.A. County Sheriff Jim McDonnell issued the following statement: \n  \n[Sheriff McDonnell Jan. 25 statement] The executive order does not change the mission of the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department. Our priority continues to be protecting our public. We accomplish this by gaining the trust of our communities and following the California Trust Act of 2014 and the Truth Act of 2016. Our department policy clearly states that our deputies do not ask for one\u2019s immigration status. Immigration enforcement remains a federal responsibility. \n  Sponsor \n\n Sponsor \n\n \nOn Jan. 25, 2017, newly installed CA Attorney General Xavier Becerra issued the following statement \n  \n[CA Att'y Gen'l Becerra statement] It is important to put these White House executive actions in context. \n \nExecutive orders do not change existing law. Executive orders cannot contradict existing law. And Executive orders can be challenged for violating constitutional and legal standards in their enforcement. \n \nThe California Department of Justice (DOJ) is prepared to protect the public safety and general welfare of all Californians as well as their privacy and property rights. These are rights and protections which have survived numerous legal challenges over time. And they are grounded on our federal and state constitutions not on an executive pronouncement. \n \nThe California DOJ will protect the rights of all of its people from unwarranted intrusion from any source, including the federal government. In California, we want to foster trust between law enforcement authorities and the communities they are obliged to protect. That's why California enacted the TRUST and TRUTH acts to guide our men and women in uniform on the proper execution of their public safety duties. \n \nCalifornia is prepared to work with our federal government to enhance the safety and well-being of all our people. We will work with our sister states to achieve mutual goals of respect and cooperation with the federal government. And we will remain ready to advance and defend California's policies wherever and whenever necessary. \n  Sponsor \n\n  \nWhat happens next will likely be triggered by actions of the U.S. Department Justice, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, or both.

History\u2019s \u201cgreat walls\u201d have all been vain attempts to control the movement of people \u2014 and they all failed. \n\nThe new president originally promised that this wall would be paid for by Mexico. Now he says Americans will pay and Mexico will reimburse us later. That sounds like a grifter\u2019s plan. And even if Mexico were to pay for it, it\u2019s an unacceptably crude tactic for a remarkably intricate problem. \n\nTrump is irresponsibly luring Americans into a hostile dispute with a country that is our ally, our friend and our neighbor. The United States may indeed have a problem with Mexicans and Latinos illegally entering the country. One would like to think that our representatives are well paid to think of better, more diplomatic solutions. \n\nShould this wall be built, it will come to stand as the enduring symbol of a shameful period in American history when the public imagination was enslaved to an emotionally unstable president and the Congress that enabled him. \n\nLisa Martinez \n\nKent \n\nUnhappy folks \u2028march to polls \n\nThe media have reveled in showing protesters against President Donald Trump breaking laws, damaging property and injuring police. \n\nWhy isn\u2019t the media glorifying the movement where the citizens who are unhappy with the direction of this country have been dealing liberals one loss after another at the polls for the last six years? \n\nThis has been done by following the laws and voting. \n\nWe do not destroy property, we do not injure police, we just take care of our families and obey the law. \n\nThis is a great country with a great Constitution.

It also barred green card holders from those countries from re-entering the United States, the Department of Homeland Security said, although the administration said exemptions could be granted. \n   \nHere are some major excerpts from the executive order, with comments by The New York Times. \n   \nIt invokes the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001 \n   \nThe visa-issuance process plays a crucial role in detecting individuals with terrorist ties and stopping them from entering the United States. Perhaps in no instance was that more apparent than the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, when State Department policy prevented consular officers from properly scrutinizing the visa applications of several of the 19 foreign nationals who went on to murder nearly 3,000 Americans. \n   \nMost of the 19 hijackers on the planes that crashed into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, were from Saudi Arabia.

None of those countries are on Trump's visa ban list. \n   \nAmerica's founders were pro-immigration \n   \nIn order to protect Americans, the United States must ensure that those admitted to this country do not bear hostile attitudes toward it and its founding principles. \n   \nThe nation's founding principles, as reflected in the Declaration of Independence, included dissatisfaction with what were said to be overly restrictive immigration practices. \n   \nIt defines what non-U.S. citizens should believe \n   \nThe United States cannot, and should not, admit those who do not support the Constitution, or those who would place violent ideologies over American law. \n   \n\"There is no statutory requirement that noncitizens entering the United States support the Constitution,\" said Peter J. Spiro, a law professor at Temple University. \"The executive order seems to suggest that even temporary visitors like tourists and students should support the U.S. Constitution, which doesn't make a lot of sense.\" \n   \nDoes Trump have the power to do this? \n   \nTo temporarily reduce investigative burdens on relevant agencies during the review period described in subsection (a) of this section, to ensure the proper review and maximum utilization of available resources for the screening of foreign nationals, and to ensure that adequate standards are established to prevent infiltration by foreign terrorists or criminals, pursuant to section 212(f) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f) \u2026 \n   \nThis provision is the key to the power Trump claims. It says: \"Whenever the president finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.\" \n   \nThe provision \"gives the president capacious authority to deny entry to any alien or class of aliens,\" Spiro said. \"No court has ever reversed a presidential order under it.\" \n   \nBut he added, \"In terms of the number of prospective immigrants involved, this is by far the most significant use of the power by any president.\" \n   \nSome critics say the order runs afoul of a later law that bars discrimination \"in the issuance of an immigrant visa because of the person's race, sex, nationality, place of birth or place of residence.\" \n   \nThe tension between the two laws has not been definitively resolved by the courts. Jennifer Chacon, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine, said a challenge to the executive order based on the later law's equal-protection principles was the most promising line of attack. \n   \nIn an opinion article in The New York Times, David J. Bier, an immigration policy analyst at the Cato Institute, a libertarian group, said Trump had at least violated the spirit of the later law. \n   \n\"Even if courts do find wiggle room here, discretion can be taken too far,\" Bier wrote. \"If Mr. Trump can legally ban an entire region of the world, he would render Congress' vision of unbiased legal immigration a dead letter.\" \n   \nIt targets 7 countries \n   \n\u2026 I hereby proclaim that the immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of aliens from countries referred to in section 217(a)(12) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1187(a)(12), would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and I hereby suspend entry into the United States, as immigrants and nonimmigrants, of such persons for 90 days from the date of this order \u2026 \n   \nThe countries are Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n   \nSome people are exempt \n   \n\u2026 (excluding those foreign nationals traveling on diplomatic visas, North Atlantic Treaty Organization visas, C-2 visas for travel to the United Nations, and G-1, G-2, G-3, and G-4 visas). \n \nThese exceptions are mostly for diplomats, people traveling to the United Nations in New York, and others involved in international organizations. \n \nThe order has room to grow \n \nThe Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State, shall submit to the President a list of countries recommended for inclusion on a Presidential proclamation that would prohibit the entry of foreign nationals. \n \nThe initial list may soon change and expand. \n \nBut it also extends beyond the 7 countries \n \nThe Secretary of State shall suspend the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) for 120 days. \n \nThis provision suspends all admissions of refugees, not limited to the seven countries. \n \n[ Nations targeted by travel ban have one thing in common: No apparent Trump business interests ] \n \nThe order prioritizes Christian refugees \n \nUpon the resumption of USRAP admissions, the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, is further directed to make changes, to the extent permitted by law, to prioritize refugee claims made by individuals on the basis of religious-based persecution, provided that the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual\u2019s country of nationality. \n \nAs a general matter, this will give priority to Christian refugees over Muslim ones. Although framed in a neutral way, this part of the order may raise questions of religion-based discrimination. Trump has said he means to favor Christian refugees. \n \nThat violates the First Amendment\u2019s ban on government establishment of religion, according to David Cole, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union. \u201cOne of the critical questions with respect to the validity of executive action challenged under the Establishment Clause is its intent and effect,\u201d he wrote in a blog post. \u201cIf intended to disfavor a particular religion, it violates the Establishment Clause.\u201d \n \nSyrians are \u2018detrimental\u2019 to U.S. interests, it says \n \nPursuant to section 212(f) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f), I hereby proclaim that the entry of nationals of Syria as refugees is detrimental to the interests of the United States and thus suspend any such entry until such time as I have determined that sufficient changes have been made to the USRAP to ensure that admission of Syrian refugees is consistent with the national interest. \n \nThis effectively expands the ban on immigrants from Syria. \n \nHow it restricts all refugees \n \n(d) Pursuant to section 212(f) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f), I hereby proclaim that the entry of more than 50,000 refugees in fiscal year 2017 would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and thus suspend any such entry until such time as I determine that additional admissions would be in the national interest. \n \nThis cuts the cap on refugees in half.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US immigration news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Trump's immigration order, annotated","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Anchorage","zipCode":"99508","state":"Alaska","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Anchorage","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Anchorage Daily News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169666318","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"150"},"name":"Anchorage Daily News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.adn.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201284672","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:05:31Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The run will start at The Firkin & Fox and go through the west side of Carson City. \n \nIn addition to the race, Woodward\u2019s project also includes a scholarship fund. Two student-athletes, one male and one female, will be chosen to receive a $1,000 scholarship for college. \n \n\u201cWe centered the scholarship about Jordan\u2019s characteristics, he was a student-athlete too,\u201d Woodward said. \n \nScholarship applicants need to fill out a form and essay on overcoming adversity. Applicants must be student athletes with a GPA of 3.0 or higher. A scholarship committee, comprised of seven community members, family members and important people in Jordan\u2019s life will choose the two students to receive the money. \n \n\u201cI am excited to be able to give out the scholarship because I know how good it felt when I got my scholarship. Because college is such as big thing, so to be able to give that money to some of my peers is awesome,\u201d Woodward said. \n \nProceeds from the race and donations will go toward the scholarships and race costs and any extra money raised will be donated to other suicide prevention charities. \n \n\u201cIt is hard to relive (the memories of Jordan\u2019s suicide) but it\u2019s such a great thing to honor him in that way, so it has been both good and bad for me,\u201d Woodward said. \n \nThe community and her family have been extremely supportive. Woodward said the community has been supportive. She said people have signed up who also have been affected by suicide. \n \n\u201cWe have had lots of support already which has been so great,\u201d Woodward said. \n \nWoodward said almost $1,700 has been raised. \n \nThe Woodward family plans on continuing the event, even after Alyssa graduates. \n \n\u201cWe really want to make sure we are spreading awareness about suicide prevention,\u201d Woodward said. \n \nThe scholarship application will be available in the Carson High School guidance office and applications are due back by March 31. The scholarship committee will meet April 15 to go over the essays and choose the winners. \n \nRegistration for the race is at http://ultrasignup.com/register.aspx?did=43933 . The 5K race will be $35 to register and the 10K will be $45. Race registration will close on Feb. 25. Race day registration will be available but there is an additional $5 fee for all race day registrations on the day of the race.

Both districts have Republican incumbents, Mark Amodei and Tom McClintock, and both won their seats campaigning as deficit hawks. \n \nIn 2012, Tom McClintock opened up on his free-spending Republican colleagues with both barrels. In an interview with The Hill, he famously said, \u201cThis government doesn\u2019t spend money unless the House authorizes it. We are more than a year into a period where we have controlled the House and we are a trillion dollars deeper in debt. The buck starts here. We can\u2019t blame the president.\u201d \n \nAnd McClintock has definitely walked the walk of a deficit hawk. For example, he defied his party\u2019s whip and voted against the Small Business Tax Cut Act, which gave a 20 percent tax break to businesses with fewer than 500 employees because it had no offsets and the entire cost went straight onto the deficit. McClintock didn\u2019t mince words, saying, \u201cTax cuts without either spending reductions or real economic growth are an illusion.\u201d \n \nSo what about McClintock\u2019s neighbor Mark Amodei? If you check the \u201cDebt and Deficit\u201d page of his congressional website, you\u2019ll find a section entitled \u201cStop the insanity!\u201d It begins on a strong note: \u201cAs a fiscal conservative, I believe that our nation\u2019s deficit is out of control. We now borrow 42 cents for every dollar we spend.\u201d It goes on to make it personal for him: \u201cOur runaway spending problem is exactly what motivated me to run for Congress,\u201d he wrote. \n \nWith that he recounts his cosponsorship of a balanced budget amendment that would require a 60 percent super majority in both houses of Congress to either raise the debt limit or allow spending to outpace revenues in any fiscal year. \n \nThe moment of truth was at 3:31 p.m. on Jan. 13. The final roll call vote on the joint budget resolution was taken on the House floor. This resolution had been touted as the legislative vehicle by which the Affordable Care Act would be repealed. But if you actually read it, you\u2019ll see that it doesn\u2019t specifically mention the ACA. The title of the resolution is: \u201cSetting forth the congressional budget for the United States Government for fiscal year 2017 and setting forth the appropriate budgetary levels for fiscal years 2018 through 2026.\u201d \n \nThat title leaves no room for ambiguity. With both houses of Congress firmly under Republican control, this resolution is no less than the Republicans\u2019 budget plan for the next decade. Having said that, it\u2019s also clear that Republicans in Congress were hoping that nobody actually read it, since it calls for the federal debt to rise from $20 trillion in 2017 to $29 trillion in 2026. You read that right. Congressional Republicans are planning to add $9 trillion to the debt over the next decade, mostly by way of big tax cuts for corporations and wealthy individuals. \n \nNot a single Democrat voted in favor of this budget resolution, but nine House Republicans broke ranks and voted against it, mostly because they feared a backlash to repealing the ACA without anything to replace it. But one brave Republican, McClintock, voted no because he actually meant what he told his constituents about being against deficits. Amodei, McClintock\u2019s deficit-hating neighbor, voted in favor of a $1 trillion dollar deficit in fiscal 2026, topping up $9 trillion in accumulated debt between now and then. \n \nLittle wonder Amodei volunteered to chair Donald Trump\u2019s Nevada presidential campaign. Trump also has trouble telling voters the truth. \n \nRich Dunn is currently secretary of the Carson City Democratic Central Committee, and was the 2012 Democratic candidate for Assembly District 4","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Rich Dunn"},"topics":[{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Rich Dunn: A tale of two deficit hawks","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Carson City","zipCode":"89701","state":"Nevada","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Carson City","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Nevada Appeal","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169664712","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"445"},"name":"Nevada Appeal","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.nevadaappeal.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201289535","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:19:01Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:05:34Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.nevadaappeal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/DunnGuestCol-NAP-032616-413x620.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Also, we are pleased with Nevada\u2019s lower teen pregnancy rate, which is related to easier access to preventive methods. \n \nUnder the Affordable Care Act, ACA, (official name of Obamacare) people receive preventive screenings, health promotion education, and primary care in the community. Health care providers are helping people take care of themselves and seek appropriate care when they need it. Before ACA, persons without insurance often waited until they were very ill, then arrived at the emergency room, causing health costs to rise quickly. \n \nWe must keep basic health care for our families; many parents work two jobs just to get by. Taking the time to research and revise the cumbersome aspects of ACA is what is needed, and not the \u201cthrow the baby out with the bath water\u201d approach. When Medicare and Medicaid programs were developed in the 1960s, health professionals, lay persons and lawmakers worked together long before and after the programs became law. They wanted the programs to do the best for the respective recipients. \n \nLet\u2019s do that again, and say no to the total repeal of Obamacare. \n \nLin Zahrt \n \nCarson City \n \n \nStudents\u2019 worries about Trump are misplaced \n \nIn \u201cStudents reflect on new president\u201d in the Saturday, Jan. 21 Appeal, one student told columnist and journalism teacher Teri Vance that Trump sounded like a \u201cfreaking racist\u201d and was in fear for his sister-in-law who\u2019s from Mexico. \n \nIs the sister-in-law here legally? Is the boy aware that Trump\u2019s wife is an immigrant? Hispanic is an ethnicity, by the way, not a race. \n \nAnother boy worried about Trump\u2019s \u201cisolationist foreign policy\u201d even as his non-isolationist cabinet is being confirmed. \n \nAnother student worried about \u201call the fanatics who feel empowered now that (Trump) is elected.\u201d Empowered like the fanatical Trump inauguration rioters in D.C. who looted and burned innocent peoples\u2019 property, blocked roads, and sent police officers to the hospital? \n \nMs. Vance, who put these anti-Trump exaggerations and falsehoods into these kids\u2019 minds? What kind of journalist are you to hide behind gullible children spouting fake news in order to publicize smears about President Trump? \n \nLois Bock \n \nMinden \n \n \nLetter writer\u2019s defense of Trump is ill conceived \n \nAnne C. Keast states in her letter dated Jan. 22 that those Representatives and Senators that made a public statement by boycotting Trump\u2019s inauguration is something they should all be ashamed of as she is. \n \nTheirs was a statement against Trump\u2019s position supporting bigotry, racism and human rights degradation. No, the mere fact that Trump articulates those beliefs is what one should be ashamed of. \n \nShe goes on to say that those politicians are not representing their constituents. However, she failed to say that they were not representing their constituents that believe as she does. \n \nThe majority party of the last Congress certainly did \u201cnothing for the good of this great country.\u201d Please point out all the constructive measures the GOP created to help citizens, rather than just create a \u201cdivide within this country.\u201d Little to no effort was demonstrated to find workable compromises for the issues needed for the betterment of our country, not their party, as Congresses in days gone by would have done. \n \nI find it incredibly ironic that Ms. Keast should end her letter by directing them to \u201cwork together to earn the respect of our citizenry and the world by keeping America united and strong.\u201d Key phrase here is \u201cwork together.\u201d Congress spent the last eight years sitting on its hands and not solving the problems that face the non-millionaires that make up 91 percent of this nation\u2019s population. \n \nMarjorie Newman \n \nCarson City \n \n \nEconomic downturn likely under Trump \n \nI imagine many people in this area are pretty excited about a Trump presidency. If that is you, I suggest you do your celebrating soon. If patterns hold, we can expect a recession and high unemployment that is typical of Republican presidencies and this time compounded by a Republican Congress. We have seen economic instability under the watch of Nixon-Ford, both Bushes and even Reagan. George W. managed to get the stock market and real estate markets to fall together along with high unemployment. If you need an additional lesson, look at Kansas and Brownback\u2019s policies. \n \nOf course, Trump is not conventional. It is possible he will leave Pence to the dirty work of running a government while he travels the country and keeps his Twitter thumbs busy. In that case we can expect a typical, Republican-led economic downturn. \n \nIt is also possible that Trump\u2019s presidency will falter from the start in the midst of scandals. It is also possible that Trump will lead in an authoritarian manner helping to inspire domestic unrest. In both of these scenarios, economic stability is a long shot. \n \nThe least likely scenario is an effective, moderate Trump presidency with a thoughtful McConnell and Ryan controlled Congress. Economic stability has a chance here but this pattern is not likely. \n \nPersonally, I am paying off obligations and putting off making any major purchases until I am certain that past patterns don\u2019t hold. I would be happy to be wrong about this and we will all have our answers in the next couple of years. \n \nDaniel Schlenger \n \nCarson City \n \n \nTrump\u2019s fledgling presidency is already worrisome \n \nAmerica, you have the president you wished for \u2026 or do you? \n \nSo far he has shown nothing positive after a week in office. All I have seen is extreme insecurity and his executive actions (where\u2019s Congress?) is showing signs of dictatorship. He backpedals and changes his mind so often one cannot keep up with him. \n \nThe wish for \u201cchange\u201d is here, good or bad. It doesn\u2019t look good from my point of view. As a senior citizen on a fixed income, I am deeply concerned for what he might do to the benefits we worked for all our lives. \n \nThe wall? Is this country getting a wall like the one in Germany during World War II? Makes one wonder what is happening to our free country. I\u2019m on a Trump watch. Should be interesting if not laughable. \n \nPhyllis Skamel \n \nCarson City \n \n \nRepeal Obamacare; restore Medicare funds to hospitals \n \nAs a member of the healthcare industry and a proud representative in our local legislature, I have witnessed the negative effects of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) on our local hospitals and clinics. The act is anything but affordable for Nevada\u2019s healthcare facilities. \n \nBefore the ACA, hospitals would receive adequate reimbursements for the services that they provided through Medicare. Unfortunately, to fund all aspects of the ACA, the government cut hospital reimbursements significantly. \n \nThese cuts have left hospitals in Nevada and across the country struggling to stay afloat. Some facilities have been forced to close, and many families and healthcare professionals have relocated. \n \nAs a practicing doctor, I am fully aware of the severe implications ACA has had on our healthcare system. The system has now resulted in rural, low-income patients and senior citizens struggling to find adequate care because hospitals have closed and services have been cut. I believe that this harmful legislation needs to be repealed, but it must include the restoration of Medicare funding to hospitals to ensure that necessary fixes are made. \n \nAs our representation moves to create a better healthcare system for all, I ask that they restore Medicare reimbursements for hospitals so that they can continue to serve their communities. Our healthcare system over the past eight years has been a failure, but we can\u2019t start off this new year on the wrong foot by repealing without fixing the issues that the ACA created. \n \nDr. Robin Titus \n \nAssemblywoman, District 38","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Letters to the editor for Sunday, Jan. 29, 2017","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Carson City","zipCode":"89701","state":"Nevada","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Carson City","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Nevada Appeal","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169664712","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"445"},"name":"Nevada Appeal","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.nevadaappeal.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201290375","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:19:01Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:05:35Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

That 108-acre parcel, he said, is worth much more to the state if rezoned to five acre parcels but that Carson City won\u2019t approve the rezoning until arrangements are made to properly maintain Clear Creek Road. \n \n\u201cDivided into five acre parcels, it\u2019s probably worth somewhere over $2 million,\u201d the first-term Assemblyman said. \n \nThe bill would create a fund at NDOT to improve and maintain the road, convincing Carson City to allow the rezoning. \n \nIn addition, he has a bill draft that would enable homeowners in the Clear Creek area to pay for maintenance of that road. He said the problem is that Clear Creek properties aren\u2019t just in Carson City but Douglas County as well since the creek runs right along the county line. Kramer said existing law doesn\u2019t allow a tax increment district or improvement district to cross county lines. \n \nHe said allowing a bi-county tax district makes sense in places like Clear Creek and also might enable creation of districts to handle such issues in areas like Mound House and where the Washoe-Storey county line runs along the Truckee River. \n \nKramer said he is also working with residents in the Duck Hill Area at Carson City\u2019s northern border. He said there are about 22 parcels of land that are in Washoe County but the residents want to move the county line to put them in Carson City where they shop and feel that they have social and other ties. \n \nHe said residents have told him they can get a piece of paper signed by all the residents on Duck Hill urging support for moving the county line. \n \nKramer said he is meeting this week with Washoe County Manager John Slaughter and Commissioner Bob Lucey who represents that area to see what their reaction to the idea is. \n \nKramer said one of his bill drafts would relax some of the restrictions on how the treasurer can invest state money. Those restrictions were put in place nearly 30 years ago when the then-treasurer was unable to define and explain some of the financial instruments he was investing state cash in. \n \nKramer said allowing the use of repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements would give the treasurer\u2019s office more flexibility in handling state funds. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s a good tool for liquidity,\u201d he said. \n \nKramer was Carson City Treasurer for 20 years and served as a chief deputy in the state Treasurer\u2019s office before running for the Assembly District 40 seat. \n \nFinally, he has a bill that would relax specific OSHA requirements currently imposed on roofing contractors. He said the change was requested by a contractor who says rules requiring roofers on a single story building to be tied off are onerous since those workers are only eight feet above the ground. \n \nRoofing contractors have said that rule is actually dangerous when you consider that they are dragging air hoses for pneumatic tools, electrical cords for power tools and the harness. With several workers on a roof, those multiple lines can quickly get tangled. \n \nKramer said those contractors aren\u2019t questioning the need for harnesses on two story and taller buildings, just for the single story roofs. \n \n\u201cIf I get a bunch of people who work on a roof tell me it\u2019s a terrible idea, I probably won\u2019t support it,\u201d Kramer said.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Geoff Dornan"},"topics":[{"name":"US State Government news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Carson City\u2019s Al Kramer requests five bills for 2017 Nevada Legislature, including two to clean up Clear Creek issues","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Carson City","zipCode":"89701","state":"Nevada","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Carson City","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Nevada Appeal","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169664712","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"445"},"name":"Nevada Appeal","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Politics","Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.nevadaappeal.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201302711","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:31:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:05:33Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.nevadaappeal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Kramer-NAP-012917-2-620x370.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

The Pack won the first-place showdowns against Boise State on Wednesday and New Mexico on Saturday by an average of 18 points, and firmly planted itself as the team to beat. \n \nThe crowd was the 12th largest in school history, and the fans left happy. Coach Eric Musselman and the players went into the stands and thanked the student section for the support. \n \n\u201cI\u2019m proud of the team,\u201d Musselman said. \u201cThe last two games we\u2019ve played better basketball than we have all season. We knew New Mexico could score the ball. We did a good job defensively; did a good job of defending the 3-ball. \n \n\u201cI think we rebounded very well in the second half, and we did a pretty good job of sharing the basketball (18 assists on 26 baskets).\u201d \n \nJordan Caroline, who finished with 20 points and eight rebounds, called it a statement win. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s a great feeling,\u201d Caroline said. \u201cWe were talking about coming out and making a statement. We want to stay on top, and if we play defense like we did tonight, we can do that.\u201d \n \nThe catalyst of the back-to-back wins was none other than 6-foot-8 sophomore Cam Oliver, who scored a season-high 26 points, pulled down eight rebounds and had three steals. \n \nThe explosion comes on the heels of a 17-point, 15-rebound effort against Boise State on Wednesday. Prior to last week, he managed just 10 points against Air Force and eight in the loss to Fresno State. He only had eight total rebounds in those two games. \n \n\u201cWhen Cam dominates a game offensively, defensively or on the glass, we\u2019re a hard team to beat,\u201d Musselman said. \u201cHe certainly has stepped up the last two games. He stepped up last year down the stretch.\u201d \n \n\u201cIt opens everything up,\u201d Caroline said when asked about Oliver\u2019s performance. \u201cHe is tough to guard when he plays like that. When he plays like this, we\u2019re tough to beat.\u201d \n \nOliver didn\u2019t score until 4:56 left in the opening half , but he scored 20 second-half points on 7-for-10 shooting. He said he got into a good rhythm. \n \nNevada, which led 37-32 at the half, had three big runs in the final 20 minutes, and Oliver was in the middle of all three. \n \nWhen New Mexico cut the lead to 37-36 early in the second half, Oliver drained a 3-ball and sank two free throws in a 10-4 run which enabled Nevada to extend its lead to 47-41 with 14:57 remaining. \n \nAfter Tim Williams scored to make it 47-43, Nevada went on a 11-4 run for a 58-45 lead. Oliver had a flush off a New Mexico turnover, and after the Lobos misfired on the next possession, he drained a 3-ball. Williams scored on a layup , and then Leland King capped the surge with a flush off an assist from Hall. \n \nNew Mexico rallied to 64-58 with 6:25 left, but Nevada scored nine straight on a 3-ball by Oliver and two treys by Marcus Marshall to make it 73-58. That last surge finished the Lobos, who lost for the first time in five games. \n \nOliver said he did a self-check after the sub-par games against Air Force and Fresno State, and he also met with his teammates. \n \n\u201cI talked to my teammates,\u201d Oliver said. \u201cThey told me that they depend on me and that I need to start playing harder. I take into consideration what they tell me.\u201d \n \nThe talented sophomore said he never has and never will lose confidence or doubt himself. \n \n\u201cI talk to my team; my coaches,\u201d he said. \u201cI ask them what I can do better.

Question 2, which passed in November despite the fact it failed in Carson on a 52-48 vote, and 12 of Nevada\u2019s 17 counties, will authorize at least two pot shops in every county, and four in Carson whether we want them or not. \n \n\u201c(The moratorium) was pretty straightforward,\u201d said Carson Community Development Director Lee Plemel. \u201cWe did the same with medical marijuana when it passed. This is just a period to take a breath and see what the state does.\u201d \n \nThat\u2019s a question the State Legislature will answer when it convenes here next month. \n \nThe Nevada Health and Human Services Department has run the medical marijuana program since 2000, but the Department of Taxation will have the daunting challenge of administering and enforcing the recreational marijuana program. I say \u201cdaunting\u201d because Question 2 will require the state to spend much more than the already allocated $900,000 and hire far more than the four employees currently on the payroll to collect the taxes and enforce provisions of the new law. Those unwelcome realities will soon become clear to Gov. Brian Sandoval (who opposed Question 2), the Legislature and the Taxation Department. \n \nAn early warning sign about the regulation of legal marijuana occurred recently when more than 11,000 medical marijuana card applicants\u2019 records were exposed on the Public Behavioral Health Division\u2019s website, records that revealed the applicants\u2019 names, race, home addresses and citizenship. \n \nMy friend and Monday lunch buddy Jim Hartman, who\u2019s president of Nevadans for Responsible Drug Policy, wrote recently Question 2 opponents \u2014 including most of our elected officials, law enforcement officers and health care professionals \u2014 \u201cfocused on marijuana \u2018edibles\u2019 and small children. Few Nevada voters knew they were voting to enact a self-serving, 13-page initiative written by the commercial marijuana industry for the promoters\u2019 benefit.\u201d \n \nIn his State of the State address, Gov. Sandoval proposed a new 10 percent retail sales tax on recreational marijuana sales on top of the existing 15 percent wholesale tax, with all proceeds going to education. And he promised to limit the sales of pot products \u201cthat appeal to children and could be mistaken for candy.\u201d Kudos to the governor because the issue of marijuana \u201cedibles\u201d such as brownies, cookies and gummy bears should be taken seriously by all concerned including Sen. Tick Segerblom, a Las Vegas Democrat who wants to turn Nevada into the Amsterdam of the West. \n \nTherefore, I urge Carson supervisors and state lawmakers to impose minimum one-year moratoriums on recreational pot shops \u2014 Massachusetts enacted an 18-month moratorium \u2014 and I think the Legislature should ban the sale of marijuana edibles in the Silver State. I base my opinion on a recent study commissioned by the National Academies of Sciences finding regular marijuana use results in \u201can increased risk of car crashes, lower birth weight babies, and problems with memory and attention,\u201d not to mention \u201cstrong connections between heavy cannabis use and the development of schizophrenia.\u201d \n \nThat\u2019s what Nevada voters approved last November. Good luck to the Taxation Department in attempting to administer and enforce a deeply flawed law financed and promoted by the marijuana industry itself \u2014 what Jim Hartman calls \u201cBig Marijuana.\u201d \n \nDuring his 28-year U.S. Foreign Service career, Guy W.

It would be a penny per ounce. The bill was introduced by State Sen. Toi Hutchinson, who is a Democrat from Chicago Heights. It requires that the distributors of sugary drinks to obtain permits, which of course would not be free.\n\nWe are already taxed quite vigorously and vehemently here in Illinois, thank you very much. This idea is crazy. The tax would be imposed on everybody, not just those who enjoy some sugar now and then. Restaurants would hike the prices on everything they sell. Distributors would be troubled with more paperwork, the state would add more bureaucrats to keep track of it all, and worse yet, the aforementioned lunacy would probably be just the first step on a steep, slick and slippery slope, as slick as a disgusting substance spread on a door knob. You may think this is funny but it's not. Like when you\u2019re dancing with your honey and her nose is kind of runny. Why is it not funny?\n\nIt is not funny because if they can get away with taxing sugary drinks, they could get away with taxing, say, candy, cakes, sugar for your coffee and sugar for you tea. They would gladly tax delicious donuts dipped in rich yummy chocolate and topped with colorful sugar sprinkles. Some barbeque sauces have a lot of sugar in them too. Ice cream, shakes and sundaes, and let\u2019s not forget cookies for crying out loud. Go for it! Be sure to include brownies, Ho-Ho\u2019s, Twinkies, Ding Dongs, and even Forest Gump\u2019s mom\u2019s box of chocolates.\n\nGo right to the source and tax the sinister substance itself, sugar. White and brown, raw and refined, granulated and powdered should all be included. Grab on to glucose, fructose, maltose, lactose and galactose. If Senator Hutchinson figures that the state can rake in 560 million dollars just on taxing sugary beverages then she should consider the billions it could rob by taking on and taxing all sugar sold in Illinois. Wouldn\u2019t that be sweet!

When used in the context of negotiations, compromise used to mean \u201cI\u2019ll give a little if you give a little.\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s just reminiscing about the good old days.\n\nThis somewhat whimsical dalliance concerning the definition of a simple word is not without purpose. We are thinking of the impasse between the State of Illinois and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.\n\nNegotiations between the entities have broken down. The case was presented to the National Labor Relations Board, which ruled that an impasse does exist. AFSCME has already voted to take a strike vote.\n\nAs can be expected, a virtual state of war exists between the two parties. Both are stumping to claim the high moral ground. And, frankly, after looking at some of the most contentious issues, there appears to be room for negotiation.\n\nGov. Bruce Rauner and his staff are advancing the argument that AFSCME should accept the terms because 20 other unions have agreed to the same terms. Although an interesting fact, that\u2019s a non-starter.\n\nThe purpose of a union is to negotiate for its members. Agreements made between the state and other unions are completely irrelevant.\n\nSome of the issues keeping the two sides apart deal with overtime pay, insurance benefits and a wage freeze.\n\nThe state wants overtime pay to begin after 40 hours. The current contract calls for overtime to be paid after 37.5 hours. For most people to work in the private sector, that seems quite reasonable, especially given Illinois\u2019 dire economic situation.\n\nAt the very least, that issue seems to provide wiggle room for negotiation.\n\nConversely, the state wants AFSCME employees to pay a larger share of their health insurance. On the surface, that sounds eminently reasonable. Corporations that provide health insurance to their employees routinely pass along the increased cost of insurance.\n\nBut, as is frequently the case in these negotiations, the devil is in the details.\n\nAccording to members of Gov. Rauner\u2019s staff, employee contributions would double if they want to maintain their current coverage. That isn\u2019t insignificant.\n\nThe state counters that employees could select between a wide variety of plans. Well, that\u2019s fine. But, if a person goes to a restaurant and finds the menu overpriced, and finds nothing appealing on the menu, they won\u2019t buy something they can\u2019t afford or don\u2019t like.\n\nSurely, when you\u2019re dealing with a 100 percent increase in premiums, there is room for negotiation.\n\nAnother sticking point is a temporary wage freeze. The wage freeze would last through the proposed contract, which would expire in 2019. The freeze would be absolute, no cost of living increases.\n\nGiven the state of Illinois\u2019 finances, asking for a wage freeze at this time is understandable. On the other hand, \u201cwage freeze\u201d is a term no employee ever wants to hear.\n\nThere are a couple other ancillary issues that seem almost bizarre \u2014 the state is asking for additional latitude in alcohol testing. One would hope that drinking on the job isn\u2019t a major issue with state employees, but surely a reasonable policy, acceptable to both parties, can be negotiated.\n\nAnd, the state is arguing that AFSCME employees are well-paid. Wage figures for public sector employees are readily available for anyone interested enough to look. We did look.

Classes are as follows: freshman are Hufflepuff (yellow/blue), sophomores are Ravenclaw (black/blue), juniors are Slytherin (green/black), and seniors are Gryffindor (red/yellow).

Quidditch teams must have seven players, and there must be at least two girls per team, and the Quidditch tournament will start Jan. 30 and continue through Feb. 3 during lunch in the big gym. Winners of the tournament will receive T-shirts and forever be known as the first to participate in a CHS Quidditch tournament. In fact, \u201cWizarding World of Winterfest\u201d long sleeve T-shirts are on sale at the Student Store for $10. \n \n \nTALENT SHOW \n \nThe CHS annual talent show takes place Feb. 15 at 6:30 p.m. at the Carson City Community Center.

They included CHS students, faculty, and members from the community. NHS members provided snacks and drinks for the donors and worked the sign-in table. \n \n \nSTUDENT OF THE WEEK \n \nThe student of the week is Evelyn Rodriguez. She is a senior this year and taking several rigorous classes. She is a hard working Senator who works her hardest to help out around the school and show respect and kindness to those around her.

Christian has taken a total of 15 AP and honors classes throughout his high school years, consistently challenging himself to work harder. Despite the rigor of his schedule he maintains a GPA of 4.7 and is currently working on his final course to complete the engineering pathway and earn his certificate. Through his involvement in engineering, he competed in the AASHTO Bridge Building Competition where, as part of a team, they designed and built a bridge, did a seven-minute presentation for the judges, and tested their final product. The team was awarded an honorable mention for their efforts. Christian has participated and taken leadership roles in many clubs and activities over the years. He is currently the events coordinator for National Honor Society, Public Relations Officer for Interact, and a Link Crew director. He has also participated in Key Club, SkillsUSA, and the golf team. He volunteers his time for various organizations including the Humane Society, the Greenhouse Project, the CHS craft fair, and the CHS blood drive. He has been a math tutor for Solutions and volunteers as a tutor at one of the CCSD elementary schools. In his free time, he plays guitar. Christian wants to attend university to study engineering. He has been accepted to Texas A&M, Penn State, and University of Colorado-Boulder; he is still waiting to hear from two others.

But it shouldn't erase the troubling memory of one major element of Trump's inaugural address.\n\nThe foreign policy section has received far less attention than so revolutionary a declaration deserved. It radically redefined the American national interest as understood since World War II.\n\nTrump outlined a world in which foreign relations are collapsed into a zero-sum game. They gain, we lose. As in: \"For many decades, we've enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry; subsidized the armies of other countries\" while depleting our own. And most provocatively this: \"The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed all across the world.\"\n\nJFK's inaugural pledged to support any friend and oppose any foe to assure the success of liberty. Note that Trump makes no distinction between friend and foe (and no reference to liberty). They're all out to use, exploit and surpass us.\n\nNo more, declared Trump: \"From this day forward, it's going to be only America First.\"\n\nImagine how this resonates abroad. \"America First\" was the name of the organization led by Charles Lindbergh that bitterly fought FDR before U.S. entry into World War II \u2014 right through the Battle of Britain \u2014 to keep America neutral between Churchill's Britain and Hitler's Reich.\n\nNot that Trump was consciously imitating Lindbergh. I doubt he was even aware of the reference. He just liked the phrase. But I can assure you that in London and in every world capital they are aware of the antecedent and the intimations of a new American isolationism. Trump gave them good reason to think so, going on to note \"the right of all nations to put their own interests first.\" America included.\n\nSome claim that putting America first is a reassertion of American exceptionalism. On the contrary, it is the antithesis. It makes America no different from all the other countries that define themselves by a particularist blood-and-soil nationalism. What made America exceptional, unique in the world, was defining its own national interest beyond its narrow economic and security needs to encompass the safety and prosperity of a vast array of allies. A free world marked by open trade and mutual defense was President Truman's vision, shared by every president since. Some have argued that Trump is just dangling a bargaining chip to negotiate better terms of trade or alliance. Or that Trump's views are so changeable and unstable \u2014 telling European newspapers two weeks ago that NATO is obsolete and then saying \"NATO is very important to me\" \u2014 that this is just another unmoored entry on a ledger of confusion.\n\nBut both claims are demonstrably wrong. An inaugural address is no off-the-cuff riff. These words are the product of at least three weeks of deliberate crafting for an address that Trump said would express his philosophy. Moreover, to remove any ambiguity, Trump prefaced his \"America first\" proclamation with: \"From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land.\"\n\nTrump's vision misunderstands the logic underlying the far larger, far-reaching view of Truman. The Marshall Plan sure took wealth away from the American middle class and distributed it abroad. But for a reason. Altruism, in part. But mostly to stabilize Western Europe as a bulwark against an existential global enemy.\n\nWe carried many free riders throughout the Cold War. The burden was heavy. But this was not a mindless act of charity; it was an exercise in enlightened self-interest. After all, it was indeed better to subsidize foreign armies \u2014 German, South Korean, Turkish and dozens of others \u2014 and have them stand with us, rather than stationing even more American troops everywhere around the world at greater risk of both blood and treasure.\n\nWe are embarking upon insularity and smallness. Nor is this just theory. Trump's long-promised but nonetheless abrupt withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership is the momentous first fruit of his foreign policy doctrine. Last year the prime minister of Singapore told John McCain that if we pulled out of TPP \"you'll be finished in Asia.\" He knows the region.\n\nFor 70 years, we sustained an international system of open commerce and democratic alliances that has enabled America and the West to grow and thrive. Global leadership is what made America great. We abandon it at our peril.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Krauthammer: Trump's foreign policy revolution","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Jackson","zipCode":"62902","state":"Illinois","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Carbondale","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Southern Illinoisan","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169663416","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"18"},"name":"Southern Illinoisan","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.thesouthern.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201318482","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:05:47Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/thesouthern.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/a/d6/ad617b4d-3e7a-502f-84d5-6a357fb76faf/57410673485d5.image.jpg?crop=182%2C102%2C3%2C79&amp;resize=356%2C200&amp;order=crop%2Cresize"}],"video":[]}}

Making the invisible world visible, from the macroscopic level down to the nanoscale, is the theme for IBM's \"5-in-5\", the IT giant's annual list of predictions that could enable us to dramatically improve farming, enhance energy efficiency, spot harmful pollution before it's too late, and prevent premature cognitive decline. Below is a quick overview of 5 in 5 predictions: With AI, our words will be a window into our mental health. In five years, what we say and write will be indicators of our mental health and physical wellbeing. Patterns in our speech and writing analyzed by cognitive systems will enable doctors and patients to predict and track early-stage developmental disorders, mental illness and degenerative neurological diseases more effectively. Hyperimaging and AI will give us superhero vision. In five years, our ability to \"see\" beyond visible light will reveal new insights to help us understand the world around us. This technology will be widely available throughout our daily lives, giving us the ability to perceive or see through objects and opaque environmental conditions anytime, anywhere. Macroscopes will help us understand Earth's complexity in infinite detail. The physical world before our eyes only gives us a small view into what's an infinitely interconnected and complex world. Instrumenting and collecting masses of data from every physical object, big and small, and bringing it together will reveal comprehensive solutions for our food, water and energy needs. Medical \"labs on a chip\" will serve as health detectives for tracing disease at the nanoscale. New techniques that detect tiny bioparticles found in bodily fluids will reveal clues that, when combined with data from the Internet of Things (IoT) will give a full picture of our health and diagnose diseases before we experience any symptoms. Smart sensors will detect environmental pollution at the speed of light. Environmental pollutants won't be able to hide thanks to new sensing technologies that utilize silicon photonics to accurately pinpoint and monitor the quality of our environment. Together with physical analytics combined with artificial intelligence, these technologies will unlock insights to help us prevent pollution and fully harness the promise of cleaner fuels like natural gas. \"The combination of data explosion and exponential computation growth over the past fifty years has opened up whole new challenges for us to work on and solve together - challenges we never could have tackled or even foreseen in the past. This 'digital disruption' is transforming the world around us,\" said Arvind Krishna, senior vice president and director, IBM Research. \"As our latest 5 in 5 predictions show, there is no challenge too big - or too small - for us to set our sights on if we're only bold enough to take the chance,\" he added. - TradeArabia News Service آ© Copyright 2014 www.tradearabia.com (c) 2017 2016 Al Hilal Publishing and Marketing Group Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc.

Kobayashi was followed by the company's business development manager Nayyar Ansari, who presented the printing production road map and future strategy for 2107. Following Ansari was Konica Minolta's marketing development manager Pauline Brooks, who presented Konica Minolta Business Solutions marketing review for the year 2016 and 2017. Brooks outlined some of the recent developments and planning for the forth coming Gulf Print event, to be held in Dubai during March. Kobayashi also gave excellence performance awards to the top-performing distributors in the Middle East region, it stated. - TradeArabia News Service آ© Copyright 2014 www.tradearabia.com (c) 2017 2016 Al Hilal Publishing and Marketing Group Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc.

But they're better right now. Until we improve, they're going to keep beating us.\" \n\nRivers mostly sat and witnessed his team go down in the third quarter under an avalanche of Stephen Curry three-point slings and Warriors points that sent the Clippers to their eighth consecutive defeat to Golden State. \n\n\"If I won eight games in a row, I would have a mental edge,\" Rivers said. \n\nCurry, supposedly playing with a sore left quadriceps, detonated for 25 of his 43 points in the third quarter. He was five for eight from three-point range in the period, during which he seemed to be playing alone. \n\nFor the game he was 15 for 23 from the field, nine for 15 from three-point range. \n\nOf all the 72 points the Clippers surrendered in the first half, the most painful had to be when Curry eased up the court and casually and knowingly hoisted a three-pointer from half court that splashed through the net as the halftime buzzer sounded. \n\nThe fans went crazy. The Warriors celebrated, none more so than Draymond Green, who chest-bumped Curry so hard he fell on the court. Curry stayed on his belly for a few seconds, his arms extended. \n\nThe Clippers could only solemnly trudge to their locker room. \n\n\"We can talk about, like, being who we are. But who are we?\" Clippers guard J.J. Redick said. \"To me, we're the most inconsistent team, maybe in the league. Like, we're inconsistent. That's who we are. So, like, if we're going to be inconsistent, we can't expect to come in here and play these guys and be inconsistent and play well. It's not realistic.\" \n\nThe Clippers have lost four of five games since point guard Chris Paul had surgery for a torn thumb ligament that is expected to sideline him six to eight weeks. \n\nBut they will see the Warriors again Thursday night at Staples Center knowing it's going to take a better effort than this one. \n\nBlake Griffin, in his second game back after missing 18 games following right knee surgery, had 20 points for a Clippers team that was never in this game. \n\nThe total destruction by the Warriors notwithstanding, Rivers has been unsure what has put him in a weakened state. \n\n\"It has been three weeks now, so it's not been a fun stretch,\" he said. \"I'll get through it. I just want to find out what the hell it is to be honest.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"BRODERICK TURNERLos Angeles Times"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: NBA - Golden State Warriors news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: NBA - Los Angeles Clippers news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest scores","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Curry, Warriors clobber Clippers, 144-98","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Saint Clair","zipCode":"62220","state":"Illinois","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Belleville","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Belleville News Democrat","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659187","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1944"},"name":"Belleville News Democrat","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Basketball","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bnd.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201321816","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:05:50Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

No. 20160436      Decided: January 18, 2017   \n[¶\u20091] On December 14, 2016, eight North Dakota licensed lawyers and two lawyers licensed in another state but temporarily licensed in North Dakota filed a petition for an order allowing non-North Dakota licensed lawyers to represent criminal defendants who have been charged as a result of protest activities connected to the Dakota Access Pipeline. The petitioners request that North Dakota's process for admission of lawyers licensed in another state be significantly changed. \n \n[¶\u20092] The petitioners allege the Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, as well as Article I, § 12 of the North Dakota Constitution, require that North Dakota admit out-of-state lawyers in temporary practice to adequately handle criminal charges stemming from protest activities which they claim overwhelm the North Dakota bar's ability to adequately represent all defendants. The petitioners request that this Court amend our Admission to Practice Rules. \n \n[¶\u20093] The Court established a comment period ending 4 p.m., Friday, December 30, 2016. We received more than 16,000 comments supporting or opposing the petition. Many comments reviewed in favor of the petition give the impression that out-of-state lawyers are not allowed to practice in this state. Others suggest the number of lawyers admitted to practice law in North Dakota is inadequate to handle all of the criminal cases that have arisen out of the protests of the Dakota Access Pipeline. The bulk of the comments appeared to be generated by social media and commented on the merits of the charges filed, the actions of law enforcement and prosecuting lawyers, the placement of or need for the pipeline or the protests in general. These comments are extraneous and unhelpful to resolving the issues raised in the petition. Also beyond the scope of our consideration is modification of rules regulating the permanent admission and licensure of those seeking to become North Dakota lawyers. \n \n[¶\u20094] This Court regulates the admission, licensing and disciplining of lawyers under authority granted by N.D. Const. art. VI, § 3. This constitutional responsibility is carried out in our rule-making authority. The Court's current rules do not prevent out-of-state licensed lawyers from temporarily practicing law in North Dakota. Rather, lawyers licensed in another state are allowed to practice law in North Dakota by filing a motion with the district court in which a case is pending, attesting to their admission, licensing and discipline information, associating with a lawyer who is licensed in North Dakota and paying an annual fee. N.D. Admission to Practice R. 3(A). While the North Dakota lawyer's name must be included on all pleadings, that lawyer's in-person appearance can be excused by the district judge presiding in the matter. This pro hac vice process under Rule 3(A) of the Admission to Practice Rules is available now and is regularly used by many clients and lawyers in both criminal and civil cases. \n \n[¶\u20095] North Dakota also allows for full admission by application of experienced lawyers. See N.D. Admission to Practice R. 7. We are among the first states allowing out-of-state lawyers to temporarily practice law in North Dakota while their application for full admission is pending. See N.D. Admission to Practice R. 6.1. Two out-of-state lawyers who signed the petition pending before this Court are right now authorized to practice law in North Dakota under this rule. That is a privilege their resident state of licensure does not grant to North Dakota's or other states' lawyers. \n \n[¶\u20096] Rule 3.1 of the Admission to Practice Rules also authorizes the practice of law in civil matters for lawyers volunteering with approved legal services organizations. Rule 3.2 of the Admission to Practice Rules authorizes the provision of legal services following a determination of a major disaster. These rules, as well as Rule 3 of the Admission to Practice Rules, were reviewed for guidance in light of the petition and the comments received. \n \n[¶\u20097] The petitioners question North Dakota's requirement that lawyers not licensed in North Dakota who seek pro hac vice admission associate with a licensed North Dakota lawyer. Requiring an associate lawyer in the state where a case is venued is common throughout the United States. See COMPARISON OF ABA MODEL RULE FOR PRO HAC VICE ADMISSION WITH STATE VERSIONS, available at http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/administrative/professional_responsibility/prohac_admin_comp.authcheckdam.pdf (last visited Jan. 12, 2017). Requiring an associate lawyer is an important and legitimate state interest to protect the public from unlicensed lawyers who often are unfamiliar with state-specific court rules, procedures and laws. \n \n[¶\u20098] The petitioners and many comments suggest an emergency exists which requires amending North Dakota's rules to allow a pro hac vice application and temporary admission process similar to the United States District Court for the District of North Dakota. They suggest that, among other things, the federal process does not require an associate lawyer, and that eliminating the need for an associate lawyer will alleviate the perceived shortage of criminal defense counsel. The federal courts do not require an associate lawyer for a number of reasons, including that the same federal rules of procedure apply nationwide and the cases usually are decided according to federal law. The same cannot be said of our state rules, statutes and judicial rulings. \n \n[¶\u20099] We further reject as unsupported by evidence the suggestion that the South Central Judicial District is not currently handling the protest-related criminal cases in a timely manner due to unavailability of counsel. We have been provided with no evidence that a specific defendant has been denied counsel due to the unavailability of criminal defense or pro hac vice associate lawyers licensed in North Dakota. To the contrary, comments received in this process from the North Dakota Commission on Legal Counsel for Indigents state that lawyers have been assigned in \u201call cases in which someone has been found eligible to have indigent defense services provided by the Commission.\u201d The Commission provided the following information: \n \n\u2022\u2009553 court cases were filed in district court in the South Central Judicial District resulting from Dakota Access Pipeline protests as of December 19, 2016; \n \n\u2022\u2009The Commission made 291 case assignments, constituting approximately 53 percent of the protest-related court cases; \n \n\u2022\u2009The Commission assigned an attorney in all cases in which a defendant is eligible to receive indigent defense services; \n \n\u2022\u2009The Commission has made case assignments to 81 attorneys; \n \n\u2022\u2009The 81 assigned attorneys are from commission offices throughout North Dakota, from contract lawyers throughout North Dakota, and from \u201c45 hourly/conflict contractors from other districts [in North Dakota] and NW Minnesota;\u201d and \n \n\u2022\u2009A large number of arrests and charges occurred on single days. Those circumstances required assignment of different counsel for each defendant. For one of those days, 71 different attorneys were needed and assignments have been made. \n \nReview of our case management system records shows that the Indigent Defense Commission has continued from mid-December to make indigent defense case assignments. The South Central Judicial District's comment filed in this matter states that all qualifying protest-related indigent defendants have been provided counsel. \n \n[¶\u200910] The petition can be read as requesting, and some filing comments have suggested, that this Court utilize provisions of N.D. Sup. Ct. Admin. R. 57 and declare a judicial emergency. By its terms, that rule was adopted to address \u201can emergency or natural disaster [that] substantially endangers or infringes upon the normal functioning of the judicial system, the ability of persons to avail themselves of the judicial system, the ability of litigants or others to have access to the courts, or to meet schedules or deadlines imposed by court order or rule, statute, or administrative rule.\u201d Id. at § 1. We are not willing to categorize the protests of the Dakota Access Pipeline and charges stemming from them as either a natural disaster or a judicial emergency. Normal judicial processes and the requested deficiency appropriations for the North Dakota Judicial System and the North Dakota Commission on Legal Counsel for Indigents are expected to protect each criminal defendant's constitutional rights. We nevertheless recognize the potential for delay or inconvenience for litigants due to the relatively large number of arrests and finite resources to handle the judicial proceedings related to those arrests. \n \n[¶\u200911] Due to the significant increased caseload of the South Central Judicial District as a result of criminal charges stemming from the pipeline protests, a surrogate judge has been assigned to the district to assist the workload. Due to this same increased caseload, this Court in its discretion will allow temporary streamlining of our procedures for temporary admission of lawyers to provide pro bono services. \n \n[¶\u200912] In criminal cases pending in the South Central Judicial District arising from arrests made during the protests of the Dakota Access Pipeline between August 1, 2016 and until further order of this Court, a lawyer authorized to practice law in another state, and not disbarred, suspended or otherwise restricted from practice in any jurisdiction, may provide legal services in North Dakota on a temporary basis. The legal services must be provided on a pro bono basis, without payment or the expectation of payment of a fee. This Order does not prohibit a lawyer providing legal services under authority of this Order from being reimbursed from non-governmental funds for actual expenses incurred while rendering services under this Order. The following requirements, processes and procedures shall apply: \n \n1)\u2003The lawyer seeking pro hac vice admission must complete a form available through the Clerk of the Supreme Court and file it with the North Dakota State Board of Law Examiners; \n \n2)\u2003The lawyer seeking pro hac vice admission must file the above-referenced form with a certificate from his or her resident state licensing authority certifying the lawyer is admitted, currently licensed, eligible to practice and in good standing; \n \n3)\u2003The lawyer seeking pro hac vice admission must associate with a licensed North Dakota lawyer as required under N.D. Admission Prac. R. 3. We excuse the requirement that the North Dakota associate lawyer appear in-person and remain in court for all proceedings unless the district judge presiding in the case enters an order, based on a case-specific reason, requiring the presence of the North Dakota associate lawyer; \n \n4)\u2003The pro hac vice filing fee is waived; \n \n5)\u2003Upon receipt of the completed form and required materials, the North Dakota State Board of Law Examiners will provide the lawyer seeking pro hac vice admission an identification number that must be included on all pleadings filed with any court regarding these matters; \n \n6)\u2003Each business day the Clerk of the Supreme Court shall provide the Court Administrator for the South Central Judicial District with a listing of all lawyers who have been granted pro hac vice admission as provided in this Order; \n \n7)\u2003Lawyers admitted pro hac vice must access the North Dakota Odyssey electronic case management system through the associate lawyer unless the associate lawyer does not subscribe to North Dakota's Odyssey case management system. If the associate lawyer does not subscribe to Odyssey case management system, the lawyer admitted pro hac vice may e-mail filings to the clerk of court; \n \n8)\u2003The lawyer admitted pro hac vice under this Order is not by virtue of that admission limited in the number of appearances or representations he or she can make regarding these matters; \n \n9)\u2003The lawyer admitted pro hac vice under this Order must remain licensed and in good standing in the lawyer's state of licensure, and must verify in writing to the North Dakota State Board of Law Examiners no later than January 5, 2018, their licensure status and provide a listing of pending cases for which they are acting under this Order; and \n \n10)\u2003Any allegations of misconduct by a lawyer admitted pro hac vice under this Order that is reported to the Disciplinary Board of North Dakota will be provided to the lawyer's state of licensure, and may be grounds for revocation of pro hac vice admission under this Order. \n \n[¶\u200913] We encourage the State Bar Association of North Dakota, the North Dakota Association for Justice and Legal Services of North Dakota to assist in locating North Dakota licensed lawyers to serve as associate lawyers. \n \n[¶\u200914] Any other remedies requested by the petitioners are denied at this time. \n \n[¶\u200915] This Order remains in effect until further order of the Court. \n \nPer Curiam. \n \n[¶\u200916] Gerald W.

Deputies were outside when a man and a 16-year-old boy walked out around 10:30 p.m. Friday. \n \nThe man and the teen pulled out handguns when they saw the deputies, and three deputies opened fire, striking the man, the sheriff\u2019s office said. The teen fled and dropped his handgun, the sheriff\u2019s office said. \n \nAfter a search, deputies determined the teen was inside a nearby apartment. The teen was finally convinced to walk out of the apartment and was arrested just after 5\u2009a.m. Saturday. \n \nThe wounded man was in critical condition Saturday at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle. \n \nDetectives have not said how or whether the 16-year-old from Kent was involved in the car prowl. \n \nThe deputies involved in the shooting \u2014 all three are veteran officers \u2014 will be placed on paid administrative leave. \n \nThe man killed Wednesday at Beaver Lake Park in Sammamish was the son of a Seattle police officer.

The prowler then jumped into a tan or gold SUV \u2014 not Radcliffe\u2019s vehicle \u2014 and drove toward Rad­cliffe, who opened fire at the vehicle, authorities said. The SUV struck and killed Rad­cliffe, and the driver took off. \n  \nCorrection: \n \nInformation in this article, originally published Saturday, Jan. 28, 2017, was corrected later that day. A previous version of this story, and the headline accompanying it, incorrectly stated that the man wounded in the police shooting Friday was a suspect in the deadly car prowl.

We hope the statue will help all those who visit Kensington Palace to reflect on her life and her legacy. \n \nThe statue of the Princess will be placed in a public part of Kensington Palace gardens, Diana\u2019s former home. \n \nThe Princes have asked a small committee to help them come up with a design and choose a sculptor. \n \nThe committee includes Diana\u2019s sister, Lady Sarah McCorquodale, Julia Samuel, a godparent of Prince George who was a close friend of the Princess, and will be chaired by Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton, their former principal private secretary. \n \nIt is hoped the statue will be unveiled later this year. \n \nWilliam was 15 years old and Harry just 12 when their mother Diana was killed in a car crash in Paris on 31 August 1997. It was not clear until now how they would mark the 20th anniversary. \n \nOther organisations have announced plans to remember her. \n \nThe Historic Royal Palaces are displaying an exhibition of her clothes and dresses at Kensington Palace from February, tracing the evolution of her style. \n \nA specially designed white garden will also be planted in the grounds of the palace this spring and summer. \n \nThe Diana Award, the only charity that bears the name of Diana, Princess of Wales, has launched their legacy awards celebrating children and teenagers who have transformed the lives of others. \n \nChief executive Tessy Ojo said: Twenty years ago most of the young people we work with were not here, but one of the ways we talk to them about the princess is through her work, her work in community, her kindness, how she reached out. \n \nI think it\u2019s important to keep Diana\u2019s legacy alive because she really changed society, she changed how we interact with various things in society, she showed a lot of kindness and a lot of compassion. \n \nWe want to encourage the public to show that little bit of kindness and to be just that little bit more compassionate. \n \n(c) Sky News 2017: Comments  \ncomments","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"UK news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Princes to mark 20th anniversary with statue of Princess Diana","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","county":"Isle of Wight","zipCode":"PO30","state":"England","countryCode":"GB","zipArea":"Isle of Wight","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Isle of Wight Radio","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"172637663","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"10"},"name":"Isle of Wight Radio","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.iwradio.co.uk"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201335436","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T00:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:05:56Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://iwradio.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/01/26fdd38f0a182bbc1e51365db8fe71029bf6b8bbe72de2642c827b3f5cdc0a71_3879860.jpeg"}],"video":[]}}

Its full significance has now become apparent. \n \nThe find contained a mixture of extremely rare Anglo-Saxon coins and Viking silver, which provides a clearer understanding of the relationship between Alfred the Great, who ruled Wessex and his less well-known contemporary Ceolwulf II of Mercia. \n \nSome of the coins were minted with a \u2018Two Emperors\u2019 design, borrowed from the Romans, which shows that the currency was used in both ancient kingdoms. \n \nThis is an extraordinary find, one which re-writes Anglo-Saxon history, Xa Sturgis, director of the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, which now houses the coins, told Sky News. \n \nThe keeper of the coin room here came running up the stairs to tell me. The more they were excavated the more it became obvious how significant they are. These coins point to some sort of an alliance in the 870s between Alfred and Ceolwulf. \n \nWhile Alfred is often described as the king who founded England, uniting Mercia and Wessex, very little is known of his rival Ceolwulf. \n \nThese coins prove that there was a very real alliance between the two men at that time, added Julian Baker, coin curator at the Ashmolean. \n \nThat alliance hasn\u2019t survived in the historical record until now. Alfred manipulated history to put himself in a better light. To date, history has overemphasised Alfred\u2019s record and almost completely neglected Ceolwulf. \n \nWe can start re-writing that decade now, courtesy of the Watlington hoard. \n \nThe Ashmolean has until Monday, 31 January, to raise £1.35m to keep the coins and Viking silver in Oxfordshire and they are extremely close to that figure now. \n \nMore than 500 people in the local area have donated to the fund set up to raise the cash. \n \nMr Sturgis added: Alfred is the only king in the history of England described as \u2018great\u2019. But these coins show that in the 870s he needed Ceolwulf. It\u2019s incredible that we know so little about him and Alfred dominates everything. It\u2019s like he obliterated Ceolwulf. \n \nThe Watlington Hoard, as it is now known, is on public display at the Ashmolean as historians begin the process of re-assessing that period of Anglo-Saxon history. \n \n(c) Sky News 2017: Comments  \ncomments","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Coins discovery \u2018will re-write\u2019 Anglo-Saxon history","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","county":"Isle of Wight","zipCode":"PO30","state":"England","countryCode":"GB","zipArea":"Isle of Wight","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Isle of Wight Radio","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"172637663","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"10"},"name":"Isle of Wight Radio","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.iwradio.co.uk"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201335616","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T00:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:05:56Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://iwradio.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/01/91ee536f8109128c59083573d526911b227c379609fe0763c27cfa771921a048_3879920.jpeg"}],"video":[]}}

It's ready and waiting to go.\"\n\nThe state's maximum temperature is expected in Wilcannia, with a blistering top of 46 degrees. \n\nThe three-day heatwave forecast for Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. Photo: Bureau of Meteorology\n\nIf this January has seemed hotter and drier than usual, that's because it has been - especially at night. \n\nMaximum daytime temperatures in Sydney last January averaged 27.4 degrees. This January has so far averaged 29.1 degrees, which should rise with two more hot days to end the month. \n\nMeanwhile, Sydney has smashed the previous record for hot nights in January, with four nights (so far) staying above 24 degrees. The previous record was two. \n\nSydney is on track to break the record for the number of summer days above 35 degrees, with just two more needed to break the all-time record\n\nMr Taggart said this January has been \"almost certainly one of the hottest on record\".\n\nAnd the heat won't end this week. Next weekend is forecast to again hit 40 degrees, Mr Taggart said, as the Bureau forecasts a \"hotter than average\" February with hot conditions pushing into March. \n\nJanuary is also likely to end with less than half the month's average rainfall. So far the city has had 48.8mm, much lower than the average of 102.5mm.\n\nIt's also significantly less than last year when Sydney received 249.8mm during January.\n\nElsewhere in the state, Moree is in the middle of a remarkable hot streak, with the town sweltering through 34 consecutive days above 35 degrees. Mr Taggart expects that to stretch to 41 days based on current forecasts, close to the state record. \n\n\"The forecast for the next seven days is pretty horrific,\" Mr Taggart said. \"That heat is completely unrelenting.\"\n\n\"The forecast seems bad for Richmond and Sydney, but it's nothing compared to Moree.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Josh Dye"},"topics":[{"name":"Weather news","group":"Science"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Education news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"NSW weather: Heatwave, severe fire danger as students return to school","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"6004","state":"Western Australia","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"East Perth","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"WA Today","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169588399","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"27"},"name":"WA Today","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Environment","Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.watoday.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201337063","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:59:13Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:05:55Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Sad to hear I\u2019ll be banned from the USA based on my country of birth. \n \nA sad, sad day to feel like a second-class citizen. Sad day for the USA. \n \nDowning Street said Mrs May\u2019s team would be in touch with the White House if Britons were affected by the order. \n \nWe are studying this new executive order to see what it means and what the legal effects are, and in particular what the consequences are for UK nationals, Number 10 said. \n \nIf there is any impact on UK nationals then clearly we will make representations to the US government about that. \n \nThe US Embassy in Ireland has also confirmed that the new restrictions are being implemented at immigration pre-clearance facilities at Dublin and Shannon airports. \n \nLabour and Conservative MPs had reacted with horror to Mr Trump\u2019s policy, and Mrs May\u2019s initial refusal to condemn it. \n \nOther world leaders, including Canada\u2019s Justin Trudeau and French President Francois Hollande, were more forthright in speaking out against the ban. \n \nOutspoken Tory MP Heidi Allen tweeted the Prime Minister directly to say: Strong leadership means not being afraid to tell someone powerful when they\u2019re wrong. It\u2019s an ethos this country is proud of Theresa May. \n \nAnd Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: President Trump\u2019s executive order against refugees and Muslims should shock and appal us all. \n http://video.news.sky.com/video/h264/vod/700/2017/01/DIGI190815FRSPECIALRELATIONSHIPFORONLINEEDIT31485594624985700.mp4 \n(c) Sky News 2017: skynews","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Theresa May \u2018does not agree\u2019 with Trump\u2019s refugee ban","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","county":"Isle of Wight","zipCode":"PO30","state":"England","countryCode":"GB","zipArea":"Isle of Wight","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Isle of Wight Radio","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"172637663","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"10"},"name":"Isle of Wight Radio","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.iwradio.co.uk"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://news.sky.com/story/travellers-turned-away-after-trump-visa-halt-10745854","http://video.news.sky.com/video/h264/vod/700/2017/01/DIGI190815FRSPECIALRELATIONSHIPFORONLINEEDIT31485594624985700.mp4"],"sequenceId":"695201339964","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T00:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:05:57Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://iwradio.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/01/66dbe78168b1c4a92658d45d6dd79d6a1755ce38aa639f60871fb2f8a4b05aa6_3879317.jpeg"}],"video":[]}}

Not your typical festive meal in England but on a street in the leafy Cheshire suburbs, it was the way Ramiro Funes Mori and his friends celebrated the recent holiday season. \nThe 25-year-old is 7,000 miles away from his home city in Argentina, but he still remains true to his traditions. He\u2019s South American and proud. \n\n\u201cOn Christmas Eve we went to Sergio Romero\u2019s and then on New Year\u2019s Eve we were at Sergio Aguero\u2019s house,\u201d he explains. \u201cWe had a Christmas barbecue with all the lads. In Argentina, we like to eat meat a lot!\u201d \n\nThose \u2018lads\u2019, as Funes puts it, are his compatriots, international teammates affiliated to various Premier League clubs across the region. There is an Argentinian hub in the north-west and, naturally, they all stick together. \n\n\u201cWe are all nearby and close to each other - Nicolas Otamendi lives two doors down from me,\u201d Funes adds. \u201cIt was good for all our families to spend time together and celebrate. It felt like being at home - we played music, danced and enjoyed Christmas. All the kids played, we ate and had a fun time.\u201d \nThe defender relaxes into his chair at USM Finch Farm. He is happy to talk about his background and heritage, a welcome change from conversation surrounding on-the-pitch matters. \n\n\u201cArgentina is a nice country, the place I was born,\u201d he continues. \u201cWarm climate, sunny with nice weather. There\u2019s good food, lots of tradition and fun to visit if you are from overseas. It is hard when you have to come to another country but it\u2019s what I wanted - I wanted to play in Europe. \n\n\u201cThere are things I miss like friends and family. I actually miss our traditional Argentinian drink! It\u2019s called maté and is made from herbs. You have it with boiling hot water. It\u2019s a drink you share and have whilst you are sat speaking and socialising. Lots of people in Argentina enjoy it. There are some places in London which sell it but I bring it back when I go home.\u201d \n\n\n\nSince his £10m switch to Everton from River Plate in August 2015, Funes has become a mainstay in his national team. Regular call-ups, of course, provide the chance to journey back to his homeland several times a year and, indeed, the flurry of international breaks in the early part of the season meant he was involved in Argentina\u2019s World Cup qualifying fixtures during September, October and November. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m used to the travelling now,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a long journey, about 12 to 14 hours and I have to catch a connecting flight in Holland or Germany to get to Buenos Aires. Argentina players based in England, like Marcos Rojo, and others from around Europe will catch the same flights. Yes, it gets tiring but I don\u2019t think of it like that. \n\n\u201cMy family travel with me, too. It\u2019s good because my wife gets to see her relatives and my son can play with his little friends. I sometimes get the chance to see my parents but not always because they live on the other side of the country [in a city called Mendoza]. They have only had the chance to visit England once before, back in March. I showed them around and took them to a nice Argentina restaurant in Liverpool called CAU. I like to go out and try new foods but it has been nice to find a restaurant from home.\u201d \n\nAway from his day-to-day work, Funes Mori enjoys the comfort of spending his spare time venturing out in public places without too much attention. Yes, there will be the occasional autograph to sign and photo to pose for, but it\u2019s a complete contrast to his previous way of life in Buenos Aires. \n\nThe defender was one of River Plate\u2019s highest-profile players, a hero amongst supporters largely thanks to his famous match-winning goal in their \u2019Classico\u2019 win at the home of their cross-city rivals, Boca Juniors, in 2014. His last-minute header was a vital contribution as River reclaimed the domestic title for the first time in five years. \n\n\u201cOver here I feel free,\u201d he explains with honesty. \u201cI like to go to the park with my child and wife. It\u2019s nice to get out because not too many people recognise me. I like to go to the shopping mall, just stroll around and buy things. I\u2019m a humble person. \n\n\u201cIf I walked around Buenos Aires, people would all want pictures. When I go back home to Argentina it\u2019s different because there are a lot of River Plate fans so I hardly go out, maybe just to a restaurant to eat. It\u2019s part of my job and it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t like it, but sometimes it feels a little bit irritating. It\u2019s normal though - when people see someone famous they like to get pictures. I\u2019m playing in the national team and because of that the whole country looks at you.\u201d \n\nThis is where the conversation turns to Lionel Messi. \n\nFunes Mori is sat in the media room at USM Finch Farm holding his mobile phone. Stored away in the contacts list on the device is the number of the Barcelona superstar. He grins, somewhat embarrassingly, at the suggestion that he is good pals with one of the most distinguishable sportsmen on the planet. \n\n\u201cLionel is an uncomplicated person but everything he says or does becomes public,\u201d Funes reveals. \u201cHe goes anywhere and he is recognised. Some of the things he does in training are incredible. I don\u2019t get the chance to speak to him too much because I\u2019m a shy person.\u201d \n\nMessi announced he was turning his back on international football in June in the wake of Argentina\u2019s Copa America final penalty shootout defeat to Chile, before reversing his decision a couple of months later. \n\n\n \n\u201cIt\u2019s great that he came out of retirement because we need him a lot,\u201d continues the defender. \u201cIt\u2019s not just Argentina, football needs him because he is the best player in the world. \n\n\u201cFor the national team, we were disappointed because we wanted to be champions. We did our best to win the cup and, unfortunately, because of penalty kicks we couldn\u2019t do that. That\u2019s how football is. But, for me, the first time playing in a Copa America and reaching the final, it was an unbelievable experience.\u201d \n\nFunes now has 18 senior caps to his name. The standard of his performances have drawn acclaim and, in November, legendary defender Daniel Passarella, the man who skippered Argentina to World Cup glory in 1978, insisted the Everton centre-back should be handed the captain\u2019s armband for his country. \nA huge compliment from one of the most respected figures in the game but one that Funes plays down. \n\n\u201cThere are lots of captains before me; Messi and [Javier] Mascherano,\u201d he declares. \u201cI worked with Passarella at River Plate when he was the president. He was one of the best defenders in the world so to hear that from him is good. I accept his opinion and I really like it but I don\u2019t consider myself as a captain.\u201d \n\nThe interview ends with a glance to the future. Once Funes has realised his ambitions in England, he is resolute in a desire to return to South America to end his professional career at the place it started. \n\n\u201cWhen I go back to River Plate as one of the experienced players, maybe I would like to be the team\u2019s captain,\u201d he states. \u201cI would like to retire in Argentina because I won a lot of important things with River Plate and I think that it would be good to go back there.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: EPL - Everton news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: soccer news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: Premier League news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Feeling Right At Home","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"GB","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Everton FC","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169681269","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"99"},"name":"Everton FC","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Sports","Soccer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.evertonfc.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201340204","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:05:57Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Philip Green is closing in on a deal to salvage the pensions of thousands of ex-BHS workers \u2013 with the agreement likely to cost him more than £350m. \n \n\n \nSky News has learnt that the high street chain\u2019s former owner could be just days away from signing a provisional deal with The Pensions Regulator to plug the BHS scheme\u2019s controversial deficit. \n \nSources close to the talks between the two sides said that a deal could be struck as soon as next week, although they cautioned that there were still moving parts, and that further delays could yet ensue. \n \nWe\u2019ve been here before, said one insider. \n \nIt won\u2019t be done until it\u2019s done. \n \nDetails of the likely agreement, which would come nearly eight months after Sir Philip promised to sort the deficit, were largely unclear on Saturday night. \n \nOne person said, however, that it was likely to involve lump-sum payments to thousands of former BHS workers with smaller pension pots, alongside the creation of a new scheme to make ongoing payments to remaining members. \n \nAny deal will be closely scrutinised by MPs on the Commons Work and Pensions Select Committee, whose chairman, Frank Field, has fought a long battle to persuade Sir Philip to pay up. \n \nAn agreement between the tycoon and regulators could leave BHS pensioners continuing to face modest cuts to their benefits, although a settlement would have to be on better terms than those of the industry-funded lifeboat, the Pension Protection Fund (PPF). \n \nLast November, the pensions watchdog began legal proceedings against Sir Philip, his companies and Dominic Chappell, the man to whom he sold BHS, in an effort to accelerate a deal. \n \nSources said that a warning notice issued to Sir Philip had included a demand for a sum north of £350m. \n \nLesley Titcomb, chief executive of the Pensions Regulator, is also under pressure to hammer out a deal that guarantees payments to more than 20,000 pensioners. \n \nBHS collapsed into administration last April, bringing an end to nearly a century of trading on the high street. \n \nApproximately 11,000 people lost their jobs when the chain closed its doors for the final time last August, sparking a deepening row between its former owners, advisers, regulators and BHS\u2019s administrators. \n \nThe last formal valuation of BHS\u2019s pension deficit stood at £571m but is thought to have increased substantially as ultra-low interest rates have depressed gilt yields. \n \nSir Philip, whose high street empire includes brands such as Top Shop and Dorothy Perkins, has fought a pitched battle with Mr Field and MPs who demanded that he be stripped of his knighthood. \n \nSky News revealed last August that Sir Philip was seeking an assurance that regulators would abandon their separate anti-avoidance probe intoý BHS\u2019s pension deficit if he made a voluntary financial contribution to the retirement pots of thousands of the collapsed chain\u2019s former employees. \n \nSir Philip\u2019s spokesman declined to comment on Saturday, while a spokesman for the regulator repeated an earlier statement, saying: We remain in discussion with Sir Philip\u2019s advisers. \n \nAny settlement offer we accept has to be robust enough to stand the test of time and mean that members and the PPF are not left in a worse position further down the road. \n http://video.news.sky.com/video/h264/vod/700/2016/11/DIGI060803THBHSKLEINMANPKG06001478153586969700.mp4 \n(c) Sky News 2017:

He was quite social on his table that he was sitting at apparently. I think he was just very glad of that and the other few occasions when we would invite him to family parties, Mr Dias said. \n \nMr Dias said they were neighbours from the 1980s until Mr Lytton moved to Pakistan in 2005, without warning. \n \nNeighbours say he was a tube driver, and at one stage perhaps worked as a taxi driver and even a casino croupier. \n \nMr Lytton was found on the morning of 12 December 2015, fully clothed and facing the summit of Indian\u2019s Head, a prominent feature above Dovestone Reservoir on Saddleworth Moor in the Peak District. \n \nPolice discovered he had travelled to the UK from Lahore, Pakistan, two days before his death. \n \nThree train tickets and £130 in cash were found on his body, but he had no wallet, ID or phone. \n \nOn the day before his body was found, he was seen on CCTV pacing outside London\u2019s Ealing Broadway station. He was later seen at London\u2019s Euston station. \n \nHe then travelled by train from London to Manchester, where he entered a pub in Greenfield and asked for directions to the 1,500ft summit. \n \nHe had been warned not to attempt the walk so late in the day but set off anyway. Witnesses saw him on the track at dusk that evening. \n \nFollowing his death, toxicology reports showed Mr Lytton had been killed by strychnine, which is found in rat poison. Police say he poisoned himself. \n \nNumerous theories about his identity were raised as the police investigation continued. \n \nIt wasn\u2019t until a leg implant was traced back to Lahore where the surgery had been carried out and his identity was discovered. \n \nWe\u2019ve found the whole thing very sad, Mr Dias said. I think he was a very lonely person with only a few regular visitors. When he left we have no recollection of him saying goodbye to us. I would go as far to use the word recluse. He would keep himself to himself but was always a very pleasant person. \n \nA full inquest will take place on 14 March. \n http://video.news.sky.com/video/h264/vod/700/2017/01/DIGIDavidLyttonMysteryBodyVT1485665079770700.mp4 \n(c) Sky News 2017: skynews","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Pakistan news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Man found dead on Saddleworth Moor was \u2018a lonely character\u2019","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","county":"Isle of Wight","zipCode":"PO30","state":"England","countryCode":"GB","zipArea":"Isle of Wight","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Isle of Wight Radio","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"172637663","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"10"},"name":"Isle of Wight Radio","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.iwradio.co.uk"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://video.news.sky.com/video/h264/vod/700/2017/01/DIGIDavidLyttonMysteryBodyVT1485665079770700.mp4"],"sequenceId":"695201340746","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T00:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:05:57Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://iwradio.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/01/57b8e752d3447a4c87c9b32c274a45032de758ea7e5ea100ec8b76768e731faf_3879965.jpeg"}],"video":[]}}

I was nervous. \n \nIn my experience as a former kid and also the mom of former kids, \"getting called into the office\" was never a good thing. Except, of course, for that one time in the fifth grade when the principal sent me to the kindergarten room to hang out with 6-year-olds until I could grow up and behave myself. \n \nWhich apparently I did. But not until I got to see this huge pet rabbit with a single ear sticking straight out of its head (like a gladiola) that some kid brought in for Show-and-Tell. As I have said before, this is my favorite fifth-grade memory. By far! Even better than all those memories of playing kissing tag at recess! \n  \nStill. I didn't know what to expect when I walked into Jennifer's office, so I was delighted when she asked if I would consider doing an advice column for The Salt Lake Tribune. \n \n(Memo to my family: Hey, look at that! Someone actually wants my advice!) \n \nI immediately put on my professional face and said, \"Of course. I would be honored to take on this new responsibility, beginning right now.\" \n \nBut first some disclaimers. \n \nI am not a licensed therapist or social worker. I am also not a licensed Realtor, cabdriver, surgeon, food handler, day-care provider, aesthetician, veterinarian, acupuncturist, architect, financial planner, tattoo artist or chiropractor. \n \nIn short, I am not licensed to do ANYTHING in the state of Utah except drive a car. So there's that, although it may interest you to know that I excel at parallel parking and will happily provide educational demonstrations if asked. \n \nStill, I will do my best to answer your questions. Bottom line, I'll try hard not to screw up your life. \n \nNow here are a few examples of questions I've already received, along with my answers. \n \nHow many cats make somebody a Cat Lady? \n \n\u2014 \"Wondering\" \n \nOne more than you already have. Clearly. So don't worry about it. \n \nMy extended family is a house divided. Some of us voted for Clinton. Some of us voted for Trump. Passions run strong on both sides. The problem is that there's a family wedding coming up and I'm worried that things could get ugly amongst us. Any suggestions? \n \n­\u2014 \"Nervous About Nuptials\" \n \nGood times, right? \n \nThis is why there used to be unwritten rules about discussing religion and politics in polite society, because doing so tends to generate heat (as the old saying goes) without shedding much light. We human beings hold our beliefs \u2014 political and religious \u2014 close to our hearts. In fact, we often define ourselves by intensely held beliefs, which then confer upon us feelings of deeply satisfying righteousness. Yay! Truth is on our side! That's why we get so riled up when it comes to politics and religion.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"ANN CANNON"},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"},{"name":"Salt Lake City news","group":"US regional"},{"name":"Journalism news","group":"Media"},{"name":"Media latest","group":"Media"}],"title":"Ask Ann Cannon: New Tribune advice columnist will try hard not to screw up your life","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Salt Lake","zipCode":"84101","state":"Utah","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Salt Lake City","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Salt Lake Tribune","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657500","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4687"},"name":"Salt Lake Tribune","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Arts","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.sltrib.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201346225","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:05:01Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:06:01Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

They have never been good about managing money. They are both retired now and on a fixed income, and they have been asking me or one of my four adult siblings for money to help with their bills each month. \n   \nI don't mind giving, but recently my siblings and I have become annoyed because, while they continue to ask for money, at the same time they are also taking short trips, which include hotels and rental cars, and inviting friends out to dinner. \n   \nThey also have a storage locker full of junk that eats up several hundred dollars a month. We have offered to help them clean out the locker, and possibly make money from some of the items in there, but they never commit. Should my siblings and I continue to help, or should we put our collective feet down? -- ANNOYED IN ALAMEDA, CALIF. \n   \nDEAR ANNOYED: Put your collective feet down. You and your siblings are good children, but it's time for an intervention. Before giving your parents more money, you should all sit down with them and help them to create a budget, taking into account their fixed income and what you children can afford as a supplement. Then tell your parents they must live within that budget. Period. Their expenses must be trimmed, and the storage unit would be an excellent place to start. \n   \nDEAR ABBY: How do you discourage someone's friendliness without being rude? \n   \nAn elderly man recently moved in with his family in our neighborhood. He roams the neighborhood and approaches anyone he sees to introduce himself and start a conversation. He doesn't seem to have dementia, as he knows where and who he is, but his behavior is a little odd (such as asking for the precise spelling of everyone's first name). \n   \n Get tips on free stuff and fun ideas delivered weekly to your inbox  \n   \nUnfortunately, now that he has met my husband and me, he comes up and knocks on the door to chat -- weekdays, evenings, weekends. The last time I was outside with my three kids, he approached with a stack of photos and proceeded to show me at least 100 prints of a trip he had taken abroad -- 10 years ago. \n   \nI feel trapped because I don't want to be mean to an old man, but I dread seeing him stroll down the road. What is the best way to deal with this situation? -- WANTING TO WITHDRAW \n   \nDEAR WANTING: The poor man is probably lonely and looking for human contact. Because you are not prepared to engage in his \"neighborly\" conversations, the next time he strolls by, tell him that you do not have time to chat right now. If he knocks on your door, tell him that you are busy or that you will be leaving shortly. And suggest to him that he may want to find a senior center so that he can make friends with contemporaries and won't feel so isolated.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Siblings start to resent funding parents' shortfall","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Santa Barbara","zipCode":"93455","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Santa Maria","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Santa Maria Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169671980","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"18"},"name":"Santa Maria Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Lifestyle","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.santamariatimes.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201346968","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:06:04Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

I\u2019m loving it. \n   \nNothing makes a home homier than the aroma of homemade bread, add that to a rainy day and I\u2019m in heaven. \n   \nAn old family favorite, one I get frequent requests to repeat, is my mother\u2019s tried-and-true \u201cFrench\u201d bread. Notice the French in quotes. This isn\u2019t an authentic version, just a terrific recipe that can mimic a French taste by playing around with the salt and sugar quantities. \n   \nMy mother, an avid baker, got this from a friend during the 1940s and it has been a staple in my family ever since. I refer to it as her no-need-to-knead bread. \n   \nThis is a multipurpose, basic bread. It\u2019s a soft dough and needs to be baked in a pan. For company, I often double or triple the recipe, divide it into eighths or 12ths, and use miniature pans. That way each diner gets his or her own loaf. \n   \nOne recipe makes four small or two rounded loaves when baked in one-quart Corningware casseroles, which are perfect for rounded, crusty loaves. \n   \nMix up the flours, too. Use part whole wheat or rye \u2014 no more than 1 to 1 1/2 cups \u2014 add some of your sourdough starter during the yeast-softening stage, throw in a handful or two of oatmeal, wheat germ, millet, nuts or sunflower seeds, etc., the possibilities are endless. I\u2019ve tossed in dried herbs, onions and garlic as well as small cubes of cheese, all came out delicious. \n   \nAnd, I repeat, you can\u2019t mess up this recipe as long as you keep the yeast, wet and dry ingredients in the proportions given. \n   \nIt\u2019s great with barbecue, spaghetti, salads and for sandwiches. I\u2019ve never had any left over long enough to try it as French toast, but I\u2019m sure it would work there, too. \n   \nThis recipe is quick to make, but it does require two risings, and depending on how warm your kitchen is, may take anywhere from two to four hours for the first one, then just less than 30 minutes for the second. \n   \nIf I\u2019m making soup, stew, a spot of chili beans or spaghetti, I start this first and by the time everything else is ready, the bread is baked. \n   \nWhether the rain keeps up or not, give your family a treat and bake this soon. \n   \n Get tips on free stuff and fun ideas delivered weekly to your inbox  \n   \nHomemade bread \n   \n1 pkg. quick-acting dry yeast \n   \n2 c. lukewarm water, approximately \n   \n1 Tbsp. sugar \n   \n2 tsp. salt \n   \n4 c. sifted all-purpose flour \n   \nDissolve yeast in 1 cup water. Measure and sift flour with sugar and salt into a large bowl. Stir in softened yeast. Add just enough water to hold dough together. Mix until you have soft, rather sticky dough. Cover with cloth and set bowl in a warm spot in your kitchen but not near direct heat. Let rise until double in size. This takes from 2 to 4 hours depending upon room temperature. When high and spongy, punch down with greased hands and give it a good sound beating. Divide dough into two for large loaves, or four small parts and place each in a well-greased baking dish/pan. Cover again with cloth and let rise until dough reaches top of baking dish. At this point start oven, 400 degrees or moderately hot.

Donald Trump\u2019s first conversation with Vladimir Putin since his inauguration as \"positive\". \n \n\n \nFollowing the hour-long call between the two world leaders, US officials described it as a significant start to improving the relationship between the United States and Russia that is in need of repair. \n \nA statement said a range of topics were discussed \u2013 including the prospect of mutual co-operation to defeat Islamic State and efforts in working together to achieve more peace throughout the world, including Syria. \n \nHowever, a White House official said sanctions imposed on Russia by President Trump\u2019s predecessor, Barack Obama, were not mentioned during the talks. \n \nBoth President Trump and President Putin are hopeful that after today\u2019s call the two sides can move quickly to tackle terrorism and other important issues of mutual concern, the Trump administration\u2019s statement added. \n \nTheir discussion about the threat posed by IS came as Mr Trump signed an executive order asking joint chiefs of staff to submit a plan within 30 days for defeating the terror group. \n \nIn its readout of the call, the Kremlin said the conversation took place in a positive and businesslike manner \u2013 adding that both leaders had agreed to maintain regular personal contact as they prepare for a face-to-face meeting. \n \nMoscow also said both men had addressed the importance of restoring mutually beneficial trade and economic ties between business circles of the two countries \u2013 which may be at odds with the White House\u2019s insistence that sanctions were not discussed. \n \nMr Trump\u2019s promises to rebuild US-Russian co-operation have been welcomed by the Kremlin, as the relationship has been pushed to its worst level since the Cold War following the Ukraine crisis, the Syrian civil war and allegations that Russian hackers meddled in the US election. \n \nAhead of the call, Mr Trump was non-committal on the subject, telling reporters on Friday: We\u2019ll see what happens. \n \nThe European Union has also hit Russia with sanctions for its actions in Ukraine, while Prime Minister Theresa May said after meeting Mr Trump on Friday that sanctions should continue. \n \nPresident Trump also spoke with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Saturday, with the White House saying the pair agreed on the fundamental importance of NATO. \n \nThe President had previously dismissed the alliance as obsolete, a remark that had caused alarm in Europe. \n \nFrench President Francois Hollande also had a telephone conversation with Mr Trump, telling his US counterpart that he should not take a protectionist approach in office. \n \nIn an unstable and uncertain world, turning inward would be a dead end, Mr Hollande told Mr Trump in their first official telephone conversation, according to a statement from the French President\u2019s office. \n

The role required some gravitas, but also called upon his voice-acting skills. \n \n\"I had lines, so already that was a plus,\" Hamill said, taking a friendly dig at his wordless appearance in \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens.\" \n \n\u2014 \n \nOne of the more heartfelt standing ovations at the festival was given Thursday morning to filmmaker Jennifer Brea, after the last screening of her documentary \"Unrest,\" in which she chronicled her battle with myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME), commonly known as chronic fatigue syndrome. \n \nBrea called the movie's rollout at the festival \"probably the most incredible few days in my life,\" as a number of audience members stood and talks about how they have been affected by the disease. \n \nPart of the push behind \"Unrest\" is to lobby for increased funding for research on the often-misunderstood disease. There is no cure, and no sure treatment, though Brea said she is helped some by antiviral medication. \n \nShe also avoids mold, which some sufferers have found to exacerbate the disease. (In the movie, she and husband Omar Wasow take a trip to the Southwest, where the dry air helps keep mold down.) \n \nPart of her mold avoidance, she said, was relocating to Los Angeles. \"I may be the only person who moved to Los Angeles for the air,\" Brea joked. \n \n\u2014 \n \nThe one-on-one experiences of the VR Palace were a must-view at the festival, though it was nearly impossible to try them all in the allotted one-hour sessions. \n \nTwo of the works were goofy fun. Mindshow allowed the viewer to take on the persona of a space alien, interacting with a pre-recorded astronaut character (voiced by comedian Dana Gould) \u2014 and then turning the tables, playing the astronaut opposite the alien the viewer just recorded. Chocolate, a psychedelic music video with a track by the EDM artist Giraffage, invited the user to dance as a multi-tentacled creature who shoots chrome kittens out its hands. \n \nIn a much more serious vein was filmmaker Rose Troche's \"If Not Love,\" which follows one horrible scenario \u2014 a conflicted gay man leaves a sexual encounter, and in his self-loathing commits a mass shooting in a gay bar \u2014 and imagines what would be different if his sex partner had shown a little more compassion.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"SEAN P.

(Photo: News Sentinel file photo) Buy Photo \n  \nThe News Sentinel and other publications have had articles about recent college graduates unable to find employment. This is the tip of a scandal of unbelievable proportion and importance for our country. \n \nThe goal of education is allegedly to prepare kids for life and to earn a living. How is this goal met by giving young adults meaningless degrees in exchange for $50,000 or more in student loans or parents emptying savings that will need to be paid back in real dollars? This is a failure at so many levels. \n \nStart with parents. Kids in high school for the most part don\u2019t have part-time jobs. They have no experience with the workplace or what kind of vocation they might enjoy. They also have no idea that an employer needs to compensate them for the value that their work provides for the business. \n \nI once asked a group of students how much they expected to make right after college graduation. The answers ranged from $50,000 to $200,000 a year. The all expected to quickly earn even more. When I told them that they would be expected to provide the business with enough value to cover their wages, workers' compensation, Social Security, taxes, medical insurance, the lease on the building, advertising, marketing and, of course, sufficient profits to keep the shareholders happy and the paychecks cashing, they were dumbfounded. I then told them that they would need to provide the company with $125,000 of value to justify their $50,000 salary. That was the first time they heard that, I assure you. \n \nParents could start the process by sitting their kids down and explaining their work experiences or even getting them some part-time work instead of one more extracurricular activity. \n \nEducation also plays a role. We have taken vocational training out of high school. This has removed an important source of experience for students. They can\u2019t find a calling as an electrician, welder, machinist, mechanic, plumber, carpenter, HVAC installer/repairman or dozens of others if they aren\u2019t exposed to them. How old was the last repairman you hired? These types of courses need to be reinstated in high schools. \n \nAs for colleges, the two-year schools are doing their part. Universities are another matter. Most state schools pay their deans more money annually than many of their students will earn in their lifetimes. The professors are tenured and untouchable. The administrators are all involved in the support of the structure. The alumni pour money into the endowments, which are ridiculous for state schools supported in part by tax dollars. The students get annual tuition increases in spite of the schools sitting on million- or even billion-dollar endowments. We need to recognize the value of a college degree is in part calculated by the education industry, which is protecting its own interest. \n \nThe best example of career guidance I\u2019ve experienced was several years ago. My home needed sewer work. The young man in charge of the crew was not what I expected. He explained that after high school his father told him he wasn\u2019t going to college. He was going to learn the family plumbing business. His dad told him his business wasn\u2019t going to be obsolete or outsourced. Ten years later he owns the business. He told me he has one of his old buddies working for him -- one of the college graduates. \n \nDonald Southwell, Loudon \n \nRead or Share this story: http://knoxne.ws/2jDZUz5","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Donald Southwell, Guest columnist"},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Education news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Citizen's Voice: Students need part-time jobs, vocational classes","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Knox","zipCode":"37902","state":"Tennessee","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Knoxville","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Knox News Sentinel","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169669706","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2983"},"name":"Knox News Sentinel","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.knoxnews.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://knoxne.ws/2jDZUz5"],"sequenceId":"695201354295","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:06:03Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Vermillion, a 22-year-old fellow Vol, jumped off the 11th Street pedestrian bridge on campus. Unfortunately, suicides on college campuses are not that rare. According to www.collegedegreesearch.net , 1,100 college students die of suicide per year. Vermillion's tragic death and the deaths of so many college students around the country should be a call to action for universities to implement funding that keeps up with the growing enrollment rate and for counseling center services to be more publicized and accessible. College students are one of the most at-risk populations in the United States for anxiety and depression, which means it is imperative our Volunteers know their resources and have full access to them. \n \nWith the consistent rise in admissions rates on college campuses, the need to expand mental health services has significantly increased. In fact, the numbers of students who have seriously considered attempting suicide, injured themselves without suicidal intent, made a suicide attempt or considered hurting another person all went up between 2010-13, according to the American Psychological Association. Despite the growth in college enrollment each year, many universities have not adjusted their budgets appropriately for mental health and counseling services. \n \nAs the Center for Collegiate Mental Health determined, the demand for counseling services has been outpaced by enrollment rates five-fold. This means that in order to keep up with the enrollment rate of a university, administrators must increase the counseling center\u2019s budget by the same percentage. As for UT specifically, according to the Board of Trustees' annual meeting reports, the proposed budget increases the counseling center\u2019s budget by about 3.1 percent, but it is questionable if that will be enough to combat the increase in enrollment for next year. \n \nFunding is not the only problem. The stigma surrounding mental health is so prominent that college students are less likely to seek help, even though they may be the population that would benefit the most from it, according to the Journal of Medical Care Research and Review. \n \nKnowing that, it is imperative that the university community stand together to eliminate the stigma surrounding mental health issues. It is also vital that the university educate the student body about resources available to them. Resources like drop-in consultations, psychological assessments, crisis interventions, individual, couple and group therapy can be discussed in a Freshman 101 class or by the resident hall directors. These services are all free for students. \n \nIt is important to know that the mental health of students is not the responsibility of just the counseling center. Informing each other on coping strategies, being aware of our surroundings and of the emotions of others can encourage someone at risk to set up an initial consultation with the counseling center or be referred to another psychologist in town if they want to exceed the 12 allotted appointments that the counseling center gives. \n \nCollege can seem like another universe. Students must adjust like they have never had to before and peer relationships are crucial, which is why college students are at a high risk for suicide and serious mental health problems. If we stand together in true Volunteer fashion and promise to stomp out the mental health stigma, demand more publicity for mental health resources and counseling center services, and be vigilant with those around us, maybe we can all help prevent someone from committing suicide, and do justice to Vermillion. A forever Vol. \n \nUT students experiencing mental health issues or who know other students who are should contact the Student Counseling Center at 865-974-2196 or email counselingcenter@utk.edu.

Still, I\u2019m thankful we\u2019re finally having a real winter to refresh our lakes and streams. That said, a few rainstorms needn\u2019t keep anyone housebound. Especially, not when you live in the heart of Central Coast wine country where our creative wineries offer some pretty great events every month of the year. \n   \nWith Valentine\u2019s Day a little over two weeks away, I\u2019ve found some very special ways of saying \"I love you\" to your sweetheart by taking part in a winery event, featuring great wines and delicious treats in Santa Ynez wine country. And more great news, some events will last through the month of February in Paso Robles. \n  \n Santa Ynez Wine Country  \n  \nZaca Mesa, founded in 1973, is notable because most wine industry insiders think of it as the university where many of our greatest local winemakers got their start. Not only that, most of them stayed here to create their own noble brands in Santa Barbara County. So the minds behind Zaca Mesa today have created Zaca University, naturally. They offer wine classes that are open to the public to help you better understand the magic that goes into the making of a bottle of fine wine. The upcoming class, \u201cSeduced by Syrah,\u201d takes place at their tasting room Feb. 11 from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. It will provide a tasting experience to allow you to truly get to know their five unique syrahs during a tasting with the winemaking team and a certified sommelier. They describe the tasting as a \u201cdeeper look into the remarkable 2013 vintage.\u201d They will teach you to recognize the impact from each factor of making the wine, from farming the vines, the effects of the vintage (the year it was grown) to winemaking, has on each wine even though they are all grown in their estate vineyard. It\u2019s not only informative, it\u2019s fun. The price is $75 per person (wine club members get in for $60 per person), which includes lunch with Zaca Mesa\u2019s great team of people who are quite passionate about winemaking. Learn more and/or buy your tickets at www.zacamesa.com . \n  \n Solvang Wine Country  \n  \nThere are many new tasting rooms in Solvang. This quaint little town just keeps on growing better all of the time. But this special event, Solvang\u2019s Third Wednesday Wine and Beer Walk, which only happens once a year, is on Feb. 15 from 4 to 7 p.m. It\u2019s a great way to help you get to know some new tasting rooms. For only $20 per person, you can taste two samples at five wine and beer tasting rooms. The ticket price gets you a souvenir glass, and a map to make it convenient to find them all. You must be 21 or over. Purchase your tickets (cash only) on the day of the event at one of these three businesses: the Olive House at 1661 Mission Drive, Wandering Dog Wine Bar at 1539-C Mission Drive and Sort This Out Cellars at 1636 Copenhagen Drive, where you will also be able to pick up the Wine & Beer Walk logo glass and head out to make some new favorites. For more information, visit www.solvangthirdwednesday.com . \n   \n Get tips on free stuff and fun ideas delivered weekly to your inbox  \n  \n Paso Robles Wine Country  \n  \nWhether you live nearby or an hour away, Vina Robles in Paso Robles offers some compelling reasons to rank them among your favorite Central Coast tasting rooms. On three Saturdays during the month of February, they will provide free concerts at the tasting room. Not only is it complimentary, but reservations are not necessary. Their fine wines will be available, which you can purchase in flights (small pours of several different white and red wines), by-the-glass or by-the-bottle. They only ask that you do not bring in alcoholic products that they haven\u2019t made. They will also have tapas available for purchase to sate your hunger. The free events take place on Feb. 4, 18 and 25. \n   \nOn Feb. 11, they are offering a pre-Valentine\u2019s Day early evening tasting from 5 until 8 p.m., featuring a \u201cChocolate Festival.\u201d They have invited other wineries and several chocolate vendors in for a wine and chocolate tasting that will be exceptional. The cost is $40 per person ($35 per person for wine club members), with a portion of the proceeds going to the Big Brothers Big Sisters of SLO County charity. Singer-songwriter Melody Flemin will perform. She will also appear during the free concert on Feb. 4. Other artists will include Kenny Taylor on Feb. 18 and Whitherward, a nationally touring indie-folk duo, on the Feb. 25.

When Jody Crouse took the mat at 220 pounds for Becahi Saturday night at Easton Area Middle School, the Golden Hawks trailed 20-19 and appeared to be in some trouble against a surging Nazareth squad. When the Becahi senior left the mat after pinning Tucker Klump in 3 minutes and 1 second, Becahi all the momentum and was launched on a five-bout winning streak to end the EPC championship final. That may have happened because Crouse entered with his own momentum. \u201cI think (beating Dillon Ryan of Wyoming Seminary) Thursday was the best win of my career,\u201d said Crouse, who won 5-3 in overtime at 195 pounds. \u201cHe placed seventh at the Ironman and he was really strong. That gave me a huge confidence boost.\u201d Even with that motivation, Crouse said Klump offered a real challenge. \u201cI was frustrated that he kept slipping off my double,\u201d he said. \u201cKlump is a tough kid.\u201d\n\nEnergy levels high for Becahi. In the same gym Sunday for FLO\u2019s \u2018Who\u2019s No. 1\u2019 Duals, the Golden Hawks had often seemed lethargic and diffident on their bench, making little noise and less impact. Not so Saturday. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have the team energy we needed,\u201d Crouse said. \u201cTonight, everyone was up cheering for their teammates. Every one has a lot more energy.\u201d It showed. \n\nBravo EPC! That gasp you just heard was conference officials fainting from reading those words in this space. It\u2019s true we have been heavily critical of the way the way the EPC runs wrestling, but there was nothing to complain about Saturday. Quite the contrary. Separating the championship match from third and fifth place spotlighted the deserving teams in the final in a terrific atmosphere; it\u2019s a change EPC officials should be proud of. It also allowed the marvelous Liberty-Northampton third-place match, perhaps the best dual we have seen all season (won by the Konkrete Kids 34-32) to receive the attention it well deserved. The $6 admission was reasonable and fair and Easton did its usual bang-up job of hosting. Kudos all round.\n\nGood news for Nazareth \u2026 at some point. Asked if freshman lower-weight sensation Andrew Cerniglia might be back in the lineup sometime \u201csoon\u201d, Nazareth coach Dave Crowell smiled and said. \u201cThere\u2019s a good chance of that happening,\u201d he said. Crowell declined to be more specific as to when, but whenever it happens it\u2019s a major boost for the Blue Eagles. Cerniglia, remember, won the Beast of the East pinner award (no small feat) before he broke his collarbone, and would likely be a major generator of bonus points in the lineup. Our bet on his return \u2013 state duals. \n\nNext time? Becahi coach Jeff Karam said \u201chopefully we\u2019ll see Nazareth again,\u201d and while that\u2019s probably going to happen, maybe even twice, Karam might want to be careful about what he\u2019s hoping for. The 20-point margin didn\u2019t come close to how the match actually felt and went \u2013 it was much closer. The Golden Hawks won 106, 113, 120, 126 and 138 \u2013 15 team points -- by a combined 10 points, some of which came very late. Give Nazareth one more takedown in each bout and it could well have been very different \u2013 which means it might well be very different next time, if, indeed, there is a next time. \"There's a lot of very good teams out there,\" Crowell said.

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official.

One will be lying if one said there is no nepotism. There definitely is. But it is there in every walk of life. When I say that, I don\u2019t want to take away anything from a lot of my friends who are also from the industry,\u201d Huma says in an interview. \n\u201cThey are very hardworking and passionate people. You have to give credit for the hard work and talent but being from here (industry) makes it easier.\u201d \nThe actress says unlike her friends from the industry, she does not have the advantage of knowing the nitty-gritty of things. \n\u201cA lot of times, I don\u2019t know who to call, how to plan my career, what films to sign. You really want that, an elder person around to help you plan it. They have the advantage of that. It\u2019s just there.\u201d \nHuma made her debut in the two-part crime saga \u201cGangs of Wasseypur\u201d in 2012 and got wide spread critical acclaim for her performance opposite Nawazuddin Siddiqui. \nShe will now be seen in the upcoming \u201cJolly LLB 2\u201d opposite Akshay Kumar, two years after her last big release \u201cBadlapur\u201d. \nThe 30-year-old actress says post \u201cBadlapur\u201d and \u201cGangs\u2026\u201d, she was offered similar characters. \n\u201cAfter Badlapur I got offered very similar characters. Our industry is quite myopic in that sense. When I did \u2018Gangs\u2019, I was only getting offered the earthy, rustic girl characters. I met some people and they were like \u2018oh you can speak English?\u2019. \n\u201cThat\u2019s what happens. You are as good as your last release. Since I am not from Mumbai, people didn\u2019t know me here back in the day, they didn\u2019t know how to place me after my first film.\u201d \nThe actress, however, did not sign \u201cany film coming her way\u201d and waited for the right one as she does not believe signing movies is a rat race. \n\u201cWhen I did \u2018Badlapur\u2019 also, I realised people would just give you the kind of work you\u2019ve done before. I was very clever I waited for the right film to happen. I read, travel, write, have several hobbies. I kept myself busy. I am not in the rat race to sign my next film.\u201d \nDirected by Subhash Kapoor, the courtroom-drama-comedy is a sequel to the 2013 film \u201cJolly LLB\u201d and is scheduled to release on February 10.

Those who were not on American soil when the decree came into effect are not able to re-enter for three months \u2013 separating them from their families and putting their jobs at risk. \n \nSome green card holders who were flying home to the US when the executive order was signed have been taken into custody at airports upon arrival \u2013 with dozens of immigration lawyers attempting to help the stranded. \n \nA judge has ruled those who have already landed in the US with valid visas can be temporarily allowed to stay in the country. \n \nAs of Saturday night, customs and border protection officials had denied entry to more than 170 people. \n \nOthers who were about to board flights back to America have been told they cannot travel \u2013 and the Homeland Security Department has been contacting airlines and recommending them to deny boarding to certain passengers. \n \nEnforcement of the executive order for those landing in the States has been described as patchy and disorganised, and some American airports have been more lenient than others. \n \nAccording to the executive order, exceptions can be made when it is in the national interest, but one federal law enforcement official said: It\u2019s unclear at this point what the threshold of the national interest is. \n \nThe International Air Transport Association has been told that the ban also applies to flight crew who are from one of the listed countries. \n \nProtests are taking place across the US \u2013 including airports in New York, Washington DC, Los Angeles, Chicago and Dallas. \n \nThe decree has also created uncertainty for refugees who were about to begin a new life in the States, as all resettlements have been suspended for at least 120 days while tougher vetting rules are established. Syrian refugees have been specifically barred from the US indefinitely. \n \nOne aid organisation said it knew of 2,000 refugees who had been scheduled to relocate to the US next week. \n \nNo refugees were on planes heading to America when the order came into force, but 350 people who had already begun their journeys are now stuck in Kenya. \n \nWashington Governor Jay Inslee, speaking at Sea-Tac Airport, condemned the chaos and cruelty of Mr Trump\u2019s policy \u2013 and warned it was provocative, incompetent, ineffective and damaging to the economy. \n \nBritish citizens who carry passports for one of the seven affected countries have also been caught up in the disruption. \n \nHamaseh Tayari, a Scottish vet who holds an Iranian passport, told the Guardian she has been left stranded in Costa Rica as her flight back to Glasgow was scheduled to go via New York. \n \nShe and her boyfriend now face the possibility of having to pay an extra £2,000 to fly to Madrid in order to get home. \n \nPresident Trump has said the executive order is a necessary step to stop radical Islamic terrorists from coming to the US \u2013 but stressed the decree is not a Muslim ban. \n \nHe has faced condemnation from leaders around the world, with Iran\u2019s Foreign Minister warning Tehran is going to stop issuing new visas to US citizens in retaliation to the ban. \n \nAmerican technology giants have also responded furiously to the immigration clampdown. \n \nApple chief executive Tim Cook said his company does not support the policy. In an apparent reference to its co-founder Steve Jobs, the son of a Syrian immigrant, Mr Cook said: Apple would not exist without immigration, let alone thrive and innovate the way we do. \n \nGoogle has urged its employees from the seven countries affected to cancel any travel plans outside the US. \n \nThe impact on foreign students is also unclear. Figures from the Homeland Security Department suggest that 17,000 students from the blacklisted countries were allowed into the US in 2015/16. \n  http://video.news.sky.com/video/h264/vod/700/2017/01/DIG060606SUTRUMPREFUGEEVT1485670229935700.mp4 \n(c) Sky News 2017: skynews","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Trump\u2019s immigration ban sparks \u2018chaos and cruelty\u2019 worldwide","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","county":"Isle of Wight","zipCode":"PO30","state":"England","countryCode":"GB","zipArea":"Isle of Wight","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Isle of Wight Radio","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"172637663","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"10"},"name":"Isle of Wight Radio","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.iwradio.co.uk"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://video.news.sky.com/video/h264/vod/700/2017/01/DIG060606SUTRUMPREFUGEEVT1485670229935700.mp4"],"sequenceId":"695201362731","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T00:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:06:10Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://iwradio.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/01/90445d11880b538f1876fd0fbae25381c76c3814e29b90f21a8a53b238778cd0_3879934.jpeg"}],"video":[]}}

In a statement issued on Wednesday, Eso Oodua urges all Yoruba people to begin the process to actualise a new nation form the people, stretching from Lagos, through Jebba, Lokoja to Warri\u201d. \nThe group said that \u201cYoruba people are bitter, disenchanted, angry, hungry and desperate for a revolutionary change in a filthy land where only the cruel, the mischievous and the dishonest can easily survive.\u201d \n \nSaid the group \u201cOur position is emboldened by what is going on in Nigeria, the killings, joblessness, the massive migration of hostile and armed people into the South West, the collapse of values, the disintegration of public trust, the leadership ruin, and the floundering fortunes of the people in the hands of self-serving, greedy, malicious and self-destructive elite.\u201d \n \nA statement signed by the group\u2019s spokesperson, Dr. Akinrogun Ahmed Akindola urged Yoruba people at home and abroad to prepare for the \u201cinevitable battle of freedom leading to the official founding of Oodua Republic which begins from Lagos, through Jebba, Yagba, Lokoja, Okun and Itsekiri territories in Delta State.\u201d The statement was made available to Irohinoodua through email. The group said other parts of the country have been compelled to resort to \u201carms uprising, bombing, kidnapping and even suicide\u201d saying that what has sustained a fragile peace in Yoruba land is nothing but the civilisation of the people which he said is no longer able to stand in the face of \u201cpublic and state terror\u201d imposed on the people.   \n \nDr. Akindola said, \u201cNigeria to Yoruba people means death, poverty, backwardness, retrogression and repression of our rich potentials\u201d. He said the Yoruba political class have failed to allay the fears and aspirations of the people adding that only a sovereign state of the Yoruba people will resolve the chain of hurdles that stand on the path of sustainable development in Yoruba land.  \n \nHe said the lukewarm attitudes to previous elections by Yoruba people in their territories represent a vote of no confidence in the entire Nigerian political system and all that pertains to it. \u201cOur position is borne out of historical facts and the traumatic experiences of the Yoruba people since 1914 when Nigeria was created by martial fiat. Our campaign for Yoruba Nation has therefore become irreversible. It is a reflection of the reality that many of our people have given up hope on Nigeria\u201d. \n \nThe group said the 50 million people Yoruba Nation is bigger than 52 countries in Europe and 82 member countries in the United Nations and it will be the third largest country in Africa after Ethiopia and Egypt apart from being the single biggest homogenous black nation in sub-Sahara Africa\u2019. \n \nHe informed that the Blueprint for the economic and social rejuvenation of Yoruba Nation has been put in place and would be put before the people and chosen credible leadership \u201cas soon as we have our own country of Oòdúà Republic\u201d. \n \n Dr. Akindola elaborated that in the last ten years, the members of the group have asked and answered questions about the future politics, economy, social engineering, culture, traditions, religion, philosophy, language of the New Oòdúà Republic. We are ready.\u201d \n \n\u201cIt is time to free the people of Yoruba land from poverty of leadership, celebration of mediocrity and excusing of criminal acts in the name of politics. Our people are tired of the miseries of Nigeria and all that pertains to it, and want to be in control of their own destiny\u201d, he explained, adding, \u201cThe road to ending violence, poverty, death, anguish and pain in our territories is to assert our rights to self determination\u201d. \n \nThe group stated \u2018Our resolve is cast in iron. We serve this notice to the world to be aware. After more than a century of traumatic experience in Nigeria, it makes a lot of sense to try something new. Our culture, language, values, economic and political potentials remain in bondage as long as we remain in Nigeria, a country that has brought Yoruba people nothing but shame and ignominy.\u201d  \n \nThe group accused Yoruba politicians of being \u2018selfish, parochial, corrupt, naive and lacking integrity and completely any sense of history. They have sold the heritage of the Yoruba people. They are in power for personal gains. It is now time for the masses of the Yoruba people to fulfill the historical responsibility of pushing the \u201carijenimodarus\u201d and the \u201cJudases\u201d amongst us, off the track for the Yoruba people to be able to reclaim her lost heritage and bring back the floundering fortunes of a once glorious people and highly endowed land.  \n \nThe group said it will work with similar groups in Nigeria that are prepared to take the bull by the horn and loose the \u201cfetters of iron of subjugation and misery\u201d. \n \nDr. Akindola \u201curged millions of Yoruba people at home and abroad to see this as a clarion call for freedom and the whistle for liberty out of the valley of blood and sorrow that has been the lot of Nigeria.  \n \n\u201cWe want to advise our fellow Yoruba people living outside of Yoruba land to consider returning to motherland, as we will not be able to guarantee their safety should the enslaving maggots at the helms of power decide to resort to violence against our people, instead of coming to the table and discuss the peaceful dissolution of the contraption of the British amalgamation exercise that has robbed the Yoruba people of her development and progress.\u201d  \n \n\u201cWe want the world to note that we are not a violent group. We are peace loving people who are determined and uncompromising about our desire for self determination and the birth of a new Oòdúà Republic. But we are ready to shed blood if need be, to defend our land and our people against possible acts of violence against us by the Nigerian state and its agents.\u201d \n \nWe call on the United States of American Congress, the progressive Canadian government, the United Nations, the European Union, the Jimmy Carter Center, the British Parliament, all the freedom fighters in the world and well wishers of the New Oòdúà Republic to join hands with us to free our Yoruba nation and its people from over a century of perpetration of atrocities and subjugation by the Nigerian state.  \n \nWe are determined to ensure that a peaceful negotiation is promoted between our group and other groups within Nigeria that have decided to pursue their self autonomy. This way a colossal calamity will be averted, if the corrupt and enslaving stakeholders of the Nigerian State would be reasonable, something we are not counting upon or we are expecting. \n \nAt this point, for the total freedom of our people and the realization of the New Oodua Republic, we are ready to water the tree of liberty with the blood of traitors and those who are determined to hold down our people in bondage. We are not going to give up until the realization of our own autonomous and independent Oòdúà Republic. We are prepared to die on our feet rather than live on our knees. \n \n\u201cWe also want to sound a note of warning to all internal enemies in Yoruba land, all agents of the Nigerian state in our midst and the Nigerian state itself to beware. We will not condone acts of treason or aggression in any form against Yoruba Nation and people as well as our foot soldiers of freedom, liberation and total independence. The silent but active and ready majority is watching,\u201d Dr. Akindola advised.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Nigeria news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Africa news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Nigeria: Yoruba urged to prepare for own sovereign nation","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Western Africa","countryCode":"NG","country":"Nigeria"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"African Herald Express","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"560866420","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"African Herald Express","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://africanheraldexpress.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?s=100&p[url]=http://africanheraldexpress.com/blog8/2017/01/29/nigeria-yoruba-urged-to-prepare-for-own-sovereign-nation/","http://twitter.com/share","http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fafricanheraldexpress.com%2Fblog8%2F2017%2F01%2F29%2Fnigeria-yoruba-urged-to-prepare-for-own-sovereign-nation%2F&description=Nigeria%3A+Yoruba+urged+to+prepare+for+own+sovereign+nation"],"sequenceId":"695201363110","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:13:17Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:06:10Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Britain\u2019s never had it so moderately okay. What\u2019s more inequality was either flat or falling \u2013 poorer households did better than most. \n \nBut the democracy story was a Brexit vote for big change on the back of deep dissatisfaction with what 21 st Century Britain has to offer many people. \n \nSo why the disconnect? If everything was going so well why have we voted for change? And why for many does life feel pretty tough? \n \nThis matters because the last year of Trump and Brexit, if not the last decade of financial crisis and aftermath, should have taught all of us that living standards are the central issue of our times. \n \nToo often people respond to this disconnect between the dissatisfaction that led to Brexit and good overall news on the economy by only listening to the part they want to hear. Conservatives focus on the jobs miracle that has seen employment reach a record high, while Jeremy Corbyn tells us that inequality is rising. \n \nSo we need to understand how these contradictions are in fact part of the same story about modern Britain, not least because new Resolution Foundation research shows that the living standards mini-boom is already over. Income growth for working age households looks set to have more than halved this year, rising by just 0.5 per cent as inflation increases. \n \nHere\u2019s a start. Yes the last few years have seen relatively strong income growth. Near zero inflation has meant prices in the shops weren\u2019t rising. Fast jobs growth and the return of some pay rises meant that household incomes grew at their strongest rate since the early 2000s between 2014 and early 2016. \n \nSo why doesn\u2019t it feel like boom time Britain? Because two good years can\u2019t wipe out a decade of squeezed living standards. Seven years on from the financial crisis family incomes are only really back to they were when the storm hit. \n \nThe same is true on inequality. Yes it has been broadly flat or slightly falling in recent years \u2013 but, thanks largely to the 1980s, it is still far too high. Crucially one of the big downward pressures on inequality during the crisis was pay falls for high earners. That\u2019s good news for inequality stats, but not much help to someone living on low pay. \n \nThen there\u2019s the problem that averages are all well and good, but they hide a multitude of sins. Here\u2019s just two \u2013 geography and age. \n \nIf you live in Lawrence Hill in Bristol, there\u2019s no use someone telling you that the city has been growing strongly when only half of your neighbourhood works. Birmingham remains a jobs disaster, with employment over 10 percent points below the national average. No wonder the West Midlands saw the strongest vote for Brexit. \n \nYear after year pensioner incomes have grown faster than those of the working age population \u2013 ten times as fast in fact since the mid-2000s. This welcome fall in pensioner poverty has helped reduce overall inequality. But it also explains why many working people think it is still rising. \n \nCrucially, as we enter more uncertain times, it\u2019s important we learn from the mini-boom \u2013 not just for nostalgia but to draw lessons from what worked. History warns us against both complacency and fatalism \u2013 the good times were all too short but policies can make a big difference. \n \nContinuing to raise employment amongst older workers and women is a good place to start. These trends aren\u2019t luck but the result of policy choices over the past 20 years that hold lessons for further challenges around disgracefully low employment rates for those with disabilities. Maintaining crucial in work benefits, rather than slashing as we are about to do, would also help. Pressing ahead with a higher minimum wage and tackling our flatlining productivity are key to dealing with anaemic pay growth. \n \nSo recognising the successes \u2013 and limitations \u2013 of recent good news on living standards is the task of politics today. The same country that statistics show has had a good couple of years is also Brexit Britain. It\u2019s time we understood that. \n \nThe post appeared first on Resolution Foundation .","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Rob Holdsworth"},"topics":[{"name":"Media latest","group":"Media"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Britain has enjoyed a mini living standards boom \u2013 so why did we vote for change?","source":{"category":"Organisation","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"GB","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Resolution Foundation","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"589531127","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"118"},"name":"Resolution Foundation","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Organisations","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.resolutionfoundation.org"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201364247","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:00:53Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:06:11Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

So far this year he has managed just two hours at school. \n \nHannah and Drew \u2013 who have shared their bed with Alfie for the past three years due to the severity of his condition \u2013 are desperate to try and control his epilepsy and believe the only option left is cannabis oil, which is currently banned in the UK. \n \nThe pair \u2013 who are also parents to two year-old Annie \u2013 are now hoping to raise £25,000 to pay for their son\u2019s treatment. \n \nHannah, who is full-time carer to her son, said: \u201cAlfie has a rare condition called PCDH19, which is a genetic disorder. It causes catastrophic clusters of seizures which are hard to control and are unresponsive to anti epilepsy drugs. His condition is not well understood and there is currently no research into medication for this condition other than in America. \n \nThorns Infant School pupil Alfie has been having aggressive seizures on a weekly basis. (s) \n  \n\u201cWhen Alfie has a cluster of seizures currently he has to have an IV of steroids. Steroids are toxic and if used a lot can cause serious side effects. Alfie is currently having seizures on average every seven days so he is receiving a lot of steroids. \n \n\u201cWe have done a lot of research into medical cannabis and have found many parents who are using it effectively to either reduce or stop very aggressive seizures.\u201d \n \nThe family originally hoped to convince UK doctors to allow them to try the oil, but have now turned to fund-raising. \n \nIt would mean travelling abroad \u2013 to the USA or Holland where cannabis oil is legal \u2013 and paying for the treatment, which is administered under the tongue and costs around £300 for a 100ml bottle. \n \nHannah said: \u201cBasically my son has no life at the moment. We have to try to raise enough money to take Alfie abroad so we can try this medicine in the hope it gives him the chance of a normal and happy life.\u201d \n \nSearch \u2018Alfie\u2019s Hope\u2019 on","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Energy industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Oil and gas news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Illegal drugs news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Family launches fundraising plea to treat son with cannabis oil abroad","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","county":"Warwickshire","zipCode":"CV32","state":"England","countryCode":"GB","zipArea":"Warwick","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Coventry Observer","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"172008711","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"Coventry Observer","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.coventryobserver.co.uk","publisher":"Bullivant Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201374751","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:36Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:06:17Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

[Photo/Weibo] A three-year-old boy was rescued by police just 15 hours after he was kidnapped by a woman on Thursday, two days before the Spring Festival. A Shenzhen resident surnamed Zhao reported shortly after 17:00 on Thursday that his son had gone missing while playing near home. The family ed for him for over an hour but could not find him.\n\nThe local police found via surveillance video that shortly after 15:40 the boy was taken away in a taxi by a middle-aged woman, whom the family did not know.\n\nThe police identified the woman as 34-year-old migrant worker from Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region. She was unemployed and lived in a hotel in Shenzhen. When the police arrived at her hotel, they found that the woman surnamed Wei took the boy to the hotel but had checked out and left.\n\nPolice found that Wei appeared at the Luohu Railway Station in Shenzhen shortly after 17:00 and they concluded that she had left Shenzhen by train. With help from railway police, they found that Wei boarded a train with the boy to Wuchang, Huhan province, at 18:00.\n\nWei was spotted on the train. When the train arrived in Wuchang shortly after 6 am Friday, the police arrested the woman and rescued the boy.\n\nWei said she took the boy to fake as her own son to repair the relationship with her former boyfriend. Wei gave birth to a boy in 2015 in Shenzhen, who died shortly after. Wei broke up with her boyfriend soon after the birth however the boyfriend was unaware of the baby\u2019s death. This year she wanted to meet her ex-boyfriend in Hubei for Spring Festival.

GEN1-Evolution And Architecture Of T24-R10.01 11 Welcome to Evolution of T24\u2019s Architecture learning unit. In this unit, you will learn how T24\u2019s architecture has evolved over the years.  2. GEN1-Evolution And Architecture Of T24-R10.01 22 After completing this learning unit, you will be able to: 1. Describe the changes to T24 Architecture 2. Identify the components of the T24 multi-tier architecture 2.1 Client Layer 2.2 Application Server Layer 2.3 T24 Application Server Layer 2.4Database Server Layer 3. Analyze the optional components of the T24 multi-tier architecture 3.1 Network Dispatcher 3.2 Message Queuing software  3. GEN1-Evolution And Architecture Of T24-R10.01 3 T24\u2019s architecture has undergone major changes so far. You will now learn about how these changes came into being. What you see here is a very simple T24 architecture. T24 was previously called as GLOBUS. The very early implementations of GLOBUS had a simple client-server architecture. The database that was used previously was uniVerse. It is an IBM\u2019s product. 1. In a typical client-server architecture, GLOBUS and uniVerse was installed on one Server called the Application Server. 2. In this type of an architecture, the clients PCs had to use a terminal emulation software to access GLOBUS. A terminal emulation software will allow the users access to a text terminal and all its applications such as command line interfaces (CLI) and text user interface applications through telnet, ssh, or dial-up. There are lot of terminal emulation software available like putty, reflection etc. 3. All client machines connect to the GLOBUS Server using a telnet protocol 3  4. GEN1-Evolution And Architecture Of T24-R10.01 What you see here are sample screens of the Character User Interface. This character User Interface is also called as Classic. Though this type of an architecture was used in the initial stages, this architecture is not completely washed away, you can still work with the Character User Interface of T24. 1. This is the sign on screen where a user can provide username and password to login. 2. This is the first screen that a user will see after login, the initial screen might differ depending upon the user profile settings of the logged in user. What you see here is the Application prompt. 3. This is a sample application screen. 4  5. GEN1-Evolution And Architecture Of T24-R10.01 5 From 1995, GLOBUS moved away from its classic user front end to a GUI based front end. The GUI based front end was called the GLOBUS Desktop. It was a client software written in Visual Basic. In this architecture too GLOBUS with its database \u2013 universe or jBASE used to exist on a server along (with the operating system Windows or Unix). The GLOBUS Desktop had to be installed on all client machines and connected to the server via a telnet connection. jBASE also supported a socket connection to the server. It should be noted that the GLOBUS Desktop was a thin client that needed to be deployed on all client machines and did not hold any business logic. 5  6. GEN1-Evolution And Architecture Of T24-R10.01 6 What you see here are sample screens of the Graphical User Interface, Globus Desktop. 1. This is the sign on screen 2. This is a sample Application screen You must remember that R7 and above do not have support for Globus Desktop. You should either use the Classic Interface or a web browser to access T24. 6  7. GEN1-Evolution And Architecture Of T24-R10.01 T24\u2019s architecture changed drastically from release R04 . A web browser software like IE or Mozilla Firefox can now be used as the User Interface. This change, introduced a lot of new layers to the T24\u2019s architecture. From release R4 onwards, Globus was renamed as T24 due to its massive improvement in the technology front. T24 stands for Temenos 24. 24 denoted 24 hour non stop processing. Along this time, T24 started working on a front end known as T24 Browser. T24 Browser is an Intranet based browser solution, which was initially designed as an accompaniment to the existing GLOBUS Desktop software. It was not a replacement for Desktop then, but rather a complementary product that offers basic functionality like contract capture and enquiries, needed for large-scale implementations - without the need to install software on client PCs. Now, T24 Browser is the standard front end for T24. With the advent of T24 Browser, there will exist many layers in the T24 technical architecture. These layers are built in for resilience so that there is no single point of failure henceforth. What you see here is a simple architecture drawn to understand the advent of T24 Browser 1. The client software used to access T24 can be any T24 Browser compliant browser. You can use Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox etc as a client. This has to be installed on all client PCs 2. The Web Server layer can hold one or more web servers. A Web Server will serve the client. Any request coming from a client will be processed by the Web Server. The Web Server receives the request from the client and forwards it to the T24 Application Server. It also sends back the processed response to the client. 3. Like the Web Server Layer, the T24 Application Server Layer can have one or more T24 Application Servers. It will receive the requests from the Web Server, processes it and sends back a response to the Web Server. Each of the T24 Application Server will have jBASE installed because it provides the run-time for T24 7  8. GEN1-Evolution And Architecture Of T24-R10.01 4. The Database Server Layer is where all the T24 data is stored. 7  9. GEN1-Evolution And Architecture Of T24-R10.01 8 What you see here are sample T24 Browser Screens. 1. This is the T24 Sign on screen for a client accessing T24 via a Web Browser. 2. This is the home page for the logged in user, this might differ from user to user, depending upon the User profile settings. 3. This a sample Application screen.  10. GEN1-Evolution And Architecture Of T24-R10.01 You will now be introduced to the new changes in T24 architecture. 9  11. GEN1-Evolution And Architecture Of T24-R10.01 Before you get to know the new architecture, it is important to understand the new terminologies introduced. You will have a brief introduction about the following terminologies used, 1. JCA 2. Application Server 3. Resource Adapter 4. Enterprise Java Bean 4.1 Message Driven Bean 5. JNDI 10  12. GEN1-Evolution And Architecture Of T24-R10.01 1,2 Java Connector architecture is a Java based technology for connecting application servers to different information systems including relational databases 3. JCA is a more generic architecture for connecting to Enterprise Information Systems(including databases). 4. JCA will be an alternative connection method to the existing TCServer because it does not depend on proprietary connection methods. 11  13. GEN1-Evolution And Architecture Of T24-R10.01 1. Application server exposes business logic and business processes for use by third- party applications. Application server can be used to serve application programs, generally in a n-tier architecture through interfaces. 2. Application servers can host applications that respond to requests, perform business logic, and coordinate updates to shared data. It is primarily a deployment environment. 3. Generally, all application servers contain a web server in them or you can say that a web server is a small subset of what comprises of an application server. Generally, all application server comes with two types of containers: Web Container EJB(Enterprise JavaBeans) Container 4. JBoss, Weblogic and WebSphere are some of the popular application servers 12  14. GEN1-Evolution And Architecture Of T24-R10.01 1. Resource adapters allow external systems to link to the J2EE platform. To enable seamless integration with an application server, a resource adapter must abide by guidelines that are defined by JCA. A resource adapter is a J2EE component that implements JCA for a specific enterprise application. 2. A resource adapter is a system-level software driver that a Java application uses to connect to an enterprise information system (EIS). 3. A resource adapter is an archive file format defined in the JCA specification. It is similar to a JDBC driver. Both provide a standard API through which an application(T24) can access a resource that is outside the J2EE server. 4. Resource adapters can also be referred as connectors. A resource adapter plugs into an application server and provides connectivity between the EIS, the application server, and the enterprise application. 13  15. GEN1-Evolution And Architecture Of T24-R10.01 1. Enterprise Java Beans or EJB for short is the server-side component architecture for the Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE) 2. EJB is a server-side model that encapsulates the business logic of an application. 3. The EJB specification intends to provide a standard way to implement the back-end 'business' code typically found in enterprise applications . These server side components provide remote services to clients distributed throughout the network. 4. Enterprise Java Beans are software components that run in a special environment called EJB container. The container hosts and manages an enterprise bean in the same manner that the Java web server hosts a servlet. An enterprise bean cannot function outside of an EJB container. 5. There are 3 types of EJBs \u2013 Session beans, Entity beans and Message driven beans 14  16. GEN1-Evolution And Architecture Of T24-R10.01 1. Message driven beans are the light weight components used for communication 2. Message Driven Beans or MDB is an enterprise bean that allows J2EE applications to process messages asynchronously 3. MDB acts as a JCA message listener 4. The messages may be sent by any J2EE component \u2013 an application client , or a web component or by non-J2EE applications 15  17. GEN1-Evolution And Architecture Of T24-R10.01 1. Java Naming and Directory Interface is an application programming interface (API) that provides naming and directory functionality to applications written using Java. 2. A naming service helps you to associate names with distributed objects and devices so that they can be located on the network using simple names instead of cryptic network addresses. An example of a naming service is the DNS, which converts an Internet hostname like www.oreilly.com into a network address that browsers use to connect to web servers. 3,4 JNDI allows you to look up for naming service and obtain references to data files and devices. Using JNDI, clients can browse a naming service and obtain references to data files and devices, without knowing the details of the naming service or how it is implemented. Often the access to the data files and devices are obtained using a URL, which points to the physical location of the data files and devices. 16  18. GEN1-Evolution And Architecture Of T24-R10.01 The R09 architecture has introduced new changes in T24 architecture. A web browser software like IE or Mozilla Firefox can now be used as the User Interface. Let us look into changes in each layer of this architecture, 1. The client software used to access T24 can be any T24 Browser compliant browser. You can use Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox etc as a client. This has to be installed on all client PCs 2. The next Layer is an application server. Now why do we need an application server instead of a web server? A web server receives HTTP requests and responds with HTTP response. The delegation model of a web server is fairly simple, it just hands over the request to an application best able to handle it. The web server does not support transaction or database connection pooling features. On the other hand, an application server provides access to the business logic for use by client application programs. An application server provides more features than a web server. For example Load Balancing, Deployment API, connection pooling and so on. 3. T24 application server receives the requests and processes it. It sends back a response to the other application Server. 4. The Database Server Layer is where all the T24 data is stored. T24 is database independent. 17  19. GEN1-Evolution And Architecture Of T24-R10.01 The T24 application server with jBASE runtime environment is known as TAFC. 18  20. GEN1-Evolution And Architecture Of T24-R10.01 The T24 application server with java runtime environment is known as TAFJ. 19  21. GEN1-Evolution And Architecture Of T24-R10.01 Temenos has introduced two different architectures with GA R09.00 \u2013 The agent architecture and the JMS architecture. 20  22. GEN1-Evolution And Architecture Of T24-R10.01 Let us first discuss about the agent architecture: AGENT allows the T24 Browser to connect directly to T24 using the TAFC JCA (currently called jremote) and the jbase_agent . Lets now look into the components of TAFC: Jremote \u2013 The T24 Browser sends requests to T24 using jremote. TAFC JCA is distributed as jremote. Jremote is the client side jBASE component that sends requests to T24. Lets now see which component handles the incoming requests. jbase_agent \u2013 Jremote communicates to T24 using the jbase_agent. Jbase_agent is a server-side jBASE component responsible for accepting and processing incoming client requests. This executable is the process you will see running on the T24 server for each connection the application server has created. Communication is established via TCP socket connections. Jbase_agent is a socket server listening on a user-defined TCP port and has the capability to serve a wide range of client applications. 21  23. GEN1-Evolution And Architecture Of T24-R10.01 You will understand the features of a browser in detail as you proceed. Now you will look have an overview of the features. 1. Stateless Connection is a physical connection does not exist between the various layers of the architecture. A stateless connection is one in which no information is retained by either the sender or receiver. The sender transmits a packet to the receiver and does not expect an acknowledgment of receipt. The recipient receives the packet without any prior connection setup. For stateless interactions, it does not matter whether different requests are processed by different servers which is not the case in a stateful interaction 2. Resilience: Being Resilient the system has the ability to provide and maintain an acceptable level of service in the face of various faults and challenges to normal operation. Since there are multiple servers in each layer, there is no single point failure. There is always a failover mechanism available. 3. Scalability: T24 has the ability to handle growing amounts of work in a graceful manner. In business terms it simply means the business model that T24 has can scale up its product to increasing demands more efficiently by adding any number of servers at any point 22  24. GEN1-Evolution And Architecture Of T24-R10.01 23 You will now try to understand the different layers of the agent architecture 1. Client 1.1 Web Browser 2. Application Server Layer 2.1 Application Server Software 2.1 T24 Browser Servlet 2.3 jremote 3. T24 Application Server Layer 3.1 jbase agent 3.2 T24 Runtime \u2013 TAFC 3.3 Direct Connect Drivers 4. Database Server Layer 4.1 Oracle / DB2 / SQL 23  25. GEN1-Evolution And Architecture Of T24-R10.01 24 1. In the current T24 architecture, to access T24, a web browser needs to be used. This is the front end that the client PCs will be using to access T24. All that the user needs to do is to supply a \u2018url\u2019 that will enable the user to connect to T24. 1.1 It forms the top most layer of the T24 architecture. 1.2 The Standard web browsers that T24 supports are Internet Explorer and Mozilla Firefox Since the front end is a web browser, no special software installation or configuration needs to be done on the client PCs. All that is required is a web browser to be installed, and nowadays all the operating systems are shipped with the web browser. Now isn\u2019t this called Ease Of Deployment! 24  26. GEN1-Evolution And Architecture Of T24-R10.01 25 The next layer that you will learn about is the Application Server Layer. The application server will consist of three main components, first, an application server software, second, a T24 Browser and third, jremote. You will first understand what an application server is. An application server is a server that hosts an API to expose business logic and business processes for use by third-party applications. It provides access to the business logic for use by client application programs. An application server provides more features than a web server. For example, Load Balancing, Deployment API, connection pooling and so on. You can use application servers like JBoss, IBM Websphere Application Server or Web logic server. 25  27. GEN1-Evolution And Architecture Of T24-R10.01 26 The Temenos Browser component supplied by Temenos is shipped as a .war file, which contains the T24 Browser logic. It transforms the incoming HTTP request into a BROWSER XML request. Passes on the request to jremote. 26  28. GEN1-Evolution And Architecture Of T24-R10.01 27 jremote, as the name suggests is the client component that sits on the Application Server. Jremote is the resource adapter that enables T24Browser to communicate with the T24 Application Server. The main job of jremote will be to forward the request to the T24 Application Server. 27  29. GEN1-Evolution And Architecture Of T24-R10.01 T24 Application Server Layer can have more than one T24 Server. 1. Jremote communicates to T24 using the jbase_agent. Jbase_agent is a server-side jBASE component responsible for accepting and processing incoming client requests. This executable is the process you will see running on the T24 server for each connection the application server has created. Communication is established via TCP socket connections. Jbase_agent is a socket server listening on a user- defined TCP port and has the capability to serve a wide range of client applications. A request coming from the jremote is sent to the jbase agent. 28  30. GEN1-Evolution And Architecture Of T24-R10.01 T24, here refers to the T24\u2019s business logic. T24 comes with an OFS module. OFS stands for Open Financial Services. If any other system had to interact with T24, then it has to happen only though OFS. OFS works on Request \u2013 Response based approach. 29  31. GEN1-Evolution And Architecture Of T24-R10.01 Temenos Application Framework (TAF) provides connectivity to T24. TAFC is the jbase runtime environment that is used. 30  32. GEN1-Evolution And Architecture Of T24-R10.01 Direct Connect Drivers are used to communicate with external databases such as Oracle, DB2, SQL Server. This driver is not required when the database used is jBASE. It converts all T24 requests into SQL/DML/DDL statements and sends it to the external database. Performs the vice versa for responses. It needs to be installed on each of the T24 application servers. It contains the database details of the external database such as Database name, User name and password (encrypted) to log on to the external database, Schema name, Table space name, Role name etc. (When Oracle is used).It establishes connection to the external database residing on the database server. 31  33. GEN1-Evolution And Architecture Of T24-R10.01 32 Database Server T24 is database independent, and supports several different databases, including Oracle,DB2,SQL Server. It is in this database server that Oracle/DB2/SQL ServerJ4 is installed. This is where the T24 data will reside in XML format. Oracle/DB2 databases support clustering and therefore a single Oracle/DB2 installation can be done across multiple servers. Jbase 4 releases prior to 1.5 do not support clustering and therefore only one database server can be used if Jbase 4 releases prior to 1.5 are being used \u2018 1. The Database Server layer holds all the data. Multiple database servers are used for resilience. When a database supports clustering, multiple database servers can be used, otherwise only one database can be used. Clustering is a concept where multiple copies of the same database is maintained, where if one fails, the other copy can take replace it. jBASE release1.5 and above supports clustering. 2. Oracle, DB2, SQL Server or jBASE can be used as the database 3. Oracle RAC installation is done for support of multiple servers and data stored in a Storage Area Network Disk 32  34. GEN1-Evolution And Architecture Of T24-R10.01 33 T24 can handle three types of message formats. 1. Browser XML: This message format can be used only when the T24 Browser is used. It is not a published format, so external interfaces cannot use this message format to interact with T24. 2. OFSML: It is a published format. Any external interface that wants to interact with T24 can use this. 3. OFS: It is the native T24 message format. It is available for the external interfaces to use. As it is a native message format, an OFS message can be sent directly to T24.  35. GEN1-Evolution And Architecture Of T24-R10.01 1. From the web browser to the App Server the message is sent as a HTTP Request. 2. T24 Browser transforms HTTP request to Browser XML request. 3. jremote sends the Browser XML request to jbase agent, jbase agent sends the Browser XML request to T24. Finally T24 processes the request 4. T24 builds BROWSER XML response and passes it on to jbase agent and jbase agent sends the response to jremote 5. jbase agent sends the Browser XML response to jremote, jremote sends the Browser XML response to T24 Browser 6. T24 Browser converts the Browser XML response to a HTTP response 34  36. GEN1-Evolution And Architecture Of T24-R10.01 Lets now have a look at the JMS architecture. Java Messaging Service is a feature provided by J2EE application servers like JBoss, WebSphere and Weblogic. The JMS architecture is introduced for enhanced resilience and reliable message processing. Let us first look into the components of JMS architecture : 1. T24 BrowserServlet 2. OFSMessageMDB \u2013 The OFSMessageMDB can be found inside the tocfee.ear file. 3. TAFC JCA \u2013 jremote 3. jbase_agent An Enterprise ARchive, or EAR, is a file format used by Java EE for packaging one or more modules into a single archive so that the deployment of the various modules onto an application server happens simultaneously and coherently. It also contains XML files called deployment descriptors which describe how to deploy the modules. The following components can be found in tocfee.ear: 1. ofsmessage-ejb.jar 2. tocfcommon.jar 35  37. GEN1-Evolution And Architecture Of T24-R10.01 3. tocflistener-ejb.jar 4. tocfplugin-ra.rar 35  38. GEN1-Evolution And Architecture Of T24-R10.01 Lets now see how the requests are handled in the JMS architecture \u2013 JMS architecture is mainly introduced for reliable delivery of messages. It makes use of queue management feature of the J2EE application server. JMS is a specification and as such it does not have any physical components. IBM or SUN MQ also implements JMS thus enabling you to use any queues which can be accessed using JMS APIs. Lets have a brief introduction of the components used in JMS architecture, Request and Response Queues \u2013 These queues are configured in the J2EE application server and they play a major role in processing the messages. OFSMessageMDB \u2013 OFSMessageMDB is a message driven bean that acts as a gateway for other components like T24 Browser. It consumes messages from the request queue and forwards it to T24 using the TAFC JCA i,e jremote jremote \u2013 jremote also known as TAFC JCA is responsible for forwarding the request to T24. 36  39. GEN1-Evolution And Architecture Of T24-R10.01 You will now understand how the requests are processed in the JMS architecture, 1. The T24 BrowserServlet drops the request onto the request queue. Also other external interfaces can drop requests onto the request queue. 2. Once the request is dropped onto the request queue, the OFSMessageMDB will be triggered. The OFSMessageMDB acts as a listener and it will take the request dropped onto the request queue. 3. Inorder to process the request it should be forwarded to the T24 application server. Therefore OFSMessageMDB will forward the request to jremote (TAFC JCA), because only jremote can communicate to the T24 application server. 4. Jremote communicates to the T24 application server with the help of jbase_agent. T24 processes the request and the response is forwarded to the jbase_agent. 5. Jbase_agent will hand over the response to jremote 6. The OFSMessageMDB will pick up the response form jremote. 7. The next step is to drop the response in the response queue of the J2EE application server. This task is done by the OFSMessage MDB 8. Finally the response will be forwarded to the T24BrowserServlet. 37  40. GEN1-Evolution And Architecture Of T24-R10.01 Prior to R09, requests were sent to the T24 application server with the help of TCServer. Now the R09 architecture can also be configured to communicate with TCServer. This feature is provided for backward compatibility. Lets now take a look at the components that are required for this, TOCF Plugin - TOCF Plugin resource adapter hosts all TOCF(EE) listeners such as the BatchFileListener. This resource adapter wraps the existing TCS plugins and allows custom listeners to be used without any code modifications. This resource adapter contains the familiar tcserver.xml to define and configure the listener interfaces. TOCF Listener MDB - TOCF Listener Message Driven Bean is an EJB that is called when a message arrives on the resource adapter it has been configured to activate. In R09, this bean is responsible for activating the TOCF listener plugins as defined within TOCFPlugin-ra.rar. When TOCFPlugin-ra.rar receives a message on any of its listeners the TOCF Listener MDB will be called upon to perform processing. This processing involves placing a message onto the OFS request queue and waiting for a response on the OFS response queue. Note: From R10 the tocf plugin resource adapter and the tocflistenerMDB are packaged inside the tocfee.ear file. 38  41. GEN1-Evolution And Architecture Of T24-R10.01 Network Dispatcher: This is a third party software that can be used to distribute HTTP requests among the available web servers. In other words, it acts as a load balancing product. It performs intelligent load balancing by using server availability, capability, workload, and other user definable criteria to determine which server the TCP/IP request is sent to. A network dispatcher is generally configured with a backup to eliminate it as a single point of failure. The advantage that the network dispatcher provides are that \u2022 It improves the performance of servers by distributing the incoming TCP/IP requests ( in our case, HTTP requests) \u2022 It improves the throughput by enabling multiple servers and CPUs to handle the client workload 39  42.

It can be observed that the taxable event under GST regime is \u2018supply\u2019. As per clause 1(a) Supply is said to include certain transactions like sale, transfer, barter, etc. made or agreed to be made for a consideration by a person in the course or furtherance of business. Thus, under clause 1 (a) an activity of sale, transfer etc will qualify as supply if it is made or agreed to be made for a consideration by a person in the course or furtherance of business.

Schedule II clarifies the certain transaction whether should be treated as goods or services so as to avoid litigation.  8. Meaning of \u201c Supply\u201d The amount of goods produced or available at the given price. \"Black's Law Dictionary\u201d. Make (something needed or wanted) available to someone. \u201cOxford Dictionary\u201d. To make (something) available to be used. \u201cMedical Dictionary\u201d. The term \u2018supply\u2019 has been defined in an inclusive manner (like definition of \u2018manufacture\u2019 in excise).The Supreme court in west Bengal state warehousing corporation Vs indrapuri studio Pvt. Ltd. has examined the meaning of inclusive and exhaustive definition as appearing in various statues. The word \u201cinclude\u201d when used, enlarge the meaning of expression defined so as to comprehend not only such things as they signify according to their natural import but also those things which the clause declared that they shall includes. Sydney High Court define the meaning of Supply In case of QUANTAS AIRWAYS LIMITED VS COMMISIONER OF TAXATION The tribunal held that there has been a supply of right, obligation and services under the contract between QUANTAS and the passengers, for which the unused fares were consideration as defined, and that the assessment were not shown to be excessive. On the appeal by Qantas, the Full Court of the Federal Court held that \u201cthat the relevant supply in the present case is the contemplated flight ,not reservation\u2026and the contemplated flight failed to occur\u201d, that the tribunal had \u201cartificially split the transaction, and in consequence that there had been no taxable supply where the flight was not taken; \u201cit is plain that what each customer pays for is carriage by air. This is the essence, and sole purpose, of the transaction\u2026.. The actual travel was the relevant supply, and if did not occur there was no taxable supply.\u201d Supply of Goods Vs Service Title as well as possession both have to be transferred for a transaction to be considered as a supply of goods. In case title is not transferred, the transaction would be treated as supply of service in terms of Schedule II (1).  9. Composite Supply Section 2(27) \u201cComposite supply\u201d means a supply made by a taxable person to a recipient comprising two or more supplies of goods or services, or any combination thereof, which are naturally bundled and supplied in conjunction with each other in the ordinary course of business, one of which is a principal supply; Section 2(78) \u201cPrincipal supply\u201d means the supply of goods or services which constitutes the predominant element of a composite supply and to which any other supply forming part of that composite supply is ancillary and does not constitute, for the recipient an aim in itself, but a means for better enjoyment of the principal supply; Example: Indian Airlines provides passenger transportation service. They also supply food on board to passengers. Supply of transportation services would be the principal supply and the service as a whole would qualify as composite supply.  10. Mixed Supply Section 2(66) \u201cMixed supply\u201d means two or more individual supplies of goods or services, or any combination thereof, made in conjunction with each other by a taxable person for a single price where such supply does not constitute a composite supply Examples: Supply of soap bars where soap boxes are given free of cost; supply of wheat for which a bottle of honey is given free of cost. In the above example of honey being supplied with wheat, both wheat and honey will be taxed at the rate of tax applicable for honey (being commodity taxed at higher rate).  11. Goods Section 2(49) \u201cGoods\u201d means every kind of movable property other than money and securities but includes actionable claim, growing crops, grass and things attached to or forming part of the land which are agreed to be severed before supply or under a contract of supply; Note: Electricity- Electricity is out of ambit of GST.  12. Services Section 2(92) \u201cServices\u2019\u2019 means anything other than goods. Explanation: Excludes money and securities Includes transactions in money relating to use of money/ conversion by cash/ any other mode from one form to another for which a separate consideration is charged Author comment : Transaction in immovable property shall be outside from the ambit of GST.  13. Business 2(17) (17) \u201cBusiness\u201d includes \u2013 (a) any trade, commerce, manufacture, profession, vocation, adventure, wager or any other similar activity, whether or not it is for a pecuniary benefit; (b) any activity or transaction in connection with or incidental or ancillary to (a) above; (c) any activity or transaction in the nature of (a) above, whether or not there is volume, frequency, continuity or regularity of such transaction; (d) supply or acquisition of goods including capital assets and services in connection with commencement or closure of business; (e) provision by a club, association, society, or any such body (for a subscription or any other consideration) of the facilities or benefits to its members, as the case may be; (f) admission, for a consideration, of persons to any premises; and (g) services supplied by a person as the holder of an office which has been accepted by him in the course or furtherance of his trade, profession or vocation; i.e. service by director (h) services provided by a race club by way of totalisator or a licence to book maker in such club; Explanation.- Any activity or transaction undertaken by the Central Government, a State Government or any local authority in which they are engaged as public authorities shall be deemed to be business.  14. Author comments: The definition of business has been borrowed from sales tax Act. 1. History behind expended definition of business. In the state of Gujarat V. Raipur Mfg Co. Ltd. AIR 1967 SC 1066.It was held that normally, to constitute a business there should be volume,frequency,continuity and regularity in transaction of sale. Transaction must be enter with profit motive, though profit need not be in fact earned. In this case it was held that when a person carry on business is required to sale of fixed assets and discarded goods then he is not constitute business because he does not carry on business of selling of fixed assets. To override this decision and cover more transaction in tax net definition of business is expended . a. Profit motive is immaterial. b. The definition is very wise as even a single transaction may get covered under the ambit of \u2018business\u2019. c. If the main activity is constitute business then ancillary and incidental activity also cover in ambit of business. 2.IF THE MAIN ACTIVITY IS NOT BUSINESS THEN ANCILLARY AND INCIDENTAL ACTIVITY CAN NOT AMOUNT TO BUSINESS. In case of SRI Velur Devasthanam VS state of TN (MAD HC) held that dominant activity of assessee is religious and charitable in nature and not business and assessee cannot be treated as dealer in respect of sale of gold bullion offered by the devotee. In case of Ruhelkhand Education charitable trust VS CCT (UP Tri) held that it was settled that main activity of institution is to impart education and is not the business therefore incidental activity supply of food would not come within the meaning of word business. In case of CTO Vs Banasthali Vidyapith (2015) RAJ HC held that Education is not business\u2019. 3.Further, Explanation specifically provides that Any activity or transaction undertaken by the Central Government, a State Government or any local authority in which they are engaged as public authorities shall be deemed to be business. It is pertinent to note that Schedule IV provides list of activities by Central, State Government and Local Authorities as neither goods nor services. Once activity or transaction undertaken by Govt is cover in the definition of business then it should necessary to exclude something (Schedule IV) which Govt do not want to tax under GST.  15. In the course or furtherance of business; No definition or test as to whether the activity is in the course or furtherance of business has been specified in GST. However the following business test is normally applied to arrive at a conclusion whether a supply has been made in the course or furtherance of business. 1.Is the activity, a serious undertaking earnestly pursued. 2.Is the activity is perused with reasonable or recognizable continuity. 3.Is the activity conducted in a regular manner based on sound and recognizable business principles. 4.Is the activity predominantly concerned with the making of taxable supply for consideration/profit motive. The test insure that occasional supplies, even if made for consideration, will not subject to GST. Q. An individual buys a car for personal use and after a year sells it to a car dealer. Will the transaction be a supply in terms of MGL? Give reasons for the answer. Ans. No, because supply is not made by the individual in the course or furtherance of business. Further, no input tax credit was admissible on such car at the time of its acquisition as it was meant for non-business use. The Term Business has been defined by sec 2 (77) of GST Act, to constitute a transaction as a supply the business should be must. If there is no business then transaction can not be cover in the ambit of GST.  16.

IOWA DISTRICT COURT FOR SCOTT COUNTY, Defendant. \n No. 15-2151      Decided: January 20, 2017  Thomas J. Miller, Attorney General, Martha E. Trout, Assistant Attorney General, Michael Walton, County Attorney, and Steve Berger, Assistant County Attorney, for plaintiff. Mark C. Smith, State Appellate Defender, and Vidhya K. Reddy, Assistant Appellate Defender, for defendant. \nThe State seeks review of the district court's denial of \u201cemergency response\u201d restitution pursuant to Iowa Code section 321J.2(13)(b) in an operating while intoxicated (OWI) case. The same legal issue is presented in State v. District Court, ___ N.W.2d ___ (Iowa 2016), decided today. Our holding in that case is dispositive on the facts presented in this case. Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the district court denying restitution and annul the writ. \n \nI. Background Facts and Proceedings. \n \nAccording to the minutes of testimony, Davenport Police Officer Michael Stegall was on patrol in the early hours of April 7, 2015. Officer Stegall observed a white Ford pickup truck cross the center line of traffic and nearly strike an oncoming vehicle traveling in the opposite direction. The other vehicle was able to swerve out of the truck's path and avoid a head-on collision. Officer Stegall pulled over the truck, at which time he also noticed the truck's license plate light was out. \n \nOfficer Stegall approached the pickup truck and identified the driver as Homer Christner. Officer Stegall detected an odor of an alcoholic beverage on Christner's breath and noticed that Christner had bloodshot, watery eyes and slow speech. Officer Stegall asked Christner to step out of the vehicle and perform various field sobriety tests. Christner failed these tests and later submitted to a preliminary breath test. Officer Stegall arrested Christner and transported him to the Scott County Jail. Once at the jail, Officer Stegall read Christner the implied consent advisory and allowed Christner the opportunity to make a phone call. Christner ultimately refused to submit to chemical testing. \n \nChristner later pled guilty to OWI, first offense, in violation of Iowa Code section 321J.2(2)(a) (2015). Before sentencing, the State submitted a request for \u201cemergency response restitution\u201d on behalf of the Davenport Police Department pursuant to Iowa Code section 321J.2(13)(b). The form requested restitution for the cost of Officer Stegall's time and the time Stegall's squad car was in use in connection with the traffic stop, arrest, and processing of Christner. A hearing on the restitution request was held on the date of sentencing. \n \nAt the restitution hearing, Officer Stegall testified that he pulled over Christner's vehicle at approximately 1:06 a.m. due to Christner's \u201cnearly striking [another] car head-on.\u201d Stegall acknowledged that Christner did not actually collide with the other vehicle or cause any injuries, but the officer testified that he \u201cabsolutely\u201d viewed Christner's conduct as dangerous. Officer Stegall finished dealing with Christner at the jail approximately an hour after the traffic stop. Stegall then completed required paperwork related to the incident. Officer Stegall testified that the emergency response restitution requested by the State covered two hours of the officer's time, at an hourly rate of $61.30, and two hours for the time his squad car was out of service during that time, at an hourly rate of $18.00, for a total of $158.60. 1 \n \nChristner resisted the State's restitution request and argued that \u201c[t]he response by Officer Stegall was not an emergency response.\u201d In a written ruling, the district court agreed with Christner and denied the State's claim for restitution. The court characterized the present case as only involving \u201cservices provided by a police department in investigating and effecting the routine arrest and processing of a person\u201d for OWI. The court therefore concluded, \n \n[T]he Iowa Legislature did not intend the routine arrest and processing of a Defendant to be subject to an emergency response restitution claim. If the legislature wanted to include nonemergency routine traffic stop activity, it would have said the cost of any response and not add the limiting language of \u201cemergency.\u201d The legislature purposefully defined \u201cemergency response\u201d broadly to capture the often unique responses fire, medical, and law enforcement must have to these incidents. Not every emergency involves an accident, although that is typically the case. \u2024 The broadness of the Iowa definition was merely a way to include those unique, case specific responses that happen even when there is no accident as a result of the violation. It is over reaching to include the routine traffic stop, investigation, and processing in the definition of \u201cemergency response.\u201d \n \nThe State filed a petition for writ of certiorari with this court. See Iowa R. App. P. 6.107(1). We granted the petition. \n \nII. Scope and Standard of Review. \n \n\u201cWe review rulings on questions of statutory interpretation for correction of errors at law.\u201d State v. Olutunde, 878 N.W.2d 264, 266 (Iowa 2016) (quoting In re R.D., 876 N.W.2d 786, 791 (Iowa 2016)). We also review restitution orders for correction of errors at law. State v. Hagen, 840 N.W.2d 140, 144 (Iowa 2013). \u201cIn reviewing a restitution order \u2018we determine whether the court's findings lack substantial evidentiary support, or whether the court has not properly applied the law.\u2019\u2009\u201d Id. (quoting State v. Bonstetter, 637 N.W.2d 161, 165 (Iowa 2001)). \n \nIII. Disposition. \n \nFor the reasons set forth in today's State v. District Court decision, Iowa Code section 321J.2(13)(b) does not authorize recovery of the costs of the routine law enforcement activities involved in this case. See ___ N.W.2d ___. Officer Stegall stopped Christner after he witnessed Christner engage in erratic driving and cross the center line into oncoming traffic. There was no accident or 911 call. As in District Court, we certainly intend no criticism of Officer Stegall's actions in removing Christner from the road. However, this case did not involve an emergency response by the police within the meaning of the statute, and it is not the type of case for which public agency restitution is authorized. Accordingly, we annul the writ. \n \nWRIT ANNULLED. \n \nFOOTNOTES \n \n1 .  \u2003The court also heard testimony from a lieutenant with the Davenport Police Department supporting the department's calculation of hourly rates for its officers and squad cars. \n \nPER CURIAM.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"STATE OF IOWA v.

Every County of Hawaii senior pool lifeguard conducts these classes at least once or twice a year. \n \nMost recently, a past student and USA swim coach, Michelle Weyrick, was able to save the life of a young man at Pololu Valley beach using one of the rescue tubes that was placed on the beach by a local USA swim team, Liquid Aloha Aquatics, and a foundation. \n \nWhat makes Pololu so dangerous is not only its deceptive rip-current but it is only assessable by a switch back trail that takes 10 to 15 minutes to hike down. But still, if someone could go down faster, it would take precious time for EMT\u2019s to drive from Kapaau to Pololu and respond to any kind of a rescue attempt of a distressed swimmer or active drowning victim. The victim\u2019s only hope is to save themselves, be helped by a surfer in the vicinity or in the above case have someone lifeguard trained to save their lives. This situation has been happening for years and not something just recently. \n \nAs of now, the official concern is how and where to create more parking spaces for visitors. Pololu Valley has quietly been claiming victims over the years and that will only increase with the influx of more and more visitors to the popular tourist destination point. Though noble in intent, placement of rescue tubes at isolated beaches is a good idea only if you have trained people to used them. \n \nA lifeguard stationed at Pololu Valley beach is a no-brainer. As it\u2019s been said, \u201cif you build it they will come,\u201d and that\u2019s the dilemma as more and more people will frequent a dangerous beach that has been taking lives over the years. We need a lifeguard first before a parking lot. \n \nJeffrey Coakley is a resident of Kapaau","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Lifeguards at Kua Bay a no-brainer","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Hawaii","zipCode":"96740","state":"Hawaii","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Kailua Kona","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"West Hawaii Today","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"170625776","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"568"},"name":"West Hawaii Today","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.westhawaiitoday.com/"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201404115","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:25:21Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:06:29Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Doctor Gupta (Syreeta Kumar) is cool, competent and in charge of a clinic so in demand from foreign clients that she is now investing in an ambitious expansion programme to meet their needs. Aditi (Ulrika Krishnamurti), the intended surrogate, will earn more in nine months than she could through 10 years\u2019 work in her village.\n\nA dramatically potent situation is given added impetus (and conceptual complexity) when politics disrupt the personal agendas. State elections loom; a ban is introduced on foreigners paying for surrogacy in India. What follows is a revelation of the women\u2019s characters under pressure (brilliantly multifaceted performances from Isaac, Kumar and Krishnamurti), which exposes questions surrounding surrogacy (without offering glib answers) and wider economic issues (a politician\u2019s voiceover attacks the ban, claiming surrogacy allows \"produce of India\" to make \"wealth flow back\" to the country), as well as semi-submerged, postcolonial attitudes. Places are precisely evoked and yet also flow and twine thanks to the combined effects of Prema Mehta\u2019s lighting, Arun Ghosh\u2019s sound design (also original music) and Denno\u2019s multiple screens, on to which are projected Shanaz Gulzar\u2019s video images. Each element enhances the play\u2019s competing tensions between fragmentation and cohesion, opposites tautly balanced by Katie Posner\u2019s fine direction. The whole makes for an intellectually and emotionally stirring encounter.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Clare Brennan"},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: theater news","group":"Entertainment"},{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Indian subcontinent news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Global news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Made in India review \u2013 an emotionally charged mix of politics and parenthood","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"GB","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"The Guardian","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"353719887","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"The Guardian","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com","publisher":"Guardian News and Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatre","http://observer.theguardian.com/","https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/jan/29/made-in-india-belgrade-theatre-coventry-review#img-1","https://www.theguardian.com/profile/clare-brennan","http://twitter.com/clarembrennan","https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fstage%2F2017%2Fjan%2F29%2Fmade-in-india-belgrade-theatre-coventry-review%3FCMP%3Dshare_btn_fb","https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Made%20in%20India%20review%20%E2%80%93%20an%20emotionally%20charged%20mix%20of%20politics%20and%20parenthood&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fstage%2F2017%2Fjan%2F29%2Fmade-in-india-belgrade-theatre-coventry-re","http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&title=Made%20in%20India%20review%20%E2%80%93%20an%20emotionally%20charged%20mix%20of%20politics%20and%20parenthood&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fstage%2F2017%2Fjan%2F29%2Fmade-in-india-belgrade-thea","http://www.pinterest.com/pin/find/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fstage%2F2017%2Fjan%2F29%2Fmade-in-india-belgrade-theatre-coventry-review","https://plus.google.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fstage%2F2017%2Fjan%2F29%2Fmade-in-india-belgrade-theatre-coventry-review%3FCMP%3Dshare_btn_gp&hl=en-GB&wwc=1","http://www.belgrade.co.uk/event/made-in-india","https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DPli3TV0kLuo&picture=","https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DPli3TV0kLuo","http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DPli3TV0kLuo&media=","https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLJyLZNfRkS9gw78I6-lgT-M5rl11Hb_4i&v=Pli3TV0kLuo","http://www.tamasha.org.uk/made-in-india/","https://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/surrogacy","https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/parents-and-parenting","http://syndication.theguardian.com/automation/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fstage%2F2017%2Fjan%2F29%2Fmade-in-india-belgrade-theatre-coventry-review&type=article&internalpagecode=3132128","https://www.theguardian.com/discussion/p/5z3ck","https://www.theguardian.com/most-read/stage"],"sequenceId":"695201417155","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:19Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:06:35Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://media.guim.co.uk/2366c1c76fbf5af9e69d42ee7a34eb5ab60d329e/304_32_5162_3097/5162.jpg"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2366c1c76fbf5af9e69d42ee7a34eb5ab60d329e/304_32_5162_3097/master/5162.jpg?w=1200&amp;h=630&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;bm=normal&amp;ba=bottom%2Cleft&amp;blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&amp;s=89e95b411a460919ed0ea3bfe7f4cf7e"}],"video":[]}}

Matt Willms of the Miners tossed in 25 points, the same as Terrence Thompson for Marshall, and the Miners rolled to a 91-68 men's basketball victory Saturday night before a Cam Henderson Center crowd of 6,781 spectators. \n   \nWillms, a 7-foot-1 junior, sank 11 of his 15 shots and led UTEP (6-14 season, 4-4 Conference USA) to a whopping 60-32 advantage on points in the paint. UTEP also got backcourt scoring from guards Dominic Artis (24) and Omega Harris (13). Artis, a 6-3 senior, also had 11 rebounds. \n   \n\"They probably looked at our record and thought we stunk, which for the most part we have this year,\" said UTEP head coach Tim Floyd. \n   \nMarshall's season win streak at home ended at 11 games. The Herd fell to a 13-9 season record and a 6-3 conference mark that is tied for third place with Louisiana Tech and Old Dominion. \n   \nThompson, a 6-7 junior, established career highs for points and rebounds with 10. Marshall forward Ryan Taylor scored 14 before fouling out with 5:36 left in the game and collected eight rebounds. Junior point guard Jon Elmore scored 11, grabbed five rebounds and delivered six assists. \n   \nSenior guard Stevie Browning was 0-for-7 and scored his only three points at the foul line. \n   \nThe Herd's highlight was senior guard Austin Loop breaking the school career record for 3-point field goals. \n   \nLoop tied Tamar Slay's record of 251 the first time he touched the basketball. He became the all-time leader with 252 with a shot from the top of the foul circle at 1:40 of the first half. A recorded video of Slay, who played from 1998 to 2002, was played on the big screen with him saying he was proud and happy for Loop. \n   \n\"It felt good at the time,\" said Loop, who scored seven and was 2-for-5 shooting 3-pointers. \"It was a big relief off my shoulders. \n   \n\"Honestly, right now it's not on my mind.\" \n   \nUTEP hit 60.6 percent of its field goals in the first half (20 of 33) and pulled away, 45-35. Willms had 12 points in the first six minutes. \n   \nSome confusion arose late in the first half with UTEP leading, 39-26. Taylor took the ball inside and was knocked down by Kelvin Jones of the Miners. Taylor made two free throws on the foul and the referees came away from the play with a technical foul call against the Herd forward. Jake Flaggert shot for UTEP and also made two free throws. \n   \nMarshall head coach Dan D'Antoni didn't like the call and argued. Before the teams returned to the court for the second half D'Antoni came out of the locker room before the players to continue making his point with the officials. \n   \nMarshall, the nation's eighth-highest scoring team with 88 points a game, connected on 32.3 percent in the first half and 34.5 percent in the second period. The Herd made a season-low three 3-point baskets in 25 attempts for 12.0 percent, which was also a season low. \n   \n\"Obviously it wasn't a great shooting night for us,\" D'Antoni said. \"We shot 12 percent from three, so all of you who say we shoot too many threes you have your ammo. I don't know what the deal was. I feel like we got the same kind of shots we've always gotten. \n   \n\"They made it tough on Loop, but a lot of that was with what we were doing with the pick-and-rolls trying to get to the rim.\" \n   \nThompson's free throws with 17:00 left to play pulled Marshall as close as 46-44. Thompson scored inside to keep the Herd within 52-49 with 14:28 to go, but UTEP reeled off the next 12 points to take a 64-49 with 11:19 remaining. UTEP stretched the margin to 25 points in the final minutes. \n   \nWith UTEP ahead, 48-44, with 16:03 left Paul Thomas of the Miners fouled out on a technical call that brought Floyd off the bench and out past half-court to protest. \n   \nMarshall's next game is Thursday at Southern Miss (6-15, 3-6). UAB won at home Saturday against Southern Miss, 87-43.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"RICK McCANN"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Miners put away Herd","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Cabell","zipCode":"25720","state":"West Virginia","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Huntington","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Herald Dispatch","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169660438","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Herald Dispatch","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.herald-dispatch.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201419813","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:01:01Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:06:35Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

That didn't bode well for an under-sized, height-challenged Herd trying to deal with the tag-team of 7-foot-1 Matt Willms and 6-11 Kelvin Jones. \n   \nThe result? \n   \nWillms had 25 points on 11-for-15 shooting, while Jones had five points, five rebounds and two blocked shots. But it wasn't just about their production. The big, bigger and biggest problem was Willms & Jones' intimidation. \n   \n\"It was real physical,\" said Marshall's Austin Loop, who had two of MU's paltry total of only three 3-point field goals. \"Their bigs were tough. \n   \n\"We're a little undersized. When guys like that are playing physical, it's tough for us.\" \n   \nThink \"Legion of Doom.\" \n   \nWhy, UTEP coach Tim Floyd even performed a fairly good impression of \"Precious\" Paul Ellering, as he ranted, raved, gestured and even charged three-quarters of the way out on the court at one point. \n   \nHow he wasn't whistled for a technical foul is beyond me. \n   \nThe combination of UTEP's skyscrapers inside, tremendous quickness and athleticism on the perimeter and the fact the officiating allowed both teams to play physical ball was simply more than Marshall could overcome. \n   \nIf Marshall is poison, then UTEP is the antidote. \n   \nThe Miners were the absolute worst-case scenario for Marshall on Saturday night. \n   \n\"We're not a physical team,\" said a somber Danny D'Antoni, during the Marshall third-year coach's postgame press conference. \"We have to play clean.\" \n   \nThere was very little cleanliness in this rough and tumble game, which included two technical fouls although that total easily could have been doubled or tripled. \n   \nWhy, Mr. Clean himself would have been hit with a technical foul in this game. \n   \nThat's how unclean it was. \n   \nThis Marshall team simply can't cope with that. As a result, Jon Elmore was 2 for 12 from the floor, including 0 for 7 on 3-pointers and scored only 11 points. Backcourt mate Stevie Browning struggled even harder, scoring only three points on 0-for-7 shooting, including 0 for 5 from beyond the arc. \n   \nImagine the \"Rock 'N' Roll Express\" taking on the \"Four Horsemen.\" \n   \nUnder the circumstances, it was that lopsided. \n   \nYet, D'Antoni insisted on giving UTEP credit rather than choosing a convenient alibi. \n   \n\"They deserved the win,\" he said. \"They were a lot closer to their game than we were to ours.\" \n   \nWhen a team that is built on 3-point shooting goes a head-shaking 3-for-25 from behind the arc for 12.1 percent shooting ... well, it doesn't get any worse than that. \n   \nAgain, worst-case scenario. \n   \nThe only glimmer of positivity was the play of Terrence Thompson, who led MU with 25 points and 10 rebounds. \n   \nThat's a step in the right direction on a night full of miss steps. \n   \nWhere was Captain Lou when Marshall needed him?","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: basketball news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: wrestling news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Chuck Landon: Wrestling with MU's loss to UTEP","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Cabell","zipCode":"25720","state":"West Virginia","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Huntington","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Herald Dispatch","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169660438","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Herald Dispatch","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.herald-dispatch.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201419984","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:06:34Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/herald-dispatch.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/4/73/473fd088-c4b5-11e5-af9c-d72c60d6c66c/57a38d3202d57.image.jpg?resize=300%2C358"}],"video":[]}}

With more bare breasts than bonnets, and a complicated intertwining of hope and betrayal, Danai Gurira\u2019s play wallops down with force. This is Christopher Haydon\u2019s last production as artistic director of the Gate: it is a bold goodbye.\n\nTo say that Gurira concerns herself with the effects of colonialism on southern Africa is to risk making her play sound doctrinaire, and single-stranded. There is nothing dry about it: it is full-blooded, with a dash of melodrama, hitting out in several directions.\n\nIn 1896, in what was then Rhodesia, a young Zezuru girl is taken into the household of a black Roman Catholic missionary. She has been rescued from a forced marriage, at a cost. She has to convert. She has to change her name: Jekesai becomes Ester. She has to alter her demeanour, reining in exuberant affection, the forceful expression of grief. She has to abandon her family. She is regarded as a quisling. The character who most upturns expectations is played, with beautiful, slinky scepticism, by Joan Iyiola As Jekesai, Mimi Ndiweni arrives with a smile so enormous that her features can barely fit around it. Her language is Shona, which is not welcomed among English speakers. In the absence of vocabulary she proselytises with her good humour. As Ester, equipped with English habits and speech, she becomes contained but is still radiant. She is an utterly convincing missionary: fervent and eloquent, fired up by having a task which uses her talents.\n\nRosie Elnile\u2019s design tells of the country\u2019s schisms: a chaise longue and a desk are perched on the cracked floor; in one corner is a heap of red rock. But when the expected strife between settlers and inhabitants breaks out, it does not obscure another division: between men and women.\n\nStefan Adegbola is persuasive and comic as the compliant missionary who is bursting \u2013 \"under my very nostrils\" \u2013 with askew phrases. But the character who most upturns expectations is played, with beautiful, slinky scepticism, by Joan Iyiola. Prudence, another convert, is a tea-drinking, pipe-smoking, Shona-speaking, academically brilliant black woman. She is more than sophisticated and sharp. She is the cleverest person on stage. \u2022","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Susannah Clapp"},"topics":[],"title":"The Convert review \u2013 full-blooded, with a dash of melodrama","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"GB","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"The Guardian","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"353719887","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"The Guardian","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com","publisher":"Guardian News and Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatre","http://observer.theguardian.com/","https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/jan/29/the-convert-the-gate-review#img-1","https://www.theguardian.com/profile/susannahclapp","http://twitter.com/susannahclapp","https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fstage%2F2017%2Fjan%2F29%2Fthe-convert-the-gate-review%3FCMP%3Dshare_btn_fb","https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=The%20Convert%20review%20%E2%80%93%20full-blooded%2C%20with%20a%20dash%20of%20melodrama&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fstage%2F2017%2Fjan%2F29%2Fthe-convert-the-gate-review%3FCMP%3Dshare_btn_tw","http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&title=The%20Convert%20review%20%E2%80%93%20full-blooded%2C%20with%20a%20dash%20of%20melodrama&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fstage%2F2017%2Fjan%2F29%2Fthe-convert-the-gate-review","http://www.pinterest.com/pin/find/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fstage%2F2017%2Fjan%2F29%2Fthe-convert-the-gate-review","https://plus.google.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fstage%2F2017%2Fjan%2F29%2Fthe-convert-the-gate-review%3FCMP%3Dshare_btn_gp&hl=en-GB&wwc=1","http://www.gatetheatre.co.uk/events/all-productions/the_convert","https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2016/jul/14/artistic-directors-exit-gate-theatre","https://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","http://syndication.theguardian.com/automation/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fstage%2F2017%2Fjan%2F29%2Fthe-convert-the-gate-review&type=article&internalpagecode=3128152","https://www.theguardian.com/discussion/p/5npvd","https://www.theguardian.com/most-read/stage"],"sequenceId":"695201420349","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:19Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:06:34Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c00e8d78e39bc96bc7a18791bfcfca2be6bcb5b/0_457_4868_2921/master/4868.jpg?w=1200&amp;h=630&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;bm=normal&amp;ba=bottom%2Cleft&amp;blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&amp;s=c01d29e3fd3fc373f5710d406fa6aef2"},{"url":"https://media.guim.co.uk/7c00e8d78e39bc96bc7a18791bfcfca2be6bcb5b/0_457_4868_2921/4868.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

It should be seen as an opportunity to highlight all the hard work you have done in a year. There should be enthusiasm and zest. It is your decision to treat as a pleasure or pressure. Those who treat it as a pleasure will gain and those who treat it as pressure will repent. \n \n\"My view is that examination is a celebration. Take it as if it is a festival. And when there is a festival or celebration, then the best comes out of us. We feel the society's strength during celebrations. Whatever is the best comes out... Smile more to score more,\" he said. \n \nRead:  Mann Ki Baat: Exams should be a festive occasion for family, says Modi \n \nHe gave the example of discipline seen among masses in 'kumbh' fair even though it is generally felt that there is a lot of indiscipline among people. \"This is the strength of celebration.\" \n \nDuring examination, there should be a festive atmosphere among students, families and neighbours and it will convert this pressure into pleasure. \n \nHe also asked people to put examination in perspective and not treat it as \"a question of life and death or as a test of life but merely of the study students have put in during the year\". \n \nHe urged students not to chase marks but gain knowledge. \"Only studying for marks will lead to shortcuts and one will limit himself or herself. It is important to study for knowledge. Marks and mark sheets have a limited use. Knowledge, skill, self-confidence and commitment will be of use to you during life,\" Modi said. \n \nHe have the example of late President A P J Abdul Kalam's failure in an air force recruitment examination and said had he accepted it as a defeat, then India would not have got such a great scientist and President. \n \nHe also asked students to desist from resorting to shortcuts and cheating to score more. \n \n\"To cheat is to be cheap. It makes you a bad person. If you form a habit of cheating, there will be no desire to learn. Trying to cheat involves one's time to find ways. Use it for better purposes. People have told you often but I am saying again -- do not cheat. Even if no one catches you, you know that you have cheated in exams,\" he said.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Education news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Smile more to score more: PM to students, ahead of exam season","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Deccan Chronicle","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169673440","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"137"},"name":"Deccan Chronicle","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.deccanchronicle.com/"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201422479","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:06:34Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Teodora Castellucci\u2019s choreography has a simplistic, counter-gravitational quality to it that melds seamlessly with Demetrio Castellucci\u2019s crunching electronic score (Teodora and Demetrio are brother and sister; a third sibling, Agata, is one of the performers). What\u2019s actually happening on their post-apocalyptic planet, however, is far from clear.\n\nThe three Castelluccis are the children of the avant-garde theatre directors Romeo Castellucci and Chiara Guidi and whimsy levels are set high. There\u2019s the samurai and the Power Ranger figure, both danced by women, and there\u2019s a male figure who wears a helmet like a penguin\u2019s head. Between them flow shifting currents of hostility and alliance. At intervals, we encounter inflated white figures like giant maggots or sci-fi Mr Blobbys, who drift on to the stage in twos and threes and enact seemingly random slayings. An enigmatic creature resembling a human balloon in the shape of a five-pointed star makes a brief and vaguely sinister appearance. All of this is divertingly weird, even if the score is so brutally over-amplifed in the tight confines of the Barbican Pit that without earplugs (which, thankfully, front of house staff provide on entry), you\u2019ll leave with your ears ringing. But the pace is slow, the choreography repetitive and the piece exhibits all the signs of a work that has been expanded from an intriguing curio into an overblown full-evening work.\n\nThere\u2019s perhaps 20 minutes\u2019 worth of inventive content in Marzo; the additional 40 are ballast. Grand themes of nobility, war and death are touched upon, but too glancingly to provide any kind of conceptual underpinning. Fans of old-school manga comics and 90s children\u2019s TV may just discover enough to nourish them here, but others will find themselves lost in space.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Luke Jennings"},"topics":[],"title":"Marzo review \u2013 whimsy levels are set high","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"GB","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"The Guardian","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"353719887","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"The Guardian","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com","publisher":"Guardian News and Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.theguardian.com/stage/dance","http://observer.theguardian.com/","https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/jan/29/marzo-dewey-dell-barbican-pit-review#img-1","https://www.theguardian.com/profile/lukejennings","http://twitter.com/LukeJennings1","https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fstage%2F2017%2Fjan%2F29%2Fmarzo-dewey-dell-barbican-pit-review%3FCMP%3Dshare_btn_fb","https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Marzo%20review%20%E2%80%93%20whimsy%20levels%20are%20set%20high&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fstage%2F2017%2Fjan%2F29%2Fmarzo-dewey-dell-barbican-pit-review%3FCMP%3Dshare_btn_tw","http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&title=Marzo%20review%20%E2%80%93%20whimsy%20levels%20are%20set%20high&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fstage%2F2017%2Fjan%2F29%2Fmarzo-dewey-dell-barbican-pit-review","http://www.pinterest.com/pin/find/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fstage%2F2017%2Fjan%2F29%2Fmarzo-dewey-dell-barbican-pit-review","https://plus.google.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fstage%2F2017%2Fjan%2F29%2Fmarzo-dewey-dell-barbican-pit-review%3FCMP%3Dshare_btn_gp&hl=en-GB&wwc=1","https://www.barbican.org.uk/music/event-detail.asp?id=20247","https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DV-dUKOeBvrM&picture=","https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DV-dUKOeBvrM","http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DV-dUKOeBvrM&media=","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dUKOeBvrM","https://www.theguardian.com/culture/barbican","https://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","http://syndication.theguardian.com/automation/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fstage%2F2017%2Fjan%2F29%2Fmarzo-dewey-dell-barbican-pit-review&type=article&internalpagecode=3123462","https://www.theguardian.com/discussion/p/5ntfy","https://www.theguardian.com/most-read/stage"],"sequenceId":"695201422727","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:19Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:06:35Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a9dc0d1490ed0e432d13e8acaed05375ff2844d/0_241_4200_2520/master/4200.jpg?w=1200&amp;h=630&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;bm=normal&amp;ba=bottom%2Cleft&amp;blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&amp;s=fd2f02135cd0132e042c2b44c30d4090"},{"url":"https://media.guim.co.uk/8a9dc0d1490ed0e432d13e8acaed05375ff2844d/0_241_4200_2520/4200.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 39 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"GB","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"MyNBC5.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"610316583","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"MyNBC5.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.mynbc5.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201422896","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:06:35Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The purely instrumental numbers are at times quite mind-boggling in their cat-and-mouse interplay. Thile\u2019s vocals can be a bit disconcerting in their falsetto moments but quite beautiful at others, as in the ballad I Cover the Waterfront.

Both are cheekily revisited in T2 Trainspotting, the long-awaited (or perhaps feared?) sequel that catches up with novelist Irvine Welsh\u2019s antiheroes two decades later, and finds them ravaged not so much by heroin as by age, emasculation and an air of disappointment. Bremner is just terrific, his Keaton-esque physicality perfectly capturing Spud\u2019s blend of fragility and resilience No longer the angry young man who once tore down Edinburgh\u2019s Princes Street, McGregor\u2019s Renton is here introduced pounding a gymnasium treadmill, a sardonic nod to former fast times. Drawn back to his old haunts in the wake of a midlife crisis, he is shocked to find Spud (Ewen Bremner) with his head in a plastic bag, longing to end his miserable existence. Meanwhile, Jonny Lee Miller\u2019s broilingly embittered Simon (AKA \"Sick Boy\") spends his days nursing old grievances against his former \"best friend\" who ran off with his loot 20 years ago (\"First there was an opportunity\", runs a recurrent line, \"then there was a betrayal\"). As for Begbie (Robert Carlyle), a lengthy spell behind bars has estranged him from his teenage son, leaving him to face up to lonely fatherhood truths, tingeing his still violent sociopathy with a streak of pathos. It\u2019s easy to forget just how shocking Trainspotting\u2019s scenes of intravenous heroin use were, and how much the language of horror cinema inflected its shiversome visions of dead babies crawling across ceilings. Yet more shocking still would be the spectre of the original film-makers reteaming for a belated cash-in sequel that somehow undermined the enduring legacy of the original. \"It\u2019d better not be shite\" was the phrase that director Danny Boyle remembers hearing repeatedly on the set of T2 Trainspotting, whispered by everyone from cast to crew. Thankfully, T2 is definitely not \"shite\". While it may lack the vampiric teeth of its youthful predecessor, it is a worthy sequel to what has become a sacred original, respecting the rough edges of its forerunner while putting middle-aged flesh on the once raw ribcages of its oddly sympathetic subjects.\n\nDrawing on both Welsh\u2019s 1993 novel and its 2002 sequel, Porno, returning screenwriter John Hodge forges new narrative paths, remembering the glory days of yore without becoming what Simon calls \"a tourist in your own youth\". The story may be driven by extortion, prostitution, addiction and even Death Wish-style revenge, but its primary concerns are friendship and memory (recurrent Boyle themes), with editor Jon Harris shuffling time frames like playing cards, old knaves coming face to face with new kings and queens, the latter in the shape of Anjela Nedyalkova\u2019s enigmatic Veronika. Jonny Lee Miller and Ewan McGregor rolling back the years. Photograph: Graeme Hunter The real triumph of the original Trainspotting was that it gave vibrant voice to protagonists who would elsewhere be written off as deadbeats, turning them into empowered characters rather than downtrodden victims. The same is true of the sequel, nowhere more so than in the character of Spud, who gradually becomes the true heart of the drama, the author of his own story. Bremner is just terrific in the role, his Keatonesque physicality perfectly capturing Spud\u2019s blend of fragility and resilience, finding hidden depths beneath the defensively gormless facade. Like the movie itself, Spud can be both hilarious and heartbreaking; you want to hug him, even when his face is explosively splattered with vomit.\n\nBegbie\u2019s balcony and Spud\u2019s cafe: classic Trainspotting haunts 20 years on Read more Visually, T2 reminds us that Boyle comes from a rebellious lineage of British cinema that can be traced back through Nicolas Roeg and Ken Russell to the classic films of Powell and Pressburger (the latter the grandfather of Trainspotting producer Andrew Macdonald). Cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle quotes affectionately from his predecessor Brian Tufano\u2019s kinetic playbook, and the bold colour schemes of Kave Quinn\u2019s original production designs haunt the new locations. Yet this new movie retains a distinctly modern edge even as it looks back to the future. On the soundtrack, Underworld\u2019s Rick Smith provides \"original score and needle drops\", which blend altered fragments of old favourites with newer offerings from the likes of Young Fathers, High Contrast and Wolf Alice.\n\nHow T2 will play to younger audiences who didn\u2019t grow up with the 1996 original is anyone\u2019s guess. It\u2019s hardly likely to become a touchstone text for a new generation of cinemagoers. But from the perspective of a fiftysomething film fan who was shaken up by Trainspotting all those years ago, it\u2019s enough that the opportunity for this class reunion has not become a betrayal.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Mark Kermode"},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"T2 Trainspotting review \u2013 still in a class A of

Students browsed titles in Farsi bookstores. Music lovers flicked through CDs of Ebrahim \"Ebi\" Hamedi, the king of Persian pop.\n\nJust another Saturday in Tehrangeles, a portmanteau of Tehran and Los Angeles coined by exiles and their descendants \u2013 also known as Little Persia, a term so well established Google Maps recognises it.\n\nNew York Yemenis stunned by Trump's ban: 'I feel like somebody has killed me' Read more The apparent normality deceived. In hushed and bewildered tones, people wondered whether they still recognised the United States, the adopted homeland that had welcomed and sheltered them but now labelled them potential terrorists.\n\n\"It is totally unjust. This will affect thousands and thousands of families that are completely innocent,\" said Siamak, a 56-year-old physician who fled Iran after the ayatollahs took over in 1979. \"We ourselves are victims of terrorism. Now we are branded terrorists?\"\n\nThe news was still sinking in: Donald Trump had signed an executive order as part of his \"extreme vetting\" to keep out terrorists.\n\nThe order, named the Protection of the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States, imposes a a 90-day block on entry from citizens from Iran, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Libya and Somalia. \n\nIran\u2019s foreign affairs ministry said it will take legal, political and reciprocal measures.\n\nOvernight, many of the up to 500,000 Iranians and Iranian Americans who live in southern California felt as though the US border had clanged shut. If they leave, they may not be able to return. Those who are currently outside the US \u2013 even those with green cards and visas \u2013 are marooned.\n\n\"My friend is visiting relatives in Tehran and now he\u2019s stuck,\" said a young bookseller, who like most interviewees did not want her name published. \"He\u2019s got a job here, a mortgage, car payments. What will happen to him?\"\n\nThe question hung over every family with noncitizen relatives abroad. \"It\u2019s ridiculous,\" said Sam, a restaurant manager. \"We\u2019ve felt good here. California is very open-minded. But now this.\u2026\" His voice trailed off. \n\nThe director Ashgar Farhadi, who won an Oscar in 2012 for his film A Separation, and is nominated again for The Salesman, may , an absence which would fuel Hollywood\u2019s animus towards the Trump administration. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences called the prospect \"extremely troubling\".\n\nOne middle-aged woman, loading groceries into a Porsche, quivered with indignation. \"Iranians are not murderers. Iranians are not terrorists. Americans should know that.\" She said \"sanity\" would return. \"Trump is not going to last so long. They\u2019ll impeach him.\"\n\nTrump had promised a crackdown during the campaign but the executive order still came as a shock. California\u2019s Iranians, who often prefer the term Persian to distance themselves from Iran\u2019s current leadership, form a thriving community with roots stretching back decades. Some arrived as students in the 1960s, followed by waves of exiles after the 1979 revolution. \n\nMuslims tended to settle in Orange Country and the San Fernando valley, Jews in Westwood and Beverly Hills. \n\nAnecdotal evidence suggests many Jewish Iranians voted for Trump because he strongly backed Israel and bashed Tehran\u2019s rulers. Some are unrepentant.\n\n\"Yes, Trump!\" said one 70-year-old man who gave his name only as Kevin. \"He will stop the terrorists. You know when you leave your house, you lock the door, right? He\u2019s doing right.\" \n\nAsked whether a blanket ban on Iranian citizens was a good idea, Kevin hesitated. \"All, maybe not. But you have to lock your house.\"\n\nHassan Ali, a 29-year-old engineer from Pakistan who was buying pepper in Tehran Market, said targeting Muslims or any other religion was un-American. \"This country is supposed to be a melting pot.\"\n\nThe executive order seemed to have a chilling, immediate effect. Of 16 people of Iranian heritage interviewed at random in west LA, not one was willing to have their full name published. \n\nHolly Dagres, a Middle East commentator, discovered the same reluctance among her contacts. \"Iranians are scared to share.\"\n\nThe community in Tehrangles learned to keep its head down during the hostile atmosphere engendered by the 1979 hostage crisis. Embracing the term Persian \u2013 evoking carpets, cats and antiquity \u2013 was a way to avoid connotations of terrorism and fanaticism. \n\nBut that linguistic sidestep did not deflect Trump, said Siamak, the physician. \"He has branded us. The stereotype is back. I fear things will get worse and worse.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Rory Carroll"},"topics":[{"name":"Los Angeles news","group":"US regional"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Residents of Los Angeles' Little Persia denounce Trump's 'unjust' travel ban","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"GB","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"The Guardian","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"353719887","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"The Guardian","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com","publisher":"Guardian News and Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/usimmigration","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/29/los-angeles-iranians-little-persia-trump-travel-ban#img-1","https://www.theguardian.com/profile/rorycarroll","http://twitter.com/rorycarroll72","https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2F2017%2Fjan%2F29%2Flos-angeles-iranians-little-persia-trump-travel-ban%3FCMP%3Dshare_btn_fb","https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Residents%20of%20Los%20Angelesescape_startx27;%20Little%20Persia%20denounce%20Trumpescape_startx27;s%20escape_startx27;unjustescape_startx27;%20travel%20ban&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2F2017%2Fjan","http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&title=Residents%20of%20Los%20Angeles%27%20Little%20Persia%20denounce%20Trump%27s%20%27unjust%27%20travel%20ban&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2F2017%2Fjan%2F29%2Flos-angeles-iranians-little-p","http://www.pinterest.com/pin/find/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2F2017%2Fjan%2F29%2Flos-angeles-iranians-little-persia-trump-travel-ban","https://plus.google.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2F2017%2Fjan%2F29%2Flos-angeles-iranians-little-persia-trump-travel-ban%3FCMP%3Dshare_btn_gp&hl=en-GB&wwc=1","https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/los-angeles","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/28/new-york-yemenis-trump-immigration-ban-reaction","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/27/trump-immigration-plan-refugees-vetting-reaction","http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/01/asghar-farhadi-muslim-ban-oscars","https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-politics","http://syndication.theguardian.com/automation/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2F2017%2Fjan%2F29%2Flos-angeles-iranians-little-persia-trump-travel-ban&type=article&internalpagecode=3138648","https://www.theguardian.com/most-read/us-news"],"sequenceId":"695201429160","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:19Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:06:36Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40622b4a59e556978ccb1ef325c428c737785f07/0_234_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=1200&amp;h=630&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;bm=normal&amp;ba=bottom%2Cleft&amp;blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&amp;s=483bdf5ffbc19427034c1152b0016694"},{"url":"https://media.guim.co.uk/40622b4a59e556978ccb1ef325c428c737785f07/0_234_3500_2101/3500.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 38 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Jackson","zipCode":"64108","state":"Missouri","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Kansas City","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Kansas City Channel","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169667893","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1100"},"name":"Kansas City Channel","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.kmbc.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201430547","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:06:36Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Bridget Jones\u2019s Baby (Universal, 15) is the cinematic equivalent of burying one\u2019s head in the sand, except the sand turns out to be a plumped-up down pillow big enough to envelop one\u2019s entire body.\n\nTwelve years have passed since we left Helen Fielding\u2019s bumbling singleton at the abysmal edge of reason, but it\u2019s the time-swallowing continuity that comforts here. The jokes, it turns out, are much the same, whether they\u2019re about being alone and panicked in your 30s or being alone and panicked in your 40s, though they\u2019re kinder than they were in the second film, which made Bridget a stooge rather than a mistress of her own muddled destiny. She\u2019s back on the latter path, played with sweet, game dorkiness by the long-absent Renée Zellweger, whose own eagerness to regain her stride feeds happily into that of her klutzy alter ago. For two hours, Bridget Jones\u2019s Baby makes everything seem warmly normal. For that reason, I might just love it a little bit.\n\nThe best battle scenes ever shot from Apocalypse Now to Hacksaw Ridge Read more Though its comforts are far less cuddly, I feel just as heartened by Deepwater Horizon (Lionsgate, 12), a rousingly humane blockbuster spectacle with a tough sense of personal consequence and tragedy beneath its brutal inferno. Peter Berg\u2019s film is based on a true story \u2013 that of the catastrophic explosion on the eponymous offshore oil rig in 2010 \u2013 but doesn\u2019t rest on those credentials for its pathos and sensory authenticity. As resilient engineer Mike Williams, Mark Wahlberg is an anchor of troubled decency amid the fiery carnage, giving the film a conscience that tempers the vivid, potentially morbid pyrotechnics of the accident. What pyrotechnics though. For sheer tactile horror, amplified by stunning, justly Oscar-nominated sound design, this takes an immediate place in the disaster movie pantheon. \u2018Sheer tactile horror\u2019: Deepwater Horizon. Photograph: David Lee War on Everyone (Icon, 15), meanwhile, trades very much in carnage without humanity, and if that calls Cards Against Humanity to mind, so does the haphazard structure and irrational nastiness of this bad cop-bad cop thriller. A disappointment from the writer-director John Michael McDonagh, this Albuquerque-set rampage finds the Irishman\u2019s typically acrobatic writing style go splat in America. Some of the blood-soaked banter between corrupt boys in blue Michael Peña and Alexander Skarsgård lands, but much of it feels strained, even effortful, in its nastiness. The pairing of Skarsgård and the ever-spry Peña never quite combusts either. The former\u2019s part feels more like a mission for Idris Elba, who surely has better things to do than 100 Streets (Signature, 15), a well-meaning but essentially naff British attempt at the Crash model of criss-crossing morality plays, in which disconnected London malcontents don\u2019t so much collide as cross the street in vague view of each other.\n\nOn the arthouse front, a number of my learned colleagues claim to feel ravished by The Childhood of a Leader (Soda, 12), Brady Corbet\u2019s roaringly ambitious directorial debut, while I find myself admiring its architecture from a distance. This opulently designed, head-crunchingly scored (by Scott Walker) and Sartre-inspired parable of a monstrous child\u2019s upbringing (or is just a child\u2019s monstrous upbringing?) between world wars has prompted Trumpian analogies in the current climate. But beyond the auspicious, undeniable brio of Corbet\u2019s craft, there\u2019s nothing terribly complex or stimulating about his film\u2019s thumpingly obvious political metaphors. \u2018Roaringly ambitious\u2019: The Childhood of a Leader. Photograph: Allstar/Ifc Films Two film-related documentaries this week entertain in very different, equally generous ways. An Oscar nomination was probably going overboard for Life, Animated (Dogwoof, E), a rather blandly assembled but nonetheless heart-squeezing study of a withdrawn, autistic child who finds a language for the outside world in his beloved Disney animations. One wonders if he\u2019d have made quite such cheering progress if he\u2019d focused instead on the films of De Palma (Studiocanal, 15). Still one of the most perverse stylists in American genre cinema, the veteran director proves an entirely winning, self-effacing raconteur in Noah Baumbach\u2019s simply constructed film-by-film conversation. Full of tasty anecdotal nuggets and passages of genuinely dynamic analysis, it\u2019s a gloriously overgrown DVD extra in the best sense of the term.\n\nIt also sent me shuffling over to Shudder.com, the growing, horror-specific streaming service to which I\u2019m a late arrival. I didn\u2019t find the De Palma I was looking for, but its menu covers a pleasingly broad trash-to-art spectrum. On the latter end it yielded a very satisfying discovery in Laotian film-maker Mattie Do\u2019s Dearest Sister, a quiet, slinky ghost story that plays certain loyally upheld gothic conventions against the invigorating factors of its south-east Asian setting and stark feminine perspective. A million miles from Bridget Jones, it offers its own kind of soothing escape.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Guy Lodge"},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment:

Are these brilliant entrepreneurs who have built tremendous businesses through sheer creativity and ingenuity? Or are they renegades that grew in large part through contempt for the status quo? There\u2019s an ambivalence that surrounds companies like Uber and Airbnb, and I think this question over their identity \u2013 and the dual meanings of the word \"upstart\" \u2013 gets to the heart of it. My own squishy answer, of course, is that they are a little bit of both.\n\nYou\u2019ve written about Silicon Valley for more than 20 years\u2026 have we reached peak Valley yet?\n\nIn terms of the business impact, I don\u2019t think so. There\u2019s a new set of transformative technologies such as machine learning, AI and virtual reality that will spawn another set of big tech franchises. But in terms of cultural impact, perhaps we are at peak Valley. For decades, technology entrepreneurship has been revered, and people like Steve Jobs and Elon Musk were heroes. Now we have to contend with lost jobs due to automation, the effects of digital addiction and simple fatigue with all this constant change. So perhaps our feelings toward Silicon Valley are about to get a lot more complicated.\n\nYou met some of the individuals who had similar startup ideas to Uber and Airbnb but didn\u2019t become billionaires. Have these people been able to move on and were they reluctant to be featured? What\u2019s the best call Travis Kalanick has ever made?\n\nSurrendering in China in an expensive battle with local rival, Didi Chuxing. Last year Uber lost $2bn trying to win that market; Kalanick couldn\u2019t bring himself to sacrifice his dream of building a truly global network. But the rules of competition in China will always favour the local champion and Didi, it turned out, had the same access to capital as Uber. By stepping away from the fight, Uber not only saved its balance sheet from more destruction but negotiated an impressive 17% stake in its rival.\n\nAnd the best call Brian Chesky has made?\n\nBranding the Airbnb user base as a \"community\". For years before Airbnb, people posted their homes and spare rooms on the internet (via sites like Craigslist and Couchsurfing.com). Chesky and his colleagues drummed up an evangelical spirit to their endeavour and held meet-ups and, in later years, global conferences of hosts. It got Airbnb users to feel part of something larger and strengthened their ties to the company, even when it meant that they were violating provincial laws.\n\nIn most territories these firms operate outside of laws and regulations around minimum wages, health and safety, and tax collection\u2026 has exploiting these loopholes been key to their success?\n\nAbsolutely \u2013 just as Amazon\u2019s navigation of its sales tax obligations was key to its success over its first decade. With tough interpretation of taxi and zoning regulations, neither Uber nor Airbnb would have gotten started. By the time many cities recognized their existence, both were fairly large and had the political support of their customers. After publication of your book about Jeff Bezos and Amazon, Bezos\u2019s wife gave the book a one-star review on Amazon\u2026 Were you surprised? Did you witness much sharing in the sharing economy?\n\nCertainly some hosts on Airbnb are opening up their spare bedrooms to meet new people; and some drivers use Uber to carpool with strangers for the companionship. But the most productive members of each community are professional operators, making available their homes or cars as a way to earn or supplement a living. It\u2019s not the sharing economy at all, though that phrase has been useful for the companies to bolster their image.\n\nWhich sectors have been able to embrace upstarts\u2019 disruption with any success?\n\nThe auto industry. Upstarts like Tesla have achieved enormous success but haven\u2019t slowed down the car companies \u2013 2015 was their best year ever. The auto giants are all researching autonomous vehicles alongside the likes of Google and Uber and they could conceivably get there first. The real estate market has also remained fairly impervious to disruption, as well as (to everyone\u2019s consternation) the airline industry. Perhaps an industry\u2019s immunity is related to the size of each individual transaction.\n\nYou state that the founders of Airbnb and Uber are very different from Bill Gates, Larry Page and Mark Zuckerberg\u2026 How?\n\nFor all their strengths, Gates, Page and Zuckerberg are not charismatic communicators or storytellers. They generally avoided the press and focused their attentions inward. Chesky and Kalanick couldn\u2019t get away with that. Early on, they faced regulatory fights that their predecessors never encountered until much later. This took skills like mustering political coalitions, enlisting the support of customers and testifying publicly. They had to be politicians, as well as innovators and managers. Are the fortunes and efficiencies created by these companies worth the price paid by the disrupted?\n\nI think so \u2013 as long as they follow on their promises. Uber has pledged to reduce or eliminate traffic in major cities within five years and to treat drivers more equitably. Airbnb thinks it can create a new industry where people are paid to provide authentic travel experiences. It has also set out to eradicate racial bias from its platform. Let\u2019s watch these companies closely and make sure they achieve their goals, instead of replacing one set of distant, dominant companies with another.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Ian Tucker"},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: book news","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"Brad Stone: \u2018We should watch Uber and Airbnb closely\u2019","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"GB","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"The Guardian","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"353719887","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"The Guardian","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com","publisher":"Guardian News and Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.theguardian.com/books/businessandfinance","http://observer.theguardian.com/","https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/29/uber-app-changed-how-world-hails-a-taxi-brad-stone","https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jan/29/brad-stone-not-sharing-economy-upstarts-book-interview-airbnb-uber#img-1","https://www.theguardian.com/profile/iantucker","https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fbooks%2F2017%2Fjan%2F29%2Fbrad-stone-not-sharing-economy-upstarts-book-interview-airbnb-uber%3FCMP%3Dshare_btn_fb","https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Brad%20Stone%3A%20%E2%80%98We%20should%20watch%20Uber%20and%20Airbnb%20closely%E2%80%99&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fbooks%2F2017%2Fjan%2F29%2Fbrad-stone-not-sharing-economy-upstarts-book-interview-airbnb-u","http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&title=Brad%20Stone%3A%20%E2%80%98We%20should%20watch%20Uber%20and%20Airbnb%20closely%E2%80%99&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fbooks%2F2017%2Fjan%2F29%2Fbrad-stone-not-sharing-economy-upstarts-book-int","http://www.pinterest.com/pin/find/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fbooks%2F2017%2Fjan%2F29%2Fbrad-stone-not-sharing-economy-upstarts-book-interview-airbnb-uber","https://plus.google.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fbooks%2F2017%2Fjan%2F29%2Fbrad-stone-not-sharing-economy-upstarts-book-interview-airbnb-uber%3FCMP%3Dshare_btn_gp&hl=en-GB&wwc=1","https://www.theguardian.com/technology/airbnb","https://www.theguardian.com/technology/uber","https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/01/uber-deal-didi-chuxing-china-analysis","https://www.craigslist.org/about/sites","https://www.couchsurfing.com/","https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jan/29/brad-stone-not-sharing-economy-upstarts-book-interview-airbnb-uber#img-2","https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fbooks%2F2017%2Fjan%2F29%2Fbrad-stone-not-sharing-economy-upstarts-book-interview-airbnb-uber%3FCMP%3Dshare_btn_fb%26page%3Dwith%3Aimg-2%23img-2&picture=http","https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Brad%20Stone%3A%20%E2%80%98We%20should%20watch%20Uber%20and%20Airbnb%20closely%E2%80%99&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fbooks%2F2017%2Fjan%2F29%2Fbrad-stone-not-sharing-economy-upstarts-book-interview-airbnb-u","http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Brad%20Stone%3A%20%E2%80%98We%20should%20watch%20Uber%20and%20Airbnb%20closely%E2%80%99&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fbooks%2F2017%2Fjan%2F29%2Fbrad-stone-not-sharing-economy-upstarts-book-","https://www.amazon.com/review/R2I0T26SV0ELPP/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316219282&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books","https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/03/sign-up-to-our-bookmarks-email","https://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","https://www.theguardian.com/technology/sharing-economy","https://www.theguardian.com/technology/startups","https://www.theguardian.com/technology/internet","http://syndication.theguardian.com/automation/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fbooks%2F2017%2Fjan%2F29%2Fbrad-stone-not-sharing-economy-upstarts-book-interview-airbnb-uber&type=article&internalpagecode=3126966","https://www.theguardian.com/discussion/p/5nnaf","https://www.theguardian.com/most-read/books"],"sequenceId":"695201431491","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:18Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:06:36Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c138775d55354fd4d7f7909939eb3277d3749b1d/0_114_6144_3686/master/6144.jpg?w=1200&amp;h=630&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;bm=normal&amp;ba=bottom%2Cleft&amp;blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&amp;s=895903075b8d96aa3c101c7f01cb702a"},{"url":"https://media.guim.co.uk/c138775d55354fd4d7f7909939eb3277d3749b1d/0_114_6144_3686/6144.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Beiser\u2019s highly individual career reflects her eclectic background. Collaborators include Brian Eno, Philip Glass and Louis Andriessen. As part of Kings Place\u2019s Cello Unwrapped series she will perform works written for her, including Steve Reich\u2019s Cello Counterpoint.\n\nHow did the Steve Reich piece come about?\n\nSteve is a long-time mentor and friend. I met him in the 1990s in New York. I am a founder member of the Bang on a Can collective and always wanted him to write a cello piece. It\u2019s still the only one he has written. I premiered Cello Counterpoint in 2003 for the inaugural season of Zankel Hall, part of Carnegie Hall in New York. It was a great opportunity, a key moment in my career, and this 12-minute work has been part of my repertoire ever since. It has seven pre-recorded tracks which I play myself \u2013 so I\u2019m my own backing track! There is a sense of call and response. It is a masterpiece. I consider myself very fortunate that Steve wrote it for me. You\u2019ve been called a \"rockstar cellist\" and \"cello goddess\". Presumably annoying to other cellists\u2026?\n\nI find it quite entertaining. I imagine it\u2019s because I\u2019m not conforming as a classical performer to the habits people expect. Part of it, curiously, is about what I wear and how I express myself on stage. It\u2019s true I do care about the visual aspect. I think of it as an art form \u2013 a total performance. I love fashion: Alexander Wang, Alexander McQueen, Iris van Herpen, Miu Miu. I find it fun to wear sculptural boots that defy gravity. It\u2019s quite theatrical. It sometimes runs the risk of seeming like a gimmick. But fortunately my very serious attitude to music and the cello seems to balance the extravagant! I\u2019d be practising Bach or Dvorák in the morning with the sound of the muezzin\u2019s call to prayer sounding in the distance You\u2019ve taken this to quite extreme extents?\n\nActually, compared to the world of rock and popular culture this is quite tame. It\u2019s only extreme if you consider the historical constraints placed on classical music performance. I love to collaborate with visual artists and expand the palette of what I bring to the audience. In 2012 I did a show at BAM \u2013 Brooklyn Academy of Music \u2013 called Elsewhere, which was what I have described as a \"cello opera\". It was based on the eerie and surreal work of the Belgium writer Henri Michaux, painting a world where females try to survive on a dying planet. It sadly feels quiet relevant to the new world order we are facing today\u2026\n\nThe repertoire you play equally stretches beyond usual boundaries.\n\nIt\u2019s been described as \"Bach to Pink Floyd\" but actually it goes back long before, and of course includes a lot of new music. My latest album, TranceClassical, covers a pretty large range, from Hildegard of Bingen to Lou Reed arrangements, and my own cover of an Imogen Heap piece. This past year I premiered three new cello concertos \u2013 by Mark-Anthony Turnage, Philip Glass and Mohammed Fairouz. I love to reinterpret classic and art rock music (such as in my 2014 album Uncovered). And then of course there\u2019s the tango my parents so loved. The trailer for Maya Beiser\u2019s Uncovered. Do you think your childhood on a kibbutz gave you this nonconformist fearlessness?\n\nI think I was born a nonconformist. But my upbringing helped shape my world view. It was a humanistic education that valued asking questions, finding one\u2019s own point of view. It melded together my passion for art and music with my passion for apolitical social justice and peace. I started playing the cello at six years old and immediately it became all I wanted to do. No one ever had to tell me to practise. An agricultural collective that lived on the land \u2013 my upbringing included milking cows, herding sheep and working the fields \u2013 organic and local was not a fad. This is how we grew our food and how we sustained our life. Ideologically it was an atheist and socialist commune. We lived in harmony with our Arab neighbours. We were friends with the Bedouins. And I\u2019d be practising Bach or Dvorák early in the morning with the sound of the muezzin\u2019s call to prayer sounding in the distance. There was a sense that peace was achievable. However difficult and remote that now seems, I believe it still is. \u2022","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Fiona Maddocks"},"topics":[],"title":"Maya Beiser: \u2018I think I was born a nonconformist\u2019","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"GB","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"The Guardian","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"353719887","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"The Guardian","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com","publisher":"Guardian News and Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.theguardian.com/music/classicalmusicandopera","http://observer.theguardian.com/","https://www.theguardian.com/global/2017/jan/29/maya-beiser-cellist-new-york-interview#img-1","https://www.theguardian.com/profile/fiona-maddocks","http://twitter.com/FionaMaddocks","https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fglobal%2F2017%2Fjan%2F29%2Fmaya-beiser-cellist-new-york-interview%3FCMP%3Dshare_btn_fb","https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Maya%20Beiser%3A%20%E2%80%98I%20think%20I%20was%20born%20a%20nonconformist%E2%80%99&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fglobal%2F2017%2Fjan%2F29%2Fmaya-beiser-cellist-new-york-interview%3FCMP%3Dshare_btn_tw","http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&title=Maya%20Beiser%3A%20%E2%80%98I%20think%20I%20was%20born%20a%20nonconformist%E2%80%99&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fglobal%2F2017%2Fjan%2F29%2Fmaya-beiser-cellist-new-york-interview","http://www.pinterest.com/pin/find/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fglobal%2F2017%2Fjan%2F29%2Fmaya-beiser-cellist-new-york-interview","https://plus.google.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fglobal%2F2017%2Fjan%2F29%2Fmaya-beiser-cellist-new-york-interview%3FCMP%3Dshare_btn_gp&hl=en-GB&wwc=1","http://www.mayabeiser.com/","https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/mar/26/brian-eno-i-dont-get-much-of-a-thrill-out-of-spending-money","https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jan/22/philip-glass-80-interview-observer-new-review","https://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2012/oct/15/louis-andriessen-classical-music-guide","http://www.kingsplace.co.uk/cello-unwrapped#.WIYsC9d4X9I","https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/oct/03/steve-reich-80-birthday-best-works-pieces","http://bangonacan.org/","https://www.ted.com/talks/maya_beiser_s_and_her_cello_s","https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DR6X_IhgJLzA&picture=","https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DR6X_IhgJLzA","http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DR6X_IhgJLzA&media=","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6X_IhgJLzA","https://twitter.com/CelloGoddess","https://www.innova.mu/albums/maya-beiser/tranceclassical","https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DpUit3XPKx9Q&picture=","https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DpUit3XPKx9Q","http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DpUit3XPKx9Q&media=","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUit3XPKx9Q","http://www.kingsplace.co.uk/whats-on/music/maya-beiser-new-york-cello#.WIYl6dd4X9I","https://www.theguardian.com/tone/q-and-as","https://www.theguardian.com/music/steve-reich","http://syndication.theguardian.com/automation/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fglobal%2F2017%2Fjan%2F29%2Fmaya-beiser-cellist-new-york-interview&type=article&internalpagecode=3128517","https://www.theguardian.com/most-read"],"sequenceId":"695201434148","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:19Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:06:35Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2242ea326ac59a9acf6f9ef304df9ea7f0f5b3f/0_5_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?w=1200&amp;h=630&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;bm=normal&amp;ba=bottom%2Cleft&amp;blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&amp;s=0878762396806e1a814135f4df2e34e3"},{"url":"https://media.guim.co.uk/e2242ea326ac59a9acf6f9ef304df9ea7f0f5b3f/0_5_2000_1200/2000.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Gibson is perhaps overly fond of juxtaposing images that evoke heavenly hosts with those of the visceral hell of the hard-fought Okinawa battle in which Desmond, true to himself and his God, becomes a hero.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Wendy Ide"},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"Hacksaw Ridge review \u2013 punchy like a sledgehammer","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"GB","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"The Guardian","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"353719887","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"The Guardian","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Film","Arts","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com","publisher":"Guardian News and Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.theguardian.com/film/hacksaw-ridge","http://observer.theguardian.com/","https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jan/29/hacksaw-ridge-review-punchy-like-a-sledgehammer-mel-gibson-andrew-garfield#img-1","https://www.theguardian.com/profile/wendy-ide","https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ffilm%2F2017%2Fjan%2F29%2Fhacksaw-ridge-review-punchy-like-a-sledgehammer-mel-gibson-andrew-garfield%3FCMP%3Dshare_btn_fb","https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Hacksaw%20Ridge%20review%20%E2%80%93%20punchy%20like%20a%20sledgehammer&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ffilm%2F2017%2Fjan%2F29%2Fhacksaw-ridge-review-punchy-like-a-sledgehammer-mel-gibson-andrew-garfield%3FCMP","http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&title=Hacksaw%20Ridge%20review%20%E2%80%93%20punchy%20like%20a%20sledgehammer&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ffilm%2F2017%2Fjan%2F29%2Fhacksaw-ridge-review-punchy-like-a-sledgehammer-mel-gibson-andrew","http://www.pinterest.com/pin/find/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ffilm%2F2017%2Fjan%2F29%2Fhacksaw-ridge-review-punchy-like-a-sledgehammer-mel-gibson-andrew-garfield","https://plus.google.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ffilm%2F2017%2Fjan%2F29%2Fhacksaw-ridge-review-punchy-like-a-sledgehammer-mel-gibson-andrew-garfield%3FCMP%3Dshare_btn_gp&hl=en-GB&wwc=1","https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DiX193z7vE78&picture=","https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DiX193z7vE78","http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DiX193z7vE78&media=","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iX193z7vE78","https://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","https://www.theguardian.com/film/war-films","https://www.theguardian.com/film/melgibson","https://www.theguardian.com/film/andrew-garfield","http://syndication.theguardian.com/automation/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ffilm%2F2017%2Fjan%2F29%2Fhacksaw-ridge-review-punchy-like-a-sledgehammer-mel-gibson-andrew-garfield&type=article&internalpagecode=3122696","https://www.theguardian.com/discussion/p/5nheb","https://www.theguardian.com/most-read/film"],"sequenceId":"695201435242","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:18Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:06:35Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1947cae06680285b31ac98f126bf78e972803c0/45_376_2716_1630/master/2716.jpg?w=1200&amp;h=630&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;bm=normal&amp;ba=bottom%2Cleft&amp;blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&amp;s=86790de98fe7ffec38c2961b5b9ca553"},{"url":"https://media.guim.co.uk/a1947cae06680285b31ac98f126bf78e972803c0/45_376_2716_1630/2716.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Failing that, he will almost certainly be an ex-Hammer by close of business on Tuesday. \n \nWhich is a pity. \n \nNot because I particularly want him stay with the London club \u2013 I would be perfectly happy never to watch him play again \u2013 but because I would love to see a footballer taught a lesson about respect. \n \nI mean, going on strike and refusing to play? How conceited, egotistical and selfish can one person be? \n \nThis isn\u2019t some poor, downtrodden worker who is slaving away in a dirty factory for minimum wage. This is a professional footballer who gets paid more than \u20ac100,000 a week for kicking a ball. \n \nYes he is pretty good at his job \u2013 or at least he was pretty good at his job up until the summer \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t give him the right to dictate to his employers and insult the supporters who pay his wages. \n \nThe problem apparently started when Marseille made an offer for Payet that West Ham politely declined, partly because it undervalued the player but mostly because they need him to help turn their season around. \n \nSo he sulked, went on strike and refused to ever play for the Hammers again. \n \nWhen analysing this situation let\u2019s not forget that it was less than a year ago that Payet was overjoyed at signing a new, improved five-year contract with West Ham, the club that put a underperforming player on the big stage. \n \nHe then went away to Euro 16, played well and returned to London with delusions of grandeur: West Ham no longer felt big enough for such an accomplished talent. And with that came a coincidental collapse in his performances. \n \nWhat a nasty and disloyal little man he is. \n \nWhich brings me back to my point \u2013 if there is any justice in the world then West Ham should neither sell him nor play him. They should make him spend the next six months rotting in the reserves. \n \nOften a club can\u2019t afford to do that with an \u2018asset\u2019, especially when transfer fees of £25 and £30 million are being talked about. \n \nBut in this case I think they can. \n \nPayet\u2019s value isn\u2019t going to drop at all between now and May because of the aforementioned five-year contract. It would have been a different case entirely if he had been in the last year of his deal, but he isn\u2019t, so his price will hold. Plus the team are actually playing better without him in the side. \n \nOn that basis, if by some miracle West Ham do stand firm it won\u2019t cost them very much. But they would be sending out a message to all players that chucking your teddy out of the pram isn\u2019t guaranteed to get you what you want. \n \nAnd the value of that to the entire world of football would be priceless. \n A badly timed blip  \nWhat on earth is going on over at Liverpool? \n \nA little over a month ago everything was smelling of roses in the Anfield garden as they sat just a couple of points behind Chelsea at the top and a genuine title challenge seemed to be on the cards. \n \nOn top of that they had one eye on a trip to Wembley with an eminently winnable League Cup semi-final against Southampton on the horizon. \n \nFast-forward to last week and the wheels have come off Jurgen Klopp\u2019s bus in disastrous fashion. A month to forget has seen them slip to fourth place, 10 points behind the leaders and they went out of the League Cup with a whimper. \n  If there is any justice in the world West Ham should neither sell him nor play him   \nLiverpool haven\u2019t won a serious game of football in 2017. Their only victory came in the FA Cup against League Two Plymouth Argyle. And even that, as the 1-0 scoreline suggests, was hardly the resounding victory it should have been. And it came after a replay. \n \nDuring this dodgy spell their defence has looked increasingly uncertain but, more worrying, the goals have all but dried up. Seven in seven games is a very worrying statistic. \n \nI\u2019ve heard numerous theories about what is behind this downturn in form but by far the most common excuse I have heard from the Liverpool fans I know is that the players are exhausted. \n \nWell I\u2019m sorry, but that is just silly. \n \nYes there is a certain amount of intensity to the way Klopp gets his team playing. But Tottenham Hotpur have a similarly energetic approach, plus they had Champions League games to deal with earlier in the season. And if Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s team are tired, they are doing a bloody good job of hiding it. \n \nI genuinely don\u2019t believe there is one individual reason for Liverpool\u2019s spell of poor form. It is just a combination of several things going wrong at the same time such as Philippe Coutinho getting injured, Daniel Sturridge forgetting how to play football and Sadio Mane disappearing to Africa. \n \nEqually, I believe it is little more than a blip and things will start to click again sooner rather than later. \n \nThe sad thing for Liverpool fans is that by the time they turn this round, they will be fighting for little more than consolation prizes. \n It\u2019s best to quit while you\u2019re ahead  \nIt can\u2019t be easy for Claudio Ranieri to keep picking up awards for being the greatest manager on the planet while at the same time presiding over Leicester City\u2019s car crash of a season. \n \nLast week the very likeable Italian added the Gianni Brera Award to his growing collection, which has seen him crowned coach of the year by the likes of Fifa, the BBC and the League Manager\u2019s Association. \n \nHe has even been made a Grand Officer of the Italian Order of Merit \u2013 Italy\u2019s equivalent of a knighthood \u2013 in recognition of what he achieved against the odds last season. \n \nBut while he is undoubtedly honoured by all these awards, the fact that they keep rolling in while he is embroiled in a relegation battle can\u2019t sit comfortably with an honest man like Ranieri. \n \nTo be honest, you have to feel a bit sorry for the man. This was supposed to be his moment in the spotlight, the year when he got to bask in the glory of the greatest achievement of his long managerial career. \n \nIf Leicester had been mid-table, chugging along, nobody would have batted an eyelid. Not even the most diehard Leicester fan expected them to repeat their success. \n \nInstead Ranieri is presiding over a disaster, which is merely serving to prove how much of a unbelievable fluke last season was. \n \nMake no mistake, Leicester are genuine relegation contenders. \n \nI\u2019ve seen them a few times this season and they have generally been poor, but last Saturday against Southampton they were truly awful. \n \nSome of that was Ranieri trying out a new formation, which was billed as \u2018diamond\u2019 but was far more \u2018lump of coal\u2019. But a lot of it was to do with the fact that players who raised their game to incredible levels last season have now rediscovered their natural levels. \n \nJamie Vardy, to pick an obvious example, was brilliant throughout the last campaign. This season he is a pale shadow of the man who scored 24 goals to fire his team to the top. \n \nAnd he isn\u2019t alone. Robert Huth and Wes Morgan, last season an impenetrable last line of defence, look like they have never played together before. Meanwhile, Danny Drinkwater, who forced his way into the England squad on the back of last season\u2019s exploits, looks like a player who couldn\u2019t force his way our of a wet paper bag. \n \nAt the beginning of the season I wondered if Ranieri might have been better quitting while he was at the top. Now I am starting to believe that would definitely have been a wise move. \n \nAs I said, he is one of the nice guys of football, and his legacy would be tarnished forever if he ended up being the first coach in Premier League history to relegate the champions. \n \n[email protected] \nTwitter: @maltablade","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"James Calvert"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: EPL - Liverpool news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: EPL - West Ham United news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Another spoilt player all set to get his way","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Southern Europe","countryCode":"MT","country":"Malta"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Times of Malta","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169660702","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"87"},"name":"Times of Malta","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.timesofmalta.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201438987","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T00:47:02Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:06:39Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Letaba Rest Camp \n \nLetaba Rest Camp is situated on the bend of the Letaba River. The camp is midway between the southern and northern boundaries, reports the  Lowvelder . \n \nThe name means \u201criver of sand\u201d. The riverbed is an excellent location for game viewing, particularly elephant. \n \n\n \n2. Orpen Rest Camp \n \nOrpen Rest Camp is situated on the western border of the KNP. It derived its name from the surname of the donor of the land, Eileen Orpen. \n \nIt is an area of scattered trees and wide-open plains populated by the three big cats. You can also look forward to encounters with wild dog. \n \n3. Talamati Bushveld Camp \n \nTalamati Bushveld Camp is situated in a large open valley. Talamati is a Xitsonga word that means \u201clots of water\u201d. \n \nDespite the meaning of the name, the river is actually dry. The clay soil acts as a giant sponge holding a vast reservoir of underground water. The vegetation there is lush all year round and attracts grazers. \n \n4. Sirheni Bushveld Camp \n \nSirheni Bushveld Camp nestles on the edge of the KNP\u2019s northern plains. \n \nThe Mphongolo River flows close by. Sirheni is a Tsonga word that means \u201ccemetery\u201d. There is an elephant graveyard at a site near to the camp. From the camp\u2019s bird hides a wide variety of game and birds can be watched. \n \n\n \n5. Skukuza \n \nSkukuza is a Shangaan word meaning either \u201che who sweeps clean\u201d or \u201che who turns everything upside down\u201d. It is the biggest camp in the park. \n \nSome Krugerholics even call Skukuza the \u201ccapital\u201d of the Republic of Kruger! \n \nIt is close to the Kruger Gate and an excellent springboard to the rest of the Park. \n \n\n \n6. Punda Maria \n \nThe name of the Punda Maria rest camp was given in 1919 by the first ranger to be posted to the area, Captain JJ Coetser. \n \nHe mistakenly named his post Punda Maria in the belief that this was the Swahili name for zebra, the first big game he saw on arrival. \n \nThe correct Swahili name is actually \u201cpunda milia\u201d or striped donkey. When the error was pointed out to him, he chose to retain the name, in honour of his wife, Maria. \n \nDr. Salomon Joubert said that in 1959, the Parks Board changed the name to Punda Miliya. \n \nDr. Van Warmelo, a well-known ethnomologist, said that the name should be spelt Punda Milia and the board accepted that. \n \nIn 1981 Dr. Tol Pienaar did a submission to the board and two acquaintances of Coetzer Hewit Ivy and Astley Maberley said that this is the correct version of how it came about. \n \nThe board accepted the explanation and the name was restored in 1981. \n \n\n \n\u2013  Caxton News Service \n \nRead original story on lowvelder.co.za","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"This is how these six Kruger camps got their names","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Southern Africa","countryCode":"ZA","country":"South Africa"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Standerton Advertiser","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"534543046","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2"},"name":"Standerton Advertiser","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://standertonadvertiser.co.za"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201439160","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:06:39Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

But why does it act as if its neighbours aren\u2019t there? The emails go back over the years, under headings such as \"property feature idea\". An offer of dinner in a fine London restaurant with the building\u2019s notable architect. An invitation to an evening of canapes and drinks in which a famous TV heritage expert would give a special talk. \"If you\u2019re interested, we can arrange a helicopter tour over the area or anything else you might need.\" This buttering-up is more insistent than usual in the world of property PR. I have also seen for myself the chunky, loopy motifs of the 31-storey tower called Canaletto, the subject of all this promotion, as it has gone up next to City Road canal basin in central London. It is the most striking of several projects in what is becoming a new zone of skyscrapers. So I\u2019m intrigued to see the finished article and find out what all the fuss was about. A brand company named it Canaletto because, I\u2019m told, \u2018it\u2019s on water, like a lot of Canaletto\u2019s images\u2019 Like other buildings of the high capitalist present, it has a curious affinity with the phalanstère, the utopian socialist community dreamed up in the early 19th century by the philosopher Charles Fourier. Fourier imagined a single imposing building, in scale and look like the palace of Versailles, where people would live, work, socialise and engage in culture and sport. Orion Capital Managers, backer of Canaletto, has also come up with an enclosed world, where several aspects of human existence are served. The 31-storey Canaletto residential tower, its curving exterior frames designed to create \u2018distinctive vertical neighbourhoods\u2019. Along with your dwelling unit (at a cost of £3.5m for a three-bedroom flat), you get access to gym, spa, swimming pool, private bar, private cinema and shared lounge with the qualities of both library and billiards room, where you can transact your business with laptop and phone or, when the football is on, engage in collective yelling at its widescreen TVs. Around these facilities a sense of community and physical wellbeing are, as Fourier hoped, encouraged. A \"plank challenge\" tests who can hold their body longest (seven minutes) in said exercise. Specially developed apps monitor, if you choose, the healthiness of your lifestyle. There are \"masterclasses\" in the use of the fearsomely complicated workout machines.\n\nIt all takes place within a singular building, triangular in plan and dominated by curving frames, each containing a portion of three or two storeys. It is an efflorescence of the globalised residential property market, its signature stylings looking more like similar blocks in Singapore or Abu Dhabi than the surrounding brick terraces and warehouses. It is as good a place as any to sample the strange new world that such developments are creating. Canaletto\u2019s private cinema. Photograph: Tony Brown It is branded and marketed. A company called Socrates Communications named it Canaletto (not the Canaletto Building, or Canaletto Mansions, or Canaletto Heights, as might once have been the case, but the one word on its own) because, I\u2019m told, \"it\u2019s on water, like a lot of Canaletto\u2019s images, and when Canaletto was painting it was a time of a lot of change and modernisation\". The artistic name then inspired its selling, with gilt-framed images of \"an award-winning masterpiece\" displayed on its hoardings.\n\nIt is designed by UNStudio of Amsterdam, a practice whose intellectual and artistic aspirations have won it commissions to design public museums and homes for art collectors. The practice is also sufficiently commercial to work on large developments, office, retail and residential, around the world. Their buildings, like their remarkable twisting Arnhem Central railway station, curve and swoop, in the manner of designs by Zaha Hadid or Santiago Calatrava. The imagery is of flow and movement, of an advanced, boundary-less society, of a world, as they put it, of \"global networks, accelerating technologies and unlimited possibility\".\n\nWith Canaletto, UNStudio take the boxy type of an apartment block and apply to the exterior, as if with a thick felt-tip pen, shapes that suggest dynamism. A theme of roundedness and anti-gravity construction then runs through the building, in cantilevered benches, in planters, balustrades and swimming pool ceiling panels, in the way that pieces of carpet are set into timber floors. Around the entrance, the architects play with the levels, sloping up to the front door, cutting away the ground to make a light well for the basement-level swimming pool. The theory is to create \"distinctive vertical neighbourhoods\", to break up the overall shape such that residents can pick out their home from a distance. The Canaletto swimming pool: \u2018a sense of physical wellbeing is encouraged\u2019. Photograph: Tony Brown The aim, says UNStudio\u2019s leader, Ben van Berkel, is to create a \"residential project that does not look like an office building\", to give \"textures to the facade\" and \"public functions at ground level\" \u2013 in particular, a restaurant \u2013 that bring \"a sense of liveliness\". The external shapes make the building \"more uplifting and lighter\". In honour of \"one of the most beautiful aspects of London, the garden city concept\", they take forms \"influenced by landscape and flowers and plants\".\n\nVan Berkel insists that he is not making shapes for their own sake, but because they are linked to the \"performance of the building\". As the facades aren\u2019t smooth, they break up downdrafts of wind, and the sculpted shapes mean that you have a \"really nice ceiling for your balcony\". He wants to go against the idea that buildings like these are \"speculations for international investors\", and to encourage community.\n\nThese ideas make a building that does stand apart from the usual tower trash going up in big cities, but it\u2019s hard to escape the impression that the big shapes, flower-inspired or not, are, after all, cosmetic, which puts them at odds with the good intentions. The appearance of flow and connectedness collides awkwardly with the cellular nature of apartment buildings. The ambition to swoop and sweep is belied by conspicuous joints in the construction, and the reluctance of hard building materials to join the party. Details clash and grind. Granite landscaping protests at being hacked into shapes it doesn\u2019t like. Canaletto in its City Road setting. Photograph: Canaletto At both a large and a small scale the rhetoric of connection paradoxically increases disconnection. Where glass, metal, wood and masonry meet, their chances of happy coexistence are diminished by the fact that they are simultaneously contorted. Despite claims to \"conceptually mirror\" the proportions of \"smaller adjacent historical buildings\", the extravagant shapes don\u2019t have much to do with their neighbours. In particular, there is a block of 100 affordable homes, provided as a planning obligation by the developer of Canaletto, but realised by another architect and developer. It is dour and grey \u2013 no fault of UNStudio\u2019s \u2013 but the design of the upmarket tower acts as if its poor relation isn\u2019t there.\n\nThe ground-level restaurant, with an external terrace, will add something to the street and make a connection between it and the tower. But under the punk urbanism that applies when British cities undergo dramatic shifts in scale, it is beyond the power of public bodies to imagine places such as City Road as more than the sum of its parts. So they tend to become arid zones of landscaping that fill the space between the private universes of buildings such as Canaletto.\n\nWhat this alliance of marketing and architectural theory has is oomph. It is Instagrammable. It gets 4.9 stars out of five in its Google reviews. If you squint, you can imagine a future in which, like art deco factories of the past, whose architecture was also cosmetic, it could inspire kitschy retro affection. \"The banding captures people\u2019s imagination,\" the developer tells me. It also has things that plenty of new residential developments don\u2019t, such as balconies you can actually use, decent ceiling heights and well-lit apartments.\n\nA friend who lives nearby, whose politics are to the left of Fourier\u2019s, has nonetheless expressed his liking for the new luxury towers rising along City Road. Something to do with their frank expression of economic reality, I think. I, too, appreciate their otherness, and in theory they could help make City Road into an extraordinary new kind of district, unlike any that has existed before. But for that to happen, the design energy that now goes into Canaletto\u2019s loopy cladding would have to be directed at the spaces between the new buildings and at the relationships they make with one another.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Rowan Moore"},"topics":[],"title":"Canaletto review \u2013 a utopia with its head in the

An early chapter ends after an uncle burgles his father\u2019s white goods store; the next chapter rewinds the narrative, with the store burned down, not robbed. Auster replays it a third time \u2013 the store burns down with Ferguson\u2019s father inside \u2013 before a final alternative shows the business thriving.\n\nWe\u2019re lured in by Auster\u2019s fine-grained scene-setting and intrigue at his intentions. The perspective is puzzling: we\u2019re inside the protagonist\u2019s mind but also told of what he was \"still too young at that point to understand\". We\u2019re curious, too, as to what Auster means when he says Ferguson\u2019s parents appear \"in the all-inclusive, authorised edition of The Book of Terrestrial Life\", a strange-sounding work that remains mysterious when it appears for the fifth and final time some 700 pages later.\n\nBy that time, 4321 has long settled into a largely unsurprising coming-of-age tale of sexual longing and literary ambition. Auster gives us heft without density: there are few stakes in this Borgesian garden of forking paths. The hero might sleep with Amy Schneiderman or Brian Mischevski; go to Columbia or Princeton; become a basketball reporter or a movie critic; get killed in a road accident or only maimed, but the story lines cancel each other out instead of adding substance. The sentences, plausibly inspired by what Auster has called Kleist\u2019s \"great hatchet-blows of thought\", usually run about half the length of this review and often a good deal longer. But Kleist\u2019s model sits ill with Auster\u2019s preoccupations. Where Kleist\u2019s 1810 novella Michael Kohlhaas \"tells and tells\" us about its hero\u2019s bloody rampage, 4321 tells and tells us about Ferguson\u2019s first taste of couscous or about how good he is at \"parallel parking, the tight-squeeze operation that was the downfall of so many would-be motorists\". You can fill 864 pages pretty quickly writing like this.\n\nWhile there\u2019s an everyman tint to Ferguson, Auster is keen to show how special he is, whatever the incarnation. A girl from Brussels with \"breasts fuller than might have been expected\" tells him he knows \"10 times more than any 10 of these idiot Americans put together\" when he brings up Leopold II\u2019s atrocities in the Congo (guess what the girl does next?). The \"finest literary mind in Princeton\" says it\u2019s \"a privilege\" to meet him after reading his student short stories. When a prostitute says he\u2019s \"a good-looking boy with a pretty pecker\", there\u2019s no question she doesn\u2019t mean it.\n\nAs the last Ferguson standing makes it into the Nixon era, the novel\u2019s girth guarantees suspense: how will Auster play the hand he\u2019s spent so long assembling? That the novel should hymn the power of imagination is hardly a shock \u2013 he\u2019s been here before \u2013 but in a book that is longer than his last three novels put together, the finale has the air of a bad joke. I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s better or worse that he seems utterly sincere.\n\n\u2022 4321 by Paul Auster is published by Faber (£20).

You saw a tremendously entertaining, hard-fought, big-time, division one game. If you are an Aztec player, coach or fan, you feel as if a part of you has been ripped off. We played hard enough to win, we played tough enough to win, but we didn't win. The nature of what we do. We have been on this side way too many times this season. The opportunities were there, but we weren't able to get it done. Tonight, it was more them than us. (Senior guard Gian) Clavell was a big ringleader for them. (Senior forward Emmanuel) Omogbo was a close second, but Clavell was sensational and we weren't able to make one more stop. Yeah, I would have done something different that last play if I could have repeated it and taken it back, but there are no mulligans in what we do. I am proud of these two boys (Kell and Pope). Malik had his best overall game of the season, and we need him like that on Tuesday and every game. Trey played with toughness, but we just came up one possession short. It hurts deeply for all of us.\" \n\nOn Gian Clavell's last sequence: \n\n\"In hindsight, we were too extended, where the whole gym had a good feeling he was going to get it and shoot it. So, we needed to put a few more bodies in front of him and make him give up the ball. We have different forms of full court. Where we should have been in more of what we call a shadow yellow, where you make him get in front of you then put bodies in front of you. But, he got it on the dead run and got an angle on us. You don't want to foul him, but you don't want him to get it to the rim either. \" \n\nOn making big plays towards the end of the game: \n\n\"There is no question we did, right till the end. When Max Hoetel got the offensive rebound and got it to Malik who made two free throws to put us up a point. We came away one play short in order to win the game.\" \n\nOn Zylan Cheatham: \n\n\"He's got a stress reaction. It's the same thing Jeremy Hemsley had last year. Now we are day to day.\" \n\nOn closing remarks: \n\n\"When you have five turn overs, score 77 points, get to the free throw line 28 times and they are 14, you should win the game. And we didn't. It burns and it hurts, and they had a lot to do with it. They played the second half with tremendous basketball. They shot 61% against us in the second half, and most of them were contested shots. They came in and fought, and stayed with it. They were led by Clavell in every regard right to the end, when Trey was shooting free throws he was barking out, `you box out the shooter, you do this, you do that.' He was the guy telling everyone on the team what to do.\" \n\nOn team moving forward: \n\n\"They sent him out for a brief moment, and I'm sure told him, `Don't foul.' And he delivered for them, and we just weren't quite there when we could've, should've but didn't. I'm proud of what we're trying to do, we've got to stay with it. This is a time that tries your soul, and you've got to come back together and come back and say, `We will win on Tuesday. We will win on Tuesday.' And nothing can take away what happened tonight, and nothing replaces the feeling when you win a game like this...so we have to win a game like this. We have to win a game like this, and we have to start on Tuesday. If we let up even a little bit, it won't happen. So we have to come in with the same mindset. We had two really good practices on Thursday and Friday. We must have a great practice on Monday. We must be attentive tomorrow when we do our film work and walkthrough and talk and have ourselves ready to go. That's the nature of the business.\" \n\nSDSU junior guard Trey Kell On the team's inability to close out games this season: \n\n\"It's tough. No matter where you're playing, especially here where the expectations are so high, and the expectations we put on ourselves, we feel like we have the talent to be able to win these close games no matter who we're playing. At the end of the day, there's nothing else we can say. There's no magic potion we can use amongst ourselves, it's just we have to do it. There's nothing the coaches can say, nothing the media can say, noting our families can say to us. It's just that we have to go out and do it.\" \n\nOn any positives SDSU can take away from the loss: \n\n\"What we mentioned a little bit earlier: how we made some plays. We had key offensive rebounds, we got some steals when we were down a couple points at the end, I happened to make [those] two free throws at the end, but besides that we didn't come here to win morale victories, we need actual victories.\" \n\nSDSU junior forward Malik Pope \n\nOn inability to close out games this season: \n\n\"So far it's been a trip, but we're learning. It's just a little adversity. [We've] just got to fight to the end, and we did everything--almost everything--correct this game, and fell short at the end. We could have done that way better, but you can't turn back. All you can do is get better from today.\" \n\nOn redshirt sophomore forward Zylan Cheatham's absence this game: \n\n\"Missing Zylan is a big piece, so of course I'll have to step my game up on rebounding and all the ways that he helps this team. But we all did that. All five of us. Everyone else on the court, it wasn't just me. We just had to pick up the slack [in the things] he was really good at. [But we're] just waiting. Just waiting, hoping he gets back soon.\" \n\nColorado State head coach Larry Eustachy \n\nOn the game: \n\n\"I thought it was a game from the memory books. If you watched it on TV or you were here live or you were able to have the luxury of coaching in the game, I think everything played out perfect. Gian Clavell had four fouls. We took him out and sat him for about four seconds and then put him back in. When you've got somebody like him and Emmanuel (Omogbo), you feel like you've got a chance.\" \n\nOn Gian Clavell's second half: \n\n\"That was one of the better performances--under the circumstances when you look at everything that's happened to this program from the beginning to the season to where they find ourselves now--it makes it an unbelievable storyline.\" \n\nOn what he did to keep the team in it when they were down by 13 in the second half: \n\n\"I just kept urging, saying, `Have we got our game on the court yet?' I thought the first 10 minutes were perfect. The tempo was right. We had to get away from it. We kept moving the ball around and we were tired. Obviously we needed to start taking some quicker shots and again, Gian just took over and Emmanuel took over. Everything had to fall right for us to win that game and it did. If two programs respect each other the most in this league, it's Colorado State and San Diego State and vice versa. I think everyone was just kind of stunned. The coaches, I know I was, I was just sitting there going, `What just happened,' to Coach Fisher. You combine the games with him and I, it's almost embarrassing how many we've coached and it reveals our age a little bit, but that is one of the more memorable games for both of us I'm sure. He'll probably remember it more than me because you don't remember the wins. You remember the tough losses like we've had at Long Beach State and things like that. Lot of experience on that court as coaches and it turned out to be an epic game.\" \n\nColorado State senior guard Gian Clavell \n\nOn today's game: \n\n\"I love San Diego State -- Coach Fisher, the players. I have always wanted to win here and I just heard that we haven't won here since 2003. I think this was by best win at Colorado State. I'm just grateful that we came here and got the win.\" \n\nOn how they kept their heads up going into halftime down by 10: \n\n\"Coach talked to us and they've had weeks before here where they felt like they'd just given up. We were just playing hard our way. Play the ball, rebound, go get it and just play with the tempo, and I think that just helped us a lot today in the second half.\" \n\nOn feeling like he couldn't miss today and what was on his mind: \n\n\"I wasn't thinking about anything, honestly. I didn't even know what I had, I didn't even know what I was.

Robert Greene\u2019s Kate Plays Christine was a tricksy moral maze of a movie that explored the ethical dilemma of being a parasite of tragedy. By comparison, Antonio Campos\u2019s Christine is less experimental in its approach, but this elegant, achingly sad study of debilitating depression is by no means a conventional piece of film-making. Deftly sidestepping any of the obvious narrative choices, this film confirms Campos (Afterschool, Simon Killer) as one of the most intelligent and consistently surprising film-makers working in US indie cinema.\n\nRebecca Hall on starring in Christine: 'It\u2019s about her life \u2013 not her death' Read more Playing the troubled Christine, Rebecca Hall is extraordinary. Her voice is low, but there\u2019s a hard, abrasive edge to it that sounds like an attack, even when it isn\u2019t. At dinner with a colleague, she stabs her lettuce with such ferocity that it looks like she is subduing an uprising on her plate rather than sampling her salad. And this force, always a notch or two higher than is needed or normal, is evident everywhere in her life. This, together with her resistance to prurient blood-and-guts journalism, places her at odds with the head of the failing television station where she works.\n\nIt\u2019s an eloquently structured piece. Campos uses repetition of certain scenes \u2013 Christine\u2019s volunteer work as a puppeteer, for example \u2013 to track the way depression spreads like an ink stain across her psyche. This is a quality package throughout. The score, by Danny Bensi and Saunder Jurriaans, is full of nervy woodwind and off-kilter rhythms; the production design is a meticulous symphony in tobacco browns. In some ways, Christine can be viewed as a companion piece to Campos\u2019s debut, Afterschool. Both deal with the alienating, dehumanising effects of violence in the media, albeit from different sides of the lens. It\u2019s certainly the stronger of the two films that tackle Chubbuck\u2019s strange, sorry story.

However, permission had been sought only for 3000-5000 people. \n \nFollowing the incident, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minster Akhilesh Yadav had constituted a one-man inquiry commission to probe the stampede. \n \nJustice (Retd) Chauhan had summoned nearly 42 officials, who were on duty the day the incident occurred to record their statements. \n \nThe commission had earlier this month visited Varanasi between January 3 to 6 to probe the stampede incident and completed its first round of inquiry with recording statements of over 100 people, including eyewitnesses and organisers. \n \nHowever, Chauhan while talking to mediapersons here has said that so far only one official from Chandauli district had appeared before the commission to record his statement and no other officials turned up before the commission to record their statements. \n \nHe said that due to being engaged in the Assembly election duties, most of the officials had requested to extend the dates for appearing before the commission (to record their statements), to which the commission had given them one more chance and it will be returning again to Varanasi for holding its third round of inquiry. \n \nChauhan said the commission may extend its date of probe for nearly six more months and it is likely to return again on February 20, for its third round of inquiry. \n \nHe made an appeal to the people including mediapersons that if they had any video footages or photographs taken at the time of the incident, then they may provide it to the commission. \n \nThis is published unedited from the PTI feed.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Press Trust of India"},"topics":[{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Varanasi stampede: Commission begins second round of inquiry","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"India.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"597540856","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"India.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.india.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201444090","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:05:08Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:06:38Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://s3.india.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/indiacom-image-banner_02.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Those numbers left Beynon with 1,013 points and 500 rebounds for her career. She became the 15th Lobo to reach both milestones. \n  \nLobo guard Cherise Beynon, left, puts up a layup around Nevada\u2019s Halie Bergman during New Mexico\u2019s MWC win in the Pit on Saturday. (Roberto E. Rosales/Albuquerque Journal) \n  \nBeynon also racked up six assists, four steals and a block in 35 minutes, but didn\u2019t consider it a stellar performance because she also amassed eight of UNM\u2019s 20 turnovers. \n \n\u201cI\u2019m kind of upset right now because of my turnovers,\u201d Beynon said. \u201cI was aware of the other stats, and they\u2019re nice because everyone wants to have a good career. But I really feel like I just had an OK game. We did just enough to get the win.\u201d \n \nThe Lobos (11-9, 7-3 Mountain West) led most of the way but could not shake the determined Wolf Pack (8-12, 2-7) until the final minute. Turnovers, rebounds and chilly shooting never really allowed UNM to find its offensive stride. \n \nNew Mexico\u2019s 59 points were its fewest in a win this season. It was also the first time UNM has won when being outrebounded. (Nevada had 46 boards to the Lobos\u2019 42.) \n \n\u201cIt was a hard-fought defensive struggle,\u201d Lobos coach Mike Bradbury said, \u201cdefinitely not pretty. We couldn\u2019t keep them off the boards and we turned it over too much, especially in the first half. But with all that, we found a way to get it done in the fourth quarter and pull out a win.\u201d \n  \nUNM\u2019s Jaisa Nunn, right, looks to grab a loose ball away from Nevada\u2019s TMoe on Saturday. \n  \nAlex Lapeyrolerie scored 13 points for the home team, including a key 3-pointer with 2:36 left that gave UNM a 56-48 lead. To that point, Nevada had battled through its own offensive woes (20 turnovers and 27.9 percent shooting) to stay within striking distance. \n \n\u201cNevada is extremely well-coached and had a really good plan both times they played us,\u201d Bradbury said. \u201cDefensively, they did what everyone does against us \u2014 packed five people in the paint and made us shoot \u2018HORSE\u2019 shots. We made just enough.\u201d \n  \n \nContinue reading \n    \nLobo posts Richelle van der Keijl and Jaisa Nunn, who combined for just two field goals in UNM\u2019s 69-63 win Jan. 7 in Reno, had precious little room to work again Saturday. They were efficient this time, however, combining for 17 points and 16 rebounds. Van der Keijl also had a season-high five blocks. \n \nNevada got a team-best 12 points from post Terae Briggs but, like UNM, could not do much damage from the perimeter. The Wolf Pack went 4-for-23 from 3-point range. \n \nStill, the game went back and forth with seven ties and 10 lead changes before UNM finally gained control. Van der Keijl scored on a high-low post feed from Nunn to give the Lobos a 44-43 lead with 2:11 left in the third quarter. Beynon then scored the next six points to extend the lead to 50-43 early in the fourth. \n \nMykiel Burleson finished with nine points and Kianna Keller had her usual hustling contributions for UNM, collecting six rebounds, six steals, two blocks and an assist. Keller missed her two shot attempts. \n \nSUNDAY MATINEE: The Lobos will host Northern New Mexico today in what is essentially a makeup game. UNM\u2019s scheduled Dec. 18 contest against Eastern Illinois was canceled because weather issues prevented the Panthers from traveling to Albuquerque. The teams were not able to find a suitable makeup date, so today\u2019s game was added instead. \n \nIt will be a quick turnaround for both teams. Northern New Mexico dropped a 78-55 decision to College of the Ozarks in Española on Saturday. \n \nThe NAIA Eagles (11-14) feature 13 players from New Mexico, including leading scorer Demetria Clichee (Navajo Pine High School), who averages 15 points per game. Cheyenne Cordova (Pojoaque Valley) and Ashley John (Shiprock) also average double figures in points. \n \nAll tickets for today\u2019s contest will be $2. \n \nClick here for Saturday night\u2019s box score.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: US college sports news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Lobo women get a win that\u2019s \"not pretty\"","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Bernalillo","zipCode":"87109","state":"New Mexico","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Albuquerque","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"Albuquerque Journal","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169660875","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3746"},"name":"Albuquerque Journal","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Consumer","Sports"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.abqjournal.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://d3el53au0d7w62.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/28/c01_jd_29jan_loba3.jpg","https://d3el53au0d7w62.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/28/c01_jd_29jan_loba2-2.jpg","http://golobos.com/documents/2017/1/28/1_28_vs_Nevada.pdf?id=8861"],"sequenceId":"695201449054","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:06:41Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

STATE OF IOWA, Appellee. \n No. 15-0203      Decided: January 13, 2017  Daniel D. Bernstein of Law Office of Daniel D. Bernstein, Iowa City, for appellants. Thomas J. Miller, Attorney General, Anne Updegraff, Assistant Attorney General, and Jessica Tucker Glick and Richard M. Tucker of Phelan, Tucker, Mullen, Walker, Tucker & Gelman, L.L.P., Iowa City, for appellee. \nIn this case, we consider whether a person can properly present a claim against the State without complying with a state appeals board (board) regulation that requires the claimant to personally sign the form. The district court dismissed the claims filed by the plaintiffs in this case because their attorney signed the forms on their behalf. On further review from a decision of the court of appeals affirming the decision of the district court, we vacate the decision of the court of appeals, reverse the judgment of the district court, and remand for further proceedings. \n \nI. Factual Background and Proceedings. \n \nPaula Segura alleges the State of Iowa was negligent in diagnosing and treating her acute medical condition, leading to a permanent loss of function in her lower extremities. Ricardo Segura, her spouse, alleges loss of consortium. The alleged negligence occurred on May 12, 2009. The Seguras assert they learned of the injury and its cause on May 13, 2009. In April of 2010, the Seguras contacted Iowa City attorney Daniel D. Bernstein about their potential claims. Bernstein agreed to investigate the claim. The Seguras moved to Fort Worth, Texas, and Bernstein maintained \u201con and off communication.\u201d On May 12, 2011, Bernstein filed two board claim forms on the Seguras' behalf, signing their names and his own, and writing \u201cper POA.\u201d Bernstein did not attach any document that would show he actually had power of attorney. The claim forms, together with attached appendices, identified the Seguras' causes of action and included a short summary of the relevant facts. 1 The claim forms also contained personal information, including the Seguras' and Bernstein's contact information and social security numbers. \n \nOn February 6, 2012 (approximately nine months after filing the claims), the board rejected the Seguras' claims by letter addressed to Bernstein, stating, \u201cThe State Appeal Board, after considering the facts and circumstances forming the basis of your client's claim and the applicable law, has made a final determination to deny payment of this claim.\u201d On August 3, 2012 (approximately six months after receiving the State's letter), the Seguras filed their claim in district court. \n \nThe State moved to dismiss the Seguras' petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, asserting the Seguras' failure to sign the claim forms and Bernstein's failure to provide evidence of power of attorney constituted noncompliance with Iowa Administrative Code rule 543\u20141.3(3), rendering the filings ineffectual and thus depriving the district court of subject matter jurisdiction. The Seguras resisted, arguing Bernstein was acting as their attorney and should be entitled to file documents on their behalf, and furthermore that strict compliance with administrative rules should not be a prerequisite to jurisdiction. The district court denied the motion, finding it would be more appropriately brought as a motion for summary judgment. \n \nThe parties then engaged in a discovery dispute regarding, primarily, expert reports. The Seguras had delayed in obtaining expert witnesses, citing high cost and the potential their claim could be dismissed on jurisdictional grounds. The Seguras then moved for declaratory judgment and/or partial summary judgment on the jurisdiction issue, reiterating their arguments from the earlier resistance to the State's motion to dismiss. This time, the district court agreed with the State and concluded, \u201c[I]t is necessary for a claims form filed under the [Iowa Tort Claims Act] to include evidence of a person's authority to represent the claimant, if the claims form is not, in fact, signed by the claimant.\u201d Finding Bernstein could not \u201cshow[\u2009] that the claims forms were completed according to the administrative rules,\u201d the district court dismissed the petition. \n \nThe Seguras appealed. They reiterated the arguments presented to the district court, but included additional legal authority and recast the issue from \u201cwhether [the Seguras'] attorney's signature on their behalf was a harmless error in the administrative process\u201d to whether \u201cthe State Appeal Board claim forms presented by claimants Paula and Ricardo Segura provided adequate notice of their claim to the State in order for the State to commence its own investigation.\u201d The State claimed that the Seguras were attempting to argue a new, \u201csubstantive\u201d issue that was not preserved, that the only issue on appeal should be whether the Seguras complied with the \u201cprocedural\u201d requirements of the Iowa Tort Claims Act (ITCA), and that the Seguras failed to do so by failing to personally sign the forms. The court of appeals agreed with the State on both error preservation and the merits and adopted the district court's ruling without further opinion. We granted further review. \n \nII. Standard of Review. \n \n\u201cA \u2018court has inherent power to determine whether it has jurisdiction over the subject matter of the proceedings before it.\u2019\u2009\u201d Klinge v. Bentien, 725 N.W.2d 13, 15 (Iowa 2006) (quoting Tigges v. City of Ames, 356 N.W.2d 503, 512 (Iowa 1984)). Our review is for correction of errors at law. Schaefer v. Putnam, 841 N.W.2d 68, 74 (Iowa 2013); see also Iowa R. App. P. 6.907. \n \nIII. Analysis. \n \n\u201cIt is a fundamental doctrine of appellate review that issues must ordinarily be both raised and decided by the district court before we will decide them on appeal.\u201d Meier v. Senecaut, 641 N.W.2d 532, 537 (Iowa 2002). \u201c[O]ne purpose of our error preservation rules is to ensure that the opposing party and the district court are alerted to an issue at a time when corrective action can be taken or another alternative pursued.\u201d Top of Iowa Coop. v. Sime Farms, Inc., 608 N.W.2d 454, 470 (Iowa 2000); see also Office of Consumer Advocate v. Iowa State Commerce Comm'n, 465 N.W.2d 280, 283 (Iowa 1991). \u201cError preservation does not turn, however, on the thoroughness of counsel's research and briefing so long as the nature of the error has been timely brought to the attention of the district court.\u201d Summy v. City of Des Moines, 708 N.W.2d 333, 338 (Iowa 2006), overruled in part on other grounds by Alcala v. Marriott Int'l, Inc., 880 N.W.2d 699, 708 n.3 (Iowa 2016). Similarly, error preservation does not turn on \u201chypertechnical\u201d challenges. Ezzone v. Riccardi, 525 N.W.2d 388, 403 (Iowa 1994). \n \nIn their motion for declaratory judgment, the Seguras characterized the issue as \u201cwhether the fact that Claimant[\u2009]s, themselves, failed to sign the State Appeal Board Claim Forms denies the District Court for the State of Iowa the jurisdiction to hear the lawsuit.\u201d In their brief in support of the motion, they posed the question, \u201cTo what extent must a claimant comply with the promulgated state tort claim form in order to properly submit a claim?\u201d They pointed out that the board was able to investigate their claims despite their failure to sign the form. They argued to distinguish our cases holding claims must be brought by individuals authorized to bring them. In short, the argument the Seguras presented should have been more than enough to alert the court of the claimed error. See Ezzone, 525 N.W.2d at 403 (finding error preserved when challenge was hypertechnical); Office of Consumer Advocate, 465 N.W.2d at 283\u201384 (finding error preserved when a party alleged a violation of \u201cprocedural fairness\u201d despite that party's failure to identify the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause as the source of the right); see also Bartlett Grain Co., LP v. Sheeder, 829 N.W.2d 18, 24 n.4 (Iowa 2013) (finding error preserved, even though parties did not cite to specific UCC provision because appellant alerted the court of its \u201cessential claim\u201d). The district court's ruling, which not only noted the Seguras had argued \u201cthat the act of retaining their counsel is, in and of itself, sufficient to permit their counsel to sign the claim forms on their behalf,\u201d but found federal precedent persuasive and stated it \u201cconsider[ed] the reasoning in Kanar[ v. United States, 118 F.3d 527 (7th Cir. 1997)] as [it] consider[ed] whether Plaintiffs' claims in the present case must be dismissed,\u201d shows it considered and decided the arguments to the contrary. See State v. Lamasters, 821 N.W.2d 856, 864 (Iowa 2012) (\u201cIf the court's ruling indicates that the court considered the issue and necessarily ruled on it, even if the court's reasoning is \u2018incomplete or sparse,\u2019 the issue has been preserved.\u201d); see also Kanar, 118 F.3d at 530\u201331 (discussing what is required under the Federal Tort Claims Act to present a claim). \n \nError was preserved in this matter. We therefore reach the underlying issue. Doing so, we conclude the district court erred in dismissing the Seguras' claims and hold a claim is properly presented to the board when it identifies sufficient information for the board to investigate the claim and discloses the amount of damages claimed. Finding the Seguras did so, we reverse and remand for further proceedings to address the merits of their claims. \n \nA. Background. The doctrine of sovereign immunity is judicial, not constitutional or statutory in origin. See Boyer v. Iowa High Sch. Athletic Ass'n, 256 Iowa 337, 347, 127 N.W.2d 606, 612 (1964). We have consistently held it is a jurisdictional bar. See Montandon v. Hargrave Constr. Co., 256 Iowa 1297, 1299, 130 N.W.2d 659, 660 (Iowa 1964) (\u201c[The state] is immune from suit except where immunity is waived by statute and \u2024 there is no statutory waiver or consent to jurisdiction in tort actions.\u201d). Leading up to the enactment of the ITCA, this court faced challenges to sovereign immunity. See Montandon, 256 Iowa at 1299, 130 N.W.2d at 660; Boyer, 256 Iowa at 347, 127 N.W.2d at 612. We declined to abrogate our doctrine and left the issue to the legislature. See Boyer, 127 N.W.2d at 612. \n \nIn 1965, the legislature took the opportunity and passed the ITCA. 1965 Iowa Acts ch. 79, §§ 1\u201323 (codified at Iowa Code §§ 25A.1\u201325A.20 (1966)). It became effective on March 30, 1965. See Hubbard v. State, 163 N.W.2d 904, 906 (Iowa 1969). \n \nPrior to passage of the Iowa Tort Claims Act in 1965, the maxim that \u201cthe King can do no wrong\u201d prevailed in Iowa. No tort action could be maintained against the State or its agencies. Throughout this period of time, one who suffered damages as the result of a negligent or wrongful act of a State employee had the limited choice of bringing suit against the employee personally or seeking redress from the Iowa General Assembly in the form of private relief. \n \nDon R. Bennett, Handling Tort Claims and Suits Against the State of Iowa: Part I, 17 Drake L. Rev. 189, 189 (1968) (footnotes omitted) [hereinafter Bennett]. By enacting the ITCA, the State waived this immunity and opened itself to suit, but it did so strictly on its terms. See id. at 190. \n \nThe case of Graham v. Worthington was our first assessment of the ITCA, and we used the opportunity to uphold the Act's constitutionality. See generally 259 Iowa 845, 850\u201370, 146 N.W.2d 626, 630\u201342 (Iowa 1966). When it was challenged for being an unlawful delegation of legislative authority, we stated, \n \nIt is for the General Assembly to enact laws governing expenditure of state funds including the appropriation of moneys for payment. But once this is constitutionally done the procedures, mechanics, the fact finding process upon which payment shall be made, may with reasonably proper guides or standards be delegated to judicial or quasi-judicial bodies. \n \nId. at 857, 146 N.W.2d at 635. \n \nLater, in Charles Gabus Ford, Inc. v. Iowa State Highway Commission, we found Iowa Code section 25A.5 (now section 669.5) made exhaustion \u201ca condition precedent to the right to resort to the courts.\u201d 224 N.W.2d 639, 648 (Iowa 1974). We looked at the rationales for exhaustion, calling it \u201ca product of the exercise of judicial restraint, resting on considerations of comity and convenience.\u201d Id. We noted it \u201cis designed to promote orderly procedures within the judicial system by requiring a preliminary administrative sifting process,\u201d and that by invoking the doctrine, courts \u201cseek to avoid interfering with the functions of the administrative agency.\u201d Id. \n \nThe source of the exhaustion requirement is section 669.5(1), which provides in part, \n \nA suit shall not be permitted \u2024 unless the attorney general has made final disposition of the claim. However, if the attorney general does not make final disposition of a claim within six months after the claim is made in writing to the director of the department of management, the claimant may, by notice in writing, withdraw the claim from consideration and begin suit under this chapter. \n \nIowa Code § 669.5(1) (2013); see also Feltes v. State, 385 N.W.2d 544, 547 (Iowa 1986) (finding section 669.5 \u201crequires that all claims be submitted to an agency and a final decision be made or six months have passed before suit is initiated\u201d). Part of exhaustion is \u201cpresentment\u201d: The plaintiff must first present the claim to the appropriate administrative body. See In re Estate of Voss, 553 N.W.2d 878, 880 (Iowa 1996). The presentment requirement and related administrative processes are \u201cintended to allow a prompt investigation of claims against the State and facilitate an early settlement when possible.\u201d Id. at 881. \n \nThe State argues the source of the presentment requirement is not the same as the source of the exhaustion requirement. Instead, the State asserts the source of the presentment requirement is section 669.3, which provides, \u201cA claim made under this chapter shall be filed with the director of the department of management \u2024\u201d Iowa Code § 669.3(2). However, reading section 669.3 in its entirety reveals it is not the source of the presentment requirement, but rather the ITCA's settlement provisions. See Iowa Code § 669.3(1) (\u201cThe attorney general, on behalf of the state of Iowa, shall consider, ascertain, adjust, compromise, settle, determine, and allow any claim that is subject to this chapter.\u201d); State v. DeSimone, 839 N.W.2d 660, 666 (Iowa 2013) (\u201c[S]tatutes must be read in their entirety.\u201d). This section is also the source of administrative authority to promulgate \u201crules and procedures for the handling, processing, and investigation of claims.\u201d Iowa Code § 669.3(3). These regulations prescribe, in part, the form of claims: \n \n1.3(1) Place of filing. Claims shall be filed in triplicate with the Department of Management, State Capitol, Des Moines, Iowa 50319. \n \n1.3(2) Verification. Claims shall be verified. \n \n1.3(3) Names and signatures. A claim shall state thereon the name, address, telephone number, and age of the person making the claim and the name, address and telephone number of the attorney, if any, preparing the claim, and their signatures. \n \n1.3(4) Designation by number. The executive secretary shall assign a number to each claim. Thereafter it may be referred to by such a number. \n \nIowa Admin. Code r. 543\u20141.3(1)\u2013(3). \n \nIn McGruder v. State and Swanger v. State, we had the opportunity to consider the interplay between now-Iowa Code sections 669.3 and 669.5. See Swanger v. State, 445 N.W.2d 344, 350 (Iowa 1989); McGruder v. State, 420 N.W.2d 425, 426 (Iowa 1988). In McGruder, we were asked whether a claim must be \u201cfiled\u201d according to now-section 669.3 for it to be \u201cmade\u201d under now-section 669.13. See McGruder, 420 N.W.2d at 425. We followed federal law interpreting the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) to require receipt of the claim, not mere mailing, to toll the statute. See id. at 426 (citing Anderberg v. United States, 718 F.2d 976, 977 (10th Cir. 1983)). Thus, the plaintiff in McGruder missed the statute of limitations when he mailed the claim form on the final day because the state did not receive the claim for two more days. See id. at 425\u201326. In Swanger, the plaintiffs argued that when the state's insurance adjuster took one claimant's deposition, the claimant presented the claim to the state. See 445 N.W.2d at 350. We reaffirmed our holding in McGruder and went further to expressly tie the term \u201cmade,\u201d also in now-section 669.5, to the administrative regulations promulgated under now-section 669.3. See id. at 350\u201351 (\u201cFollowing our reasoning in McGruder, we conclude that tort claims are \u2018made\u2019 for the purposes of section 25A.5 when the prescribed forms are properly filed with the director of management.\u201d). We noted the board \u201chas prescribed the form and content of tort claims,\u201d and that \u201cfor example, [claims] must be verified and signed by the claimant.\u201d See id. at 350 (citing 543 Iowa Admin. Code rs. 1.3, 1.4). Thus, the plaintiffs' communications to the state's insurance adjuster were inadequate to commence the six-month period of now-section 669.5. See id. at 351; see also Bloomquist v. Wapello County, 500 N.W.2d 1, 8 (Iowa 1993) (finding claim barred when not specifically identified in claim form and stating \u201cunder Iowa law it is incumbent on the claimant to first file a claim before the proper administrative agency, even if, as a practical matter, it would not have changed the State's approach to the case\u201d). \n \nHowever, we rejected a formalistic approach in a later case. In Schneider v. State, the state argued \u201cplaintiffs who failed to supply information required by the state appeal board's administrative rules had failed to exhaust administrative remedies.\u201d 789 N.W.2d 138, 144 (Iowa 2010). The plaintiffs had filed board claim forms, \u201cdisclos[ing] the amount of each claim for property damage and generally describ[ing] the legal theories asserted against the State,\u201d but they failed to respond to requests for additional information. See id. at 144\u201345. Nevertheless, we noted the board's failure to invoke its administrative means of inducing the plaintiffs to provide the information was evidence \u201cthe board had available to it the information it believed it needed to make its administrative determination.\u201d See id. at 145\u201346. Because the board ultimately denied the claim, we found \u201cthe administrative process ran its course.\u201d See id. at 146. Looking to the underlying principles of the exhaustion doctrine, we found it inappropriate to invoke it, as doing so would not \u201cavoid interference with the administrative process.\u201d See id. \n \nIn Voss, we questioned whether the rule \u201cthat a plaintiff must have the capacity to sue in order to commence and maintain an action in district court \u2024 appl[ied] to claims filed with the State Appeal Board.\u201d 553 N.W.2d at 880. The plaintiff had filed a claim for her son's wrongful death in her individual capacity, failing to obtain appointment as administrator of her son's estate until well after the board denied her claim. See id. at 879. Because the \u201csettlement of claims is greatly facilitated if the person making the claim is the person entitled to any recovery and has the authority to settle,\u201d and the plaintiff lacked that capacity, her claim was barred. Id. at 881. We reiterated a point we had applied elsewhere, that the plaintiff's capacity to sue must exist at the time of filing, and \u201cfuture appointment \u2024 cannot prevent the expiration of the limitations period.\u201d Id. at 882 (quoting Estate of Dyer v. Krug, 533 N.W.2d 221, 224 (Iowa 1995)). We noted \u201c[a] less theoretical reason\u201d for this rule: \u201cRequiring the Board to delay consideration of a claim while waiting for the claimant to obtain the legal authority to pursue it would defeat the statutory goal of prompt settlement.\u201d Id. \n \nWe recently revisited the issue in McFadden v. Department of Transportation, 877 N.W.2d 119, 120 (Iowa 2016). There, like in Voss, the claimant did not attach evidence of her appointment as administrator of her husband's estate to her board claim form when bringing a claim for his wrongful death. See id. However, the claimant in McFadden, unlike the claimant in Voss, was in fact the administrator at the time she presented the claim. See id. Thus, she was entitled to bring the claim; she simply failed to attach the proof. See id. at 122. The state argued board rules, specifically 1.3(3), required the claimant to disclose her representative capacity. See id. at 123 (citing Iowa Admin. Code r. 543\u20141.3(3)). We balanced two competing principles: \u201cOur legal processes normally strive to resolve disputes on their merits,\u201d and \u201c[r]ules, especially those which fix jurisdictional matters, are \u2024 vital to the proper conduct of court business.\u201d Id. at 121 (first quoting MC Holdings, L.L.C. v. Davis Cty. Bd. of Review, 830 N.W.2d 325, 328 (Iowa 2013); then quoting Gordon v. Doden, 261 Iowa 285, 288\u201389, 154 N.W.2d 146, 148 (1967) (alteration in original)). We found the former consideration prevailed, quoting, \u201c[R]ights must not be denied by too strict an application of mere legal formality.\u201d Id. at 123 (quoting McMillan v. Osterson, 191 Iowa 983, 985, 183 N.W. 487, 488 (1921)). Thus, we concluded, \u201cThe appeal board's rules and claim form did not require [the claimant] to allege her representative capacity in presenting the tort claim in this case.\u201d Id. \n \nThese two competing principles present themselves again. There is no question the Seguras failed to comply with the administrative rules prescribing the form of claims; they did not personally sign their claim forms. 2 However, the State does not assert this failure hindered its ability to investigate the claim, stating \u201c[h]ow the Board dealt with [the Seguras'] improperly filed tort claims before denying the claims is irrelevant.\u201d Indeed, the board appeared to have the necessary information to handle the claim as it ultimately denied it \u201cafter considering the facts and circumstances forming the basis of [the] claim and the applicable law.\u201d Schneider, 789 N.W.2d at 146 n.8 (finding the board's use of this language showed \u201cthe board's explanation for the denial of the claims appears to have rested on liability considerations rather than the plaintiffs' failure to sufficiently document their claims\u201d). We are thus called upon to answer a question previously unaddressed: Did the legislature vest the board with the authority to deprive the courts of jurisdiction? \n \nB. Application to the Seguras' Claims. We begin by reaffirming a concept we have consistently applied: Exhaustion is a jurisdictional prerequisite under our interpretation of the ITCA. See McFadden, 877 N.W.2d at 122 (\u201cExhaustion of the administrative process is jurisdictional, and a suit commenced without complying with this process is subject to dismissal.\u201d (quoting Swanger, 445 N.W.2d at 347)); Feltes, 385 N.W.2d at 547 (\u201c[W]hen an area or subcategory is excepted from the waiver, it is still covered by sovereign immunity, and consequently, the courts have no jurisdiction.\u201d); Charles Gabus Ford, 224 N.W.2d at 648 (\u201c[T]he State Appeal Board has \u2018primary\u2019 or \u2018exclusive\u2019 jurisdiction of tort claims against the State.\u201d); see also Bennett, 17 Drake L. Rev. at 192 (\u201cIt seems obvious that the exhaustion of the administrative process is jurisdictional, and a suit commenced without complying therewith is subject to dismissal.\u201d). Under Iowa law it is well established the district court does not have jurisdiction to hear a tort claim against the state until it has been presented, properly, to the board. See Voss, 553 N.W.2d at 880; Charles Gabus Ford, 224 N.W.2d at 648. We also recognize that jurisdictional matters must be carefully construed. See McFadden, 877 N.W.2d at 121. If the Seguras failed to exhaust their administrative remedies by improperly presenting their claim, the district court was correct to determine it lacked jurisdiction. Voss, 553 N.W.2d at 880 (\u201cImproper presentment of a claim, or not presenting one at all, has been considered a failure to exhaust one's administrative remedies, depriving the district court of subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d). \n \nOur polestar is legislative intent. See id. \u201cIn construing a statute, we look to the object to be accomplished and give the statute a meaning that will effectuate, rather than defeat, that object.\u201d Id. We have previously held the legislative intent in creating the administrative process under chapter 669 was \u201cto allow a prompt investigation of claims against the State and facilitate an early settlement when possible.\u201d Id. at 881. The exhaustion requirement furthers this purpose. See Schneider, 789 N.W.2d at 145 (\u201cWe have noted that the doctrine requiring a plaintiff to exhaust administrative remedies \u2018is designed to promote orderly procedures within the judicial system by requiring a preliminary administrative sifting process.\u2019\u2009\u201d (quoting Charles Gabus Ford, 224 N.W.2d at 648)). And, obviously, the legislature delegated some authority to allow the functioning of this investigation and settlement process. See Iowa Code § 669.3(3). However, while exhaustion of administrative remedies is a jurisdictional prerequisite, and our legislature clearly intended this process be governed by administrative rule, we have not held the legislature intended to delegate the authority to set the jurisdiction of our courts. \n \nAs noted above, the source of the presentment requirement is Iowa Code section 669.5. See Feltes, 385 N.W.2d at 547. Section 669.5 does not delegate administrative authority. See generally Iowa Code § 669.5(1)\u2013(2). Rather, the board's authority comes from section 669.3. See id. § 669.3(3). Section 669.3 governs claims processing and gives the board the authority to \u201cadopt rules and procedures for the handling, processing, and investigation of claims.\u201d Id. This delegation does not say \u201cfor the presentment of claims,\u201d but \u201cfor the handling, processing, and investigation of claims.\u201d This indicates the legislature only intended to delegate the authority to promulgate rules necessary to investigate and settle claims, not to govern their initial presentment for exhaustion under section 669.5. See Thomas v. Gavin, 838 N.W.2d 518, 524 (Iowa 2013) (noting the statutory construction rule of expressio unius est exclusio alterius). Any statements to the contrary in our precedent are distinguishable on this point. McGruder merely stands for the proposition that sections of the ITCA may work in harmony\u2014that a claim is not properly presented until the board receives it. See 420 N.W.2d at 426. This is not controlled by administrative rule but by statute. See id. Nor does our statement in Swanger, \u201ctort claims are \u2018made\u2019 \u2024 when the prescribed forms are properly filed,\u201d control. 445 N.W.2d at 351. Section 669.5 requires the claim be made in writing. See Iowa Code § 669.5. In Swanger, the claimant asserted it was made by mere statements in a deposition. See 445 N.W.2d at 351. \n \nWe can also look to the principles of exhaustion to support this conclusion. See Charles Gabus Ford, 224 N.W.2d at 648. Exhaustion under section 669.5 requires a claim be made in writing so that the attorney general has the opportunity to make a final disposition of the claim. See Iowa Code § 669.5(1). The administrative process cannot \u201cr[u]n its course\u201d absent key information. Schneider, 789 N.W.2d at 146. A signature, made in the presence of a notary and filed in triplicate, is not key information to the disposition of a claim. Cf. Iowa Admin. Code r. 543\u20141.3(1)\u2013(3). These requirements, just like the additional requirements of the claimant's address, telephone number, and age, are more appropriately characterized as claims-processing rules. See id. Thus, they are appropriately promulgated pursuant to the delegation to adopt rules governing handling and processing, but they are not rules governing presentment. The failure to comply with these administrative rules alone should not deprive a district court of jurisdiction. \n \nThe State argues this court's opinion in Voss controls. The claim in Voss was not barred because the claimant failed to comply with an administrative rule; the claim was barred because the claimant did not have the capacity to bring it. See 553 N.W.2d at 880, 882 (\u201cIt is \u2018an elementary rule of law\u2019 that a plaintiff must have the capacity to sue in order to commence and maintain an action in district court.\u201d (quoting Dumbaugh v. Cascade Mfg. Co., 264 N.W.2d 763, 765 (Iowa 1978))). When a claimant has the capacity, even if they do not attach proof with their initial claim, the claim is not barred. See McFadden, 877 N.W.2d 122. There is no allegation Paula Segura lacks the capacity to bring her medical malpractice claim, nor is there an allegation Ricardo Segura lacks the capacity to bring his loss-of-consortium claim. The holding of Voss simply does not apply to an attorney's ability to bring a claim on behalf of his or her clients, the true claimants. Iowa Code section 602.10114(1) authorizes an attorney to \u201c[e]xecute in the name of a client a bond, or other written instrument, necessary and proper for the prosecution of an action or proceeding about to be or already commenced.\u201d See Iowa Code § 602.10114(1) (emphasis added). So, too, do our rules of civil procedure. See Iowa R. Civ. P. 1.411(1) (\u201cEach appearance, notice, motion, or pleading \u2024 shall bear the signature \u2024 of the party or attorney filing it.\u201d (Emphasis added.)). If there was any doubt, the Seguras dispelled it by filing affidavits stating Bernstein had the authority to bring their claims. Thus, Voss is inapplicable. \n \nWe find the administrative regulations promulgated under section 669.3 do not define the jurisdictional ambit of the presentment requirement under section 669.5. Instead, a claim is properly presented when it, in writing, identifies sufficient information for the board to investigate the claim and discloses the amount of damages claimed. We reach this finding by applying our rules of statutory construction, relying on the underlying principles of the exhaustion requirement, and building on our existing precedent. We note, however, that this view is consistent with the vast majority of federal courts interpreting the FTCA; these courts similarly distinguish between presentment under 28 U.S.C. § 2675(a) and claims processing under 28 U.S.C. § 2672. 3 See GAF Corp. v. United States, 818 F.2d 901, 918\u201319 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (\u201cThus we hold, with the Ninth Circuit and the majority of appellate courts to have considered the question, that Section 2675(a) requires a claimant to file (1) a written statement sufficiently describing the injury to enable the agency to begin its own investigation, and (2) a sum-certain damages claim.\u201d); see also Lopez v. United States, 823 F.3d 970, 976 (10th Cir. 2016) (same); Pleasant v. United States, 764 F.3d 445, 448 (5th Cir. 2014) (same); Blair v. IRS, 304 F.3d 861, 865 (9th Cir. 2002) (same); Santiago-Ramirez v. Sec'y of Dep't of Def., 984 F.2d 16, 19 (1st Cir. 1993) (same); Conn v. United States, 867 F.2d 916, 918\u201319 (6th Cir. 1989) (same); Tidd v. United States, 786 F.2d 1565, 1567 (11th Cir. 1986) (same); Tucker v. U.S. Postal Serv., 676 F.2d 954, 959 (3d Cir. 1982) (same). Section 2672 authorizes the Attorney General to adopt rules that allow the relevant federal agency to \u201cconsider, ascertain, adjust, determine, compromise, and settle any claim.\u201d 28 U.S.C. § 2672 (2012). But the jurisdictional requirement of presentment and exhaustion appears to be from § 2675, which does not contain a similar delegation of authority. See 28 U.S.C. § 2675. Accordingly, federal courts hold \u201cthis means [a court] must distinguish between the presentment filing mandated by Section 2675(a) and the settlement procedures of Section 2672.\u201d GAF Corp., 818 F.2d at 918\u201319 (\u201cPresentment is mandatory; settlement is merely optional.\u201d This distinction is crucial for courts called upon to determine their jurisdiction to hear claims under the [FTCA].\u201d). We look to these federal decisions not to conform our interpretation of the ITCA to their interpretation of the FTCA, but merely for persuasive guidance on ambiguous provisions of similar law, as we have often done. See, e.g., Feltes, 385 N.W.2d at 547 n.5 (comparing now-section 669.5 with 28 U.S.C. § 2675(a)); see also Voss, 553 N.W.2d at 881 n.2 (noting we may \u201clook to the Federal Tort Claims Act and federal cases for guidance in interpreting the Iowa Tort Claims Act\u201d). \n \nWe hold today that the information we described in Schneider is sufficient to present a claim under the ITCA. See 789 N.W.2d at 144. A claimant presents a claim when the board receives a writing that \u201cdisclose[s] the amount of\u201d damages claimed and \u201cgenerally describe[s] the legal theories asserted against the State.\u201d Id.; see also Iowa Code § 669.5. This should give the board sufficient information to investigate the claim, which is all that is required for the administrative process to run its course. See Schneider, 789 N.W.2d at 145\u201346. To facilitate this process, the board is vested with the authority to demand additional information under Iowa Code section 669.3(3). Indeed, it has promulgated rules empowering the special attorney general investigating the claim to administer oaths, take testimony in affidavits, depositions, or interrogatories, and even subpoena witnesses. See Iowa Admin. Code r. 543\u20141.7. If the board finds the claim form lacks a signature, verification, or any other piece of information it requires under its regulations, it can demand it. However, the administrative rules prescribing the form and content of claims do not operate as a jurisdictional bar to suit if the claim is properly presented and six months pass or the attorney general makes a final disposition. See Iowa Code § 669.5(1). \n \nApplied to the Seguras' claims, they identified the underlying facts of their causes of action\u2009 4 and asserted a claim for damages. They even identified witnesses. There is no allegation the board lacked sufficient information to investigate the claim, and in fact, it appears to have done so. Thus, the Seguras presented their claim, the administrative process ran its course, and they may now proceed before the district court. \n \nIV. Conclusion. \n \nWe conclude the district court had jurisdiction to hear the Seguras' claims. This result is consistent with the ITCA's text and its purpose of \u201cdoing substantial justice.\u201d See id. § 669.9 (\u201cWith a view to doing substantial justice, the attorney general is authorized to compromise or settle any suit permitted under this chapter \u2024\u201d); Graham, 259 Iowa at 853, 146 N.W.2d at 632 (\u201cThe self-evident purpose of the [ITCA] is to provide an orderly method by which to compensate those tortiously damaged by any officer, agent or employee of the state \u2024\u201d). It is consistent with our precedent. See McFadden, 877 N.W.2d at 123 (\u201c[R]ights must not be denied by too strict an application of mere legal formality.\u201d (quoting McMillan, 191 Iowa at 985, 183 N.W. at 488)). It is consistent with the apparent legislative intent, and it is even consistent with the analogous approach of most federal courts. See Mader v. United States, 654 F.3d 794, 810 (8th Cir. 2011) (Bye, J., dissenting) (noting \u201cthe judicial consensus is that section 2675 mandates only \u2018minimal notice\u2019\u2009\u201d); Feltes, 385 N.W.2d at 547 (identifying now-section 669.5 as the source of the exhaustion requirement). An alternative holding would deny the Seguras the right to be heard solely because of a state appeal board rule the board never attempted to enforce. The Seguras' completed claim forms sufficiently presented their claims to the board by enabling it to investigate them, which it apparently did. See Schneider, 789 N.W.2d at 146 n.8. If the board requires a signature while investigating a future claim, it can request it during the six months in which it has exclusive jurisdiction. See Iowa Code § 669.3(3); Iowa Admin. R. 543\u20141.7; Charles Gabus Ford, 224 N.W.2d at 648. This approach accommodates the board's right to obtain relevant information and verification without barring potentially meritorious claims based on initial noncompliance. Accordingly, we remand this case for further proceedings on its merits. \n \nDECISION OF COURT OF APPEALS VACATED; DISTRICT COURT JUDGMENT REVERSED AND CASE REMANDED. \n \nI agree with the majority that an administrative agency's rule cannot divest our courts of jurisdiction over a tort claim. However, the court does not have to reach that issue because I would find the Seguras complied with the requirements of the Iowa Tort Claims Act (ITCA) by applying Iowa Code section 602.10114 (2013) and find that the district court had jurisdiction of this matter. \n \nThe State takes the position that because its rules require the signature of the client, a tort claim form filed without the client's signature or a power of attorney giving the attorney the power to sign the claim form divests the courts of jurisdiction. Our statutes do not support this claim. \n \nThe Code provides how a person makes a claim under the ITCA. Specifically, \n \na claim or suit otherwise permitted under this chapter shall be forever barred, unless within two years after the claim accrued, the claim is made in writing and filed with the director of the department of management under this chapter. \n \nIowa Code § 669.13(1). Thus, the Code only requires the person filing the claim to file it in writing with the department of management within a specified time. Chapter 669 of the Code does not contain any provision as to who has to sign the claim. \n \nAnother section of the Code allows an attorney to file a claim in a proceeding, without the necessity of the client's signatures. The Code gives an attorney the power to \n \n[e]xecute in the name of a client a bond, or other written instrument, necessary and proper for the prosecution of an action or proceeding about to be or already commenced, or for the prosecution or defense of any right growing out of an action, proceeding, or final judgment rendered therein. \n \nId. § 602.10114. Therefore, when the Code requires a party to file a written document in a proceeding, an attorney has the authority of his or her client to sign the document. \n \nThe State enacted an administrative rule stating, \n \nAll claims should be typewritten, but claims printed by hand will be accepted if legible. \n \n1.3(1) Place of filing. Claims shall be filed in triplicate with the Department of Management, State Capitol, Des Moines, Iowa 50319. \n \n1.3(2) Verification. Claims shall be verified. \n \n1.3(3) Names and signatures. A claim shall state thereon the name, address, telephone number, and age of the person making the claim and the name, address and telephone number of the attorney, if any, preparing the claim, and their signatures. \n \n1.3(4) Designation by number. The executive secretary shall assign a number to each claim. Thereafter it may be referred to by such a number. \n \nIowa Admin. Code r. 543\u20141.3. \n \nThe signature boxes of the claim forms filed by Paula Segura and Ricardo Segura were signed as follows: \n \nI, the claimant, being duly sworn upon oath depose and state that I have read the supplied information and the same is true and correct to the best of my belief. \n \nS/Paula Segura by attorney Bernstein per POA. \n \nI, the claimant, being duly sworn upon oath depose and state that I have read the supplied information and the same is true and correct to the best of my belief. \n \nS/Ricardo Segura by attorney Bernstein per POA. \n \nIn its brief, the State claims the tort claim forms were defective because \u201c[a] power of attorney document did not accompany either claim.\u201d The State's argument in this regard was \n \nAttorney Bernstein was not permitted to sign the Seguras' names on their tort claims without valid powers of attorney. He was certainly not permitted to sign the Seguras' names under oath without valid powers of attorney. Attorney Bernstein failed to procure such powers of attorney. Paula Segura and Ricardo Segura were thus required to sign and verify their respective tort claims, and they did not. As a result, the Seguras failed to comply with the procedural requirements of the ITCA, and their tort claims were not properly filed. \n \nThis argument makes it clear that the State acknowledges a signature on a tort claim form signed by someone other than the claimant is allowed under the Act as long as he or she has the power to do so. Section 602.10114 gave attorney Bernstien the authority to sign the claim forms on behalf of the Seguras when Bernstein submitted the forms to the department of management. I can find no authority that an administrative rule can require additional action by a party to confer jurisdiction on the court when that action is not required by the statute. 5 \n \nI would thus conclude attorney Bernstein's signatures on behalf of the Seguras on the tort claim forms complied with the Code and the rule. First, a notary verified the claim forms. Second, they contained the names of the claimants, and the Seguras' attorney signed the forms on the claimants' behalf by a power of attorney. Third, section 602.10114 gives the attorney the power of attorney to sign the documents on the Seguras' behalf. \n \nAccordingly, I would find jurisdiction. \n \nI respectfully dissent. Under the court's decision, the State will no longer be able to insist upon signed claims, let alone verified ones. In my view, the court has disregarded clear language in chapter 669 and the Iowa Administrative Code, while uprooting established caselaw. All this is being done to bring to life a claim that the attorney likely knew was noncompliant when he submitted it. \n \nThis case involves alleged medical malpractice that occurred at the University of Iowa Hospitals on May 12, 2009. As early as April 2010, the Seguras were in contact with their present attorney. However, no claim was filed with the State until over a year later. \n \nIowa Code section 669.3 provides: \n \n1. The attorney general, on behalf of the state of Iowa, shall consider, ascertain, adjust, compromise, settle, determine, and allow any claim that is subject to this chapter. \n \n2. A claim made under this chapter shall be filed with the director of the department of management, who shall acknowledge receipt on behalf of the state. \n \n3. The state appeal board shall adopt rules and procedures for the handling, processing, and investigation of claims, in accordance with chapter 17A. \n \nIowa Code § 669.3 (2013). \n \nThe applicable rules adopted by the state appeal board (board) under the authority of subsection 3 provide: \n \nAll claims should be typewritten, but claims printed by hand will be accepted if legible. \n \n1.3(1) Place of filing. Claims shall be filed in triplicate with the Department of Management, State Capitol, Des Moines, Iowa 50319. \n \n1.3(2) Verification. Claims shall be verified. \n \n1.3(3) Names and signatures. A claim shall state thereon the name, address, telephone number, and age of the person making the claim and the name, address and telephone number of the attorney, if any, preparing the claim, and their signatures. \n \n1.3(4) Designation by number. The executive secretary shall assign a number to each claim. Thereafter it may be referred to by such a number. \n \nIowa Admin. Code r. 543\u20141.3. Notably, these rules require that \u201c[c]laims shall be verified.\u201d Id. \n \nThe board's one-page claim form is not complicated or difficult to follow. There are sections for information about the claimant and for information on the claim itself. At the bottom of the page, consistent with the board's rules, there is a space for \u201cCLAIMANT'S SIGNATURE.\u201d Right above the signature space the form states, \u201cI, the claimant, being duly sworn upon oath depose and state that I have read the supplied information and the same is true and correct to the best of my belief.\u201d In addition, at the top of the one-page form, the directions state, \u201cCLAIMANT and NOTARY public must sign.\u201d \n \nNeither of the Seguras signed the form. Instead, their attorney signed the forms in the space for \u201cCLAIMANT'S SIGNATURE.\u201d He added the handwritten notation: \u201cby attorney \u2024 per POA.\u201d \u201cPOA\u201d of course is short for \u201cpower of attorney.\u201d \n \nIn reality, the Seguras' attorney had no powers of attorney. See Iowa Code § 633B.102(9) (\u201c\u2009\u2018Power of attorney\u2019 means a writing that grants authority to an agent to act in the place of the principal, whether or not the term \u2018power of attorney\u2019 is used.\u201d). Arguably, the attorney could have been admonished for this misstatement. Regardless, the claim was clearly not verified by the claimant as required by rule 543\u20141.3. Indeed, the majority concedes this point. 6 \n \nThe verification requirement is not some trifling technicality. When the State waives sovereign immunity to allow claims against it, the State is entitled to insist that the claim be backed by the claimant's oath as an assurance of its reliability. See id. § 669.4 (\u201cThe immunity of the state from suit and liability is waived to the extent provided in this chapter.\u201d (Emphasis added.)); accord Rivera v. Woodward Res. Ctr., 830 N.W.2d 724, 727 (Iowa 2013) (recognizing that \u201ccompliance with an administrative scheme\u201d is \u201c[o]ne of the most prominent conditions interposed by the ITCA\u201d). After all, the Internal Revenue Code requires that tax returns be verified, see 26 U.S.C. § 6065 (2012), insurance companies typically require that insurance claims be verified, and we require verifications under our own rules in a variety of situations, see, e.g., Iowa R. Civ. P. 1.405(4) (denial of signature); id. r. 1.509(1)(c) (interrogatory answers); id. r. 1.1502(1) (application for temporary injunction); id. r. 1.1901-Form 16 (expedited civil action certification). Here, because the Seguras' claims were not verified, the Seguras were not bound under penalty of perjury to anything the claim forms said. 7 \n \nTo sum up: The statute specifically empowers the board to adopt rules for what a claim must contain. See Iowa Code § 669.3(3). The board did so. See Iowa Admin. Code r. 543\u20141.3. The Seguras' claims failed to comply with those rules in a material way. As the majority puts it, \u201cThere is no question the Seguras failed to comply with the administrative rules prescribing the form of claims \u2024\u201d \n \nThe majority excuses this noncompliance by determining the board lacked authority to issue its longstanding administrative rules. The majority says that Iowa Code section 669.3(3) only authorizes the board to promulgate rules \u201cfor the handling, processing, and investigation of claims,\u201d and not \u201cfor the presentment of claims\u201d\u2014as if the two are distinguishable. \n \nI don't follow this argument. In my view, language authorizing the board to issue rules for the \u201chandling\u201d and \u201cprocessing\u201d of claims empowers the board to adopt a rule stating a claim must be signed under oath by the claimant. We previously said so in Swanger v. State: \n \nSection 25A.3 [now section 669.3] further empowers the appeal board to adopt rules and procedures for handling and processing claims. Pursuant to its rule-making authority, the state appeal board has prescribed the form and content of tort claims. Tort claims before the appeal board, for example, must be verified and signed by the claimant, filed with the department of management at Des Moines, and must describe the accident, injuries and claims in detail. \n \n445 N.W.2d 344, 350 (Iowa 1989) (citation omitted). In other words, in Swanger, we cited the verification requirement as one example of a requirement the board has prescribed \u201c[p]ursuant to its rule-making authority [in section 669.3].\u201d Id. Today's decision now tosses aside this language from Swanger. \n \nOf course, we are entitled to change our minds. But why would we do so here? It would be impossible to have an orderly system for the \u201cprocessing\u201d and \u201chandling\u201d of claims without some minimum criteria for what a claim must contain. Indeed, the court adopts minimum standards of its own\u2014they just happen to be different from the board's requirements as set forth in its regulations. \n \nThe court does not dispute that the proper presentment of a claim is a jurisdictional prerequisite to bringing a lawsuit under the Iowa Tort Claims Act (ITCA). See In re Estate of Voss, 553 N.W.2d 878, 880 (Iowa 1996) (\u201cImproper presentment of a claim, or not presenting one at all, has been considered a failure to exhaust one's administrative remedies, depriving the district court of subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d). The disagreement is essentially over who gets to decide the contents of a claim. Is it (1) the justices of this court, or (2) the board through its duly promulgated regulations? I think the legislature delegated the matter to the board in Iowa Code section 669.3(3)\u2014not to us. \n \nToday's decision is also at odds with Voss. Voss arose out of a fatal automobile accident where the State was allegedly at fault. See id. at 879. The deceased's mother signed the claim as the claimant but had not yet been appointed administrator of her son's estate. Id. We held that such a claim was insufficient: \n \nObviously, settlement of claims is greatly facilitated if the person making the claim is the person entitled to any recovery and has the authority to settle. \n \n\u2024 [A] claim is defective if it is not made by a claimant to whom the State would be liable for the damages sought. \n \nId. at 881. This case presents the same circumstances, practically speaking. The person who actually made the claim was the Seguras' attorney, who would not have been entitled to the recovery or authorized to settle the claim. \n \nVoss emphasizes that the claim-filing requirements are supposed to eliminate \u201c[t]he filing of multiple claims\u201d and to save the State from having to wait for a claimant \u201cto obtain the legal authority to pursue\u201d a claim that has been filed. Id. at 881\u201382. Today these justifications vanish, and this aspect of Voss is effectively overruled. In its stead, the majority holds that a valid claim need only \u201cidentif[y] sufficient information for the board to investigate the claim and disclose[\u2009] the amount of damages claimed.\u201d By this minimal standard, practically any piece of paper will do. The court thus shifts time, burden, and expense from the claimant to the State. And it does so despite the clear language of Iowa Code section 669.3(3) and the board's administrative rules, not to mention the principle of a limited waiver of sovereign immunity. \n \nThe court relies on Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) precedent, but this reliance is flawed at its inception because of differences in the two statutes. We generally say that we are \u201cguided by interpretations of the FTCA, which was the model for the ITCA, when the wording of the two Acts is identical or similar.\u201d Thomas v. Gavin, 838 N.W.2d 518, 525 (Iowa 2013) (emphasis added); see Smith v. Iowa State Univ. of Sci. & Tech., 851 N.W.2d 1, 21 (Iowa 2014); Minor v. State, 819 N.W.2d 383, 406 & n.10 (Iowa 2012); see also Godfrey v. State, 847 N.W.2d 578, 584 (Iowa 2014) (comparing section 669.5(2)(a) to similarly worded federal law). Here the wording of the two Acts is not identical or similar. \n \nUnlike Iowa law, the FTCA requires only that \u201cthe claimant shall have first presented the claim to the appropriate Federal agency.\u201d 28 U.S.C. § 2675(a) (emphasis added). By contrast, Iowa Code section 669.3 requires the attorney general to \u201cconsider, ascertain, adjust, compromise, settle, determine, and allow any claim\u201d and also requires the board to \u201cadopt rules and procedures for the handling, processing, and investigation of claims.\u201d Iowa Code § 669.3(1), (3). In both instances, section 669.3 uses the mandatory term \u201cshall\u201d with respect to these requirements. Id. \n \nFederal courts interpreting the FTCA have accordingly held that Department of Justice regulations \u201cwhich flesh out the requirements for the presentation of administrative claims for settlement\u201d are not jurisdictionally binding because 28 U.S.C. § 2675 only mandates pre-suit notice. See Santiago-Ramirez v. Sec'y of Dep't of Def., 984 F.2d 16, 19\u201320 (1st Cir. 1993) (\u201c[T]his circuit has followed the general shift among all circuits toward a recognition of the distinction between presenting a claim in a section 2675 context and presenting a claim for settlement.\u201d); Tucker v. U.S. Postal Serv., 676 F.2d 954, 957 (3d Cir. 1982) (\u201cThe question whether a plaintiff has presented the requisite section 2675 notice is determined without reference to whether that plaintiff has complied with all settlement related requests for information.\u201d). That is because the FTCA does not require or even authorize the government to adopt rules for the \u201chandling\u201d and \u201cprocessing\u201d of claims. \n \nOur statutory scheme, on the other hand, mandates more than giving the State perfunctory notice. It is designed to facilitate prompt settlement, as we held in Voss. See 553 N.W.2d at 880\u201381 (\u201cA requirement the claimant possess the capacity to sue is \u2024 intended to allow a prompt investigation of claims against the State and facilitate an early settlement when possible.\u201d). Whether or not the Seguras' claims would have passed FTCA muster is therefore irrelevant. See, e.g., Griffen v. State, 767 N.W.2d 633, 635\u201336 (Iowa 2009) (rejecting an interpretation of the FTCA as \u201cnot applicable to the ITCA\u201d when language in the Acts differ). \n \nThe majority also suggests today's decision is supported by Schneider v. State, 789 N.W.2d 138 (Iowa 2010). I respectfully disagree. In that case, \u201c[e]ach of the plaintiffs \u2024 filed an administrative claim on a form promulgated by the appeal board.\u201d Id. at 145. There was no issue raised as to whether the claims met the formal requirements of Iowa Administrative Code rule 543\u20141.3. See id. Rather, the question we had to decide was \u201cwhether those plaintiffs who thereafter declined the board's request for additional documentation failed to exhaust the available administrative remedy and thereby deprived the district court of subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d Id. We noted, \n \nAlthough some of the plaintiffs failed to submit any documentation to augment their administrative claim forms, and others submitted documentation the State's claims manager deemed conclusory, each of the challenged claims disclosed the type of claim (tort) asserted, stated the amount of property damage claimed, and provided a general statement of the relevant legal theory supporting it. \n \nId. And we said that was enough. Id. at 146. \n \nSchneider thus involved the different question of how much detail must be provided on behalf of a claim that is presumably verified and already complied with the board's other requirements as to form. See id. (\u201cUnder these circumstances, we conclude the board had available to it the information it believed it needed to make its administrative determination.\u201d). \n \nThe majority also states that the board \u201cnever attempted to enforce\u201d the verification requirement. This assertion is unfair to the board. At the administrative level, the board denied the claims without giving a reason. The board didn't know for a fact no powers of attorney existed until the case reached the district court. That is when the State served a document request, asking for the powers of attorney. The Seguras' attorney refused to respond to the request, raising a frivolous objection that the request violated the attorney\u2013client privilege. Finally, after a motion to compel had been filed, counsel admitted there were no powers of attorney in a district court hearing. If anyone was giving somebody the runaround, it was the Seguras' attorney and not the State. \n \nWhile it might be desirable in the abstract to \u201caccommodate[\u2009]\u201d the interests of the Seguras and the State, as the majority puts it, that is not our role. \u201cThe State may \u2024 be sued in tort, but only in the manner and to the extent to which consent has been given by the legislature.\u201d Swanger, 445 N.W.2d at 346. \n \nLastly, let me add some observations regarding the special concurrence. The special concurrence first argues that Iowa Code section 669.13 only requires \u201cthe person filing the claim to file it in writing with the department of management within a specified time.\u201d That is not an accurate paraphrasing of the statute. Section 669.13 bars the claim unless it was timely filed in writing with the department of management \u201cunder this chapter.\u201d Iowa Code § 669.13(1) (emphasis added). \u201cUnder this chapter\u201d means the filer has to comply with the filing requirements of this chapter, which are set forth in section 669.3 and the corresponding administrative rules. The special concurrence reads the phrase \u201cunder this chapter\u201d out of the statute. \n \nAlternatively, the special concurrence argues that another law, Iowa Code section 602.10114, overrides section 669.3 and the board's administrative rule requiring signature and verification by the claimant. Section 602.10114 dates back to our early statehood days and provides, \n \nAn attorney and counselor has power to: \n \n1. Execute in the name of a client a bond, or other written instrument, necessary and proper for the prosecution of an action or proceeding about to be or already commenced, or for the prosecution or defense of any right growing out of an action, proceeding, or final judgment rendered therein. \n \nIowa Code § 602.10114(1). \n \nAccording to the special concurrence, section 602.10114 empowers an attorney at all times to sign any litigation-related paper on the client's behalf. If this were true, it would invalidate any other instance where a statute or rule requires client verification or client signature. \n \nIt isn't true. This statute has been interpreted as giving the attorney authority to execute papers on the client's behalf unless another law provides otherwise. See Cassady v. Mott, 203 Iowa 17, 19, 212 N.W. 332, 333 (1927) (quoting this statute and finding that an attorney could sign notices of forfeiture after noting that the forfeiture law \u201cdoes not in terms require that the notice of forfeiture must be signed in person by the parties\u201d); In re Oldfield's Estate, 158 Iowa 98, 103\u201304, 138 N.W. 846, 848\u201349 (1912) (indicating that this statute allows the attorney to sign the notice of appeal for the appellant \u201cwhere there is no statutory requirement otherwise\u201d); see also Iowa Code § 4.7 (resolving a conflict between a general provision and an irreconcilable special provision in favor of the special provision). Here Iowa Code section 669.3 and rule 543\u20141.3 provide otherwise. \n \nFor the foregoing reasons, I would affirm the judgment of the district court and the decision of the court of appeals. \n \nWaterman, J., joins this dissent. \n \nFOOTNOTES \n \n1 .  \u2003As follows:Paula D. Segura was hospitalized at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, Iowa City, Iowa on May 12, 2009 complaining of epigastric pain.

Because of this, Ms. Segura's left lower extremity is paralyzed. \n \n2 .  \u2003We acknowledge Iowa Code section 602.10114 gives an attorney the power to sign litigation documents in the name of a client. However, this general power would not necessarily trump a specific requirement for a party to sign a document. See, e.g., Iowa Code § 86.13(3) (authorizing settlement of workers' compensation claim \u201conly if [the agreement is] signed by all parties and approved by the workers' compensation commissioner\u201d); id. § 507C.36(1)(g) (requiring in certain insurance matter proof of claim be \u201csigned by the claimant\u201d and include \u201c[t]he name and address of the claimant and the attorney who represents the claimant, if any\u201d); id. § 809.3(3) (requiring an application for the return of seized property \u201cbe signed by the claimant under penalty of perjury\u201d). Because we resolve this case on other grounds, we need not reach this issue. See, e.g., Jones v. Univ. of Iowa, 836 N.W.2d 127, 142 (Iowa 2013) (declining to reach statutory construction and constitutional arguments when deciding case on other grounds). \n \n3 .  \u2003Even the one jurisdiction that expressly subscribes to the view that administrative regulations define the authority of the district court to hear the claim would likely allow this one to proceed. See Smoke Shop, LLC v. United States, 761 F.3d 779, 787 (7th Cir. 2014) (\u201cSo long as the proper agency had the opportunity to settle the claim for money damages before the point of suit, \u2024 technical deficiencies in the administrative claim could well be a case of \u2018[n]o harm, no foul.\u2019\u2009\u201d (quoting Kanar, 118 F.3d at 531)). \n \n4 .  \u2003Ricardo Segura's form expressly stated it was for loss of consortium. Paula Segura's form did not state \u201cmedical malpractice,\u201d but a reasonable reading of the facts it did state would reveal that is the claim presented. \n \n5 .  \u2003I also do not believe an agency can create a rule requiring a signature of a party to a document when the statute conferring jurisdiction on the court does not have the same requirement. See Auen v. Alcoholic Beverages Div., 679 N.W.2d 586, 590 (Iowa 2004) (holding an agency cannot change the meaning of a statute by writing a rule). However, neither the majority nor I need reach this issue because the State concedes that a power of attorney is sufficient to make the claim form valid. \n \n6 .  \u2003Given the court's opinion, from now on, nobody will need to sign the claim forms. \n \n7 .  \u2003We also require appellants in child-in-need-of-assistance and termination-of-parental-rights cases to personally sign the notice of appeal, even though a verification is not required. See, e.g., Iowa R. App. P. 6.102(1)(a) (\u201cThe notice of appeal cannot be filed unless signed by both the appellant's counsel and the appellant.\u201d) \n \nCADY, Chief Justice. \n \nAll justices concur except Wiggins, J., who concurs specially, and Mansfield and Waterman, JJ., who dissent.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"PAULA SEGURA RICARDO SEGURA v.

That is a ­Constitutional violation. See u in court.\u201d \n \nStephanie Grisham, a White House spokeswoman, said: \u201cThe high-risk territories are based on Congressional statute and ­nothing else.\u201d \n \nTrump has handed over management of his real estate, licensing and merchandising business to his sons to avoid the perception that he is making presidential decisions to boost his own business. \n \nAccording to the Washington Post, Trump has retained ownership of the ­company, meaning if it thrives during his presidency, he will profit. \n \nThe President\u2019s order makes no mention of Turkey, which has faced several terrorist attacks in recent months. \n \nThe State Department on Wednesday updated a travel warning for Americans visiting Turkey, noting that \u201can increase in anti-American rhetoric has the potential to inspire independent actors to carry out acts of violence against US citizens\u201d. \n \nTrump has licensed his name to two luxury towers in Istanbul.

What are telomeres and what happens to them as we age?\n\nIf you think of your chromosomes \u2013 which carry your genetic material \u2013 as shoelaces, telomeres are the little protective tips at the end. They are made of repeating short sequences of DNA sheathed in special proteins.\n\nDuring our lives they tend to wear down and when telomeres can\u2019t protect chromosomes properly, cells can\u2019t replenish and they malfunction. This sets up physiological changes in the body which increase risks of the major conditions and diseases of ageing: cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, a weakened immune system and more. But the process is somewhat malleable. It is happening in all of us at some rate, but the rate can change. An enzyme called telomerase can add DNA to the ends of chromosomes to slow, prevent and partially reverse the shortening.\n\nCan you delay or reverse ageing by taking care of your telomeres?\n\nWe all have health spans \u2013 the number of years we remain healthy, active and disease-free \u2013 and the shortening of our telomeres contributes to ageing and our entry from health span into disease span. But we can [do things that] effect our telomerase and telomeres, that can [delay] entry from health span to disease span. So we are talking more about keeping people healthier for longer and staving off some diseases of ageing. This is not about extreme life span extension \u2013 though of course staying healthier longer does have a reflection in mortality rates.\n\nIn the book you argue that to lengthen our telomeres, or at least stop them shortening, we need to improve our lifestyle by managing chronic stress, exercising, eating better and getting enough sleep. A lot of these things are recommended already \u2013 so what is new?\n\nPeople hadn\u2019t understood why at the cellular level the sorts of things that are recommended to improve lifestyle can help stave off disease. One reason is because they are helping you maintain telomeres. The book integrates a lot of new studies \u2013 from genetics, epidemiology and social science \u2013 that have been accumulating. We also provide a new biological underpinning to the mind-body connection. Nobody had any idea that meditation and the like, which people can use to reduce stress and increase wellbeing, would be having their salutary and well-documented useful effects in part through telomeres. The book is also recognising how much control we can have. Small tweaks in how you approach stress, for example, can lead to long-term habits that make a difference.\n\nHow meditation might ward off the effects of ageing Read more One of the criticisms of the book is that it is a bit glib. That ageing is too complicated to simply boil down to these entities at the end of chromosomes\u2026\n\nThis is one of many processes of ageing, and we say that. We are focusing on one mechanism which has relatively recently been recognised in humans and that we can have some control over.\n\nWhat exercise can help preserve our telomeres?\n\nThe good news is you don\u2019t have to go to the gym three hours a day or run a marathon a week. People who do moderate aerobic exercise \u2013 about three times a week for 45 minutes \u2013 have telomeres pretty much as long as marathon runners. Mixing things up seems to be good too. One study showed the more different kinds of exercise people did, the longer their telomeres. Many studies looking at people under severe chronic stress find their telomere shortness relates to how severely that stress is experienced. But that relationship seems particularly strong in sedentary people. Even 10-15 minutes of light exercise daily appeared, in one study, to buffer the effect.\n\nBeyond a balanced diet with lots of wholefoods such as vegetables, fruits and grains, should we be taking any supplements to lengthen our telomeres?\n\nHaving adequate omega-3 fatty acids really seems to relate to better telomere maintenance and the easiest way to ensure that may be a supplement. It is also in foods such as oily fish and flaxseeds. There is some data about vitamin D but the studies are somewhat incomplete. It is pretty clear that if people have a balance much more towards a wholefoods diet versus a diet high in processed foods, red meat, sugary drinks and highly refined white bread \u2013 again, all the things we know already are bad for our health \u2013 you see quantifiable effects on telomeres.\n\nAre marriage and children telomere-friendly?\n\nThere is a general trend for longer telomeres among married people or those with partners. But we have also studied women who were formerly in relationships where they were domestically abused. Their telomeres were shorter, and the amount they were shorter related quantitatively to the number of years they were in the relationship. It probably relates to the stress of being in a threatening situation for a long period of time. One preliminary study has suggested having children may help telomere health but it has not yet been independently repeated, so it is early days.\n\nCan this woman cure ageing with gene therapy? Read more How quickly can telomere length change?\n\nYou can see the effects of interventions in as little as a few months. But it is really the long-term changes, over periods of a year to 10 years, that are going to be predictive of increased health span.\n\nCommercial tests are available for telomere length, with prices in the US ranging from about $100 to $500. Should we all get our telomere lengths tested?\n\nThe answer is no. I see no harm in it, but it doesn\u2019t mean a whole lot. You could be long one year and short another year. We know enough about telomere maintenance from a lot of studies to know the kinds of things that we can and should do. You want to do them regardless of what the test said.\n\nHave you had your telomeres tested?\n\nI had them tested because I was part of a research study. It turned out I had long telomeres. But that can change, so that test result doesn\u2019t stop me from taking seriously these lessons I have learned from all the research. I do try to build these things into my life. I exercise, but I don\u2019t spend hours at the gym; I have a good diet, but am not fanatical about food; and I try to think about the effect of stress. I practice micro-meditations which I think help.\n\nThere are pills that, it is claimed, have telomere lengthening effects, and at least one US company is developing telomerase gene therapy with the aim of reversing ageing. Are they a good idea to take?\n\nThese are things that purport to increase telomerase activity, but they are very untested and the studies that have been done have only been done by those who actually market these products. There is a caution too because telomerase has a good side (lengthening telomeres) but it can also have a bad side. Higher levels of it are associated with higher risks of brain tumours, melanoma and non-smokers\u2019 lung cancers. Things like exercise, stress reduction and good diet, on the other hand, have never been shown to increase cancer risk, and indeed some studies show they decrease those risks.\n\nAfter your experience on President Bush\u2019s Council on Bioethics \u2013 you were kicked off in 2004, many think for your support of human embryonic stem cell research \u2013 how do you feel about ?We need to be active. I am the president of a scientific research institute [the Salk Institute in San Diego]. We have to keep making clear statements about what sorts of things are important principles \u2013 including that science works because there is real respect for the truth. I expect there is going to be a mass shortening of telomeres around the country related to the chronic severe stress that will be a consequence if a number of Trump\u2019s policies come to pass. There is a likelihood of all these very burdensome diseases of ageing going up. We are in for big individual and societal costs.\n\n\u2022 The Telomere Effect: A Revolutionary Approach to Living Younger, Healthier, Longer by Elizabeth Blackburn and Elissa Epel is published by Orion Spring (£14.99).

But how illuminating is it? A show about light: a light show \u2013 what might a curator put in? Just about all art concerned with making the world visible in some sense speaks of light, the very condition in which it was made. But an all-inclusive approach would be ridiculous, to be sure, so how about a show on light?\n\nYou could include Manet, who believed light was the main protagonist of any painting. You could put in Vermeer if you had the funds. You could look at the ever-changing effects of light in the art of Monet, or stuff the show with Constable, Turner and the American luminists, or blow your cash on a Caravaggio \u2013 or go the other way and show light art itself, from Dan Flavin to James Turrell. This is the besetting sin of theme shows: they put viewers into questioning mode, pondering what is and isn\u2019t relevant But the Towner Gallery hasn\u2019t gone this way at all. True, it has a small seascape by LS Lowry that is hardly lightsome in its turgid opacity. It also has a large Julian Opie sculpture that fuses one of Flavin\u2019s sublime neon works with a freezer cabinet in icily sinister pastiche. And Ceal Floyer has a bulb dangling from the ceiling that seems to emit an eerie blue glow (achieved by projectors) even though it\u2019s actually switched off.\n\nBy now it will be obvious that this is a conceptual event, multimedia, multifarious and intermittently tendentious. So there\u2019s the show itself to think of. The opening gallery is certainly all gorgeous radiance, generated by Cerith Wyn Evans\u2019s immense chandelier, flashing up a glumly obscure morse code message, to David Batchelor\u2019s marvellous cascade of coloured plastic bottles, each lit within like some abstract Christmas tree of the future. These lights send their reflections deep into Anish Kapoor\u2019s stainless steel void so that it looks more like a funhouse distorting mirror than an actual sculpture, playing subtly on voluminous depth. \u2018Gleaming wit\u2019: Gary Hume\u2019s Fragment of a Rainbow VI, 2011 at Towner, Eastbourne. Photograph: Pete Jones And there is the same lighting problem, so to speak, with Toby Ziegler\u2019s white on white painting, made in acrylic on polypropylene. Apparently we ought to be able to see Moorish columns, abstract designs and the extreme depth of field you get in computer games in its reflective surface. But what\u2019s mainly visible is the winking of Mark Titchner\u2019s wilfully hideous wool and lightbulb construction nearby. Gary Hume\u2019s Fragment of a Rainbow is a gleaming piece of wit: the colours of the spectrum all isolated in what appear to be massive, disembodied highlights of the shape one would normally find on a painted iris in a portrait, making the eye come alive. Red, green, yellow, blue and so on, these glossy panels carry their own reflections too: a triple play on light, and on the way we see light in art.\n\nAnd this is beautifully paired with an exquisite piece by Mark Garry that appears, at first, to be a beam of light passing at ceiling height between two galleries and then transforms into a light-splitting prism as you pass below. In fact it is nothing more than a sheaf of coloured threads stretched between two walls, affected by ambient air and the gallery spotlights. \u2018Voluminous depth\u2019: Untitled, 1995 by Anish Kapoor. Photograph: Pete Jones Here one sees how art makes poetry from science, specifically the behaviour of light. And there are other works here that take this even further, especially Garry Fabian Miller\u2019s beautiful experiments in the dark room, using light-sensitive paper but working entirely without a camera. Miller directs light, funnels it, and introduces liquids and filters to make what look like ethereal abstract paintings with some kind of nearly supernatural glow at their core.\n\nKatie Paterson\u2019s vast glitterball revolving between two projectors creates an ever-turning cosmos of stars gliding across the gallery walls. How far art has come from the static image\u2026 But each pinprick is the reflection of some miniscule image of a historic solar eclipse, 10,000 of them, reflecting the progression of an eclipse across the room. The vision is simple, rapturous, but the data is intensely complex.\n\nThere is some straight science here. Runa Islam\u2019s projection of a negative image flashes on for several seconds and then suddenly disappears, leaving a spectral positive of a woman\u2019s face on the mind\u2019s eye. This could be in the Science Museum, but at least it has something to do with light. It\u2019s pushing it to claim that Rachel Whiteread\u2019s resin cubes, cast from the spaces underneath chairs, are relevant in any way, still less Shirazeh Houshiary\u2019s modern reprise of Brancusi\u2019s Endless Column. As for John Riddy\u2019s show of a building in Barcelona, it has about as much to do with light as any pre-digital photograph. \u2018Spectral\u2019: Runa Islam\u2019s Stare Out (Blink), 1998. Photograph: © the artist This is the besetting sin of theme shows: they can put viewers into questioning mode, pondering what is and isn\u2019t relevant, how strong or weak the connections, what the entrance qualifications ought to be. This is no real way to look at art. Many shows rise high above this problem, but it is a test for viewer and curator alike, and particularly aggravated in this case.\n\nA year ago, the Arts Council announced that it had chosen four national partners to mount 24 \"must-see\" shows over three years, all derived from its massive collection. The partners were Yorkshire Sculpture Park, Birmingham Museums Trust, Liverpool\u2019s Walker Art Gallery and the Towner. The galleries get art and cash, the collection gets an England-wide airing and the public gets a glut of theme shows.\n\nAlthough it would be possible, in theory, to focus on solo artists such as Bridget Riley in which the collection is rich, or specific decades, or schools of art, nobody does it. So far it\u2019s been people, homes and the colour blue, with the decriminalisation of homosexuality to come. Not only are the curators limited to the collection, they are effectively in competition with each other. Hence, perhaps, the reliance on themes as a way of divvying up the art.\n\n\u2022 A Certain Kind of Light is at the Towner Art Gallery, Eastbourne until 7

That's something you've got to get through, the first 10-15 overs are crucial. With the line-up that we play, if we can have wickets in the shed at the back end then we will score a lot of runs at the end of the (innings).\" \n \nThe keeper found out the perils of taking on Eden Park's small boundaries when he played at the ground for the first time last February, caught at cow corner trying to heave Corey Anderson over the ropes. \n \nThe Australians were all out for 148 on that occasion, with the Black Caps' seamers running riot on the way to a 2-1 series win. It was a similar story a year earlier, with the Aussies skittled for 151 in a World Cup clash that the Kiwis only won by a wicket. \n \nAt the same time, Eden Park's unusual dimensions have resulted in big scores before. Although the tourists failed to pass 150 last time around, New Zealand posted a score of 8-307 in the same game. \n \nIndeed, before Australia's innings that day, seven of the last eight innings at the ground had gone past 280 runs. \n \n\"(The Eden Park pitch) just has a bit in it,\" New Zealand veteran Ross Taylor said. \"I don't think there is a par score, some wickets here are 300, some are 200. \n \n\"You just have to analyse it as quickly as possible, whether you're batting or bowling.\" \n \nThe Kiwis were trounced 3-0 in Australia when the sides met in December, but Wade is expecting a tougher time on New Zealand's turf. \n \n\"We played them in Australia (on) big grounds (with) long boundaries. It's a completely different ball game,\" he said. \n \n\"(On) the smaller grounds (in New Zealand) they'll still play aggressive; they're still going to be able to hit plenty of fours and sixes at grounds that they play at. \n \n\"They play well here (in NZ) and they play this venue very well. \n \n\"We like to think we're hard to beat in Australia and it's the same when we come here - we expect a hard challenge over the next three games but we've got a young squad and we're excited to go out and really have a crack at it.\" \n \nCaptaining the side for the first time, Wade maintains his job is simply to continue the fine work of the leadership duo of Steve Smith and vice-captain David Warner. \n \n\"I don't think for me personally it's about putting a stamp on the team,\" he said. \"It's about driving the values and the game plan that we have in one-day cricket moving forward. \n \n\"Steven and David have put their stamp on the team, it's just about me keeping on driving those key messages through to the players. \n \n\"We've performed really well in one-day cricket over a long period of time so it's not about trying to change too much - it's about keeping the ball rolling.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"New Zealand news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Aussies wary of Black Caps on home turf","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"AU","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Blackwater Herald","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"606908468","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Blackwater Herald","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.blackwaterherald.com.au"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201463327","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T00:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:06:41Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

As she publishes her memoirs, the staunch loyalist explains why she\u2019ll keep fighting I always totally denounced people who wrote their memoirs, says Harriet Harman, who has just written her memoir. There is a copy of A Woman\u2019s Work in front of us. A hardback whopper of nearly 400 pages with all kinds of enticing entries in the index: Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers, 18; Association of Metropolitan Authorities, 106; Mothers in Manufacturing Report, 219, 235. One thing I learn about Harriet Harman: she\u2019s not one to shy away from the boring detail.\n\nDuring her time on the frontbench, she says, people would sit in cabinet meetings and literally be writing their diaries in front of her. \"And I used to think, \u2018We\u2019ve got a country to run!\u2019 I was very moral high ground about it, all the time denouncing them as male vanity projects.\"\n\nSo, this is what? A female vanity project?\n\n\"Yes!\" she says. \"It\u2019s a self-consciously female vanity project. When all my colleagues\u2019 autobiographies came out, the first thing you do is to look at the photos and it would all be men. Maybe there\u2019d be their wife and someone who worked for them. And possibly Hillary Clinton and that\u2019s it. And it\u2019s like, where were the 100 women who swept into parliament? Where was the transformation reflected in our politics and the change in women\u2019s lives? You remember Sheila Rowbotham\u2019s Hidden from History? Her thing about unless it\u2019s written about, it\u2019s invisible and then it hasn\u2019t happened?\n\n\"Well, funnily enough, even though I was in the cabinet at the time, I don\u2019t seem to be in these memoirs either. You might find one reference, \u2018Harman, sacking of\u2019. And I thought, \u2018Well, stuff that\u2019. So I found it very easy to do my U-turn.\" Oh, it\u2019s raining men in the Labour party From someone else, this would be hypocritical self-aggrandisement. But this is Harriet Harman, AKA Harriet Harperson. Her conversation is littered with references to \"the cause\", \"the struggle\", \"the mission\" \u2013 her whole adult life, and her entire career at Westminster, has been in single-minded pursuit of equal rights. And it\u2019s fair to say that A Woman\u2019s Work is in some ways more about the changing political representation of women than it is about her. It\u2019s just that she defines and embodies that change.\n\nWe\u2019re in the kitchen of her house in her south London constituency, a warm, comfortable, family home with various piles of clutter and a prowling cat, the kind of fantasy dwelling that would make a millennial\u2019s heart bleed, and she\u2019s telling me how they bought it in 1987 when the area \"was all social workers and FE lecturers\". And now? \"Now it\u2019s bankers and corporate lawyers.\"\n\nWhen Harman first became an MP, at a byelection in 1982, London was a Tory stronghold, a family home was an achievable goal and she was one of only 11 women Labour MPs. And the only one who was pregnant. She was a completely new sight in British politics: a young, pregnant, feminist MP. The photos in the book show her campaigning with a babe in arms and then a toddler and they culminate in the still-record-breaking sight of the 101 Labour women elected during the 1997 landslide: Blair\u2019s Babes. Though she\u2019s still cross about that. The photo. Tutting when I bring it up.\n\nBecause there they all are, \"Folletted\" up in jackets all the colours of the rainbow, the prescribed style decreed by the Labour party\u2019s fashion arbiter, the then member for Stevenage, Barbara Follett, massed around a grinning Tony Blair. \"It was supposed to be the sisterhood!\" says Harman. \"It was supposed to be us, the women, doing it for ourselves. Not as the backing group for the great leader.\" Even more galling was the fact that it had been her idea. She\u2019d arranged it all, when suddenly at the last minute someone added Blair to the line-up. \"It was a complete failure to understand that this was a moment for women.\" On the other hand, she says, at least people remember it. Though she backtracks almost immediately. \"Though I think they would anyway.\" On the campaign trail in 1982, when she entered parliament. Photograph: Rex And a lot of it, of them, was down to her. Campaigning and networking and inspiring and ultimately helping to get the highly unpopular but effective all-women shortlists through, a struggle, documented at length, in the book. Alan Clarke\u2019s Diaries this is not, though she does recall how, as Robin Cook\u2019s deputy on the shadow frontbench, she had promised to take her son to the Bromley Odeon and, despite frantic calls to deliver a response to striking ambulance workers, she took him to the Bromley Odeon. Cook was furious. And since she couldn\u2019t think of an excuse, she simply told him: \"I was not available.\" Cook responded with \"conspiratorial glee\", she says. He assumed she was having an affair.\n\nBut then, having an affair was a valid excuse to go missing in action in Westminster. Having children was not. And Harman had three \"badly timed babies\". Pregnant in her first byelection, campaigning for her first general election with a four-month-old baby, pregnant for the second time when she joined the frontbench, and with another four-month-old baby at the time of her second general election in 1987.\n\nShe didn\u2019t have time to write a diary, she says, \"but because I was so on the defensive all the time, because I thought that people were thinking, \u2018Pregnant, baby, pregnant, baby, pregnant, baby, she\u2019s not going to be doing her job properly.\u2019 I had to prove myself all the time.\"\n\nAnd she fishes out children\u2019s scrapbooks filled with her old cuttings and a file of reports she gave to her local party. \"Look at this one,\" she says. \"You see. I report I\u2019ve had a baby but then I\u2019m immediately on to politics. \u2018They\u2019ve axed the physio in the maternity ward!\u2019 And I wrote that report on the 7th of December.\"\n\nWhen did you have the baby?\n\n\"November 20th. I just never thought I could be a normal MP. I always had to prove myself.\"\n\n\"She\u2019s always been fantastically dogged in pursuit of what she went into politics to achieve,\" one political editor tells me. \"It\u2019s just always been about the cause of women. And asserting herself as a woman in politics. I remember when she first starting stepping in at PMQs. On the one hand, she was leaden and heavy handed, but on the other, she was so relentless and unembarrassed that you came out just thinking, \u2018Good for her\u2019.\n\n\"She has been an extraordinary phenomenon in British politics. Just this totally driven political animal. Always nice. Always pleasant. Impeccably turned out. Incredibly professional. Fantastically loyal to the Labour party. But there are not many jokes or signs of life outside politics. It has always been about women and women\u2019s interests.\"\n\nAnd yet\u2026 it was a Tory who became Britain\u2019s second female prime minister. How did you feel about that? And she grimaces. It\u2019s a subject that is still raw. \"It\u2019s bad enough that the first one was. Imagine what that was like, if you\u2019re a feminist and in the women\u2019s movement, fighting against the Tories uphill and the first woman prime minister is a flipping Tory. It was torture.\"\n\nAnd now they\u2019ve gone and done it again. While the Labour party\u2026 \"Oh, it\u2019s raining men in the Labour party.\" It\u2019s pretty bad that the Tories have got a strong, competent woman in charge... \"It\u2019s terrible. It\u2019s bad. And this is the second time. But then there\u2019s a lot of things now, which are painful echoes of those years. It was bad enough first time around, but second time\u2026 \" It strikes me that in some way you\u2019re the Labour equivalent of Theresa May, I say. \"You mean Theresa May is the Tory equivalent of me?\" she says. And then shudders. \"I hope not!\" You\u2019re both senior, opinionated women, I point out, who don\u2019t care about being liked\u2026\n\n\"Please don\u2019t compare me to her. And I have no idea whether Theresa May wants to be liked. I don\u2019t want to be not-liked. It\u2019s just that nobody did for nearly 20 years. It was horrible and lonely and painful and I did it despite not being liked. I very nearly opted to leave. It\u2019s very difficult to be with people when they are meant to be your colleagues and they are being actively hostile.\n\n\"What kept me there was the women\u2019s movement. I was liked by them. I was one of them. We all liked each other. Theresa May and I are both female politicians but that\u2019s all.\"\n\nIt comes out in a heartfelt rush, this. Because, it\u2019s true, for a long time, Harman wasn\u2019t liked. Not by male-dominated Westminster and not by the male-dominated Westminster press. She was a humourless feminazi before the term was even invented. Harriet Harperson. Harridan Harman. In a column that is vile and misogynistic even by his own standards, Rod Liddle once wondered whether you \"would do\" Harriet Harman, if drunk enough, and decided on balance that you wouldn\u2019t. With husband Jack Dromey, now also an MP, in 1982. Photograph: PA It took 30 years of frontline politics before she gained even grudging acceptance. When she stepped down as deputy leader, the Daily Telegraph ran a leader with the headline: \"Hats off to Harriet Harman \u2013 like or loathe her \u2013 she\u2019s tough as old boots\" and noted that she endured more abuse than any other modern Labour politician bar Tony Blair.\n\nHarman\u2019s father was a doctor and her mother had trained as a lawyer \u2013 one of the first to graduate in the subject from Oxford \u2013 though she never practised. Harman says she and her three highly competitive sisters were brought up with \"mixed messages\" \u2013 the expectation that they would be educated, independent, accomplished in their own right and marry well. The aim, she says, was \"to be intelligent but not too clever\".\n\nIt was partly due to her background, suggests Yvonne Roberts, the Observer\u2019s former leader writer and a fellow member of the women\u2019s movement of that era, that she was enabled to rise above the resistance and hostility she encountered. Her parents sent her to St Paul\u2019s, the London public school that Harman describes as \"stiflingly elitist\". Roberts describes her as \"supportive and warm-hearted and quite posh. I think her background helped. I don\u2019t think anyone else but her could have carved their way through in the way she did. She was surprised if anyone challenged her. She had that same sense of entitlement that upper-class men have: \u2018Why shouldn\u2019t I be doing this?\u2019\n\n\"I think it\u2019s quite hard to knock her confidence. Though there have been times. But in her generation, our generation, it\u2019s kind of what you expected. You had to be ready for it. No one thought it was going to be an easy ride.\" At the University of York, her tutor suggested she\u2019d get a 2.1 if she slept with him, a 2.2 if she didn\u2019t. A few pages later, she writes about how the partner of the law firm where she was an articled clerk groped her. And she names them both. Are they dead? I ask her. Is that a bit problematic accusing people no longer around to defend themselves? She shrugs. \"They shouldn\u2019t have done what they did.\"\n\nIt was a burgeoning sense of injustice that led her to volunteer after work at the Fulham Legal Advice Centre, which, she says, is where she found her calling and became involved in the spectrum of 1970s radical causes: leftwing politics, the women\u2019s movement and consciousness-raising groups. Though there was too much talk about sex and not enough about equal pay for her taste. We were in the wilderness for so long, and the price was paid by people who were unemployed and had no decent services \"I just wasn\u2019t into group discussions about sex. There were also a lot of men on the left who felt it was the duty of women on the left to have lots of sex with them. Anyway, I didn\u2019t want to be discussing my own consciousness. I wanted to be discussing women\u2019s rights.\"\n\nBy this time, she\u2019d met Jack Dromey, then a trade unionist, now an MP, and her future husband, though they would never have done anything as bourgeois as go on a date. Did your eyes meet across a burning brazier?\n\n\"Something like that. Or a courtroom. I\u2019m not sure anyone went on dates in our world because we literally were full on with the cause. It was our lives. We didn\u2019t do chilling around and relaxing and being cheerful with Margaret Thatcher as prime minister. No. There was a job to be done.\"\n\nI get the distinct impression that Dromey is not the type to run around the house with a vacuum, though she won\u2019t be drawn on details. \"You\u2019ve got to remember that this is still a work in progress about men having an equal share in the home,\" she says.\n\nShe won\u2019t say either if she brought up her two sons (she has a daughter too) to be good feminists around the house, though one, Joe, has followed his parents into politics \u2013 he\u2019s a Labour councillor in south London. But one of the most affecting bits is where she talks briefly about her marriage. How, during her campaign to become deputy leader, Dromey would drive through the night so she could make a meeting. And how at the last minute, the party decided to release the full membership lists and her campaign manager, Joan Ruddock, said that to have a chance, they needed to leaflet them all and that would cost £40,000. Which they didn\u2019t have. She came around to the house to tell her and Dromey immediately said that they would find it: they would remortgage the house.\n\n\"I was absolutely astonished by that. Really astonished. Because it\u2019s a big, big sum of money. And Jack comes from a very poor background with no money at all. But he\u2019s always been so committed. So if I\u2019d come back from work exhausted and say I just couldn\u2019t face going to some meeting, some husbands would say, \u2018Just put your feet up and tell them you can\u2019t come.\u2019 Whereas Jack would say, \u2018Just put your head round the door for five minutes.\u2019 We\u2019ve got a shared belief system but in a way that\u2019s why we got together. We didn\u2019t come from the same backgrounds at all. We had shared goals.\"\n\nA week after I interview her, after the supreme court ruling, I ring to find out how she\u2019s going to vote on Brexit and she bangs on about how \"the moment of decision has passed\" and her constituents were telling her on Saturday that \"they thought it had already happened\". Eventually she says: \"I will vote with the whip.\" So, how did Peckham and Camberwell vote? \"Oh, very strongly Remain.\" So, you\u2019re not actually representing them at all, I say. You went on and on about how you shouldn\u2019t be in politics if it\u2019s not all about representing your constituents and yet here you are not representing them. From there on in, we get into what I can only call a slightly bad-tempered row. This is the other Harman, the dogged party loyalist, who has never, ever not toed the party line. She refuses to pass comment on Corbyn though it\u2019s obvious that she hates everything he stands for. And when I say, how deeply disappointing it is that Labour is just not providing any sort of opposition, she agrees, before listing the reasons why she\u2019s backing Corbyn and not providing any sort of opposition.\n\nThough if anyone knows about the political wilderness, it\u2019s Harman. Her first 15 years in parliament were spent in opposition. \"We lost four general elections: 79, 83, 87, 92. Four! The press used to say, Labour\u2019s absolutely useless. There\u2019s no opposition. We weren\u2019t even effective in opposition, let alone looking like a credible government.\"\n\nSo exactly what it feels like now? \"Exactly. Different circumstances. But that sense of being off the pitch, that we\u2019re irrelevant. That we can\u2019t do our basic job of representing our constituents. That absolutely frustrating thing. I just felt like, \u2018Come on!\u2019\" With Gordon Brown at the Labour party conference in 2008. Photograph: Martin Argles for the Guardian In her memoir, she rails against her neighbouring MP Stuart Holland, who threw in the towel to take some plum job. \"It was shocking to me that an MP would give up his seat this way and thereby run the risk of Labour losing the byelection,\" she writes.\n\n\"I wrote that before I knew about Jamie and Tristram,\" she points out. Jamie Reed and Tristram Hunt have both stood down as Labour MPs, triggering byelections. \"Tony Blair used to say it too. \u2018I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m doing this. I should go back to being a barrister.\u2019 And I used to say, \u2018If we all did that, where would we be.\u2019\"\n\nBut then, I say, isn\u2019t that what happens when you parachute careerist high-flyers into constituencies they have no connection to? Isn\u2019t this New Labour\u2019s chickens coming home to roost?\n\n\"All I can say is how I did it and what I said to Tony Blair. If you\u2019ve made a promise to your voters that you will stand up for them, you need to stand up for them. Nobody makes you stand as a Labour MP. You fight for that position. If I\u2019d just seen this as a career, I never would have done it. It was because it was a cause. And the cause is when you\u2019re opposition as well as government.\"\n\nThere was a moment in her career, though, when she could have stood up and been counted, and if she\u2019d done that it is conceivable that\u2026 well, it depends how counterfactual you want to be, but Gordon Brown would have been deposed, a new, less paranoid leader elected, the Tories would not have got in, the referendum would not have been called and Brexit would have been averted\u2026 It was in 2009, when James Purnell resigned, telling Brown he should quit and was followed by half the shadow cabinet, culminating in Caroline Flint accusing Brown of using women as \"window dressing\" when she stood down as Europe minister.\n\nDespite being deputy leader, Brown had refused to make Harman deputy prime minister, an act that she found humiliating and depressing, not just for herself, and I believe her on this, but for all Labour women. And she\u2019s right: it was important. And then in the middle of the crisis, she discovered that he planned to make Peter Mandelson deputy instead.\n\nIn the memoir, she recounts her fury. \"Over my dead body!\" she tells him. And then points out that she\u2019s about to go out and defend him against accusations that he treats women as window dressing. He backs down and agrees not to make Mandelson deputy prime minister. \"I was pleased but suspicious,\" she writes. \"And as I left my parting shot was, \u2018OK, but you\u2019d better not be going to double-cross me and do it by the back door.\u2019\" Harman with her three children in 1988. Photograph: Rex Later that afternoon, Brown made Mandelson \"first secretary of state\" or as Number 10 briefed the media, \"deputy prime minister in all but name\". It still smarts. She\u2019s still furious. But you wouldn\u2019t have known any of this at the time. She\u2019s shown dogged loyalty in the face of betrayal, knifings in the back, rank incompetence on the part of her colleagues, no-hopers as leaders. You\u2019ll never get her to bitch and whine. \"She\u2019s fantastically loyal to the Labour party,\" one political editor tells me. \"When she was fired by Blair very early on, she could have become a carping anti-Blairite but she just got on with it and eventually resurfaced as solicitor general and made a very good job of it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s no longer sees Brown or Blair, but she still refuses to be a carping anti-Blairite; when I point out that Iraq only occupies a page and a half of the entire book, she refuses to apologise for it. \"We\u2019d lost four elections. If you\u2019d been in opposition since 1982 with your constituents dying on hospital waiting lists, and I\u2019m not saying that people didn\u2019t die in Iraq. Obviously, they did in huge numbers, but I\u2019m not going to say bad things about him. We were in the wilderness for so long and the price that was paid was by people who were unemployed and had no decent public services; Tony was part of moving things forward.\"\n\nThis wasn\u2019t her first view of him. She\u2019d been friends with Cherie through their work in the law and thought she was \"a dynamo\". Tony, on the other hand\u2026 \"I thought that\u2019s it, the Labour party has gone to the dogs. I was amazed he got selected for Sedgefield. Couldn\u2019t imagine what had happened to everyone else\u2019s nominations.\"\n\nBut he was a winner. And, in the Harriet Harman playbook, that\u2019s what matters. Winning. Making laws. Changing things. \"It\u2019s not very fashionable, but I\u2019ve not got a bad word to say about Tony Blair in the book and I\u2019m not going to say a bad word afterwards because actually, he led us to three victories. Three victories where we could do things and I think the things we did were incredibly important. We did civil partnerships, we abolished Clause 28. The Human Rights Act\u2026 \"\n\nYvonne Roberts says what Harman and that cohort of women Labour MPs achieved for women during those years shouldn\u2019t be underestimated. \"On childcare and working rights and domestic violence. There was a lot of stuff going behind the scenes. I suspect she did more than she even takes credit for.\"\n\nThere is something bracing about talking to Harriet Harperson. I leave her kitchen feeling slightly more cheerful than when I arrived. It\u2019s so dark right now. \"But I remember feeling very dark and despondent when we had Reagan and Thatcher,\" she says. \"People talked about emigrating. But nobody went anywhere. We fought our way through. We kept the faith. We kept the course. We got into government. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do again.\" She\u2019s 66. It would be cheering to think there will finally be a female Labour prime minister in her lifetime. Or any Labour prime minister.\n\n\u2022 A Woman\u2019s Work by Harriet Harman is published by Allen Lane (£20). To order a copy for £15 go to bookshop.theguardian.com or call 0330 333 6846.

Their ninth meeting in a grand slam final is all the sweeter for being so unexpected. \n \nLast October, Federer travelled to Mallorca for the opening of his friend\u2019s new tennis academy. The Swiss was on \u201cone leg\u201d after knee surgery and the Spaniard still hampered by the wrist injury that wrecked his 2016 season. \n \n\u201cAt that moment, for sure we never thought that we had the chance to be in a final again, and especially in the first of the year,\u201d recalled Nadal. \n \n\u201cBoth of us I think worked very hard to be where we are. It\u2019s great that we are again in a moment like this.\u201d \n \nAs Nadal and Federer arrived at Melbourne Park as ninth and 17th seeds, therefore, the first drafts of the obituaries of two great sporting careers were being prepared. \n \nThey were hurriedly dropped back into the files, however, as it became apparent the duo were playing vintage tennis: Federer all fluidity and peerless shot-making, Nadal at his brutal best from the baseline. \n \nThe early departures of reigning champion Novak Djokovic and top seed Andy Murray, the players who had joined Federer and Nadal to make up the \u201cBig Four\u201d, then opened up the path to a grand final reunion. \n \nAlthough it has often felt more like 2007 than 2017 at Melbourne Park this week, even great champions are not immune to the ravages of time. \n Recovery time  \nAt 35, Swiss Federer is the oldest men\u2019s grand slam finalist since Ken Rosewall lost the US Open final in 1974 at the age of 39. \n \nNadal might be five years younger but has been on tour since his late teens and the effort required for his attritional playing style puts tremendous strain on his body. \n \nAnd while Federer has been able to rest up after his three-hour semi-final victory over Stan Wawrinka on Thursday, Nadal must recuperate as best he can after his epic five-hour victory over Grigor Dimitrov on Friday. \n \n\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m going to try,\u201d the 14-times grand slam champion said. \u201cI did it in 2009. I am seven, eight years older.\u201d \n \nThat five-set 2009 victory over Federer earned Nadal his sole Australian Open crown and another would make him the only man in the open era apart from Roy Emerson to have won all four grand slams twice. \n \nFederer has four Australian Open titles but just a single French Open crown, his path to Roland Garros glory more often than not blocked by Nadal. \n \nNadal has a 6-2 edge over Federer in grand slam finals but few are making a call with any confidence over who will win today\u2019s contest. \n \n\u201cI just know that two of the greatest players of tennis are going to square off on Sunday, and it\u2019s going to be a freakin\u2019 amazing match,\u201d Dimitrov said on Friday.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Nick Mulvenney"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Sports: tennis news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Deja vu slam to climax with Roger-Rafa show","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Southern Europe","countryCode":"MT","country":"Malta"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Times of Malta","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169660702","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"87"},"name":"Times of Malta","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Tennis","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.timesofmalta.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201476313","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:11:04Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:06:44Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The integrated development environment (IDE) had been in preview for quite some time under the name Visual Studio \"15\" , and offers various improvements and enhancements over previous versions, included an increased focus on mobile cross-platform development. \n \nThe company has now released another update for the IDE , integrating new features and fixing a number of issues. \n  \nMicrosoft has released a summary of the change log relevant to the latest update to Visual Studio 2017 Release Candidate. It includes: \n The .NET Core and ASP.NET Core workload is no longer in preview. We have fixed several bugs and improved usability of .NET Core and ASP.NET Core Tooling.  Team Explorer connect experience is now improved to make it easier to find the projects and repos to which you want to connect.  The Advanced Save option is back due to popular demand.  Multiple installation-related issues are now fixed in this update, including hangs. We\u2019ve also added a retry button when installation fails, disambiguated Visual Studio installs in the Start menu, and added support for creating a layout for offline install.  \nMoreover, the company has also removed Data Science and Python Development workloads. Microsoft explains that as the IDE approaches public release, many components including the ones mentioned above, won't be able to meet some necessary requirements - such as translation to non-English languages. As a result, they'll be available as separate downloads later. \n \nMicrosoft has encouraged users of the release candidate to report bugs , track feedback on developer forums , and voice suggestions on UserVoice .

The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The ones who see things differently. They're not fond of rules.You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore them. Because they change things. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius.\u201d \n \n  \n \nThis one is for you Sanjay Leela Bhansali. Before going into any other part of what happened, we need to say - thank you. Thank you for being the crazy misfit who thinks he can change the world. It\u2019s men like you who make history. We aren\u2019t sure, whether to start with lauding your courage or  apologising  on behalf of a handful of goons who took it upon themselves to safeguard the Rajput culture. For a community that claims to be the most valiant community in India, these men definitely aren\u2019t sound representatives of the culture they gloat about so-darn-proudly. As someone we know, memorably puts it, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to not offend when in India\u2026\u201d, the attack on SLB is a testament to how aggressive a certain section of the nation can get when their fragile egos  are tampered . But never before, has an attack been this unreasonable.  \n \n  \n \nIs there a more suitable word to describe the Karni Sainiks than goons? (Besides the obvious expletives\u2026) Maybe not. But they definitely aren\u2019t what Anurag Kashyap calls \u2018Hindu extremists\u2019. That\u2019s almost saying that terrorism has a religion, an idea radicals have been fighting ferociously for decades now. The violence comes with no creed or  colour . What happened to Bhansali or even Karan Johar during the release of Ae Dil Hai Mushkil, is enraging but let\u2019s not fall prey to the pitfalls of anger and suspend our logical thinking mind. Didn\u2019t the 16-year-old Zaira Wasim fall prey to scathing comments by extremists who slandered and abused her on social media for a mere meeting? Clearly, religion is not a factor to extremists who are so blinded and brainwashed by their false ideals that they stop seeing things just the way they are. Zaira, for days after her social media post, stayed indoors. A friend in Srinagar had informed us how her parents refused to open the doors to anyone and kept the phones unplugged or switched off. They were petrified for her safety. \n \n  \n \nThe cited instances bring us to the point that Bollywood is a soft prey for anti-social groups. The goons claimed that they were  vandalising  the set to protest inappropriate depiction of their history. Pray, how did they know what the film\u2019s script has? In  case  of Bhansali\u2019s discreet process of work, even the strongest of our sources fail but  clearly , the goons have the script with them to know how the facts aren\u2019t \u2018correct\u2019 in his film. Guys, open a Bollywood site. You could give us a serious run for our money. But of course, that isn\u2019t easy money. Extortion rocks yeah? Be it in the case of forcing 5 crores out of someone else\u2019s pocket to get them a smooth release in the name of patriotism or now. For a film that\u2019s mounted on a magnanimous budget, the cost of equipment damaged by your silly act of so-called righteousness will be borne by the poor producers, who wouldn\u2019t want any further harm to their passion project. It was a riot, a clear case of pre-planned and  organised  violence, presumably supported by someone in power, which gave them the audacity to go on with the act. \n \n  \n \nAnd with that, let\u2019s understand who gives a certain political group the right to safeguard history. Isn\u2019t history open to interpretation? Facts are facts but there are always two sides of the story. Bhansali, since the time he has announced his film, has called Alauddin Khilji as his anti-hero. Are we so myopic that we won\u2019t allow a revered filmmaker to go about his job without being humiliated multiple times over? And as for Rani Padmini, who  symbolises  courage and chastity, she won\u2019t exactly be proud of the cowards who are using her name as a pawn in this war of vulnerable egos. Back then, she knew how to take care of herself and even now, the  Padminis  of the world know how to win their wars all by themselves. \n \n  \n \nDear Goons, stop shoving your chauvinism to protect what\u2019s not even yours to protect. As for Bhansali, 12 years ago he had made a play on Padmini which put her on the world map. Let\u2019s not teach him how to do his job. Don\u2019t try to curb his creative freedom or humiliate him for taking the modern Indian generation to a part of history they aren\u2019t well acquainted with. The Government of India, which has bestowed him with National Awards four times over, surely believe the man is competent enough to do his job.

Although there are differences between their proposals, President Donald Trump and the House GOP have suggested significant changes to the estate tax as well as to the availability of asset step-up in basis after death and itemized deductions during life. High-net-worth individuals and their estate planners should examine all three issues, in addition to state estate tax consequences, when revising their lifetime and testamentary giving plans in the wake of changes at the federal level. \n Tax Reform Plans  \nThe following table compares President Trump\u2019s statements on tax reform during his campaign with the House Republican proposal, known as the \u201cBlueprint.\u201d (See \" Business Tax Reform All but Certain in US, Europe .\") \n \nPresident Trump and the Blueprint offer additional proposals, such as closing the carried interest tax \"loophole\" (President Trump only) and income tax rate decreases for corporations and pass-through business entities (both plans). However, the issues of estate tax repeal, changes to asset basis step-up and limitations on deductions will have the most significant effects on estate planning in terms of both testamentary plans and lifetime giving. \n Estate Tax Repeal  \nEstate tax repeal has been on the Republican wish list for many years, but previous efforts at permanent repeal failed \u2014 even during one period of unified Republican government \u2014 because of Democratic political opposition and legislative rules relating to the reconciliation process between House and Senate spending bills. However, political will for estate tax repeal is strong this year, both because it is a stated priority for congressional Republicans and President Trump and because Senate Democrats may cede opposition to estate tax repeal as a filibuster bargaining chip in overall tax reform. The generation-skipping transfer tax, which prevents individuals from avoiding the estate tax through transfers to grandchildren and more remote descendants, would become largely irrelevant with no estate tax in place and would likely be part of any estate tax repeal bill. \n \nAlthough the 40 percent rate for transfers at death totaling over $5.49 million for an individual and $10.98 million for a married couple in 2017 appears ripe for the legislative chopping block, less certain is the status of the gift tax. Neither plan mentions this tax, which imposes the same rate on transfers exceeding the same amounts during a donor\u2019s lifetime. Although transfer taxes represent only a nominal amount of revenue for the government relative to all tax receipts, the gift tax serves as a backstop to the income tax by preventing high-marginal-rate taxpayers from gifting certain assets to low-marginal-rate taxpayers \u2014 often, younger family members \u2014 who would sell the assets and gift the proceeds back to the donor. If the gift tax remains in effect, transfer techniques such as grantor-retained annuity trusts would continue to be effective estate planning tools even after a repeal of the estate tax. \n Asset Basis Step-Up  \nA major difference between the two plans is whether assets that appreciate will receive a step-up in basis, or a readjustment in value, at an owner\u2019s death. Current law and the House GOP plan provide that all assets owned by a decedent at his or her death receive a step-up in basis to their fair market value at the time of death. Unless an asset appreciates significantly after the decedent\u2019s death, its recipient will have limited \u2014 if any \u2014 taxable gain on a later sale or exchange. \n \nHowever, President Trump\u2019s plan appears to limit the step-up in basis to the first $10 million of built-in gain in assets owned by a decedent at death. If a decedent owned $100 million of assets at death with an aggregate basis of $50 million (in the simplest case, having paid $50 million for those assets, which then appreciated to $100 million), the basis of those assets in the hands of the recipient(s) would be limited to $60 million as opposed to their $100 million fair market value. It is unclear from President Trump\u2019s plan how the $10 million increase in basis would be allocated among multiple built-in gain assets. It also is unclear whether his plan would deem death a capital gains realization event, such that, in the previous example, the decedent\u2019s estate would pay tax (presumably, at capital gains rates) on $40 million of appreciation, and the recipients would take the decedent\u2019s assets with a $100 million fair-market-value basis. In any event, the full, tax-free step-up in basis at death that estate planners and clients have enjoyed would no longer be in effect. \n Limitations on Deductions  \nFinally, President Trump\u2019s plan changes the availability of itemized deductions for all taxpayers, potentially limiting the income tax efficiency of charitable contributions during life for charitably inclined high-net-worth individuals. Although the House GOP plan eliminates most itemized deductions, such as deductions for medical expenses and for state and local taxes, it retains the current charitable deduction, which is unlimited in terms of dollar value but subject to a percentage limitation based on adjusted gross income. \n \nBy contrast, President Trump\u2019s plan retains all current itemized deductions but caps them at $100,000 for a single individual and $200,000 for a married couple. An individual whose annual home mortgage interest, medical expenses, and state and local taxes exceed $100,000 would thus receive no additional deduction for amounts contributed to charities, perhaps causing him or her to defer charitable giving to later years or until death. \n State Estate Taxes  \nEven if President Trump and the House GOP implement comprehensive tax reform that eliminates the federal estate tax, state estate taxes would not automatically follow suit. New York, for example, imposes an estate tax with a top rate of 16 percent for transfers at death exceeding $4.187 million (increasing to $5.25 million in April 2017). Eighteen other states have state estate taxes, with top rates ranging from 12 percent to 20 percent. New York residents and residents of other states that continue to have separate estate taxes must remember to consider the state tax efficiency of their estate plans, even if state estate tax rates remain lower than the current top federal rate of 40 percent. \n Looking Ahead  \nAt first glance, changes to the transfer tax system at the federal level would seem to simplify estate planning for many individuals. However, because of offsetting changes to the federal income tax consequences of gratuitous transfers and unchanged state transfer tax systems, individuals and their estate planners should take a cautious approach when revising estate planning documents in the coming year. \n \nThis memorandum is provided by Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP and its affiliates for educational and informational purposes only and is not intended and should not be construed as legal advice.

The new administration\u2019s appointments reinforce expectations of a multipronged approach to foreign investment and specifically to reviews by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). While most foreign acquisitions and investors will continue to be welcomed, those presenting potential national security issues \u2014 which the Trump administration may come to view as including risks to American jobs and pre-eminence in certain industrial sectors \u2014 can expect more searching CFIUS reviews. \n \nTrump Administration. Additional subcabinet appointments to executive positions within key agencies will further clarify the new administration\u2019s approach. Early indications suggest it will be open to investments from friendly nations but more skeptical of those from nations it deems to be economic or strategic adversaries or engaging in trade-distorting practices. Notably, the long-standing split within CFIUS between economic and national security agencies may become more stark in the Trump administration. Appointments to the Trump cabinet in key economic positions, including Treasury, State, Commerce and the National Economic Council, indicate an administration preference for practical dealmaking, given top-level appointees\u2019 experiences in the private sector. At the same time, some key economic appointees have indicated that the CFIUS process may not be adequately addressing trade issues, such as reciprocal market access. For example, during confirmation hearings, Commerce secretary nominee Wilbur Ross Jr. was asked about CFIUS reviews of Chinese acquisitions in the entertainment industry. Ross indicated that he was \u201cstruck to learn\u201d that the industry is \u201cnot very reciprocal [in] that [Chinese investors] want to control entertainment and other media here, and yet are denying our companies anything getting remotely close to that.\u201d Moreover, the administration also has signaled through its appointments at Defense and Justice that it may be highly skeptical of investments from geopolitical rivals and can be expected to encourage a more rigorous and thorough review of investments from those nations. \n \nJob Retention. Foreign investors can expect all of these agency priorities to yield at times to the unifying principle of President Trump\u2019s foreign investment platform: maintaining domestic employment. Treasury secretary nominee Steven Mnuchin nodded to this possibility when referring during his confirmation hearing to a potential committee role in \u201cprotecting American workers.\u201d In addition, during the transition, the incoming president broadcast his meetings with CEOs and foreign investors, such as Masayoshi Son of Japan, who have committed to expanding employment and keeping facilities and technology in the United States. As shown in those transition discussions and in the recent Carrier and Ford onshoring decisions, investors who commit to maintaining jobs in the United States can expect more favorable treatment in the Trump administration. \n \nReciprocal Market Access. The president\u2019s continuing emphasis on reciprocal market access, as shown in senior White House appointments, also demonstrates that countries with strong bilateral trade relationships with the United States should continue to enjoy a more favorable position in transactions before CFIUS. Still, while individual cabinet members have significant control over the strategies of their cabinet departments, senior and mid-level political appointees \u2014 who may not be named for several months \u2014 will ultimately be responsible for overseeing the day-to-day activities of government officials and making the majority of CFIUS decisions. Close attention should be paid to the backgrounds and views of these appointees, given their prominent roles in managing the CFIUS process. \n \nCoordination With NATO Allies. As it develops its internal approach to CFIUS reviews, the Trump administration may also be the first to need to develop an internationally coordinated approach to national security reviews, as traditional U.S. allies have begun to institute new, more rigorous oversight regimes. In recent years, CFIUS reviews have increasingly involved international cooperation or parallel national security review involving the United States and its NATO allies. Examples include: \n the recent proposed acquisition of Germany\u2019s Aixtron SE by Grand Chip Investment GmbH, ultimately owned by investors in the People\u2019s Republic of China, which was blocked by both U.S. and German authorities;  the recent successful acquisition of Alcatel-Lucent by Nokia Corp., which was cleared by the U.S. and French governments; and  the acquisition of Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise by China Huaxin Post and Telecommunication Economy Development Centre, which was cleared by the U.S. and French governments, as well as by the Chinese government in a simultaneous national security review.  \nIf these multilateral national security reviews become more common, the Trump administration can be expected to face more requests for intelligence sharing and collaboration, and may elect to use those tools to strengthen alliances with close U.S. partners. \n \nRevising CFIUS Authorities. The new Congress also may exercise its authority to refocus the U.S. approach to foreign investment. Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle have shown a renewed interest in reviewing or reforming CFIUS staffing, funding and/or authorities. Topics have included expanding the committee\u2019s jurisdiction to review the economic impacts of foreign investment and requiring the committee to take into account the openness of investors\u2019 home countries to U.S. investment when reviewing specific transactions. At the request of several members of Congress, mostly Republicans, the Government Accountability Office recently announced that it will review CFIUS statutory and administrative authorities. Moreover, to the extent that reciprocal market access is revisited by either the Trump administration or Congress, they may take heed of the recent trend in European national security reviews to take market access and other economic issues into consideration. \n \nThe laws governing CFIUS last underwent a significant overhaul in 2007, and subsequent legislative attempts to expand the mission of CFIUS have been unsuccessful. However, the heightened focus on foreign trade and investment by Congress and the new administration may create a more fertile environment for change. \n \nParties pursuing cross-border investments will need to engage in careful advance planning, including the assessment of relevant national security risks and the potential need to craft a pre-emptive risk mitigation package. Parties should consider a proactive approach to CFIUS in advance of the formal process. \n \nThis memorandum is provided by Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP and its affiliates for educational and informational purposes only and is not intended and should not be construed as legal advice.

During his campaign, for example, he vowed to challenge certain high-profile mergers in the telecommunications industry \u2014 including the 2011 acquisition of NBC Universal by Comcast, which was already approved by the relevant government authorities \u2014 and decried the \u201cantitrust problems\u201d of companies across the technology industry. Both statements raised concern among some Republicans that the Trump administration would press for aggressive investigation of companies perceived to have a dominant position in their respective markets or, at the very least, would be less predictable in antitrust enforcement decisions. Notwithstanding these widely publicized declarations, early indicators \u2014 such as the selection of Joshua Wright as head of President Trump\u2019s antitrust transition team and assurances by attorney general nominee Jeff Sessions in his confirmation hearing that there will be \u201cno political influence\u201d in enforcement of the antitrust laws \u2014 point to a more conservative approach to antitrust policy under President Trump. Indeed, it is fair to expect some tempering of the level of activity that characterized the Obama administration, particularly with respect to merger challenges. \n \nIn the coming months, President Trump will make several leadership appointments to the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the two federal agencies that share responsibility for antitrust enforcement. These appointments, for which no candidates have been announced, will be subject to the same Senate confirmation process that is required for Cabinet-level positions. With the nominations yet to come, one cannot predict with any certainty the direction that antitrust enforcement will take under President Trump, but his transition team provided important clues. A former Republican FTC commissioner, Wright developed a reputation as the commission\u2019s most conservative voice, staunchly advocating an \"evidence-based\" approach to antitrust policy and decision-making based on the relevant law and demonstrable economic evidence, which manifests in principled restraint in enforcement actions. \n \nWright emphasizes three methodological commitments that ought to apply in antitrust enforcement: (1) integrating economic analysis into all stages of enforcement decision-making, (2) drawing on empirical evidence to improve the decision-making process, and (3) minimizing the adverse costs and impacts of speculative enforcement decisions. In merger enforcement specifically, Wright argued that prevailing merger analysis improperly ignores the efficiencies resulting from transactions (including those \"outside\" the alleged market) and does so asymmetrically, often embracing \u201cprobabilistic prediction, estimation, presumption and simulation of anticompetitive effects on the one hand\u201d but requiring \u201cefficiencies to be proven on the other.\u201d \n \nBeyond his role in the presidential transition, some have speculated that Wright himself may be a candidate for assistant attorney general, and, if nominated and confirmed, would name key members of the Antitrust Division\u2019s senior leadership team. Others have suggested that Wright could reprise his role as FTC commissioner, likely taking on the role of chairman, where he could better influence FTC policy across antitrust, consumer protection and privacy issues. Regardless of whether Wright is appointed to a position in government, his influence over the Trump administration's nomination of senior antitrust officials to the DOJ and FTC is likely to leave its imprint on antitrust policy for the foreseeable future. \n \nIn terms of appointments, the changes will be most dramatic at the FTC, where President Trump will nominate at least three, and possibly four, commissioners within his first year in office \u2014 an unprecedented transformation in such a short period. The FTC is composed of five commissioners, no more than three of whom may be from the same political party. They are nominated by the president and serve seven-year terms. Due to vacancies, there are currently three sitting commissioners \u2014 two Democrats and a Republican. The existing chairwoman, Democrat Edith Ramirez, is serving under an expired term and recently announced her resignation effective February 10, 2017. President Trump\u2019s responsibilities will include picking several candidates to bring the commission up to full strength and shifting the chairmanship to a Republican commissioner, either current Republican Commissioner Maureen K. Ohlhausen or a new appointee. The new chair, in turn, will hand-select candidates for key leadership positions, such as director of the Bureau of Competition and general counsel. Moreover, Democratic Commissioner Terrell McSweeny\u2019s term expires on September 25, 2017, meaning the Trump administration will nominate a fourth commissioner during the latter part of 2017 (albeit likely a Democrat). However it unfolds, for the first time in nearly a decade, the commission will be led by a Republican majority and chairperson, increasing the likelihood that the overall antitrust enforcement climate in the U.S. will be less aggressive. \n \nThese changes will take time to run their course. The antitrust agencies typically are not the highest priority of a new president's administration, and in past administrations the president has not completed his antitrust selections until several months into his presidency. Even assuming a smooth nomination process made possible by Republican control of the Senate, it may be several months before the new senior antitrust officials are in place and executing their decision-making authority within the agencies. One aspect of the process that some have speculated could proceed more quickly would be the appointment of Commissioner Ohlhausen as the FTC\u2019s acting chairwoman. The act of elevating a sitting commissioner to the chairmanship does not require Senate confirmation and could theoretically occur immediately, but whether this will happen ultimately depends on the end game that the new administration has in mind. In particular, if the new administration decides to shift the chair to one of its new nominees, it may defer any action until later or request that Commissioner Ohlhausen serve as chair on an acting basis, in which case she would be unlikely to select new senior enforcers. \n \nEither way, the U.S. antitrust landscape is poised to undergo considerable transition. After a slow start, the Obama administration became very active on a number of fronts, with both the DOJ and FTC making aggressive moves to enforce the antitrust laws, particularly in their scrutiny of mergers. The levels of antitrust enforcement seen at the tail end of the Obama administration were consistent with President Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign promise to \"reinvigorate antitrust enforcement, which is how we ensure that capitalism works for consumers.\" Over time, we expect the Trump administration\u2019s antitrust outcomes \u2014 even if laden with more evidence-based economics \u2014 in many respects to resemble those of past Republican administrations, with fewer challenges to merger activity overall, an implicit or express endorsement of \"creative destruction\" (even when it might lead to dominant market positions), and perhaps greater reliance on economic analysis for changes in policy and to reach enforcement decisions. \n \nThis memorandum is provided by Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP and its affiliates for educational and informational purposes only and is not intended and should not be construed as legal advice.

U.S. presidential election, companies and investors enjoyed a stock market rally fueled by expectations concerning tax cuts, increased government spending and significant deregulation. While the legal and regulatory changes envisioned under a new presidential administration may present real and substantial opportunities for companies, those changes may have little if any impact when it comes to corporate governance. The forces driving shareholder activism, governance activism, scrutiny of board composition, concerns regarding board oversight of risk management and director-shareholder engagement remain present and may gain strength in a period of deregulation. Investors, having successfully employed \u201cprivate ordering\u201d in recent years to achieve corporate governance changes, may find that private ordering will be able to trump the impact of political change. \n \nPrivate Ordering and Proxy Access. Private ordering is not a new concept, nor is it limited to corporate governance. It is the notion that private parties are best positioned to order their affairs rather than relying on government regulation to do so. In the corporate governance context, many in the business community championed private ordering when criticizing the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) 2010 adoption of a proxy access rule that would apply to all public companies. Under that SEC rule, vacated in litigation due to procedural flaws, holders or groups of holders of at least 3 percent of a company\u2019s shares for at least three years would have the ability to nominate candidates for 25 percent of the board seats and have those candidates appear in the company proxy statement alongside the board\u2019s nominees. Rather than an SEC-mandated one-size-fits-all proxy access rule, the rallying cry was that individual companies \u2014 management, the board of directors and shareholders \u2014 should be left to decide for themselves what form of proxy access, if any, was appropriate for them. \n \nAs a result of private ordering, the number of companies that provide shareholders with a proxy access right has increased from a handful at the end of 2014, to 125 at the end of 2015, to approximately 350 in early 2017. This number includes more than half of the companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index. The rapid rate of adoption is likely to continue unabated through 2017 and for the foreseeable future. Although there is some company variation in the proxy access details, private ordering has coalesced around a 3-3-20-20 proxy access right: Holders of 3 percent of a company\u2019s shares for three years may nominate and include in the company\u2019s proxy materials candidates for up to 20 percent of the board (often permitting a minimum of two nominees) and form a group of up to 20 shareholders to meet the 3 percent ownership requirement. \n \nOf course, the ultimate impact of proxy access on board composition and behavior remains to be determined. In November 2016, GAMCO and Gabelli Funds became the first shareholders to use proxy access, nominating one person for inclusion in the proxy materials of National Fuel Gas Company pursuant to the company\u2019s proxy access bylaw. Prior to submitting the nomination, Gabelli-affiliated funds had been advocating for change at National Fuel Gas for some time, including by submitting a 2015 shareholder proposal requesting that the company hire an investment bank to explore a spin-off of the company\u2019s utility business. Referencing those prior actions, National Fuel Gas determined that GAMCO and Gabelli Funds were not eligible to use proxy access, as they could not accurately represent that they lacked the intent to \u201cchange or influence control\u201d of the company, as required by the company\u2019s proxy access bylaw (and virtually all other proxy access bylaws adopted to date). The proxy access nomination was subsequently withdrawn. Presumably, however, it is just a matter of time until investors submit a nomination that is compliant with a company\u2019s proxy access bylaw and a proxy contest ensues. \n \nThe reluctant acceptance of proxy access by corporations is in large part the result of an alignment of views across a wide swath of investors. The campaign for proxy access was largely spearheaded by the New York City comptroller\u2019s \u201cBoardroom Accountability Project,\u201d which in late 2014 submitted 75 proxy access shareholder proposals to companies with perceived issues relating to executive compensation, board diversity or climate change. Other institutional investors joined the campaign, submitting shareholder proposals to additional companies. The voting results in favor of those shareholder proposals could not have been achieved without the support of some of the largest mutual funds and asset managers, such as BlackRock, State Street, T. Rowe Price and Vanguard. Finally, individual investors and corporate gadflies aligned around the proxy access parameters preferred by larger investors and have been submitting a significant number of proxy access shareholder proposals. These investors now have a well-developed playbook for employing the power of private ordering to create corporate governance change. The question is what the next issue will be that can achieve a similar alignment of investor views. \n \nPotential Dodd-Frank Repeal. The Dodd-Frank Act encompassed a wide-ranging set of banking and financial sector reforms enacted in response to the 2007-08 financial crisis. The statute also contained a number of securities law and corporate governance provisions applicable to all or most U.S. public companies \u2014 for example, establishing the requirement that public companies provide shareholders with an advisory vote on executive compensation (commonly referred to as \u201csay-on-pay\u201d). Expected efforts by the new presidential administration to repeal or replace the Dodd-Frank Act primarily will relate to banking and financial sector regulation but likely will also address these securities law and corporate governance provisions of wider applicability. (See \" The Trump Impact: Key Issues in Financial Services Reform for 2017 .\") Although the ultimate form of any new law remains to be seen, the \u201cFinancial CHOICE Act of 2016\u201d \u2014 approved on a party-line vote by the House Financial Services Committee in the fall of 2016 \u2014 represents the most advanced effort thus far. One section in the Financial CHOICE Act would repeal the Dodd-Frank provision authorizing the SEC to adopt proxy access rules. As a result of private ordering, this repeal would be somewhat irrelevant. \n \nAnother provision in the Financial CHOICE Act would amend the requirement to have a say-on-pay vote. Rather than the current requirement that companies hold a say-on-pay vote at least once every three years, companies would be required to hold such a vote only when there has been a material change to the compensation of executives from the previous year. In 2011, when most large companies last solicited shareholder feedback on the desired frequency of say-on-pay votes, more than 90 percent of S&P 500 companies adopted annual say-on-pay votes. Many companies will hold their next say-on-frequency vote in 2017 and the expectation is that investors will again express a preference for annual say-on-pay votes. It would appear that even if the law was amended to require say-on-pay votes only upon material changes to executive compensation, private ordering likely would result in maintaining the status quo of annual votes at most companies. \n \nBoard Composition. Investors continue to scrutinize director skill sets, diversity and tenure as well as company disclosure regarding how boards consider these issues. Although there have been calls by some investors or investor groups to expand SEC disclosure rules concerning director diversity, most of the change to date in this area has been the result of private ordering. Prompted by investor calls for better disclosure, the appearance of board skills matrices in company proxy statements continues to expand. While progress may be viewed as slow by some, boards are steadily increasing their gender diversity. On the issue of director tenure, investors continue to raise concerns where average tenure is lengthy, where a high percentage of directors are considered long-tenured or where no new director has been added for some length of time. In any event, private ordering is likely to continue to spur boards to consider these issues, take responsive action and improve disclosures to reflect their understanding and consideration of these matters. \n \nEnvironmental and Social Issues. The level of assets managed using ESG \u2014 environmental, social and governance \u2014 factors continues to grow, as does the number of mainstream investors that consider ESG to some degree in their portfolio decision-making. Much like corporate governance, some investors view environmental and social issues as additional lenses through which to analyze risk in their portfolio companies. It is worth recalling the role that environmental and social concerns played in selecting the companies initially targeted by investors for proxy access shareholder proposals. In 2016, a record nine shareholder proposals on environmental and social issues received majority support, including proposals on board diversity, gender pay equity, political contributions disclosure and sustainability reporting. Also in 2016, a record 91 climate change shareholder proposals were submitted, driven in part by the climate change agreement reached in Paris in December 2015. Although specific proposals vary, a new proposal seeking an assessment of the impact of climate change policies aimed at reaching the 2-degree Celsius target adopted by the Paris climate accord received significant shareholder support, ranging from 38 percent to 49 percent of votes cast at a number of major energy companies. \n \nUnder a presidential administration skeptical about climate change and likely to revisit many of the Obama administration\u2019s environmental initiatives, environmental and climate change matters may be the next private ordering battlefield. It is estimated that more than 200 environmental and climate change shareholder proposals will be submitted for the 2017 proxy season. In addition, mutual fund companies and asset managers are facing shareholder proposals relating to incongruities between their voting records on these types of proposals and their stated positions on climate change. These and other pressures could result in increasing levels of voting support for climate change proposals and impact companies\u2019 willingness to negotiate for the withdrawal of some proposals. \n \nPrivate ordering also may impact climate-related corporate disclosures. In December 2016, the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), established by the Financial Stability Board (an international body that monitors and develops policies concerning the global financial system), published for public comment recommendations for voluntary climate change-related disclosures as part of company financial disclosures. The TCFD members include banks, insurance companies, asset managers, pension funds, large nonfinancial companies, accounting firms and credit rating agencies. The stated expectation is that large asset owners and asset managers will influence the companies in which they invest. The focus of the TCFD recommendations is disclosure related to the financial impact of climate change on a company, rather than a company\u2019s impact on climate change. If a broad coalition of investors emerges in support of enhanced disclosures on climate change, private ordering may again prevail over deregulation efforts stemming from political change. \n \nShareholder Engagement. Companies are likely to continue along the current path on which shareholder engagement and enhanced disclosure are driven by the demands of investors rather than in response to regulatory requirements. Company proxy statements continue to evolve, not just in terms of the use of color and graphics, but in addressing topics such as shareholder engagement and other items of interest to investors. Shareholder-director engagement continues to increase, and companies that have a policy prohibiting shareholder-director engagement may find shareholders voting against key directors. \n \nRegardless of the regulatory climate, companies and their directors are well-served by being able to articulate a long-term business strategy that considers the risks faced by the company and how the board oversees those risk areas, including cybersecurity and climate change risks. They also should be able to explain to investors how the company\u2019s executive compensation fits with the business strategy and risks, and how the board\u2019s composition and refreshment plans tie back to the strategy and risks. Private ordering is calling on companies and boards to do these things and to do them well. \n \nThis memorandum is provided by Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP and its affiliates for educational and informational purposes only and is not intended and should not be construed as legal advice.

In 2016, the CFPB continued to aggressively enforce federal consumer protection laws, including imposing its largest civil penalty to date \u2014 $100 million \u2014 in a settlement announced in September. But two developments in 2016 threaten to disrupt the CFPB\u2019s operations: the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit\u2019s PHH decision and the election of Donald Trump. \n Enforcement Actions Trending Downward  \nThe CFPB has filed more than 160 enforcement matters to date, including more than 40 in 2016 alone. These actions have resulted in restitution to consumers totaling more than $4.4 billion and civil money penalties (CMPs) of more than $580.9 million. The following chart summarizes CFPB enforcement actions over the last five years: \n \nAs the chart shows, after a very active 2015, the CFPB\u2019s restitution and civil penalties from enforcement actions decreased in 2016. Moreover, the majority of the total penalties assessed in 2016 related to one case \u2014 the CFPB\u2019s September 8, 2016, settlement with Wells Fargo regarding sales practices. \n Recent Court Decisions Limit CFPB Power  \nTwo court decisions in 2016 have placed significant constraints on CFPB authority. In CFPB v. Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools , the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia held that the CFPB did not have the authority to issue a civil investigative demand (CID), a type of administrative subpoena, to an accreditor of for-profit colleges. This case, decided on April 21, 2016, represents the first time that a federal court has quashed a CFPB CID. In doing so, the court noted that the CFPB\u2019s investigative authority is limited to inquiries regarding potential violations of consumer financial laws, and that there is no \"clear nexus\" between these laws and the for-profit college accreditation process. The court also warned, \u201cAlthough it is understandable that new agencies like the CFPB will struggle to establish the exact parameters of their authority, they must be especially prudent before choosing to plow head long into fields not clearly ceded to them by Congress.\u201d The CFPB has appealed this decision to the D.C. Circuit, with a ruling expected in 2017. \n \nA second decision poses an even greater threat to the authority of the CFPB\u2019s director. In October 2016, in PHH Corp. v. CFPB , two of three judges on the D.C. Circuit held that the single-director structure of the CFPB was unconstitutional and a departure from the setup of other independent agencies, which are overseen by multimember commissions. The court stressed that placing so much power in the hands of a single director was particularly concerning because, given the broad scope of the CFPB\u2019s authority and jurisdiction, the agency exercises \u201cmassive power.\u201d The court concluded that the provision governing removal of the CFPB director \u2014 which authorizes removal by the U.S. president only for cause \u2014 violates constitutional separation-of-powers principles. However, rather than shut down the agency, the court severed the removal provision from the rest of the statute, a narrow remedy that would allow the CFPB to continue to operate and give the president the authority to remove the director at will. \n \nThe PHH case has a complicated history. In 2014, the CFPB filed an administrative action against PHH alleging that the company\u2019s captive reinsurance agreements violated the anti-kickback provisions of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act. After a trial, an administrative law judge ruled against PHH but assessed damages at $6.9 million. Both PHH and the CFPB sought CFPB Director Richard Cordray\u2019s review of that decision. On review, Director Cordray broadened the relief significantly and ordered PHH to pay $109 million in disgorgement. PHH appealed to the D.C. Circuit, arguing in part that the structure of the CFPB was unconstitutional. \n \nThe CFPB has since filed a petition for rehearing en banc by the D.C. Circuit, asserting that this \u201cmay be the most important separation-of-powers case in a generation.\u201d In the interim, the court has stayed its issuance of a mandate, so the ruling has no immediate legal effect. \n Election Brings More Uncertainty to the CFPB\u2019s Future  \nAt the political level, President Trump\u2019s victory and continued Republican majorities in the House and Senate introduce significant uncertainty with respect to the CFPB\u2019s future in three primary ways: \n Removal of the Director. Now that he has taken office, President Trump may take action to remove Director Cordray even before a final ruling in the PHH case. The president could seek to fire Director Cordray for cause \u2014 that is, for \u201cinefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office\u201d \u2014 citing actions Director Cordray has taken during his term that CFPB critics claim exceeded his authority. Alternatively, President Trump may conclude that he has the independent authority to decide whether the CFPB\u2019s structure is constitutional and remove Director Cordray without cause. Either action would be controversial and could lead Director Cordray to sue President Trump to get his job back.  Legislative Action. On the campaign trail, President Trump promised to \u201cdismantle\u201d the Dodd-Frank Act, which created the CFPB. Although it is unlikely that the law would be repealed in full and the CFPB shut down, the Trump administration and the Republican Congress are expected to support sweeping changes to the statute and the CFPB\u2019s structure and authority. Indeed, in late 2016, House Financial Services Chairman Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, introduced the Financial CHOICE Act, a bill that would require substantial changes to the Dodd-Frank Act and to the CFPB\u2019s structure and funding, including replacing the CFPB director with a multimember commission and subjecting the agency to the congressional appropriations process.  U.S. Supreme Court. President Trump will seek to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court left by Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s death in early 2016. It is unlikely that any new Supreme Court justice would be particularly sympathetic to the CFPB, and, in any event, such appointment increases the chances that, should the Court review the PHH decision, it would (1) decide that the CFPB\u2019s structure is unconstitutional and (2) possibly reach a broader view of the appropriate remedy, such as invalidating all of Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act, which created the CFPB and introduced the prohibition of unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices.  Looking Ahead  \nTwo CFPB rules have generated significant controversy since they were proposed in 2016 and are likely to be at risk under the new administration and Republican Congress: one that would prohibit certain mandatory arbitration clauses in consumer financial contracts and another that would restrict certain payday, auto title and high-cost installment loans. Despite the challenging political landscape for the CFPB, it has recently indicated that priorities for the new year will include continued focus on redlining, as well as emerging fair lending focus on mortgage and student loan default servicing and small business lending. Undoubtedly, the wide range of the CFPB\u2019s authority, and its exercise of that power, will be scrutinized carefully in 2017 and beyond. \n\nThis memorandum is provided by Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP and its affiliates for educational and informational purposes only and is not intended and should not be construed as legal advice.

This strategy continued into the post-election lame-duck period, with new sanctions against Russia, further changes to the Iran sanctions, the easing of sanctions on Sudan and the continued targeting of North Korea, terrorist networks and transnational criminal organizations. \n \nPresident Donald Trump has been critical \u2014 during the campaign and since his election victory \u2014 of the Obama administration\u2019s approach to Iran, Russia and Cuba, raising the prospect of sanctions-related policy changes in his administration. Regardless of how the Trump administration deploys sanctions as a tool of U.S. foreign policy, we expect continued vigorous enforcement of sanctions violations by federal and state regulators. \n Iran  \nDuring the campaign, President Trump threatened to dismantle and renegotiate the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) negotiated by China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States (the P5+1) with Iran. In exchange for steps taken by Iran with respect to its nuclear program, the U.S. suspended certain sanctions on Iran, with a principal focus on lifting so-called secondary sanctions that targeted non-U.S. financial institutions and other non-U.S. companies doing business with Iran. (See our January 28, 2016, client alert \u201c 'Implementation Day': Key Aspects of US and EU Implementation of Iran Sanctions Relief \u201d and our July 23, 2015, client alert \u201c Sanctions Relief Under the P5+1 Agreement With Iran: Implications for US, EU and International Business .\u201d) The United Nations and European Union simultaneously lifted many of their respective sanctions on Iran. \n \nWe see four broad sanctions scenarios available to the Trump administration with respect to Iran. \n \n1. Maintenance of Status Quo. Although unlikely in view of the statements made to date, it is conceivable that the Trump administration could generally continue the path the Obama administration took if there is a determination that core U.S. objectives are being achieved under the deal. The Obama approach to Iran sanctions post-JCPOA principally involved the implementation of the JCPOA sanctions relief and a limited number of \u201cmaintenance\u201d actions sanctioning individuals and entities for non-nuclear Iranian conduct that falls outside the scope of the negotiated relief. \n \n2. Withdrawal From the JCPOA. The JCPOA is not a treaty, but rather an executive agreement with voluntary undertakings by the parties. The Trump administration could unilaterally withdraw the United States from the JCPOA. Alternatively, the administration could reimpose some or all sanctions for which relief was provided under the deal \u2014 with or without a violation by Iran. Iran would likely respond to a reimposition of suspended sanctions, regardless of the motivation for such a step, by asserting a U.S. breach and taking counteractions of its own. In all likelihood, even if the JCPOA dispute resolution mechanism is employed, a material breach by either party would result in the deal\u2019s demise. \n \nThe U.S. would be expected to follow a collapse of the deal with a robust sanctions campaign. However, if the United States was blamed for the deal\u2019s failure, it could create diplomatic challenges for the U.S. with key allies, including European partners that were essential to sanctions efforts before the JCPOA and would be important to any renewed sanctions intended as leverage to achieve new deal terms. \n \n3. Preservation of JCPOA Sanctions Relief While Increasing Non-Nuclear Sanctions. In light of the challenges associated with withdrawal from the JCPOA, President Trump could continue implementation of the negotiated nuclear-related sanctions relief but increase non-nuclear sanctions on Iran ( e.g ., sanctions related to support for terrorism, human rights abuses, activities in Syria). Such measures could include the designation of additional actors under existing authorities and the imposition of new categories of sanctions by executive order. Alternatively, the administration could let Congress take the lead on new measures and then implement the statutory sanctions. \n \nIt is likely that such an approach would be met by Iranian accusations of a breach of the spirit, if not the letter, of the agreement. Whether or not this approach could trigger the end of the JCPOA will likely depend on the nature of any new sanctions, the extent of their economic impact and whether the new measures would replicate relieved sanctions in practice if not in name. Also in question is how they might play out domestically in Iran in the context of its presidential election in May 2017 and how election politics could drive the Iranian response. \n \n4. Return to the Negotiating Table? If President Trump pushes for renegotiation of the JCPOA, the willingness of Iran and the other members of the P5+1 to participate will be essential. That said, it is unclear what new terms may be sought from Iran with respect to its nuclear program, or whether the negotiations could potentially expand in scope to include other areas of concern for the U.S. government, such as Iran\u2019s support for terrorist groups and its activities in Syria. Similarly, it is far from clear what the U.S. might offer with respect to sanctions relief in the context of any renewed negotiations. \n \nAt this early stage of the Trump presidency, it appears most likely that the administration will continue to provide the technical nuclear-related U.S. sanctions relief under the JCPOA but \u2014 either on its own or through Congress \u2014 increase non-nuclear sanctions on Iran. \n Russia  \nU.S. sanctions against Russia have received significant attention in recent weeks and months, including as a result of new U.S. sanctions targeting Russia\u2019s principal intelligence services, the FSB and the GRU. On January 11, 2017, President Trump\u2019s nominee for secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, asserted in his Senate confirmation hearing that Russia \u201cposes a danger\u201d to the United States. He also appeared to signal simultaneously no immediate change on policy with regard to sanctions against Russia and a willingness to review the current approach, stating it is \u201cimportant that we keep the status quo until we are able to develop what our approach is going to be.\u201d Later that same week, then-President-elect Trump stated in an interview with The Wall Street Journal that he would keep certain sanctions on Russia \u201cat least for a period of time\u201d but signaled that he would consider relieving them if Russia proved helpful on other U.S. policy objectives, such as counterterrorism. \n \nWhile Congress passed two pieces of sanctions legislation in 2014 with respect to the situation in Ukraine, most U.S. sanctions on Russia have been imposed via executive order. Consequently, if the Trump administration were to adopt a shift in U.S. policy toward Russia, nearly all current U.S. sanctions on Russia could be modified or removed by executive action. \n \nA radical shift in U.S. sanctions on Russia without a corresponding change in Russia\u2019s activities involving at least Ukraine and Syria would likely encounter significant objections, and a legislative response, by many in Congress. On January 10, 2017, five Democratic and five Republican senators announced a new Russia sanctions bill, the Countering Russian Hostilities Act of 2017, which seeks to limit the flexibility of the president and includes new measures that, if enacted, would be among the most powerful sanctions imposed on Russia since the first round of Ukraine-related sanctions were issued in March 2014. The timing of the introduction of the bill \u2014 the day before the Tillerson confirmation hearing \u2014 appeared intended to send a message that Congress plans to be an active participant in setting Russia policy. \n \nSanctions on Russia in response to the situation in eastern Ukraine have been a trans-Atlantic effort, with closely coordinated measures by the U.S. and the European Union. A change in U.S. policy toward Russia \u2014 or even a less resolute status quo \u2014 would likely have ramifications for EU sanctions as well, where the retention of sanctions measures requires unanimity among the 28 member states. In that regard, there are three important tests for the EU in the next six months, when the EU financial sanctions against targeted individuals and entities (March 2017), the EU restrictive measures against Crimea and Sevastopol (June 2017), and the EU sectoral sanctions on Russia (July 2017) all come up for renewal. \n Cuba  \nSanctions involving Cuba received less attention than those on Iran and Russia during the U.S. presidential campaign. President Trump has criticized the Obama administration\u2019s shift in the decades-long U.S. policy toward Cuba and several rounds of sanctions easing, tweeting that \u201cif Cuba is unwilling to make a better deal for the Cuban people ... I will terminate [the] deal.\u201d During his confirmation hearing, Tillerson indicated that a review of Cuba policy would be undertaken, including \u201cthe change in the status of travel to Cuba as well as business activities in Cuba\u201d and the appropriateness of Cuba\u2019s 2015 delisting as a state sponsor of terrorism. \n \nAlthough the Obama administration\u2019s changes have allowed for increased travel from the United States to Cuba and more commercial activity between the two countries, most elements of the U.S. embargo remain in place. If President Trump were to reverse the easing of sanctions, he could do so easily and quickly, as the steps President Obama took were all done by executive action and could be undone in the same fashion. \n \nAlthough the longer-term approach to Cuba is unclear, it appears likely in the near term that the Trump administration will hit the pause button on Cuba while it conducts the policy review Tillerson referenced. During this period, we do not expect a reversal of the Obama administration\u2019s changes; however, further rounds of easing are unlikely. \n \nThis memorandum is provided by Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP and its affiliates for educational and informational purposes only and is not intended and should not be construed as legal advice.

That's something you've got to get through, the first 10-15 overs are crucial. With the line-up that we play, if we can have wickets in the shed at the back end then we will score a lot of runs at the end of the (innings).\" \n \nThe keeper found out the perils of taking on Eden Park's small boundaries when he played at the ground for the first time last February, caught at cow corner trying to heave Corey Anderson over the ropes. \n \nThe Australians were all out for 148 on that occasion, with the Black Caps' seamers running riot on the way to a 2-1 series win. It was a similar story a year earlier, with the Aussies skittled for 151 in a World Cup clash that the Kiwis only won by a wicket. \n \nAt the same time, Eden Park's unusual dimensions have resulted in big scores before. Although the tourists failed to pass 150 last time around, New Zealand posted a score of 8-307 in the same game. \n \nIndeed, before Australia's innings that day, seven of the last eight innings at the ground had gone past 280 runs. \n \n\"(The Eden Park pitch) just has a bit in it,\" New Zealand veteran Ross Taylor said. \"I don't think there is a par score, some wickets here are 300, some are 200. \n \n\"You just have to analyse it as quickly as possible, whether you're batting or bowling.\" \n \nThe Kiwis were trounced 3-0 in Australia when the sides met in December, but Wade is expecting a tougher time on New Zealand's turf. \n \n\"We played them in Australia (on) big grounds (with) long boundaries. It's a completely different ball game,\" he said. \n \n\"(On) the smaller grounds (in New Zealand) they'll still play aggressive; they're still going to be able to hit plenty of fours and sixes at grounds that they play at. \n \n\"They play well here (in NZ) and they play this venue very well. \n \n\"We like to think we're hard to beat in Australia and it's the same when we come here - we expect a hard challenge over the next three games but we've got a young squad and we're excited to go out and really have a crack at it.\" \n \nCaptaining the side for the first time, Wade maintains his job is simply to continue the fine work of the leadership duo of Steve Smith and vice-captain David Warner. \n \n\"I don't think for me personally it's about putting a stamp on the team,\" he said. \"It's about driving the values and the game plan that we have in one-day cricket moving forward. \n \n\"Steven and David have put their stamp on the team, it's just about me keeping on driving those key messages through to the players. \n \n\"We've performed really well in one-day cricket over a long period of time so it's not about trying to change too much - it's about keeping the ball rolling.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"New Zealand news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Aussies wary of Black Caps on home turf","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"AU","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Central & North Burnett Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"606907337","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Central & North Burnett Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.centralnorthburnetttimes.com.au"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201504669","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T14:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:06:52Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://media.apnarm.net.au/img/media/images/2017/01/29/b88557687z1_20170129162619_000g9dg4eu82-0-5o7dbx25uooe6wninn2_t325x200.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Stirling in London; Pascal Bine and Olivier Diaz in Paris; and Matthias Horbach and Stephan Hutter in Frankfurt provide insights on the developments impacting activity in the United Kingdom, France and Germany, respectively. \n UNITED KINGDOM  \nM&A Update \n \nM&A activity in the U.K. was, under the circumstances, relatively robust in 2016, albeit not as strong as in 2015. Deal volume was down, in large part due to political uncertainty surrounding the June 2016 Brexit vote and the November U.S. election. Although this uncertainty was partially offset by the devaluation of the pound following the Brexit referendum, which made U.K. assets relatively cheaper, and while strong inbound interest from both the U.S. and Asia remains, the overall value of U.K. M&A activity relied on a smaller number of relatively high-value deals, such as the London Stock Exchange Group/Deutsche Börse merger and SoftBank's acquisition of ARM Holdings. \n \nFor 2017, insofar as domestic activity is concerned, uncertainty as to the structure and timetable for Brexit is expected to exert downward pressure, although the continued availability of debt and (if the markets stay strong) equity financing should offset that to some extent. \n \nFrom a cross-border perspective, the corrections in the values of the pound and, to a lesser extent, the euro have reduced the apparent cost of European assets for non-European acquirers. This should result in a continued increase in inbound interest, though that interest has not yet translated into significant deal volumes in the U.K. This may in part be because, although in the short term the reduction in value of the pound has lowered the cost of investment in the U.K. for international acquirers and increased the value of exports, the macroeconomic consequences may be unclear for a while. Markets have responded to the decline in the pound with a material rise in market capitalization of U.K.-listed companies that have international exposure. Additionally, imports are commensurately more expensive, and the future levels of tariffs are unknown. Finally, uncertainty surrounding the U.K.'s ability to strike favorable trade deals with other non-EU countries remains. \n \nOther macro factors will likely have a greater specific impact on individual industries. For example, regulatory and financial pressures on the financial services sector, in particular on mixed financial businesses, are likely to lead to pressure for disaggregation, while the settlement of long-running disputes may make some assets more sellable. In the insurance industry, specifically, market fundamentals that have underpinned activity in the sector remain in place. Meanwhile, Solvency II, which regulators intended to reduce regulatory risk by harmonizing capital requirements, has been in place for more than a year, and the impact of the changes to regulatory requirements on potential targets is becoming clearer, as most insurers have reported information showing the effect on their capital positions. Thus, there is greater clarity for companies in buying mode and diversified groups in determining where their capital can be most effectively deployed. This is likely to lead to realignment and consequential transactional activity on both the buy and sell sides this year. Many who have carried out significant analysis and planning in connection with potential deals now appear to be moving toward a position where they consider the consequences of Brexit manageable. \n \nThe broad shape of Brexit is starting to become clearer. Prime Minister Theresa May provided clarity as to the U.K. government's intentions in a speech on January 17, 2017. (See our January 20, 2017, client alert \u201c UK Prime Minister Outlines Objectives for Exiting the EU .\u201d) We now know the U.K. government will have to leave the single European market. Additionally, in order to negotiate its own trade deals, the U.K. also will have to leave, either wholly or substantially, the customs union. The U.K. government intends to negotiate a trade deal with the EU and incorporate arrangements beneficial to specific sectors, such as retaining some version of existing \u201cpassporting\u201d rights for financial services institutions, with automotive manufacturing also likely to be a hot topic. While the U.K.'s starting point is coming into focus, however, there is little concrete information on what to expect at a granular level and what both the U.K. and the EU would consider acceptable. Companies across sectors should expect continuing uncertainty while the overall position becomes clearer. \n \nPresident Donald Trump said the U.S. would work to complete a new trade deal with the U.K. quickly once he assumed office, a suggestion that is being cautiously welcomed \u2014 provided the outcome isn\u2019t shaped by the more aggressively protectionist positioning that President Trump has at times adopted. The evolution of this and other trade deals and what, precisely, Prime Minister May's vision of a \u201cglobal Britain\u201d means will likely be dominant factors this year. \n \nCooperation With Other Nations, Use of DPAs May Drive Investigation Increase \n \nWhen the U.K.'s Bribery Act came into effect in July 2011, many expected U.S.-style Foreign Corrupt Practices Act enforcement to become more prevalent in Britain. And while the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) has brought only four actions against corporations since the Bribery Act\u2019s enactment, there are indications that investigations are on the rise. One reason for the low number of investigations so far is that the Bribery Act does not apply to conduct before July 2011. From detection through investigation to enforcement, bribery proceedings can take several years, making it likely that we will see a significant number of cases in the future. \n \nA higher volume of whistleblower activity due to such developments as enhanced whistleblower protections, an increased awareness and acceptance of \u201cspeaking up,\u201d and significant journalistic coverage of high-profile investigations like the Panama Papers also could drive an increase in enforcement activity. Additionally, increased cooperation with other national regulators, both formal and informal, has improved the speed and effectiveness with which prosecutors are able to obtain evidence of corporate misconduct from abroad, including through coordinated searches in multiple jurisdictions. \n \nWhile the SFO has long worked closely with the U.S. Department of Justice, it now also collaborates with a growing number of other regulators in cross-border investigations. For example, the Alstom case involved cooperation between prosecutors in the U.K., Switzerland and Hungary. In September 2014, the SFO brought corruption and conspiracy charges against Alstom Network UK Ltd relating to transport projects in India, Poland and Tunisia. Two company executives also were charged with the same offenses. In December 2014, the SFO brought further charges \u2014 under the Prevention of Corruption Act 1906 and the Criminal Law Act 1977 \u2014 against Alstom Power Ltd and two executives for offenses committed between 2002 and 2010 related to the refurbishment of the Lithuanian Power Plant. \n \nThe U.K. also has made significant changes to its criminal justice system to try to increase its prosecutions of corporations for serious crimes. These changes include clarifying sentencing guidelines for corporate corruption and introducing deferred prosecution agreements (DPAs). DPAs, which are common in the U.S., encourage companies to cooperate with the government in cases involving economic and financial offenses. If a company\u2019s conduct meets defined criteria and it agrees to certain conditions, including the payment of financial penalties, a company may elect to use a DPA to avoid prosecution. In contrast to the U.S., the entire DPA process is subject to judicial oversight and approval, which provides greater insight into the decision-making of the judges and the prosecution, as well as a transparency around the factors that will be taken into account. In the Rolls Royce DPA announced in mid-January 2017, the judge went to great lengths to explain the company\u2019s \u201cextraordinary cooperation,\" even though other aggravating features of its conduct tended to support a prosecution. \n FRANCE  \nM&A: Domestic Activity Up, Cross-Border Down in 2016 \n \nThe French M&A market experienced an 8.1 percent increase in deal value in 2016 (compared to 2015), reaching \u20ac76.2 billion on 869 deals, 75 more than 2015, according to Mergermarket. The most active sectors in 2016 were financial services; pharmaceutical, medical and biotechnology; energy, mining and utilities; industrial and chemicals; and real estate. However, such statistics are impacted by the \u20ac18.5 billion Crédit Agricole/Sacam transaction (a transfer of a minority interest in the regional banks to Crédit Agricole\u2019s parent company) \u2014 without it, deal value decreased by 18 percent compared to the previous year. \n \nDomestic M&A accounted for the highest deal volume (\u20ac41.9 billion, up 102.1 percent), while inbound M&A experienced a 31 percent decrease at \u20ac34.3 billion, a third of which was the \u20ac11.4 billion exchange of assets between France-based Sanofi and Boehringer Ingelheim of Germany. Chinese buyers continue to show interest in inbound M&A, especially in the hospitality business, with deals such as Jin Jiang\u2019s acquisition of the Louvre Hotels Group and of a significant interest in hotel group Accor. \n \nOutbound M&A by French companies reached \u20ac43.7 billion in 2016, a 1.2 percent decrease compared to 2015. Transactions included the acquisition of U.S.-based WhiteWave by Danone (\u20ac11.3 billion), the merger between Technip and U.S.-based FMC Technologies (\u20ac4 billion), the acquisition by Accor of Canada-based Fairmont Raffles Hotels International ($2.7 billion) and the recently announced acquisition by car equipment manufacturer Valeo of the Japanese company Ichikoh. Low interest rates and easy access to funding could spur French companies in search of growth to pursue outbound opportunities in 2017, especially in the telecommunications, media and technology sectors. \n \nPrivate equity continues to represent a significant portion of the market, with private equity buyout and exit transactions involving French companies totaling \u20ac25.2 billion. In some instances, private equity and private equity-led companies have competed head to head with corporates for significant businesses, as in aircraft engineering company Safran\u2019s auction of Morpho, a biometric identification business. Advent International-sponsored Oberthur eventually won the auction over Gemalto; both are digital security companies. \n \nImplications of French Elections in 2017 \n \nHistorically, election years have not been good for M&A in France, which will hold presidential elections in May and parliamentary elections in June, as people tend to wait for the policies of the new administration to become clear before making business decisions. Transactions involving companies where the French state has a significant interest are likely to be the most affected. Material transactions in strategic sectors, for example those in which the foreign investment control regime applies, may be perceived as more difficult. \n \nSeveral presidential candidates, such as conservative and pro-business François Fillon (the right-wing candidate) or social-liberal Emmanuel Macron (the center candidate), propose to liberalize the French labor market as well as reduce taxation on companies and individuals. Fillon has indicated that he would promote France\u2019s disposal of government-owned equity interests that are perceived as nonstrategic. This may prompt companies in which such interests are held to pursue strategic partnerships as a way to secure a stable shareholder base, thus spurring M&A activity. \n \nWith the parliamentary elections, it is possible that the new legislature could simplify the M&A process in France, which remains unnecessarily burdensome in certain aspects. For example, cross-border deals involving a French company require a time-consuming tax-ruling process, the legality of which is currently being challenged under European Union law. \n \nFrance Looks to Attract Business After Brexit \n \nBrexit has had minimal impact on French transactions, including those with a U.K. component. For example, the Technip/FMC Technologies merger, which was announced prior to the Brexit vote, was completed on January 16, 2017. It combined the French- and U.S.-based companies into a new U.K. entity, with completion pursuant to the original structure unaffected by the Brexit vote. Likewise, Nissan, which has a strategic alliance and shares its CEO with French company Renault, has confirmed its plan to manufacture its successful Qashqai SUV in the U.K. as long as the U.K. government gives certain assurances. In the financial sector, French banks have confirmed they have no plans to materially reduce their presence in the U.K. \n \nOn the other hand, France is keen on attracting businesses currently located in the U.K., as well as foreign investors already in the U.K. or considering investments there. The current French government has plans to reduce its corporate tax rate progressively to 28 percent and to extend the tax favorable \u201cimpatriation\u201d regime, which provides benefits to non-French employees relocated in the country, from five to eight years. France also has favorable tax breaks for research and development (\u201ccrédit d\u2019impôt recherche\u201d), which it is trying to promote to attract research programs. \n \nFrance also hopes to attract more business from financial institutions that do business across Europe from London. In addition, France is advocating in the EU for the relocation of the euro-settlement of transactions in the eurozone. \n \nEnforcement and Regulatory Developments \n \nFrance has adopted a new anti-corruption law, \"Sapin II,\" which was inspired by the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, and which has extraterritorial implications. It requires that large French companies, including their foreign subsidiaries, implement a compliance program; and it allows for the prosecution of acts of corruption committed abroad by French nationals or by persons who ordinarily reside in France or carry out all or part of their economic activity in France. In addition, Sapin II has created a new French anti-corruption authority (\u201cAgence française anti-corruption\u201d) that is responsible for monitoring compliance programs and ensuring that French companies subject to foreign investigations comply with the French blocking statute (\u201cloi de blocage\u201d), which may block discovery requests from foreign authorities. With regard to sanctions for acts of corruption, the law has created a settlement agreement procedure (\u201cconvention judiciaire d\u2019intérêt public\u201d) similar to the deferred prosecution agreement used in the U.S. \n \nFrench authorities responsible for controlling direct foreign investments in France are focusing increasingly on economic and technological security issues: preservation of essential infrastructure and sensitive technologies, access to vital resources, energy independence, protection of strategic sectors and cybersecurity. \n \nFrench-listed corporations and their executive officers will continue to face stricter governance requirements and best practices. The corporate governance code for listed corporations (\u201ccode de gouvernement d\u2019entreprise des sociétés cotées AFEP-MEDEF\u201d) was amended in fall 2016. The strategic role of the board of directors has been heightened, the criteria used to assess directors' independence have been specified and the rules governing executive compensation have been strengthened. Meanwhile, under Sapin II, the compensation of executive officers of French-listed companies is now subject to prior authorization by the shareholders, and subsequent shareholder approval of the compensation effectively paid is now compulsory. Furthermore, financial disclosure requirements also have been strengthened, in accordance with the Market Abuse Regulation and as a result of the stricter position taken by the French financial markets authority (\u201cAutorité des marchés financiers\u201d) with regard to issuers' permanent disclosure obligations. These changes have occurred in a context characterized by the development of shareholder activism in France \u2014 though not at the levels found in the U.S. and the U.K. \u2014 and by increasing shareholder engagement. \n GERMANY  \nM&A: Political Influences, Governance Requirements, Activism and China \n \nGerman M&A activity in 2016 was broadly in line with prior years, except for a degree of softening in the third quarter of the year due to general uncertainty regarding economic prospects in Europe and Asia as well as political factors such as Brexit, the U.S. election and the constitutional referendum in Italy. Despite unexpected results in all but the Italian referendum, and recognizing that the outcomes in the U.K. and the U.S. are expected to result in changes of policy in those countries, the fact that these votes have passed lifted some of the reservations concerning M&A activity in the fourth quarter. The upcoming elections in France, the Netherlands and Germany are not expected to significantly affect German transaction activity. \n \nIn the past year, sellers often were industrial companies divesting individual divisions and private equity sponsors taking advantage of high prices. Distressed and forced sales continued to be rare. Strategic buyers leveraged the availability of cash and cheap financing to achieve growth through acquisitions, winning auctions for a number of high-profile transactions, such as the acquisition of the coffee machine and cookware producer WMF by French Groupe SEB for close to \u20ac1.6 billion. Higher valuations made it more difficult for private equity sponsors to achieve the yields they require, resulting in fewer buyouts and smaller deals overall with private equity sponsors as buyers. Apart from a few exceptions, individual domestic M&A transactions were generally valued below \u20ac1 billion in 2016. Outbound transactions included a number of significant deals by German corporates in the United States, such as the acquisition by Bayer AG of Monsanto Co. for approximately $66 billion and the acquisition by Lanxess AG of Chemtura Corp. for approximately $2.7 billion. Another significant cross-border deal was the December 2016 announcement that U.S.-based Praxair would purchase Germany's Linde for $35 billion. \n \nThe number of public transactions in Germany was relatively flat compared to prior years and did not reflect the rise in stock prices and economic growth. In our view, this is at least in part a function of German corporate governance requirements and of the need to address complex rules applicable to public companies or to corporations in general. German public companies increasingly find themselves in situations in which they must defend against shareholder activism, including funds acquiring positions in the company and organized opposition from existing shareholders, or address unsolicited or competing bids. While such activity has been (and is likely to continue to be) less aggressive in Germany than in the U.S., investors are taking an increasingly active role, asserting pressure on previously entrenched management and supervisory boards by demanding transactions, reorganizations or other actions to unlock value for shareholders. \n \nA number of other factors are influencing the M&A environment in Germany. Merger control issues are on the rise as a result of an increase in strategic M&A, leading to more frequent dispositions of assets. As a consequence, \u201chell or high water\u201d provisions and reverse-termination fees have become more important. Additionally, Chinese investors, which account for a higher level of activity than previously, now tend to focus on high-profile and technology-leading companies and are prepared (and able) to pay high prices for these businesses \u2014 often justified by the expectation that a German target will be able to successfully access the Chinese market. The level of investments by Chinese buyers in the year ahead will depend on the economy and regulatory changes in China itself (see \u201c Regional Focus: Asia \u201d), as well as currency stability, the recognition of China as a market economy under the World Trade Organization, and the general political climate between China and the United States. Regardless, the success of Chinese buyers thus far has prompted political concerns and initiatives to tighten foreign investment controls on a European level. Reviews under the applicable German foreign investment control regimes have already intensified, making the identity of buyers and the presentation of their background increasingly relevant in bid evaluations. \n \nLooking ahead, we expect corporations to increase the number and overall scope of acquisitions. Share buybacks and extraordinary dividends are often no longer regarded as desirable instruments, and corporates feel pressure to expand their businesses. Transformational M&A will play an important role. In addition, distressed M&A should rise as lenders are less likely, for regulatory and other reasons, to retain outstanding defaulted loans or other indebtedness with limited likelihood of repayment. \n \nBrexit: German Perspective \n \nThe impact of Brexit on the German business climate has generally been rather limited. Parties (both German and international) considering investments in Germany do not appear to have placed critical weight on the U.K.\u2019s exit from the European Union. However, investments by German corporates in the U.K. have been affected by the prospect of Brexit as German corporates have postponed a number of transactions there until more clarity on the terms of Brexit becomes available. Companies should take advantage of the common market rules before Brexit becomes effective, including by amending supply channels in order to avoid possible tariffs, making use of the free movement of labor and capital within the EU, and obtaining, where necessary, additional licenses to secure the continuation of operations, among other issues. \n \nWhile some commentators posit that Frankfurt may benefit over time as a financial center in continental Europe, it is too early to tell whether that will be the case. Ultimately, if Brexit results in an increase of strategic investments in the EU (especially from non-EU buyers), Germany\u2019s share of activity may increase over time because of its actual or perceived relative economic and political stability when compared to other EU member states. The real risk of Brexit in the longer term is the general political impact it may have on the fabric of the EU as a whole. As the ongoing refugee and financial crises in certain countries continue to depress pro-EU sentiments, the underlying question is whether the populist movements across Europe will continue to see voter support and whether initiatives in other countries ( e.g. , Austria, France, Italy, Netherlands) to leave the eurozone or the EU will gain momentum. \n EUROPEAN CAPITAL MARKETS  \nCapital markets in Europe were mixed in 2016. The year saw a healthy volume of high-yield issuances in Europe after a very quiet start of the year. In the U.K., the Brexit vote impacted high-yield issuances somewhat, but such issuances continue. Initial public offering (IPO) volumes were down compared to previous years, but the IPO market this year should be open for strong candidates. Political developments (the Brexit vote, the Italian referendum rejecting reform proposals and the U.S. election) created periods when the capital markets were not generally available for new issuances. However, these \"closed periods\" were relatively short, and it is unclear how much these developments affected capital market activity overall. European capital markets have dealt with political volatility \u2014 notably the Greek debt crisis \u2014 for years, and investors seem to have become accustomed to such challenges. \n \nThe first part of the year has seen strong volumes of high-yield issuances in Europe. Looking ahead, if attractive interest rates on loans continue to be available, some existing high-yield issuers may look to refinance bonds with lower-cost loans, which would limit the number of \"debut\" high-yield issuers. The outlook for the IPO market remains uncertain, but the recent increases in key U.S. stock market indices give reasons for optimism. Rising interest rates in the U.S. may prompt U.S. issuers to seek euro-denominated debt if such rates are lower in Europe. In addition, any changes to the sanctions currently in place with respect to Russia could increase capital market activity coming from that region. \n \nDACH: Volatility and HETA Restructuring \n \nThe capital markets in the DACH region (Germany, Austria and Switzerland) continue to be characterized by market volatility, mainly because of the European refugee crisis and the continuing financial crisis in countries such as Greece and Italy, as well as Brexit and its implications. \n \nMost equity transactions in Germany last year (in terms of volume) originated from corporate realignment activity and a few large spin-offs, in part because of increasing pressure on German corporate boards to create shareholder value and deliver returns to shareholders. \n \nIn an environment where investors are risk-averse and seek to preserve exit options, the current stock markets favor larger, more liquid stocks. The climate for IPO candidates whose valuation was below \u20ac1 billion was difficult in 2016, a trend likely to continue in 2017. This was particularly true for companies in the technology, biotechnology or other growth sectors because of their risk profile, lack of liquidity and (related) valuation discounts. Most IPOs/private equity exits were structured as dual-track processes, and in light of the difficulties for smaller IPO candidates, most ended up as a trade sale or were abandoned. \n \nIn light of the ongoing market volatility, companies that intend to go public or raise capital on the equity markets increasingly are seeking to reduce their time to market by substantially completing due diligence and documentation processes in advance through \u201cin the drawer\u201d prospectus documents. As a result, thorough and well-crafted information for future investors is available early in the process, facilitating investor education, premarketing efforts and possible preplacements, which have lowered risk for equity transactions in the region. \n \nIn the DACH debt markets, the \u20ac11 billion tender and exchange offer of existing debt instruments of Austrian bank HETA by the province of Carinthia (represented by Skadden) was a landmark transaction likely to redefine the handling of future distressed debt restructurings of subsovereign obligations in Europe. The transaction involved a number of firsts in Europe, including the first successful distressed debt offer and restructuring under the EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD), and constitutes an important precedent in Europe with regard to new ground rules on subsovereign distressed debt negotiations imposed by European member states as a result of the implementation of the BRRD. \n \nThe German debt markets were characterized by a high volume and significant number of corporate (investment grade) debt issuances in 2016. We expect this method of raising significant liquidity to continue this year, as the European Central Bank announced it would keep interest rates at historically low levels in the EU region. On the other hand, we saw fewer high-yield debt issuances in 2016 than in previous years due to the access by noninvestment-grade issuers to less expensive bank financings (increasingly with local financial institutions more intimately familiar with an issuer's business model, financial situation and prospects). \n\nThis memorandum is provided by Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP and its affiliates for educational and informational purposes only and is not intended and should not be construed as legal advice.

number of economic and political factors, both domestic and international, influenced M&A and capital markets activity worldwide in 2016. Skadden attorneys Christopher W. Betts , Will H. Cai , Z. Julie Gao , Bradley A. Klein , Steve Kwok and Haiping Li in Hong Kong; Nobuhisa Ishizuka and Kenji Taneda in Tokyo; and Jonathan B. Stone in Hong Kong and Rajeev P. Duggal and Parveet Singh Gandoak in Singapore provide insights on the developments impacting activity in China, Japan and India, respectively. \n CHINA  \nStrong Momentum in Outbound M&A Activity \n \nChina\u2019s outbound M&A activity continued its strong showing in 2016, reaching approximately US$247.5 billion and surpassing the record set in 2015. Underlying the trend are a number of factors, including a desire to expand into new territories following domestic consolidations in a broad range of industries and to acquire strategic technologies amid the slowdown in China\u2019s domestic economic growth. Turbulence in the Chinese stock markets, coupled with the market expectation of renminbi (RMB) depreciation, have driven Chinese enterprises to accelerate their investments abroad in order to diversify risks and hedge against devaluation of domestic assets. The favorable financing environment for acquisitions in the U.S. and European markets has aided this overseas drive. Also, private equity firms were an important player in activity in 2016. \n \nChinese government policies also assume a key role in M&A activity. On the one hand, policymakers in China are encouraging Chinese enterprises to be more prominent on the world stage; to do so, companies need to look globally for quality investment opportunities to better position themselves for international and domestic competition and achieve long-term growth. On the other hand, in an attempt to curb capital outflows that are putting downward pressure on the RMB and draining foreign exchange reserves, China also imposed various new restrictions on outbound foreign investments in late 2016. This effort resulted in a cap on RMB-denominated loans issued outside China and a requirement that the loans be registered in China. In November 2016, China also imposed new limits on the amount of yuan that Chinese companies can remit overseas. \n \nAs the depreciation of the RMB accelerated in the last few months of 2016, Chinese foreign exchange regulators began vetting transfers abroad worth US$5 million or more to curb capital outflows. Additionally, regulators have privately proposed certain rules that directly restrict outbound M&A transactions valued over US$10 billion (or over US$1 billion if without strategic purposes or unrelated to acquirers\u2019 core businesses). Lastly, as debts continue to soar, the government is reining in shadow-banking loans and debt-fueled financial investments, raising the cost of borrowing. These regulatory changes have already created difficulties for certain deals; if they are fully implemented, the effects will ripple through the entire region. \n \nChallenges in Deal Execution and Negotiation \n \nChinese buyers are still in the process of establishing a track record for executing large M&A transactions overseas. Thus, management teams of Western targets often have concerns regarding financing uncertainties. Some Chinese buyers have opaque corporate and ownership structures, which can raise doubts about the source of funds and present difficulties in securing regulatory approvals, particularly from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). Chinese buyer consortiums often consist of a wide array of parties, such as government-backed investment vehicles, trusts, offshore holding companies or newly formed funds for the sole purpose of carrying out the transaction. Therefore, it is often impossible for a vendor or target to properly assess the consortium\u2019s creditworthiness. \n \nIn addition, Chinese buyers increasingly are using leveraged financing structures for acquisitions. When a Chinese bank funds a transaction with leveraged loans, Chinese buyers often present debt commitment letters that are intended to offer a degree of funding certainty comparable to that provided by their Western counterparts. However, these letters are typically in a short-form format without the customary terms used in the U.S. or Europe. As such, the enforceability of these letters has been a cause for concern. \n \nIn the past, Chinese buyers addressed a vendor's or target\u2019s worries about funding by offering a significantly higher valuation, thereby outbidding competitors. In more recent transactions, Chinese buyers have been more willing to cater to sellers\u2019 requirements and address their concerns over risks of regulatory approvals by depositing reverse-termination fees in an escrow account or by securing such fees with a letter of credit. As a result, reverse-termination fees are heavily negotiated and are often higher than those for U.S. domestic transactions. It remains to be seen whether such an approach is sustainable. \n \nChina Further Opens Access to Capital Markets, Increases Enforcement \n \nThe most recent development in the Chinese capital markets is the launch of the new Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect (SZ-HK Connect) on December 5, 2016, which follows the November 2014 launch of the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect (SH-HK Connect) (see 2015 Insights article \u201c Shanghai-HK Connect Opens Possibilities for Companies Looking to Tap Chinese Investor Demand \u201d). These schemes allow investors located in Shanghai and Shenzhen to trade in Hong Kong-listed securities and Hong Kong investors to trade in Shanghai- and Shenzhen-listed securities, in each case through their own brokers and in their own currency. \n \nSZ-HK Connect further increases Hong Kong\u2019s appeal as a listing venue for companies seeking to tap Chinese investors and as a base for foreign investment into China. In particular, by virtue of SZ-HK Connect, mainland Chinese investors will now be able to trade in stocks on the Hang Seng SmallCap Index, which offers about 180 shares more than the SH-HK Connect. The Shenzhen Stock Exchange allows foreign investors to buy into the growth stories of the technology, media and health care companies that are primarily listed on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange instead of in Shanghai. The Stock Connect schemes allow mainland Chinese capital to be invested in Hong Kong-listed entities without drawing the ire of capital control hawks in China, because proceeds from sales are returned to the owners in RMB and do not become part of the foreign currency market. \n \nIn addition, there have been increasing regulatory enforcement and disciplinary actions by Hong Kong securities regulators. In May 2016, the Securities and Futures Appeals Tribunal affirmed the Securities and Futures Commission\u2019s (SFC) decision to reprimand and fine Moody\u2019s Investors Service Hong Kong Limited HK$11 million (US$1.4 million) for various failures relating to its preparation and publication of a special comment report. Similarly, in August 2016, the Market Misconduct Tribunal (MMT) found that Andrew Left of Citron Research disclosed false or misleading information in a report he published and ultimately banned him from trading securities in Hong Kong for up to five years, disgorged him of profits worth HK$1.6 million, and ordered him to pay investigation and legal costs of HK$4 million. \n \nBoth rulings were firsts for Hong Kong. Moody\u2019s fine was the first disciplinary action of its kind the SFC has taken against a credit rating firm since it started regulating rating activities more than five years ago. Similarly, the MMT\u2019s finding against Left was the first time it had found a short seller guilty of market misconduct arising from the publication of otherwise unregulated market commentary. \n \nFCPA Scrutiny of Chinese Companies and Executives \n \nThe Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) enables U.S. authorities to assert \u201cterritorial jurisdiction\u201d over foreign entities and nationals. Under this theory, as the FCPA Resource Guide warns, \u201ca foreign national who attends a meeting in the United States that furthers a foreign bribery scheme may be subject to prosecution, as may any co-conspirators, even if they did not themselves attend the meeting.\u201d \n \nIn the past, FCPA enforcement actions against foreign entities and nationals were relatively rare because of the difficulty for U.S. prosecutors and regulators in identifying a U.S. nexus from the alleged corrupt payments to foreign officials. The enforcement challenge was heightened by the need to gather evidence abroad. With increasing numbers of Chinese companies and employees entering the U.S. to do business, however, many of these evidentiary obstacles no longer stand in the way. \n \nThere is already some indication that prosecutors have been paying closer attention to the territorial theory of jurisdiction. In the February 2016 enforcement action against Massachusetts software company PTC, Inc., the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) named not only PTC but also PTC\u2019s China entities as defendants. To do so, prosecutors alleged that the jurisdiction requirement was satisfied because PTC China employees accompanied Chinese \u201cforeign officials\u201d on their travels to tourist destinations in the U.S. such as New York, Las Vegas and Honolulu. \n \nIn the debate over what the FCPA enforcement landscape will look like under President Donald Trump, comparatively little attention has been paid to FCPA risks that foreign companies and executives doing business in the U.S. face. Some expect the next attorney general will issue new guidance requiring prosecutors to consider the impact on American business competitiveness in FCPA cases; however, enforcement actions against foreign entities level the playing field by forcing all companies subject to the FCPA\u2019s jurisdiction, foreign and domestic, to play by the same rules. \n \nChina\u2019s Anti-Corruption Campaign Continues \n \nThese U.S. trends may be of particular relevance to Chinese companies, as China\u2019s anti-corruption campaign, now in its fifth year, continues in full force. Faced with rising public anger about mounting social problems amid a slowing economy, Chinese authorities are expected to continue their scrutiny of industries that have a direct bearing on the quality of life of Chinese citizens in the forms of, for example, drug prices, food safety, environmental quality and building hazards. \n \nMoreover, unlike investigations of corrupt party or government officials that are almost invariably conducted out of public view in their initial stages, investigations of these industries are, with increasing frequency, preceded by highly public exposés that identify the accused and showcase the Chinese government\u2019s ability to bring them to heel. \n \nOnce the information is in the public domain, it is readily accessible to regulators in other jurisdictions, including the U.S. This has significant implications for companies operating in China that also are subject to the FCPA. In responding to Chinese government inquiries, companies should take into account the very real possibility that the alleged conduct also may pique the interests of American prosecutors and regulators. As a result, an array of U.S. law issues must be considered at the outset of a Chinese government inquiry. Such issues include safeguarding the attorney-client privilege to enable privilege arguments to be asserted later in a U.S. court if necessary, and conducting an internal review in a manner that will pass the scrutiny of U.S. regulators. \n \nExternal Political Factors and Predictions for M&A Activity in 2017 \n \nBrexit and the U.S. presidential election did not have an immediate impact on China-originated deals. However, as the change in U.S. administration unfolds, we anticipate major shifts on a variety of policy fronts. It is widely perceived that Chinese buyers will have more difficulties obtaining CFIUS approvals under the Trump administration, especially given that technology and intellectual property assets are prized targets for many outbound transactions. (See \" CFIUS and Foreign Investment Reviews in 2017 and Beyond .\") This trend would follow an already challenging CFIUS environment for Chinese investors. In 2016, for example, CFIUS blocked Fujian Grand Chip Investment Fund\u2019s purchase of German semiconductor maker Axitrom and prompted the Blackstone Group to withdraw the sale of Hotel del Coronado to Anbang Insurance Group. \n \nMore importantly, in a country where government policies heavily influence private dealmaking, the general political and economic tensions between the U.S. and China may impact cross-border M&A activity. International trade, cybersecurity and currency manipulation were all prominent issues during the U.S. election cycle. More recently, there is renewed concern that Taiwan may again become a critical feature of U.S.-China relations. These all increase the unpredictability of future policy directives and contribute to the volatility of the M&A market. \n \nThat said, the strongest headwind to outbound Chinese M&A is China\u2019s move to combat capital flight. If these temporary control measures are lifted, and absent any major changes in the regulatory environment, we expect to see continued momentum in Chinese outbound M&A dealmaking. \n JAPAN  \nCross-Border Activity Slows Amid Rising Domestic Consolidations \n \nCross-border Japanese M&A activity significantly decreased in 2016 compared to 2015. This can be attributed in part to a pause in activity stemming from a number of companies continuing to integrate large acquisitions from prior years; increasing competition for attractive assets, particularly from Chinese acquirers; a lack of larger targets at appealing valuations; and a significant increase in domestic consolidations that likely diverted attention from outbound activity in some sectors. \n \nIn addition, uncertainties created by Brexit, the U.S. election and financial market volatility at the beginning of the year made Japanese buyers more cautious when considering foreign acquisitions. Notably, only two transactions accounted for over 50 percent of Japanese outbound deal volume during the first three quarters of 2016 \u2014 Softbank/ARM and Sompo Japan/Endurance Specialty Holdings \u2014 underscoring the relative lack of activity. \n \nBy contrast, domestic Japanese M&A activity in 2016 increased significantly over the prior year, due to consolidation transactions. The continuing global slowdown in the industrials and chemicals sectors, persistent low oil prices in the energy, mining and utilities sector, and conglomerate reorganizations drove companies in these sectors to seek greater competitive advantages through combinations with industry peers. \n \nDecrease in Capital Markets Activity \n \nThere also was a general decrease in capital markets activity by Japanese issuers in 2016, due to factors such as volatile markets and a negative interest rate environment. In terms of equity capital markets, the number of initial public offerings (IPOs) in 2016 fell to a seven-year low, and despite the successful listings of some prominent companies such as LINE Corporation and JR Kyushu, there were fewer large-scale IPOs than in previous years. In addition, the number of follow-on public capital raises by listed companies fell by more than 50 percent as compared to 2015. This decrease is attributable in part to sluggish share prices that persisted prior to the U.S. presidential election and were due to factors such as a stronger yen and Brexit. However, the decrease in equity offerings also was the result of an enhanced focus that many Japanese corporations have placed on the efficient use of capital, as well as the availability of favorable bank financing caused by negative interest rates. \n \nActivity was somewhat stronger in the debt capital markets, reflecting the availability of low interest rates for domestic bonds. In terms of cross-border activity, overseas issuances were again dominated by Japanese financial institutions, such as banks and insurance companies, offering hybrid and other subordinated debt products to overseas investors to raise regulatory capital. \n \nImpact of External Political Factors \n \nThe implementation by the Bank of Japan of its negative interest rate policy in January 2016 and the resulting tightening of credit spreads put pressure on banks to seek more diversified sources of revenue. At the same time, the policy has provided an incentive for Japanese corporate borrowers, which tend to save cash rather than spend capital, to deploy excess savings. Further supplementing this trend is a continued focus on new corporate governance reforms, in their second year of implementation, which impose increased accountability on Japanese companies to productively use their surplus cash with a particular focus on shareholder returns. As a result, while corporate boards are taking a more holistic view of their balance sheets and are increasingly considering M&A transactions in the larger context of overall financial performance, we expect these incentives to productively deploy cash will continue. \n \nFor Japanese companies \u2014 members of an export-driven economy \u2014 currency fluctuation is a double-edged sword that can create uncertainties impacting Japanese outbound M&A transactions. A weaker yen such as that triggered by the recent U.S. election (as a result of strong dollar-buying) boosts corporate earnings but makes foreign acquisitions more expensive. Conversely, a stronger yen such as that resulting from the Brexit vote (as a result of strong safe haven purchases of the yen) makes such acquisitions cheaper but hurts corporate earnings. On balance, and as Japanese companies have shown in recent years, cross-border M&A activity generally should be immune to both environments because the sustained need to address stagnant growth in the domestic market will continue to drive outbound M&A activity. However, volatility in the strength of the yen complicates valuation and adds to the uncertainties for such transactions. It is too early to tell whether Japanese companies should anticipate continued volatility as the new U.S. administration transitions to governance and implementation of policy and as the U.K.'s exit from the European Union unfolds. \n \nOutlook for 2017 \n \nNotwithstanding these potential headwinds, we expect that strategic considerations around the use of large cash reserves and slow domestic growth driven by an aging population and deflation will continue to drive Japanese outbound acquisition activity in 2017. \n \nA heavily import-dependent country for natural resources, Japan is particularly vulnerable to fluctuations in oil prices. As crude oil prices have stabilized and strengthened as a result of the recent Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) agreement and ongoing ancillary negotiations to limit production among non-OPEC countries, it remains to be seen what the potential impact will be on Japanese M&A activity in the energy, oil and gas, and industrial and chemicals industries. \n \nThe ongoing impact of the Bank of Japan's negative interest rate policy will continue to generate margin pressure on Japanese lenders, which will drive the larger banks to seek more diversified sources of revenue, including potentially through acquisitions, and will increase pressure on smaller regional banks to consolidate. \n \nAs the Japanese venture capital market continues to grow after a long, slow development period, smaller independent companies in the technology sector, such as developers of software applications and social media, are becoming increasingly attractive targets for foreign acquirers. While overall inbound acquisition activity has been low relative to outbound activity for a number of years, a majority of the inbound deals in 2016 by value were in this sector, a trend we expect will continue. \n \nIn addition, there may be an increase in activity in the equity capital markets due to the recent recovery in share prices that has continued in the aftermath of the U.S. presidential election. In particular, higher share prices may attract more exit transactions by major shareholders, including not only private equity funds but Japanese corporates seeking to unwind cross-shareholdings by selling large blocks in the capital markets. In addition, there may be an increase in issuances of debt or equity securities by Japanese companies seeking to finance both domestic and cross-border acquisitions. \n INDIA  \nPositive Conditions in Market and Government Spur M& A \n \nIndia's strong M&A environment in 2016 was driven by favorable economic conditions and an encouraging regulatory regime. Its economy overtook China as the fastest-growing major economy, with a growth rate of almost 7.6 percent last year. The U.S., U.K. and Japan continue to lead in inbound investments, with China\u2019s interest in India expected to grow in 2017. Meanwhile, political stability, including one party having an absolute majority, has helped India initiate economic reforms that have had a positive impact on activity. \n \nTechnology, media, telecommunications, financial institutions and pharmaceutical companies remain key targets for foreign buyers and private equity investors. Private equity funds, after waiting many years for a capital markets recovery, are finally achieving public market exits for their investments and raising new funds. We expect a lot more private equity deal activity in the coming year, as India-focused funds are sitting on close to $7 billion ready to be invested. However, valuations and control deals still seem to be a challenge, as Indian promoters (as company founders are known) typically demand comparable market valuations and are reluctant to cede control. \n \nActive Capital Markets Should Continue \n \nThe Indian equity markets were very active in 2016, with more than 25 companies raising almost $3.6 billion in aggregate through November 30, 2016, and several companies lined up to go public in the coming months. Some very large IPOs are in the pipeline, such as Vodafone, and 2016 was the best year for capital markets fundraising in India in the last five years. We expect this trend to continue in 2017 on the back of stable foreign direct investment inflows. The industrial and financial services sectors have been the busiest in terms of both value and volume. \n \nDomestic dual listings on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and National Stock Exchange (NSE) continue to dominate India's IPO scene, and very few Indian companies have listed internationally. That said, improved business confidence should drive more companies to pursue fundraising opportunities abroad. We expect some technology companies to explore international listings in the coming years to target sophisticated global technology investors, offer more attractive valuations and provide a means to access capital not available in India. \n \nCurrency Demonetization Should Positively Influence M&A, Debt Markets \n \nAnother factor impacting the deal landscape is India's decision to demonetize its 500 and 1,000 rupee notes (approximately US$7.50 and US$15, respectively) in an effort to fight tax evasion and corruption. The notes account for over 85 percent of currency that was in circulation and had to be exchanged with banks for new legal tender prior to December 30, 2016. Because the economy relies predominantly on cash, this change may negatively impact economic activity in the near term. In January 2017, for example, the International Monetary Fund cut India\u2019s projected growth rate for the current fiscal year to 6.6 percent. However, in the long run the move could boost government revenue by increasing tax compliance and improving the overall business environment. \n \nOne immediate impact of the currency demonetization has been a drop in bond yields, as banks have parked most of the canceled currency into debt securities. This drop should help companies refinance debt and fund capital expenditures, as well as make acquisitions less expensive. \n \nWith less developed local debt capital markets, Indian companies have historically borrowed at high interest rates and relied on bank loans to raise funds. The regulators recently eased the rules with respect to the issuance of rupee-denominated bonds to foreign portfolio investors (FPIs), known as \"masala bonds.\" FPIs also have been allowed to invest in unlisted nonconvertible debentures and other debt securities. These developments should have a positive impact on the development of debt capital markets. \n \nIndian Companies Eye Brexit Cautiously \n \nMany Indian conglomerates and information technology (IT) companies have large U.K. operations that are a gateway to Europe. Brexit threatens the U.K.\u2019s position as a major investment hub for Indian companies, which worry that they could be subject to higher tariffs for exports as well as unfriendly regulatory and immigration policies. British Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s recent visit to India was disappointing to many in the business community given the U.K. government\u2019s refusal to ease visa restrictions for business travel. At the same time, the decline in the pound has been a cause for concern, and many companies are cautiously reviewing their operations in the U.K. \n \nOn a positive note, Brexit will likely compel Britain to seek a more robust trade relationship with India. The two countries have been unable to reach a free trade agreement so far, with negotiations becoming mired in the politics of the European Union bloc; however, with Britain's commitment to attract new investment from further afield, this could change. A lot will depend on the shape and timing of the U.K.\u2019s actual exit from the EU. If the process is drawn out, Germany and France may be able to nullify the U.K.'s diplomatic first-mover advantage and reach an EU-India free trade agreement first. \n \nIT and Pharma Sectors See Downside to Potential Trump Policies \n \nIn general, the U.S.-India relationship is expected to continue on a positive trajectory under President Donald Trump. India is seen as a strategic and economic partner and thus has strong bipartisan support in the U.S. The two countries work together on a range of issues, from defense and security to space, health care, energy, technology and climate change. The U.S. is also India\u2019s largest trade partner. \n \nHowever, some of President Trump's protectionist policies could adversely affect Indian industry and bilateral trade. For example, India's IT industry earns 60 percent of its $100 billion revenue from the U.S., much of which is attributable to outsourced U.S. jobs. If the Trump administration works to bring back these jobs, Indian IT companies could suffer. In addition, the possibility of extra duties being levied on imports could impact Indian exports to the U.S. and adversely affect the Indian pharmaceutical industry in particular, which accounts for about 40 percent of all generic medicines supplied to the U.S. \n \nPresident Trump is likely to pressure India for more market access, especially as it relates to defense. We expect to see some major investments and joint ventures between Indian and American companies in this sector. \n \nImpact of Regulatory Developments in 2017 \n \nIndia has seen quite a few developments on the tax front that could significantly impact companies in the year ahead. The general anti-avoidance rules (GAAR) will be applicable starting April 1, 2017, and provide sweeping powers to Indian tax authorities to declare any arrangement an \u201cimpermissible avoidance arrangement\u201d if it has been entered into with the principal purpose of obtaining a tax benefit. Because the taxpayer has the burden to demonstrate that this is not the case, the tax authorities could question any transaction that results in tax savings. The rules also could deny tax treaty benefits to many investors who are unable to show \u201ccommercial substance\u201d in the country through which they invest. Investments made before April 2017 will be grandfathered in, but GAAR will apply to arrangements where an entity continues to claim tax benefits on an ongoing basis. \n \nIn 2016, India and Mauritius announced an amendment to their tax treaty, as a result of which Mauritius tax residents will no longer be exempt from Indian capital gains tax on sales of shares of Indian companies that are acquired on or after April 1, 2017. Investments from April 1, 2017, that are sold prior to April 1, 2019, will be taxed at 50 percent of the prevailing rate, subject to satisfying certain requirements, including a minimum spend in Mauritius and that the Mauritius resident not be a shell or conduit company. Similar changes were made to the India-Singapore tax treaty on December 30, 2016. Thus, we expect that investors will have to think about alternative investment structures into India. \n \nThe recently passed Goods and Services Tax Bill, which takes effect on April 1, 2017, will completely overhaul India\u2019s current indirect tax system and unite it as a common tax market for the first time. Currently, goods are taxed multiple times at different rates and at different stages by the federal and state governments, which makes it challenging and costly to do business across state borders. \n \nAdditionally, the passing of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 and the Reserve Bank of India's initiative to require banks to clean up their books should make the next few years ripe for stressed-asset investors. However, the speed with which the attendant regulations and infrastructure will be rolled out remains unclear. \n \nCoupled with these regulatory changes, the government's push to encourage investments through policies such as Make in India and Start-Up India and to improve the overall ease of doing business is expected to start showing results in 2017. \n \nSkadden is not admitted to practice law in India.

But they're better right now. Until we improve, they're going to keep beating us.\" \n\nRivers mostly sat and witnessed his team go down in the third quarter under an avalanche of Stephen Curry three-point slings and Warriors points that sent the Clippers to their eighth consecutive defeat to Golden State. \n\n\"If I won eight games in a row, I would have a mental edge,\" Rivers said. \n\nCurry, supposedly playing with a sore left quadriceps, detonated for 25 of his 43 points in the third quarter. He was five for eight from three-point range in the period, during which he seemed to be playing alone. \n\nFor the game he was 15 for 23 from the field, nine for 15 from three-point range. \n\nOf all the 72 points the Clippers surrendered in the first half, the most painful had to be when Curry eased up the court and casually and knowingly hoisted a three-pointer from half court that splashed through the net as the halftime buzzer sounded. \n\nThe fans went crazy. The Warriors celebrated, none more so than Draymond Green, who chest-bumped Curry so hard he fell on the court. Curry stayed on his belly for a few seconds, his arms extended. \n\nThe Clippers could only solemnly trudge to their locker room. \n\n\"We can talk about, like, being who we are. But who are we?\" Clippers guard J.J. Redick said. \"To me, we're the most inconsistent team, maybe in the league. Like, we're inconsistent. That's who we are. So, like, if we're going to be inconsistent, we can't expect to come in here and play these guys and be inconsistent and play well. It's not realistic.\" \n\nThe Clippers have lost four of five games since point guard Chris Paul had surgery for a torn thumb ligament that is expected to sideline him six to eight weeks. \n\nBut they will see the Warriors again Thursday night at Staples Center knowing it's going to take a better effort than this one. \n\nBlake Griffin, in his second game back after missing 18 games following right knee surgery, had 20 points for a Clippers team that was never in this game. \n\nThe total destruction by the Warriors notwithstanding, Rivers has been unsure what has put him in a weakened state. \n\n\"It has been three weeks now, so it's not been a fun stretch,\" he said. \"I'll get through it. I just want to find out what the hell it is to be honest.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"BRODERICK TURNERLos Angeles Times"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: NBA - Golden State Warriors news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: NBA - Los Angeles Clippers news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest scores","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Curry, Warriors clobber Clippers, 144-98","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Sedgwick","zipCode":"67202","state":"Kansas","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Wichita","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Wichita Eagle","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169665895","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"6865"},"name":"Wichita Eagle","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Basketball","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.kansas.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201509947","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:06:54Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

I've shot and interviewed them, not about what they're wearing or their upcoming projects. Instead we discussed a very real and personal absoluteness: How would you spend your last day on earth? \n \nThe Last Days Project doubles as a motivational social commentary, acting as liaison between the \"untouchables\" of popular culture and the general public through a connected thread: mortality. Facing your own mortality rewires your brain to focus on the things that matter most to you. Reminds you that time waits for no man. Reminds you that we are all battling demons no matter social status. Reminds you of your virtues and the impact you have on those around you. It reminds you that life isn't over yet. \n \nInstead of waiting and worrying about the unforeseeable future, who says we can't live our days as if they were in fact our last? Here's what a few of the subjects from #TheLastDaysProject had to say about their last days. \n    Jaden Smith   \n\" I Feel Like Shit \" \n \nThe universe works in weird ways. When he was around my age, my father, Ronald Antony Williams, aka \"Sekou,\" toured with Will Smith as a dancer. Backstage during Camp Flog Gnaw 2016 I saw Jaden Smith and introduced myself. When I asked how he would spend his last day on Earth he told me it would take him some time to think of a \"prolific\" response. I didn't want something \"prolific\" from him. I wanted something relatable that no one could misinterpret or misunderstand. I asked him to tell me how he was feeling instead. This is the response I received. \n    Naomi Campbell   \n\"Naomi \" \n \nI was given about five minutes to talk to Naomi at VFiles, enough time to tell her about the project. She gave me the utmost energy and love, expressed how much she loved Polaroids--literarily exclaiming \"I love Polaroids!\"--then quickly getting into a Mona Lisa worthy pose. When I asked her the question she attempted to answer, then replied, \"That's too difficult. I don't live that way.\" She happily signed her name to the bottom. \n    George Clinton   \n\" Get Hight\" \n \nAs night fell on Day 1 of Afropunk 2016, I walked into the tent where George Clinton's wife had arranged for me to take his photograph. His entire family welcomed me with open arms. I watched George Clinton roll a blunt and asked him the secret to being funky. The next day I gave this photo to his wife and she returned it to me with the words \"Get Hight\" scribbled at the bottom. I'm uncertain if the \"t\" at the end is purposeful, but I'm grateful nonetheless. \n    Sango   \n\"Pray\" \n \nI first met Sango at a Goldlink concert at Irving Plaza. After the show, I ventured upstairs where Sango and a few others were lounging. Knowing noone, I introduced myself to everyone. The energy in the room was very friendly. Some months later I traveled to DC to cover Broccoli City Fest, where Sango would be performing. We sat down for an intimate interview, and he played me a piano recording his mother had sent him from his iPhone. \n    Joe Kay   \n\" I would take my daughter to Disneyland.\" \n    Esta   \n\" I'm having a family reunion on my last day\" \n    Alexander Sowinski, BADBADNOTGOOD   \n\"Drink wine. Dance. Sex. Smoke. Star Gaze with John Williams. Blast tunes. Play with all my animals.\" \n \nI spent some time with the members of BADBADNOTGOOD during a private recording session at RedBull Studios in Chelsea, NYC. Alex taught me a bit about the enormous soundboard that took up the front of the studio and about a machine that makes sounds more antique. It took a very long time for any of them to answer the question. With careful thought and after about an hour of chat and laughter the four members handed me back their Polaroid portraits, now scribbled with their last day requests. \n    Matthew A. Tavares   \n\"Swim in the ocean on mushrooms with everyone I love.\" \n    Chester Hanson, BADBADNOTGOOD   \n\"Make sure everyone in my life knew how much I love them.\" \n    Leland \"Chomps\" Whitty, BADBADNOTGOOD   \n\"Smooch my friends. Make love to my girlfriend. See my family and lastly walk into the ocean.\" \n                \nWhat would you do with 24 hours to live? Post a photo to Instagram of yourself using the hashtag #TheLastDaysProject and tell me @GYA.SI . I'll be adding the most detailed responses to the final of the book, The Last Days.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: book news","group":"Entertainment"},{"name":"Entertainment: fine arts news","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"See Naomi Campbell, Jaden Smith and More in the Last Days Project Malia Obama Protests DAPL at Sundance Bella Hadid Like You've Never Seen Her Before 10 Kick-Ass Women Filmmakers to Know from Sundance 2017 NSFW: Women Get Carnal with the City in New Book","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"PAPER Magazine","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"511989530","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3090"},"name":"PAPER Magazine","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Lifestyle"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.papermag.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.instagram.com/gya.si/?hl=en"],"sequenceId":"695201511357","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:06:55Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It was expected that details of the deal between Australia and the US would not be nailed down until the second half of the year.\n\nNews that Mr Trump won't overturn his predecessor's arrangement with Australia puts to rest months of concern about the future of the deal that could finally resolve the plight of many of the refugees on Nauru and Manus Island.\n\nAn executive order released over the weekend by Mr Trump includes a four-month pause on all refugee arrivals, a three-month ban on entry by citizens from seven countries of terrorism concern including Iran, Iraq and Syria, and an indefinite halt on all refugees from Syria.\n\nThe new US President has also ordered officials to prioritise refugees who are fleeing persecution as members of religious minorities in their home countries, which would most obviously apply to Christians and other non-Muslims in the Middle East and South Asia.\n\nThat order, however, also stated that senior US officials can \"admit individuals to the United States as refugees on a case-by-case basis\" including to \"enable the United States to conform its conduct to a pre-existing international agreement\".\n\nIt is not certain that the US will take all confirmed refugees from Australia's offshore detention system. Mr Turnbull has said the United Nations' refugee agency would be responsible for assessing the refugee claims. That agency has made clear it might reassess people on Nauru and Manus Island who have already been denied refugee status and could also take into account the hardship they have been through while seeking asylum.\n\nMr Turnbull has also said the deal would give priority to women, children and families. Those groups are housed on Nauru while Manus Island holds single men.\n\nThe US will conduct its own security vetting of applicants and could regard single men as a greater risk.\n\nIn their first conversation since the businessman was sworn in as US President, Mr Turnbull and Mr Trump also discussed the war against the so-called Islamic State and agreed to work together on global security including in the Asia-Pacific region. They also talked about their shared interest in stopping irregular migration of people seeking asylum.\n\nMr Turnbull's office is yet to comment on the 25-minute long conversation between the two leaders. A two paragraph statement from the White House said both leaders \"emphasised the enduring strength and closeness of the US-Australia relationship that is critical for peace, stability and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region and globally\".\n\nEducation Minister Simon Birmingham told reporters he did not know the details of the conversation between Mr Turnbull and Mr Trump but said the two countries had \"long been close allies and have worked co-operatively on a range of agreements and I'm very confident, the government's very confident, we will continue to work co-operatively on agreements in the future\".","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"David Wroe"},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Asia-Pacific latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"South Pacific Islands news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Donald Trump tells Malcolm Turnbull he will honour deal to resettle refugees from Nauru and Manus","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"AU","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"Melbourne Age","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169652301","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3545"},"name":"Melbourne Age","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Politics","Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.theage.com.au/","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201515297","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:05:26Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:06:57Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

I had Philip read three pieces, and I transcribed his voice into notes, very literally.\u201d \n \nAlthough the piece was composed on a guitar, Smeltzer will perform the sections written for poem\u2019s text on theremin. \n \n\u201cWith the more abstract parts, Ron and Wayne will do whatever they feel,\u201d Smeltzer said. \n \nSmith said a common willingness to rely on instinct and a collective sense of intuition among members brings out a relaxed performance, one that, he hopes will connect with the audience. \n \n\u201cI think what I like most is the unpredictability,\u201d Smith said. \u201cIt adds interest.\u201d \n   \n Jason Smeltzer plays the theremin during the Fracture Society\u2019s rehearsal at the Wyoming Valley Art League\u2019s Circle Center for the Arts in Wilkes-Barre Jan. 16.

My brain stopped. My heart stopped. I was the living dead.\"\n\nThe boat is the sole source of income for Pideris and Marmarinos. Both vessels sat in the corrosive sea water for three days, until the roads cleared enough to bring in a crane. The electronics and engines on both vessels were destroyed.\n\nThe mayor of Lesbos says money from a humanitarian award, the Olof Palme prize, given to the islanders for embracing refugees will go toward the cost of repairs, estimated in the thousands.\n\nMarmarinos says he's proud \"because I offered help and I see it's coming back to me\u2026.even if no one helped I'd still be proud and if it happens again, I'd do the same,\" he says.\n\nMarmarinos and Pideris hope to be fishing again by early February.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Kelly Cobiella"},"topics":[],"title":"The Fishermen Who Brave Frigid Seas to Save Refugees","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"MSN News US","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"530694805","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"MSN News US","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Global","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.news.msn.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/europes-border-crisis/migrants-shiver-icy-blast-grips-europe-s-crowded-refugee-camps-n705116","http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/europes-border-crisis/europe-migrant-crisis-one-young-syrian-s-journey-reunite-his-n673811"],"sequenceId":"695201520060","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:06:58Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Capital Trustees Board chairman Mohammed Al Khozaie said Hank Dittmar, of Urban Futures, is helping prepare new plans for the suq, blending modernity with tradition. The consultant is a global sustainability authority and urbanist, advising governments, companies and communities all over the world on making cities and towns more liveable and resilient. Based on his assessment a budget will be allocated for work to begin immediately, said Mr Khozaie. The suq project is a joint responsibility of the Bahrain Tourism and Exhibitions Authority (BTEA), the Economic Development Board, the Bahrain Chamber of Commerce and Industry (BCCI), and the board. \"Funds are there - they just need to be divided according to the needs, whether structural, technical or commercial or for other support facilities such as car parks,\" said Mr Al Khozaie. \"We have already approached some of the businesses in the area to build multi-storey car parks on their property in return for benefits and they are considering it. So, hopefully, approval will come with the report's findings. \"There is a commitment to develop the suq and we have a lot on our minds, like possibly closing certain areas and turning them into pedestrian-only zones. \"However, that again depends on how we will handle the load factor. \"We are also thinking about confining car parks to certain areas rather than the whole market to reduce congestion and allow people to move around freely.\" He said the consultant was considering all options with the suq area being huge and how to conduct work in phases. BTEA marketing and tourism promotion director Yousef AlKhan told the board members that the aim was to turn the suq area into Bahrain's most recognisable destination. The old suq was the first destination for tourists coming on cruises, he said. \"We are putting a huge emphasis on the Capital Governorate as our main frontier destination for tourists and the Old Manama Suq is our biggest attraction. \"The suq fascinates tourists mainly those coming on cruises and it is the first thing they want to see whenever they arrive in Bahrain. \"And for that it needs to be developed in a way that protects its identity to be in line with expectations.\" mohammed@gdn.com.bh (c) 2017 2016 Al Hilal Publishing and Marketing Group Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc.

They are candidates for a Darwin Award. \n \nI mention all of this because of Levi Felix, who died recently at the age of 32. \n \nPerhaps, like me, you never heard of him. He was the founder of something called Digital Detox whose mission was \u201cto create more mindful, meaningful and balanced lives, both online and off.\u201d \n \nThe organization sponsored Camp Grounded, a summer camp for adults to get unplugged from technology. Attendees turned in their electronic devices and were expected \u2013 gasp \u2013 to have conversations with others in real life, or IRL as they say in digital parlance. \n \nCampers also had choices of activities, such as crafts, archery, swimming and capture-the-flag. \n \nFelix said he wanted to see \u201cmore people taking more time to reflect and experience what they\u2019re doing instead of sharing it or Instagramming it or posting it on the internet.\u201d \n \nThere was something so simple and profound about what he preached; it really resonated with me. \n \nFor my generation, the electronic devil was the \u201cBoob Tube,\u201d aka television, which we were warned would turn our brains to Jell-O if we watched too much of it. \n \nI grant you there was a lot of bad television I watched as a kid but we also had a rule when I was growing up: No TV at dinner. That was a time reserved to be together as a family. Period. \n \nToday, if you go to a restaurant, it is stunning to see how many people are seated around a table and they are all looking at their smartphones! It\u2019s like they are allergic to talking to one another. \n \nI know I am guilty of spending too much time on my phone, but being a newsman, it is an occupational hazard. \n \nFor others, it is an addiction in which they get a little shot of dopamine to their brains every time a notification comes from Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or someone texts. (Does anyone actually even use their smartphones to call anyone anymore anyway?) \n \nAt a time when we face deep cultural, racial and political divisions, it feels like the need to have civil face-to-face conversations is more important than ever. \n \nIf I can paraphrase a popular \u201860s expression, I think it\u2019s time we turn off our electronic devices, drop our screens and tune into each other. \n   \n   http://timesleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/web1_mele-5.jpg   \n \nBy Christopher Mele \n \nMele\u2019s Musings \n \n \n \nChristopher Mele is married and dad of two sons and two stepchildren.

The stay came as scores of refugees, immigrants and others were stranded at airports across the country. While the ruling blocked the deportation of some arrivals ensnared by the executive order, it stopped short of allowing them into the country, and did not actually weigh in on the constitutionality of the president's order. Large crowds of protesters turned out at several airports, including New York's JFK, to protest Trump's order. \n \nTrump's order suspended resettlement of Syrian refugees indefinitely, suspended all other refugee resettlement for 120 days, and banned the entry of nationals from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia, and Yemen for 90 days. The ACLU , which brought the challenge to the order, said, \"This was a Muslim ban wrapped in a paper-thin national security rationale.\" \n \nThe ACLU brought the challenge on behalf of two Iraqi nations detained at JFK\u2014including one, Hameed Khalid Darweesh, who worked as interpreter for the US Army's 101st Airborne Division in Iraq. The ACLU argued that Trump's order violates the Due Process and Equal Protection clauses of the US Constitution. Judge Ann M. Donnelly issued the stay at 9 AM. \n \nThe executive order ostensibly halts the entry of refugees and nationals from the designated countries pending a review of the vetting process. Judge Donnelly's ruling applies to some 200 people already in the United States, and those who were mid-flight as the White House announced its order. \n \nThe order also places a cap of 50,000 refugees to be accepted in 2017, compared to a limit of 110,000 set by former President Obama. Priority will be given to religious minorities facing persecution, with Trump specifically singling out Christians in an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network . The order also suspends the Visa Interview Waiver Program, which allows consular officers to exempt some applicants from face-to-face interviews if they are seeking to renew temporary visas within a year of expiry. ( NYT , Daily News ,  The Hill , BBC News ) \n \nHours after Trump signed his executive order, a mosque in southern Texas burned to the ground. The Islamic Center of Victoria, which supports some 100 local Muslims in the town roughly 125 miles from Houston, was completely gutted by the fire. The Islamic Center's president Shahid Hashmi said he watched helplessly as the mosque was destroyed. The local fire marshal said the cause of the fire is currently unknown, but is asking for the community's help in the investigation. ( US Uncut ) \n \nTrump said the order was aimaed at keeping out \"radical Islamic terrorists,\" adding: \"We don't want them here. We want to ensure that we are not admitting into our country the very threats our soldiers are fighting overseas. We only want to admit those into our country who will support our country, and love deeply our people.\" ( NYT ) Yet critics point out that the order excludes Saudi Arabia, where 15 of the 19 9-11 hijackers were from. The remainder were from the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Lebanon\u2014also countries not covered by Trump's order. Some speculate the order intentionally excludes countries where his Trump Organization has done business or pursued potential deals. Trump properties include golf courses in the United Arab Emirates and two luxury towers operating in Turkey.

When focusing their learning on what has gone before, how do we know that we are teaching them the right things for what comes next?\" \n \nThe focus, according to Mr Caller, may be better applied to a child's individual talents and skills, using creativity and adapting to advancements in technology and new information as they happen. \n \nMr Caller said: \"In private tutoring, we see time after time how focusing on a child's individual interests and talents, and adapting teaching styles and lesson planning to compliment them, results in a child who is more interested and eager to learn. Tutors International is now seeing clients who are already starting to look for 'outside the box' thinkers when selecting their private tutors [2]. They want someone who can expose their child to a wide range of topics, concepts and ideas from an early age, and use new advancements in technology to their learning advantage. They want someone who can 'move with the times', and this paves the way for some very exciting job opportunities for forward thinking tutors, worldwide.\" \n \nWith a career in education spanning over 25 years, Mr Caller believes that embracing these latest developments and incorporating them into a child's own individual curriculum, while prioritising their creativity and nurturing a natural curiosity, is key in shaping adults that can use their own skills to adapt and succeed in a world that their teachers may never get to experience. \n \nTutors International places exceptional tutors with families based on their individual needs and circumstances.

It was deemed the junction would need to be closed to mitigate any severe effects of development on trunk roads. \n \nIt was believed the Government decision would bring an end to the three-year fight. \n \nBut the parish council has now decided to defer the decision to close the lights this month,  to allow it to be revisited if circumstances change.  \n \nBut campaigners warn this is an interim solution only until the A27 options are published. \n \nThe cycling and walking phases of the lights have only just been finished in the last three months. \n \nAn event has been organised on Sunday the 29th of Janurary as a show of solidarity to keep the traffic lights. \n \nPeople are planning to meet on the old Halfords carpark, on Portfield Way in Chichester at 2pm, and walk  a short distance to look at the Oving traffic lights on the A27. \n \nPaula Chatfield a frequent user of the junction said: \" I cross the traffic lights regularly and always see pedestrians and cyclists of most ages - from toddlers in pushchairs accompanying mum on older siblings' school run to all sorts of working age people apparently commuting. \n \n\"I understand from a friend who works in the Tangmere community, that it's the main route for non-drivers walking or cycling from Tangmere as the official cycling route involving negotiating the A27 sliproad junction over the A27 and through Westhampnett that no-one likes.\" \n \nMr Harris owns Elfords Sheds in the business park just yards from the junction. \n \nHe told Spirit FM the closure is going to effect his  business: \"Customers won't be able to get here very easily. They will have to go to Bognor Roundabout and double back on themselves and come back to the traffic lights to turn.

It will have facilities such as berthing space for two vessels simultaneously, storage area, transit shed, parking areas, among others. \n\nThe Varanasi terminal with 0.54 million tons per annum of cargo handling capacity in Phase 1, will complement the Eastern Dedicated Freight Corridor (EDFC) project, enabling movement of cargo from Ludhiana in Punjab to Haldia in West Bengal and further east, said an official at the Ministry. \n\n\"With the cost of transportation by waterways being 30-50 paisa per tonne per km (PTPK) only, compared to Rs 1 PTPK for rail, and Rs 1.5 PTPK for road, various government and private entities have already shown interest in transporting their cargo using the facility,\" the official added. \n\nNW-1, along with proposed EDFC and NH-2, constitutes the Eastern Transport Corridor of India connecting the National Capital Region (NCR) with the eastern and north-eastern states and will function as a link to Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand, Nepal and other east and south-east Asian countries through the Kolkata Port and Indo- Bangladesh Protocol Route. \n\nCurrently, a large portion of cargo from north India is transported to the ports of Kandla and Mumbai through land routes at high cost, and there is much reluctance of the shippers to transport the cargo to the eastern ports of Kolkata, Dhamra, and Paradip.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Press Trust of India"},"topics":[{"name":"Bangladesh news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"'Multi-modal terminal at Varanasi to be major logistic hub'","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Business Standard India","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659514","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"218"},"name":"Business Standard India","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Business"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.business-standard.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://mybs.in/2USkNP8"],"sequenceId":"695201546587","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:37:10Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:07:07Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It should be seen as an opportunity to highlight all the hard work you have done in a year. There should be enthusiasm and zest. It is your decision to treat as a pleasure or pressure. Those who treat it as a pleasure will gain and those who treat it as pressure will repent. \n\n\"My view is that examination is a celebration. Take it as if it is a festival. And when there is a festival or celebration, then the best comes out of us. We feel the society's strength during celebrations. Whatever is the best comes out... Smile more to score more,\" he said. \n\nHe gave the example of discipline seen among masses in 'kumbh' fair even though it is generally felt that there is a lot of indiscipline among people. \"This is the strength of celebration.\" \n\nDuring the examination, there should be a festive atmosphere among students, families and neighbours and it will convert this pressure into pleasure. \n\nHe also asked people to put examination in perspective and not treat it as \"a question of life and death or as a test of life but merely of the study students have put in during the year\". \n\nHe urged students not to chase marks but gain knowledge. \n\n\"Only studying for marks will lead to shortcuts and one will limit himself or herself. It is important to study for knowledge. Marks and mark sheet have a limited use. Knowledge, skill, self-confidence and commitment will be of use to you during life,\" Modi said. \n\nHe have the example of late President A P J Abdul Kalam's failure in an air force recruitment examination and said had he accepted it as a defeat, then India would not have got such a great scientist and President. \n\nHe also asked students to desist from resorting to shortcuts and cheating to score more. \n\n\"To cheat is to be cheap. It makes you a bad person. If you form a habit of cheating, there will be no desire to learn. Trying to cheat involves one's time to find ways. Use it for better purposes. People have told you often but I am saying again -- do not cheat. Even if no one catches you, you know that you have cheated in exams,\" he said. \nTurning his focus to parents, Modi said they should accept \n\ntheir children as they are and not burden them with expectations. \n\n\"There is a lot of discussion about the weight of students' school bag. It seems that the weight of parents' expectations is more. Expectation is at the root of problems while acceptance gives you an opportunity to improve things and look for new ways,\" he said, asking them to spend quality time with their children. \n\nUnderlining the need to avoid competing with others, he said it leads to jealousy, disappointment and complacency while if one competes with oneself it leads to stronger resolve, introspection and inspiration. \n\nHighlighting the need to play sports even as they prepare for exams, he said, \"Letter 'P' is for preparation and 'P' is also for play. The person who plays shines. Proper rest, adequate sleep and physical exercise should be there... \n\n\"A happy mind is the secret for a good mark sheet. When you are tense, knowledge takes a back seat. Do not let that happen.\" \n\nHe asked students to strike a balance between their mission and ambition, saying if they do it, good marks will follow them. \n\nThe burden of scoring good marks at times prevents them from taking the right path, he said, noting that people never inquire about how much marks a doctor or a lawyer has scored when they go to them. \n\nIn a lighter vein, Modi said parents and teachers may not like his emphasis on the need for relaxing and playing. \n\n\"Whatever I say, it does not mean that you keep sleeping or your family will blame me when the mark sheet comes... You should not allow whatever I have said to become a burden. Do it if possible or leave it.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Education news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Smile more to score more: PM to students, parents ahead of","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Business Standard India","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659514","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"218"},"name":"Business Standard India","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Business"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.business-standard.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://mybs.in/2USkNPF"],"sequenceId":"695201546752","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:43:22Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:07:07Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The court handles about 20,000 cases a year from 16 northern Summit County communities. \n \nThe event which led to the change happened in March when Stephen Bice, 53, shot and killed his wife, Kristi Bice, 42, and then shot and killed himself. Stephen Bice had previously been charged with domestic violence and placed under a temporary protection order by Stow Municipal Court Judge Kim Hoover. The domestic violence charge was later amended to a disorderly conduct charge, according to court records. Kristi Bice agreed to the lesser charge. Two months later she was dead. \n \nStow Municipal Court Judge Lisa Coates said she decided something more had to be done by the courts to protect victims. \n \nThat led to her change of policy. \n  [Article continues below]   \n\"It propelled me to do more as a judge,\" Coates said. \"Before I'll accept any change from a domestic violence charge to (a lesser charge), I want the victim to go see Victim Assistance.\" \n \nAccording to Coates, the death could have happened no matter which judge handled the case, but felt the court as a whole had to do more to help victims, including trying to get a full-time advocate assigned to the court. \n \nIn the past, victims were sent to Akron to talk to Victim Assistance advocates, Coates said. \n \nAccording to Coates several victims said they were unable to drive or get a ride to Akron for a variety of reasons. \n \n\"Now there are no more excuses, \" Coates said. \"I love the fact that they are down the hall now and there is no reason not to meet up with them. I just like to make sure they know they have another alternative to going home if something more is going on.\" \n  [Article continues below]   \nAdvocate paid for with federal funding \n \nLeanne Graham, executive director of Victim Assistance, explained Coates' reasoning for adding a full-time advocate. \n \n\"The goal of that was to provide that victim the opportunity to talk with someone that is not involved with the court system. [They are] really there just to support that victim and have their best interest at heart to educate them about domestic violence, to educate them about some of the ramifications or some of the impact this could have in the future,\" Graham said. \"And if they want to do that we will support them 100 percent.\" \n \nGraham applied for and received $44,245 in federal funding from the Victim of Crime Act. The VOCA is legislation that requires the court system to take fines set aside and use for victims, Graham said. \n \n\"We had to do something for the people who have nothing at all,\" Graham said. \"That's when I decided to devote the time and energy to find funding for the people of Stow.\" \n \nAccording to Graham advocates provide victims with all the information possible to make a rational and safe decision during a variety of tragic events. \n \nJillian Loftus is the first full-time Victim Assistance advocate assigned to the Stow Municipal Court in more than 13 years, according to Graham. \n \n\"I do love being out here,\" Loftus said. \"I feel there was a lot we were missing, as far as victims.\" \n \nLoftus said victims feel better just being able to ask questions and have someone be there by their side. \n \nLoftus, of Stow, was assigned as the court's Victim Assistance advocate Nov. 21, 2016 which made the Stow Municipal Court one of six Victim Assistance satellite offices throughout Summit County. \n \n\"Our main objective is to fulfill our mission, which is to empower our community, restore lives impacted by crisis, violence and tragedy,\" Graham said. \"And just because people are not involved with the criminal justice system that does not mean we won't help them.\" \n \nThe agency also assists those who have been impacted by suicide, traffic fatalities, infant, deaths and heroin overdoses, Graham said. She added the program assists in any type of trauma. \n \n\"We encourage anyone who is dealing with any type of struggles to call our 24-hour hot line and talk to us,\" Graham said. \"Our services are confidential and we will be able to offer them some opportunity to navigate through what their situation is.\" \n \nTo contact Summit County Victim Assistance 24-hours a day call 330-376-0040. \n \nEmail: ttroglen@recordpub.com \n \nPhone: 330-541-9435 \n \nTwitter: @Trog_RPC \n \nRate this article Do you want to leave a comment?   Please Log In or Register to comment.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Cleveland news","group":"US regional"},{"name":"Crime and punishment news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Murder case prompts addition of advocate to Stow Muni Court","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Summit","zipCode":"44224","state":"Ohio","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Stow","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Stow Sentry","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169763896","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"Stow Sentry","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.stowsentry.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201547270","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:07:08Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

That panel will pick finalists to forward to Gov. John Kasich. The governor will make the final decision on the appointments, subject to the consent of the Ohio Senate. \n \nThe interviews are not open to the public, but the rest of the proceedings and the announcement of finalists are and will be streamed online at www.puco.ohio.gov . \n \nYou'll recall the political drama surrounding the governor's last pick -- M. Howard Petricoff, a retired attorney and a Democrat who had to leave his PUCO post after it became evident that the Republican-controlled Senate would not sign off on the appointment. \n  [Article continues below]   \nThere are currently no Democrats serving on commission, a point that's drawn criticism from the Statehouse's minority party and prompted legislation that would require both major parties to be represented at PUCO. \n \nCommissioners at the state's utility regulation agency earn a base pay of about $120,000. \n \nPublic Comment \n \nThe Ohio Department of Education is accepting public comment on an overview of its State Plan for the Every Student Succeeds Act, which \"provides a framework for the final plan that Ohio will submit in April\" to federal officials. \n \nThe draft covers academic standards, assessments, accountability and school improvement. \n  [Article continues below]   \nThe federal Every Student Succeeds Act replaced the No Child Left Behind Act. According to documents, \"This long-awaited legislation represents a shift from broad federal oversight of primary and secondary education to greater flexibility and decision-making at the state and local levels.\" \n \nAdditional details are online at education.ohio.gov. \n \nTaxes and Voters \n \nThere's an interesting case making its way through the Ohio Supreme Court that merits your attention. \n \nIt focuses on a renewal levy OK'd by voters in Delaware County in 2015 that provides funding (about $7 million projected in 2017) for a multi-county joint career center, according to documents. \n \nVoters in Delaware County approved the renewal by a margin of 10,644 votes. \n \nAnd, \"Believing its revenue stream to be secure, DACC continued to plan for ongoing operations, to pursue its long-term, ongoing campus consolidation project, and to continue with a major construction project to enhance the career- technical education of students,\" according to documents. \n \nHowever, elections officials neglected to place the issue on the ballot in affected precincts in surrounding counties. Meaning 1,026 registered voters did not get to cast ballots on the issue. \n \nSchool officials say there were enough votes favor of the renewal, regardless of the balloting error. Tax officials, however, say that state law doesn't give them the authority to move forward with collections. \n \nThe case is now before the Ohio Supreme Court, which has set a briefing schedule to consider the issues involved and the larger ramifications. Filings will be made over the next couple of weeks. \n \nStay tuned. \n \nMarc Kovac is the Dix Capital Bureau Chief.

It is also attempting to create its own state, which ISIS claims as a 'caliphate'. But there can be no accommodation or negotiation with it,\" Trump said in his executive order. \"For those reasons I am directing my administration to develop a comprehensive plan to defeat ISIS,\" he said. \n\nThe plan to be submitted to the President within 30 days calls for a comprehensive strategy to defeat the ISIS and recommend changes to any US rules of engagement and other American policy restrictions that exceed the requirements of international law regarding the use of force against the terror group. \n\nTrump said the ISIS has engaged in a systematic campaign of persecution and extermination in those territories it enters or controls. \n\n\"If ISIS is left in power, the threat that it poses will only grow,\" he warned. \n\n\"We know it has attempted to develop chemical weapons capability.

John Kasich didn't sign everything lawmakers sent him following their lame duck session. \n \nHe vetoed a bill that would have ceased requirements for utilities to meet renewable energy and efficiency benchmarks, turning those mandates into goals instead. \n \nHe also blocked legislation that would have required the regular review of state agencies by lawmakers and action by the legislature for those offices to continue to operate. \n \nThe governor used his line-item veto on several other measures, including a proposal to block abortions within weeks of conception and language seeking to clarify sales tax breaks for oil and gas production. \n \nThere was another line-item veto in the past few days that focused on jukeboxes. \n  [Article continues below]   \nHere are more details on that plus a handful of other law changes Kasich signed that are set to take effect in about three months: \n \n31. Higher Ed Spending: HB 384 allows the state auditor to conduct performance audits on public colleges and universities to pinpoint ways for them to make their operations more efficient. \n \nRepublican state Auditor Dave Yost has already spearheaded comparable studies of other agencies, resulting in more than a billion dollars in recommended savings. \n \n\"Ohio has a world-class university system,\" Yost said in a released statement about HB 384 last month. \"This bill will help contain costs and further their mission.\" \n \n32. About Those Jukeboxes: While Kasich signed much of HB 384, he line-item vetoed language that would have provided a sales tax break on songs purchased and played on electronic jukeboxes. \n  [Article continues below]   \nThe governor wrote in his veto message, \"Vending is a valued industry in Ohio, but there is no justification for granting a narrow subset of this industry -- digital jukeboxes -- a tax exemption. Adequate ability exists for the vending industry to collect and remit its required sales tax. Further, this broadly drafted exemption could potentially have the unintended consequence of negating the state's tax on all digital audio products (i.e., downloaded books, movies and music). Therefore, this veto is the public interest.\" \n \n33. Biological Products: HB 505 allows biological products to be substituted by pharmacists, as allowed under federal regulations, in certain medical treatments, including \"medications used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, anemia, psoriasis and various forms of cancer,\" according to an analysis by the Legislative Service Commission. \n \nLSC added, \"Whereas a generic drug is a copy of a brand-name drug that has the same active ingredient, an interchangeable biological product has allowable differences because it is made from living organisms. The FDA approves interchangeable biological products that meet standards of biosimilarity and are expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference products they are compared to.\" \n \n34. Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy: HB 216 contains a number of provisions related to nursing and health care. \n \nOne portion of the bill deals with \"hyperbaric oxygen therapy,\" a treatment involving \"the administration of pure oxygen in a pressurized room or chamber,\" according to an analysis by the Legislative Service Commission. \n \nSpecifically, the legislation authorizes podiatrists to \"order and supervise\" such treatments, so long as certain requirements are met. \n \n35. Diabetes: That same bill calls on several state agencies study the prevalence of diabetes in the state and develop ways to reduce incidence of the disease. \n \nThe state health director, starting next year, will have to provide biennial reports to lawmakers on the findings and progress. \n \n36. Continuing Ed: Professional engineers and surveyors are required to complete 30 hours of continuing education every two years as part of their registration renewals. \n \nHB 236 requires that at least two of those 30 hours cover ethics or \"rule relevant to the practices\" of engineering or surveying, according to LSC. \n \n37. Getting Pulled Over: Better think twice before driving with expired plates, on the wrong side of the road or with \"willful or wanton disregard of safety\" in Ohio's smaller townships. \n \nThanks to HB 378, officers in townships with fewer than 50,000 residents soon will have authority to make arrests on national highway system roads that are located within their borders. \n \nThose officers already had such arrest authority on state highways. \n \nAccording to LSC, only seven of Ohio's 1,308 have populations or more than 50,000. But there's no exact count on how many of the remainder actually have National Highway System roadways within their borders. \n \n38. Speaking of Getting Pulled Over: An amendment added to HB 455 establishes a 35 mph speed limit on county and township highways located within national parks that span two more counties -- namely the Cuyahoga Valley National Park. \n \n39. Drunken Drivers: First-time drunken drivers could be granted unlimited driving privileges, so long as their vehicles are equipped with certified ignition interlock devices, under HB 388. \n \nThe units require drivers to blow into them to start the vehicle, checking their blood alcohol content in the process. Cars wouldn't start if drivers had too much to drink. \n \nExisting law allows judges to grant restricted driving privileges to OVI offenders, enabling them to commute to workplaces or schools. Judges also are able to order the use of ignition interlocks, but proponents say HB 388 would expand their use in the state. \n \nColleen Sheehey-Church, national president of Mothers Against Drunk Driving, offered in a statement, \"Many lives will be saved as Ohio increases the number ignition interlocks used by drunk driving offenders.\" \n \n40. Namesake: The legislation was named Annie's Law, in memory Annie Rooney, a 36-year-old attorney from the Chillicothe area who was killed by a drunken driver in 2013. The latter had been arrested multiples times prior for drunken driving. \n \nMarc Kovac is the Dix Capital Bureau Chief.

John Kasich, with most provisions set to take effect in a few months: \n \n41. Infant Mortality: SB 332 implements the recommendations of a state panel that focused on ways to ensure the health and wellbeing of Ohio's babies. And with good reason -- the state's infant mortality rates have been among the worst in the country. \n \nAccording to the Ohio Department of Health, 1,005 Ohio infants died before their first birthday in 2015, up from 955 a year earlier. That's about 7.2 deaths per 1,000 live births, up from 6.8 a year earlier. \n \nBlack babies are dying a rate nearly three times higher than white babies, according to health officials. \n  [Article continues below]   \nThe national rate is about 6 infant deaths per 1,000 live births. \n \n42. What Are They Going To Do About It: SB 332 includes numerous provisions aimed at tackling the infant mortality issue. \n \nFor example, the bill requires state health and Medicaid officials to provide increased access to birth and death information, with quarterly reports made available to the public. The state agencies also will be required to create scorecards that include details of baby deaths by race and region. \n \nMedicaid officials will have to provide detailed information about how millions of dollars in state funding was used over two fiscal years and how effectively the recipient programs and initiatives addressed infant mortality in high-risk neighborhoods. \n \nAdditionally, health officials will be required to provide annual safe sleep training to parents and caregivers in infant morality hotspots and provide tobacco cessation and other programs for needy residents. \n  [Article continues below]   \nThere's also language that allowing parents of babies 30 days old or younger to deliver their children to designated newborn safety incubators without intent to return for their children. \n \n43. Crib Bumpers: One more provision in SB 332: It bans the sale of crib bumpers, which advocates say put babies at risk of suffocation. Certain mesh crib liners are exempt. \n \n44. Civil Forfeiture: HB 347 reforms the civil forfeiture process in the state, with an eye toward preventing law enforcement groups from confiscating private property from law-abiding citizens. \n \nAmong other provisions, the legislation requires probable cause that property was involved in the commission of certain offenses in order for civil forfeiture complaints to be filed. \n \nAccording to the Buckeye Institute, a conservative think tank that supported the legislation, \"This reform is most definitely an idea whose time had come. Civil asset forfeiture laws --believe it or not -- had previously allowed the government to take private property without convicting or even charging the property owner of a crime.\" \n \n45. Sample Time: Would you like to take a few sips of beer, wine or spirituous liquor before buying a product? \n \nHB 444 opens the door for certain liquor permit holders to offer up to four free tasting samples in any 24-hour period to customers age 21 and older. Samples will be limited to 2 ounces of beer or wine or a quarter ounce of spirituous liquor, and they must be given free of charge and consumed on the premises. \n \n46. License Plates: A couple of bills included provisions for new license plates. \n \nSB 207 had half a dozen, including a Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation plate, with proceeds to be directed to the Ohio chapter of that organization. There's also an \"Ohio Pupil TransportationSafety First!!!\" plate, with proceeds supporting efforts to improve training and programming for school bus drivers and others involved in school transportation. \n \nHB 455, meanwhile, created the \"Conquer Childhood Cancer,\" \"University of Notre Dame,\" \"Triple Negative Breast Cancer Awareness,\" \"Improved Benevolent and Protective Order of the Elks of the World,\" \"Down Syndrome Awareness,\" and the \"Buckeye Corvette\" plates. \n \n47. Roads: Those same bills designated stretches of more than a dozen highways in memory of military service members and officers killed in the line of duty. \n \nThe list includes a section of Interstate 77 in Summit County that will honor Army Pfc. Michael Dominic Paonessa, who was killed in action in Vietnam in 1968. \n \nAnother section of I-77 in Summit County will be named the Marine Gunnery Sgt. Robert L. Gilbert II Memorial Highway. Gilbert was killed in action in 2010 while serving in combat in Afghanistan. \n \n48. Boarding Schools: HB 455 also included language allowing cities and townships to set slower speed limits near boarding schools. \n \nThe law changes were offered by Reps. Kristina Roegner (R-Hudson) and John Patterson (D-Jefferson), both of whom have boarding schools located in their districts, including the Western Reserve Academy in Hudson. \n \n49. Organ Donation: Are you confused about what it means when you agree to donate your organs, in the event of your death? HB 438 seeks to provide a bit of clarification, via required instruction as part of school health classes. \n \nAccording to the Legislative Service Commission, \"This instruction must emphasize the life-saving and life-enhancing effects of organ and tissue donation.\" \n \n50. School Appreciation: That same bill designates the week prior to Thanksgiving as \"Ohio Public Education Appreciation Week.\" \n \nMarc Kovac is the Dix Capital Bureau Chief.

There the company wants to build a slag processing plant that will turn Anaconda\u2019s massive black heaps along Highway 1 into proppant \u2014 a material use in fracking oil and natural gas.\n\nThe lease was ultimately approved by the commission, but not before 20 more minutes of deliberation and after residents had offered input.\n\nOne resident, Mike King, called the plan a \u201csavior\u201d that would save Anaconda from Superfund, which he described as a noose around the county\u2019s neck.\n\nLike many small communities in southwest Montana, Anaconda has struggled to revive its economy since the decline of the mining industry in the 1980s. It was during that decade that the smelter in Anaconda closed, causing the town to lose blue collar jobs that had brought the community prosperity for decades.\n\nWhile it\u2019s not yet clear whether slag processing will bring blue-collar jobs back to Anaconda, for the time being economic-development advocates are betting their money on downtown revitalization.\n\nInstrumental in this effort has been the Anaconda Local Development Corporation.\n\nThe ALDC and an umbrella group called Accelerate Anaconda recently unveiled a downtown master plan with help of a Billings-based consulting company.\n\nAccording to the plan, small towns like Anaconda can get more bang for their buck by investing in their urban areas.\n\n\u201cDowntowns provide greater value in tax revenues as compared to a strip mall development or big box retail stores,\u201d the plan says. \u201cWhen comparing development in terms of acres, downtown properties contribute five times the property tax revenue as single-use commercial establishments.\u201d\n\nBut more than that \u2014 said Jim Davison, executive director of the ALDC \u2014 restoring downtowns increases the quality of life for residents.\n\n\u201cIt leads to so many other good things,\u201d said Davison. \u201cThere\u2019s an old, old urban theory of the broken window. If you get a broken window in a building and you don\u2019t fix it, that\u2019s the end of the neighborhood because things deteriorate from there \u2014 versus, fix that broken window, have that amenity, have that activity.\u201d\n\nDowntown development on rise\n\nDavison said Anaconda is already making strides when it comes to redevelopment along the town\u2019s two main thoroughfares, Park and Commercial Avenues.\n\nIn the past year alone, the area has seen the revamping of the following businesses:\n\nAnother resident, Davison said, is planning to launch a beer and wine establishment near Beautiful Life.\n\nWhen asked what has led to the new construction downtown, Davison pointed to strides in both the regional and national economy. He added that the increasing popularity of telecommuting has also made an impact, allowing residents to stay in Anaconda and work anywhere in the world where advances in internet technology have made it feasible for at least five engineering firms to open up shop in the Smelter City.\n\nPopup shops remain poppin\u2019\n\nHowever, a small portion of new development downtown can also be attributed to a popup-shop initiative the ALDC put forward 2½ years ago after a board member heard about the concept at a conference.\n\n\u201cThe best form of economic development is plagiarism,\u201d said Davison.\n\nEssentially, a popup shop is a temporary business that can be launched quickly and cheaply. The idea is to test whether the business can work before making major investments. The concept is relatively new and has become a bit of a catchphrase in recent years. In other words, in the world of economic development, popup shops are what all the cool kids are doing.\n\nDuring the initiative, Davison said, eight home-based businesses were given the chance to occupy a brick-and-mortar location for three months. The ALDC negotiated with property owners to get short-term leases and assisted with things like marketing, signage, branding and rent payments.\n\nToday three of the original shops have become permanent, fulltime businesses, including La Casa Toscana Italian restaurant, Beautiful Life Clothing Boutique and Whispering Winds Spa.\n\nA fourth shop, Amy\u2019s Custom Cakes, folded after its owner moved out of state, but a new bakery, Sugar and Spice, has come in its wake, making use of the existing infrastructure.\n\nRebekah Esquibel, who owns Beautiful Life with her mother Nancy Gibson, said the initiative helped her move out of a 400 square-foot loft inside Pad-N-Pencil on Park Avenue to an 800 square-foot location across the street from Pizza Hut. In March the boutique moved to its third location, 221 E. Park Ave.\n\nAnother concept that seems ripped from the pages of the cool-kid manual of economic development is the \u201cTED Talk.\u201d\n\nThe term \u201cTED Talk\u201d became popular starting in the 1990s when organizers of the TED Conference relaunched an earlier effort to bring technology, entertainment and design fields together in the form of often inspirational and motivational presentations by industry leaders and visionaries.\n\nUnder the umbrella of Accelerate Anaconda, economic development advocates periodically host the TED-style talks in empty buildings downtown.\n\nThe events \u2014 which include beverages, snacks and sometimes live music \u2014 are intended to generate ideas and get people inspired about what\u2019s possible inside Anaconda\u2019s historic buildings.\n\nALDC also supports an Alive After Five group that hosts downtown socials throughout the summer.\n\n\u201cThey bring in music, bring in different food vendors. They have different themes, activities for kids. It\u2018s really family-oriented,\u201d said Davison. \u201cIt\u2019s a great place to gather.\u201d Like many Montana towns, Anaconda is hoping to cash in on tourism.\n\n\u201cThe visitor industry is a huge portion of Montana\u2019s economy and is a huge opportunity for communities along the Yellowstone-Glacier corridor,\u201d said Davidson, noting that last year Yellowstone National Park boasted around 4 million visitors, while Glacier National Park almost hit the 3-million mark.\n\nDavison said when thinking about tourism it\u2019s important to do so from a regional perspective.\n\nHe encouraged economic development advocates to think not just about how they can attract more visitors to their own jurisdictions but also how they can support efforts in other communities.\n\n\u201cHow do we take that mining-history story and link it into Butte, and linked it into Anaconda, and link it into Philipsburg, and link it into the other communities around here that supported the mining industry?\u201d Davison asked.\n\nA great example of working regionally, Davison said, is the Greenway Trail that links Anaconda-Deer Lodge and Butte-Silver Bow.\n\nThe Greenway is a trail for bikes and pedestrians. Dori Skrukrud, Butte community development coordinator and project manager for the Silver Bow Creek Greenway Corridor project, said the trail system came out of a multi-jurisdictional effort in 1998 when leaders in both counties came together to establish the Greenway Service District.\n\nThe project involved Superfund cleanup along the Silver Bow Creek corridor, reaching out to residents in both counties and establishing Copperway, which Skrukrud described as a branding concept shared by both counties, replete with a logo that appears at Greenway trailheads.\n\n\u201c(It\u2019s) the way of copper,\u201d Skrukrud said. \u201cThe history, the heritage, the development of our communities.\u201d\n\nToday bikers and pedestrians can walk, run and bike from Butte to Ramsay, located about 7 miles west of Butte on Interstate 90.\n\nThe ultimate goal is to extend the trail to the town of Opportunity, located 6 miles southeast of Anaconda off Highway 1, Skrukrud said.\n\nMeanwhile, the folks at the Anaconda Trail Society are working to make that happen.\n\nAdam Vauthier, organization chairmen, said the Trail Society has championed efforts to make Anaconda more bike-friendly and handicapped accessible, while also revamping existing trails and creating new ones in areas around Anaconda. The group also provides guided bike rides during the summer and is sponsoring an initiative to bring a bike camp to Anaconda.\n\nWhen asked why it\u2019s worth investing in recreational activities like hiking and biking, Vauthier said that communities that support active lifestyles tend to be better off economically.\n\nAside from the physical benefits of hiking and biking and the potential decrease in healthcare costs for residents, Vauthier said recreational activities can provide an economic boost in the form of increased tourism.\n\n\u201cWe know that bicyclists that travel long distances generally spend more money,\u201d said Vauthier. \u201cBiking tourism is very lucrative.\u201d\n\nHence, the Trail Society hopes the bike camp \u2014 where bikers can shower, store their belongings, charge their phones and have access to a kitchenette \u2014will attact more cyclists, including those who travel the Continental Divide Trail, to make a stop in Anaconda. While Anaconda has made small strides in downtown development in recent years, the community is not without its challenges.\n\nDavison said the Community Hospital of Anaconda is one of the largest employers in the county, but 25 percent of its staff live outside of Anaconda. Many of them, Davison said, site access to housing that meets their lifestyle expectations as the main reason for living outside of town.\n\nBut one thing Anaconda doesn\u2019t lack is community passion.\n\nDuring a 2016 address she gave during a January fundraiser for the Anaconda Chamber of Commerce, former Smelter City resident and former Lt. Gov. Angela McLean described Anaconda as a place where residents rally together.\n\n\u201cDo we know hard times in Anaconda? We absolutely do. But what we will never know is hard times alone,\u2019\u2019 said McLean. \u201cThe smelter and the stack will forever be a source of pride. A symbol of getting back up on our feet and fighting for a better tomorrow.\u201d\n\nMore than a year later, Davison agrees.\n\n\u201cI think it keeps a genuineness of who we are,\u201d said Davison when asked about the impact of community identity. \u201cThere\u2019s a quote in one of Steinbeck\u2019s books\u2026 For other states I have admiration and respect, but for Montana I have Love. And I think that Montanans and Anacondans and Buttians have love for their communities.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Annie Pentilla anne.pentilla@mtstandard.com"},"topics":[],"title":"Anaconda economic development advocates bet on downtown revitalization as winning strategy","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Deer Lodge","zipCode":"59711","state":"Montana","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Anaconda","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Montana Standard","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169680055","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1476"},"name":"Montana Standard","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Business","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.mtstandard.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201552161","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:07:11Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/mtstandard.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/0c/80cecf44-f479-5fb4-9f90-428108548c67/588a90dc75716.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C992%2C0%2C91&amp;resize=1120%2C630&amp;order=crop%2Cresize"},{"url":"http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/mtstandard.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/0c/80cecf44-f479-5fb4-9f90-428108548c67/588a90dc75716.image.jpg?resize=300%2C200"}],"video":[]}}

They get separated based on how quickly they respond to electric fields. \n \nWhile capillary electrophoresis has been around since the early 1980s, this is the first time it has been tailored specifically to detect extraterrestrial life on an ocean world, said Jessica Creamer, a postdoctoral scholar at JPL. \n \n\"Our method improves on previous attempts by increasing the number of amino acids that can be detected in a single run,\" Creamer said. \n \n\"Additionally, it allows us to detect these amino acids at very low concentrations, even in highly salty samples, with a very simple 'mix and analyse' process,\" she said. \n \nThe researchers used the technique to analyse amino acids present in the salt-rich waters of Mono Lake in California. \n \nThe lake's exceptionally high alkaline content makes it a challenging habitat for life, and an excellent stand-in for salty waters believed to be on Mars, or the ocean worlds of Saturn's moon Enceladus and Jupiter's moon Europa. \n \nThe researchers were able to simultaneously analyse 17 different amino acids, which they are calling \"the Signature 17 standard.\" These amino acids were chosen for study because they are the most commonly found on Earth or elsewhere. \n \n\"Using our method, we are able to tell the difference between amino acids that come from non-living sources like meteorites versus amino acids that come from living organisms,\" said the project's principal investigator, Peter Willis of JPL. \n \nThe study was published in the journal Analytical Chemistry. \n \n(This article has not been edited by DNA's editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"New test to detect signs of life on alien planets","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"DNA India","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659516","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1346"},"name":"DNA India","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["InformationTechnology","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.dnaindia.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201560683","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:59:44Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:07:13Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The American Civil Liberties Union successfully argued for a temporary stay that allowed detained travelers to stay in the United States. \n \nSupporters outside the Brooklyn courtroom and at protests at airports in Dallas, Chicago, New York and elsewhere cheered the decision, but a bigger fight lay ahead. \n \nThe court action does not reverse Trump's order, which was criticized by some of America's closest allies. \n \nTrump, a businessman who successfully tapped into American fears about terror attacks during his campaign, had promised what he called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants and refugees from areas the White House said the U.S. Congress deemed to be high risk. \n \nHe told reporters in the White House's Oval Office on Saturday that his order was \"not a Muslim ban\" and said the measures were long overdue. \n \n\"It's working out very nicely. You see it at the airports, you see it all over,\" Trump said. \n \nAlong with Syria, the ban affects travelers with passports from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. \n \nThe Department of Homeland Security said about 375 travelers had been affected by the order, 109 of whom were in transit and were denied entry to the United States. Another 173 were stopped by airlines before boarding. \n \nThe order \"affects a minor portion of international travelers,\" the department said in a statement, saying the measures \"inconvenienced\" less than 1 percent of travelers. \n \nThe new rules blindsided people in transit and families waiting for them, and caused havoc for businesses with employees holding passports from the targeted nations and colleges with international students. \n \nPegah Rahmani, 25, waited at Washington's Dulles airport for several hours for her grandparents, both Iranian citizens with U.S. green cards. \"They weren't treating them very well,\" she said. \n \nRahmani's grandfather is 88 and legally blind. Her grandmother is 83 and recently had a stroke. They were released to loud cheers and cries. \n \n'TIP OF THE SPEAR' \n \nSeveral Democratic governors said they were examining whether they could launch legal challenges, and other groups eyed a constitutional challenge claiming religious discrimination. \n \n\"I don't think anyone is going to take this lying down,\" said Cleveland immigration lawyer David Leopold. \"This is the tip of the spear and more litigation is coming.\" \n \nThe White House did not respond immediately to a request for comment. \n \nThe Department of Homeland Security said the order would stay in place. \n \n\"No foreign national in a foreign land, without ties to the United States, has any unfettered right to demand entry into the United States,\" the department statement said. \n \nMark Krikorian, the director of the conservative Center for Immigration Studies, called lawsuits challenging the order \"last ditch efforts\" that would only apply to a few individuals, and he said a broader constitutional argument would be hard to win. \n \n\"The first amendment doesn't apply to foreigners living abroad. The law explicitly says the president can exclude any person or class of people he wants,\" Krikorian said. \n \nSome leaders from the U.S. technology industry, a major employer of foreign workers, issued warnings to their staff and called the order immoral and un-American. \n \n\"This ban will impact many innocent people,\" said Travis Kalanick, chief executive of Uber Technologies Inc UBER.UL, who said he would raise the issue at a White House meeting on Friday. \n \nArab travelers in the Middle East and North Africa said the order was humiliating and discriminatory. Iran vowed to retaliate. \n \nSudan called the action \"very unfortunate\" after Washington lifted sanctions on the country just weeks ago for cooperation on combating terrorism. A Yemeni official expressed dismay at the ban. \n \nIraq's former ambassador to the United States, Lukman Faily, told Reuters that Trump's ban was unfair to a country that itself has been a victim of terror attacks, and could backfire. \n \n\"We have a strong partnership with U.S., more so in the urgent fight against terrorism. This ban move will not help, and people will start questioning the bond of this partnership, Faily said. \n \nAllies in the United Kingdom, France and Germany were critical. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeted a photo of himself welcoming Syrian refugees. \n \nGREEN CARD CONFUSION \n \nConfusion abounded at airports as immigration and customs officials struggled to interpret the new rules. Some legal residents with green cards who were in the air when the order was issued were detained at airports upon arrival. \n \nHowever, senior administration officials said it would have been \"reckless\" to broadcast details of the order in advance. \n \nOther officials said green card holders from the affected countries would require extra screening and would be cleared on a case-by-case basis. \n \nAirlines were blindsided and some cabin crew were barred from entering the country. \n \nTravelers were handled differently at different points of entry and immigration lawyers advised clients to change their destination to the more lenient airports, said Houston immigration lawyer Mana Yegani. \n \nAt Chicago O'Hare International Airport, brothers Bardia and Ayden Noohi waited for four hours for their father Kasra Noohi - who has an Iranian passport and a U.S. green card - to be allowed through. \n \nThey knew Trump had pledged tougher rules but did not expect the problems. \"I didn't think he'd actually do it,\" Bardia Noohi, 32, said. \"A lot of politicians just talk.\" \n \nThousands of refugees seeking entry were thrown into limbo. Melanie Nezer of the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society said she knew of roughly 2,000 who were booked to come to the United States next week. \n \nTrump's order indefinitely bans refugees from Syria. In a television interview, he said he would seek to prioritize Christian refugees fleeing the war-torn country. \n \nU.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they were not consulted on the action and in some cases only learned the details as they were made public. \n \nAt the State Department, a senior official said lawyers were working to interpret the executive order, which allows entry to people affected by the order when it is in the \"national interest.\" \n \nHowever, a federal law enforcement official said: \"It's unclear at this point what the threshold of national interest is.\" \n \n(This article has not been edited by DNA's editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Religion news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"WRAPUP 6-Chaos, anger as Trump order halts some Muslim immigrants","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"DNA India","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659516","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1346"},"name":"DNA India","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.dnaindia.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201561668","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:03:31Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:07:15Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

However, they were reduced to 51 for 3 in the middle of the sixth over when Verma came in. He put on 25 for the fourth wicket with Roy, before dominating the next three partnerships - his three partners scoring a combined 17 off 29 - en route to an unbeaten 55 off 41 that took Assam past the target with nine balls to spare. Aaron (2-39) and Rahul Shukla (2-30) were among the wickets for Jharkhand, while Shahbaz Nadeem took 1 for 9 in his four overs.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: cricket news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Verma's all-round performance takes Assam to four-wicket victory","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"GB","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"CricInfo","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657455","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"6"},"name":"CricInfo","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Cricket","Sports"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://espncricinfo.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.espncricinfo.com/indian-domestic-2016-17/content/story/1080019.html?CMP=OTC-RSS#comments","http://www.espncricinfo.com/indian-domestic-2016-17/content/story/1080019.html?CMP=OTC-RSS#","http://www.espncricinfo.com/indian-domestic-2016-17/content/story/1080019.html?wrappertype=print","http://www.espncricinfo.com/india/content/player/26441.html","http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/1079281.html","http://www.espncricinfo.com/india/content/player/228430.html","http://www.espncricinfo.com/india/content/player/360911.html","http://www.espncricinfo.com/india/content/player/390547.html","http://www.espncricinfo.com/india/content/player/31872.html","http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/current/match/1079282.html"],"sequenceId":"695201563425","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:55:20Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:07:16Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.espncricinfo.com/db/PICTURES/CMS/139200/139216.3.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

The Yunus Centre, which claims to be an organisation aimed at 'promoting and disseminating Professor Yunus' philosophy', issued a rejoinder on Saturday, claiming that most of these allegations have been made repeatedly since 2011.\n\n\"They have been thoroughly responded to on each occasion,\" it read.\n\nIn her address at the House on Wednesday, Hasina claimed Yunus used his connections with former US secretary of state Hillary Clinton to block the $1.2 billion World Bank funding for the Padma Bridge project.\n\n\"He (Yunus) and the editor of a renowned newspaper in our country went to meet the World Bank president.\n\n\"The World Bank stopped funding Padma Bridge after all of them including America's foreign secretary Hillary Clinton lobbied for it,\" she said in response to a question.\n\nThe Yunus Centre statement says the Nobel laureate 'has categorically rejected' the claim in the past.\n\n\"He had repeated many times, and repeats it again in this rejoinder that Padma Bridge is a dream of the people of Bangladesh and that he would dedicate all his energy to realise this dream,\" it read. The prime minister had told the House that Yunus does not pay taxes against fixed deposit with banks and sues authorities when asked to pay tax.\n\nHasina also said that the sources of Yunus' income were unknown.\n\nYunus Centre dismissed the allegation of tax evasion as 'completely false'.\n\nThe statement said Yunus' incomes come from three sources -- fee for lectures at conferences, royalties from books and from fixed deposits generated from those incomes.\n\nIt said that his earnings from lectures and royalty from books are remitted to Bangladesh through proper banking channels and the details are documented with the banks and also submitted to the tax authorities.\n\nYunus keeps his money in fixed deposits with banks and has no investments, the statement said citing that taxes on those are paid at source.\n\nHasina also said that Grameen Bank enjoys a tax benefit, but there are 40 to 50 other sister concerns, who also don't pay tax. \"Why will they not pay taxes? The NBR has those reports.\"\n\nFinance Minister AMA Muhith followed up the statement and told the media the next day a probe will be launched into it.\n\nThe statement described it as a 'completely baseless accusation.' It said all organisations created by Yunus pay tax, VAT and none of them enjoys any tax benefit.\n\nOn Wednesday, an angry Hasina went on to describe Yunus as a 'cheat' over Grameenphone as he breached the promise he made before setting up the telecom entity.\n\n\"This lobbying that he did...at that time he obtained the Grameenphone (GP) licence from me. Ask him, did he even offer me a cup of tea for the licence? \"On the contrary, it was I who invited him to my office, offered him tea and gave him business,\" a miffed prime minister said adding he did not pass on the profits from the telecoms venture to Grameen Bank.\n\nThe statement said that GP was joint venture with Norway's state-owned Telenor as the lead partner and Grameen Telecom, a non-profit entity with no private owners and registered under the Company Act, was the second owner.\n\nYunus Centre claimed that profits from GP that come to Grameen Telecom are used for projects that 'support the welfare of the common people' through Grameen Telecom Trust.\n\nIt said all GP documents are available with the government.\n\n\"Professor Yunus never owned any share of Grameenphone at any stage of the company, nor does he own any share now. Therefore, the question of his selling shares to anyone does not arise. \n\n\"Similarly, since Grameen Bank did not own any share of Grameenphone at any time, the question of Grameen Bank selling shares of GP does not arise either. Grameen Telecom never sold any of its shares to anyone except in the case of selling shares to general public, as agreed by all partners of Grameenphone and the Government of Bangladesh,\" the statement added.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Bangladesh news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Political unrest news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Yunus Centre protests PM Hasina's statement made in Parliament","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"BD","country":"Bangladesh"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Bdnews24.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169667953","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"128"},"name":"Bdnews24.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Financials","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bdnews24.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://bdnews24.com/economy/2017/01/29/yunus-centre-protests-pm-hasina-s-statement-made-in-parliament&src=sdkpreparse","http://www.printfriendly.com/","http://delivery.ritsads.com/w/1.0/rc?cs=ff614e8f84&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE","http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript","http://disqus.com/","http://delivery.ritsads.com/w/1.0/rc?cs=9e5f0d291c&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE"],"sequenceId":"695201564981","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T13:56:21Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:07:18Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://d30fl32nd2baj9.cloudfront.net/media/2017/01/29/yunus-centre-rejoinder.jpg/ALTERNATES/w640/Yunus+Centre-Rejoinder.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

The victory gives the senior class their one-hundredth win as members of the Bethel College Pilots. \n \nCaleb Oetjen led three Pilots in double figures with 22 points going 8-of-12 from the field. Jordyn Coon contributed 18 points, nine rebounds, and four assists. Junior Gage Ott added 17 points, six rebounds, and three assists. \n \nNick Kindig started out the contest hitting back-to-back threes, which was followed by a bucket from Gage Ott giving the Pilots take an early 8-4 lead. However, Indiana Wesleyan responded with point-guard Grant Zawadzki hitting a pair of triples to take a 10-8 lead with 15:43 left to play in the half. Both teams struggled to secure the ball early in the first half, having a combined 18 turnovers in the first twelve minutes of the game. The Pilots closed out the half hitting four of their last six attempts and going on a 13-8 run to take a 47-42 lead at the break. \nBethel headed into the locker room shooting 54.3 percent from the field and connecting on 19-of-35 attempts while shooting 42.9 percent from behind the three-point line.

In the next minutes of the game the Wildcats responded with six different players scoring to go on a 15-3 run, which cut the Pilots lead to just two with 8:30 left to play. Despite the run, a quick bucket from Oetjen and Coon would give the Pilots a seven-point cushion entering the final two minutes. With 1:43 left play the persistence of the Pilots helped them gain an 11-point lead. While Indiana Wesleyan tried to cut the lead with three-point attempts from Bob Peters and Grant Evans, both shots fell short. The Wildcats were forced to foul, and the Pilots stepped up to the challenge, knocking in all six free throws in the last minute and a half to help secure the victory. \n \nThe Pilots shot 55 percent from the field, connecting on 33-of-60 attempts, while shooting a solid 42.3 percent from behind the arc.

These are priced between Rs 8.78 lakh and Rs 10.63 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi). \n \nWhen contacted a MSI spokesperson told : \"In this segment (1.6 litre engine), customers go for highest trim that has all the features. Therefore, it is business prudence to keep the number of variants at an optimum level in line with customers requirements.\" \n \nThe model's performance is in line with the company's expectation, the spokesperson added. \n \n\"We started a new segment called premium crossover with S Cross. Volume-wise, S-Cross continues to do an average of 2,000-2,100 units monthly,\" the spokesperson said. \n \nS-Cross, the first model from the stable of MSI to be sold through its premium retail chain NEXA, has had a chequered history. \n \nMSI had introduced the S-Cross in two options of 1.6 litre and 1.3 litre engines in 2015 coinciding with the launch of its premium retail outlet chain Nexa. However, pricing issues hindered sales of the vehicle forcing the company to go for price correction. \n \nLast year, the company had cut price of the vehicle by over Rs 2 lakh. The reduction in the price of 1.6 litre variant was Rs 2,05,000 for all the three trims, while that of 1.3 litre variant ranged from Rs 40,000 to Rs 66,000. \n \nS-Cross along with Vitara Brezza have helped the company enhance its market share in the utility vehicle (UV) segment. \n \nWhile Vitara Brezza has been a runaway hit, S-Cross has been a slow starter for the company. \n \nAcknowledging the fact, the spokesperson said: \"Every brand has a specific role in the overall portfolio. While some are mass models that sell in big numbers, others may not sell as much as a mass model but contribute to the overall brand objectives of the company for the medium and long term\". \n \nS-Cross helps Maruti Suzuki in expanding its range and presence with an eye on the future, the spokesperson added. \n \nGrowth in the UV segment for MSI is over 120 per cent for the April-December period this fiscal. Volume wise the company has sold 1,43,254 units during the April-December period as compared to 63,924 units in the previous fiscal. \nThe company now commands over 65 per cent market share in the total UV segment.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Indian subcontinent news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Maruti Suzuki India discontinues sale of lower variants of S-Cross","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Economic & India Times Auto.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"594642922","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Economic & India Times Auto.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["AutomobilesComponents","Industrials","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://auto.economictimes.indiatimes.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201572342","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:12:05Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:07:23Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

We\u2019ll cross that bridge when we come to it.\u201d \n \nWhite seems to agree with McGregor when it comes to co-promoting alongside the UFC if he really wants the fight with Mayweather to generate the kind of life changing money he could make off the proposed boxing match. \n \n\u201cYou know how I feel about Conor. I\u2019ve always shown Conor nothing but respect and if he wants to go down that road with us, let me tell you, it will be an epic fall,\u201d White said at the FOX UFC Fight Night post fight press conference. \n \nMcGregor and Mayweather both seemed to agree that it\u2019s very possible the fight between them could realistically come together before the end of the year. \n \nThat being said, White still isn\u2019t willing to wager that the two biggest superstars in combat sports will ever come to an agreement to meet in the ring. \n \n\u201cHere\u2019s what I think the chances are \u2014 about the same as me being the back up quarterback for (Tom) Brady on Sunday,\u201d White said. \n \nIt was just a couple of weeks ago that White offered Mayweather and McGregor $25 million each plus a cut of the pay-per-view profits to stage the mega-fight. White says he pressed the button on that offer because Mayweather continuously claimed that he was trying to put the fight together yet never actually reached out to him to ask about promoting the fight. \n \n\u201cBecause (Mayweather) was full of (expletive) and he said that he had made an offer, which wasn\u2019t true. So I made a real offer. That was a real offer,\u201d White said. \n \nAs far as McGregor\u2019s numerous other comments on Saturday, including an Instagram tirade where he went on an expletive laced rant against the UFC, Mayweather, and the WWE, White didn\u2019t take any offense. \n \nMcGregor\u2019s post came just about an hour before he hit the stage in England for a pay-per-view interview that cost approximately $5 to view and White knows he was just trying to drum up some last minute business before going live. \n \n\u201cI didn\u2019t hear all that,\u201d White said. \u201cHey listen, when you\u2019re about to go on and do a pay-per-view that you\u2019re charging people $5 to listen to you talk, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve got to say some pretty crazy (expletive).\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: MMA news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Dana White scoffs at McGregor promoting fight against Mayweather without the UFC","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Bartholomew","zipCode":"47203","state":"Indiana","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Columbus","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"1010 WCSI","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"541446766","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3"},"name":"1010 WCSI","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Consumer","Sports"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://1010wcsi.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.foxsports.com/ufc/story/conor-mcgregor-expects-his-next-fight-to-be-against-floyd-mayweather-012817","http://www.foxsports.com/ufc/story/floyd-mayweather-responds-to-conor-mcgregor-after-fiery-interview-012917","http://www.foxsports.com/ufc/story/conor-mcgregor-blasts-the-ufc-wwe-and-floyd-mayweather-ahead-of-ppv-interview-012817"],"sequenceId":"695201577404","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:07:25Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

We recently caught up with her at M-Net\u2019s 2017 showcase for their upcoming local shows to chat about the new job. \n \nIt\u2019s a show called Wedding Bashers and she will be travelling all across South Africa to attend and judge the weddings featured on each episode. \n \nShe will be joined on the judging panel by Siba Mtongana, Cindy Nell and Zavion Kotze. \n   \nSiba Mtongana is a multi-award winning celebrity TV chef, food judge and freelance food writer with a show on the Food Network called Siba's Table. We guess she\u2019ll be bringing her expertise to the culinary aspect of each wedding.  \n\n \nZavion is a wedding planner and former Survivor SA contestant. Once described by Channel 24 as \u201cthe stereotypical image of an out-and-proud gay wedding planner,\u201d he actually brings so much more to the table than that. He has been the SA Student Decathlon Champion for the past four years and trained for the Sharks Rugby Academy under-21 side. \n \nBut he is quite the perfectionist so the couples better beware. \n \nCindy Nell first came into the spotlight when she won the Miss South Africa title and she has since gone to feature on reality shows such as Survivor SA and Strictly Come Dancing. \n \nShe now juggles the roles of TV Host, wife, mommy, business-woman, and model. \n \n © Provided by Kagiso New Media Proprietary Limited Denise Zimba Wedding Bashers \n\n  \nThe judges will often have to attend themed weddings so we can expect to see them dressed to the nines in a variety of looks. \n\n \nWhile the outfits may get crazy, Denise says she won\u2019t. \n \n\u201cOne thing a lot of people are going to be surprised by is the fact that I am not going to come as crazy Denise, the Denise that I\u2019ve always been. People grow and mature. You also end up wanting to direct yourself and your career into a different place as you get older.\u201d \n \nShe\u2019s not doing a complete 180 though. \n \n\u201cThere will be a little bit of the crazy Denise but I will also be smart and critical about what I say because I\u2019ll be judging the entertainment side of things but I\u2019ll also keep it cool and collected. For the most part, it\u2019s not going to be Looking-For-The-Loerie crazy\u201d \n \nShe was one of our highest viewed stories this past week for THAT comment she made about Ayanda Thabethe and she says she will be bringing that same honesty to Wedding Bashers. \n \n\u201cI always believe you\u2019ve just gotta be yourself and be real. Whoever likes you does and whoever doesn\u2019t like you doesn\u2019t.\u201d \n \nIn addition to the new show, she also plans to genuinely get back into music. \n \n\u201cI don\u2019t care what anyone thinks. Guys... I am THE SH** when it comes to my music.\u201d \n \nAnd it is for that exact reason that she will be pursuing it with a passion this year and knocking down anything that stands in her way. \n \n\u201cI\u2019ve learned that in life, if you wanna do something, pursue it, put it out into the universe and then keep it moving\u201d \n \nMain image credit: Instagram","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"Denise Zimba to be a judge on new M-Net Wedding Show","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Southern Africa","countryCode":"ZA","country":"South Africa"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"MSN South Africa","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"491300065","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1946"},"name":"MSN South Africa","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Arts","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.msn.com","publisher":"Microsoft Corporation"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201578091","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:07:25Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}
