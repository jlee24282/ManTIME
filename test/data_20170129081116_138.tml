<TEXT type="str">A recap of game-changing news with a few extra twists from the pages of January&apos;s Lewiston Tribune.

One financial measure of the Port of Lewiston has shown a loss for the fourth consecutive year. 
 
The port experienced an operating loss of $501,234 in fiscal year 2016. The loss is a calculation of revenue and expenses at the port&apos;s container dock, a large warehouse, its rentals and a telecommunications network it is constructing, according to the port&apos;s annual audit. 
 
One of the largest expenses was depreciation at $406,469, which has to be deducted as infrastructure ages, but is not real dollars going out the door. 
 
The port experienced losses in the same category of $92,435 in fiscal year 2013, $445,497 in fiscal year 2014 and $401,917 in fiscal year 2015. 
 
Port officials contend the losses are not an accurate picture of the port&apos;s overall financial health. 
 
The port&apos;s net position was $24.3 million at the end of fiscal year 2016 and $21.9 million at the end of fiscal year 2013. 
 
That number includes the port&apos;s capital assets, which were $19.6 million in fiscal year 2016 and $17.3 million in fiscal year 2013, according to an email from port Manager David Doeringsfeld. 
 
It also contains the more than $400,000 the port receives each year in property taxes and more than $1 million in gains from property sales. 
 
The port used to ship dried peas and lentils from its container dock until the overseas carriers that took them to their final destinations stopped calling on the Port of Portland. That service is expected to resume in the future, but it is &quot;unlikely&quot; to return during the present fiscal year, according to the audit. Plenty of cargo still originates in Lewiston at the Lewis Clark Terminal that handles bulk agricultural commodities. 
 
St. Joseph Regional Medical Center: No deal yet 
 
The wait to see what will happen to the area&apos;s largest hospital continues. 
 
The Idaho Attorney General&apos;s Office received a two-month extension to finish its review of the matter, citing a need for more time to obtain information such as the due diligence St. Joseph Regional Medical Center completed in selecting a buyer. The decision had been due on Jan. 18. It now can be issued as late as March 20. 
 
RCCH Regional Healthcare Partners in Brentwood, Tenn., is poised to acquire St. Joe&apos;s from Ascension in a $109 million deal. 
 
The would-be buyer is part of the investment firm, Apollo Global Management, and operates a network of 17 regional health care systems in other areas. Ascension is based in St. Louis. It is the largest not-for-profit health system in the United States and the biggest Catholic medical organization in the world. 
 
57 channels and no FOX on 
 
A notice about an ongoing dispute is all Cable One viewers see when they turn on KAYU-FOX. The cable company that serves the Lewiston-Clarkston Valley and the owner of the Spokane network affiliate don&apos;t see eye to eye on a retransmission agreement. (See accompanying stories.) The standoff shocked many Cable One customers. It started on New Year&apos;s Day and prevented many viewers from seeing the Seattle Seahawks beat the San Francisco 49ers in a regular-season finale aired on KAYU-FOX. 
 
A new face for Thunder Jet 
 
Brunswick didn&apos;t skimp on talent when it chose a leader for its recent Clarkston acquisition, Thunder Jet. Erik Bon Fleur, an engineer who&apos;s completing his master&apos;s in administration, is in charge of the operations, which employ close to 100. Brunswick, a multinational company with 16,000 employees, intends to keep all of the Thunder Jet operations in Clarkston, where it is renovating and expanding. Thunder Jet provided Brunswick an entrance into the heavy-gauge welded aluminum boat market, a sector that serves those who pilot boats in tough conditions such as whitewater and the ocean. 
 
More hamburgers anyone? 
 
Hamburgers are one of the foods diners order most when they go out to eat. Lewiston-Clarkston Valley residents will have another place to score them this spring. 
 
Zip&apos;s Drive-In is replacing Polar Bear, one of Lewiston&apos;s oldest independently owned eateries, on the corner of Eighth Street and 16th Avenue. Polar Bear closed last week. Zip&apos;s anticipates opening May 1.
