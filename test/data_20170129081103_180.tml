<TITLE>Sloan was right on Anthem and Kaeperneck</TITLE>
<TEXT>In a recent Letter-to-the-Editor appearing on Sunday, Jan. 15, Daniel J. Andrews from The Villages stated that Russ Sloan needs a history lesson. No, it is Mr. Andrews that needs a lesson on our Constitution and the First Amendment. 
 
In the column by Russ Sloan regarding 49ers quarterback ColinKaeperneck not standing for the National Anthem, Mr. Sloan pointed out that while Mr. Kaeperneck has the right to do that as an individual, that right does not exist if your employer, the 49ers, does not approve. First Amendment rights are not the same as an employee as they are as an individual. We have freedom of speech, but an employer can take action against an employee who uses vulgar or obscene language with a customer or coworker. Legally, ColinKaeperneck does not have the right to protest standing for our National Anthem unless his employer approves. Russ Sloan simply pointed out that if he was the head football coach of the 49ers, he would privately let the ownership know that either Kaeperneck stands for the National Anthem or the 49ers can find a new coach or a new quarterback. 
 
It is clear that Mr. Andrews does not fully understand the limits of the First Amendment as an individual versus as an employee. The ownership of the 49ers, for whatever reason, chose to tolerate Kaeperneck's disrespect of our National Anthem. Apparently Mr. Andrews feels the same way. Mr. Sloan felt differently and his position was 100 percent correct based on our Constitution and the limitations of the First Amendment rights in the workplace. Russ Sloan does not need a lesson on American history, Mr. Andrews needs a lesson on our Constitution!
