<content type="str">Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger was delighted with his side&apos;s 5-0 thrashing of Southampton in the FA Cup 

Arsene Wenger admitted he was pleasantly surprised with Danny Welbeck&apos;s powers of recovery after the striker netted a double in the 5-0 win at Southampton. 

Wenger feared Welbeck might have lost his edge after 20 months out with two knee injuries, but looked back to his best as he fired his first goals since April to put Arsenal 2-0 in front at St Mary&apos;s. 

Welbeck had only just beaten knee ligament trouble when he suffered cartilage problems in late April, but he flourished on the south coast on Saturday to banish his injury worries. 

Gunners boss Wenger hailed the 26-year-old&apos;s resolve in fending off not one but two long-term knee blows to move back towards top form.

Asked if he had feared Welbeck may never recover full sharpness, Wenger said: &quot;You do wonder. I wondered first of all would he be solid enough mentally to cope with that. 

&quot;Then secondly you hope he will go well after he comes back after the second surgery. 

&quot;He worked very hard, he went through some moments of very deep disappointment. Because when he had the setback and he had to go in again, as a professional player that&apos;s very difficult.

&quot;But he became even more resilient and worked even harder. He&apos;s highly respected inside the club because he&apos;s shown so much dedication. 

&quot;It was good to see Welbeck be so convincing. I didn&apos;t expect him at that level, because I knew he worked very hard but I didn&apos;t know how much efficiency it would be in a competitive game. 

&quot;It was great to see he hasn&apos;t lost his runs or his finishing; it shows as well when you are able to transform that frustration in not playing into efficiency that he&apos;s a special guy.

&quot;There are always two fears, the first is that it takes him too long with decision-making, and second that he would be scared for contact. 

&quot;But the runs and also fighting the defenders, it was important for me.&quot; 

Welbeck opened the scoring with a dinked finish before latching onto Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain&apos;s lofted pass to slide home between Harry Lewis&apos; legs. 

The former Manchester United striker then laid on Walcott&apos;s first goal, before second-half replacement Alexis Sanchez set up the final two finishes. 

Wenger hailed Walcott for staying calm to score his treble and kill off any chances of a Saints fightback. 

&quot;Theo is a good finisher,&quot; said Wenger. &quot;And the chances we created were very good. He&apos;s very quick, he has a short backlift and is very accurate in finishing.&quot;
