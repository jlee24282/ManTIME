<content type="str">Following back-to-back wistful performances by New Kids On The Block , Eddie Money , Starship , and more at the iHeart80s Party, English singer-songwriter Rick Astley concluded the show with a performance of his greatest hits Saturday night. 
 
Astley kicked off his set with a classic rickroll , leading the fans at SAP Center to believe that he was going to open with &quot; Never Gonna Give You Up ,&quot; but instead performed his Whenever You Need Somebody single &quot; Together Forever ,&quot; before going into &quot; Strong Strong Man .&quot; In between performances, the &apos;80s icon, who turns 50 on February 6, made self-deprecating jokes about his age and blamed it for his lack of dance numbers, and asked fans to do the two-stepping for him during &quot; She Wants to Dance With Me .&quot;

Following back-to-back performances of energized hits, Astley slowed things down with his single &quot; Angels On My Side &quot; off his 1991 album Free . Before he concluded his set with his world-conquering cut &quot;Never Gonna Give You Up,&quot; he performed the first few verses a cappella to make sure fans were prepared to sing along.
