<TITLE>Artistes du Terrebonne: Our Artist of the Month loves landscapes</TITLE>
<TEXT>The Terrebonne Fine Arts Guild has selected Sam Richardson as Artist of the Month for February. 
 
His exhibit will be on display Feb. 1-24 at Downtown Art Gallery 630, 630 Belanger St. in Houma. Gallery hours are Tuesdays to Fridays from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Entry to the gallery is always free. 
 
Richardson started painting about four years ago. He started experimenting with leftover art supplies from one of his wifes hobbies. Amazed at what artists could do with paint and paper, he decided to try. He continued until he was pleased with the results. 
 
Being an enthusiastic lover of nature, it was only natural for him to prefer painting landscapes. His medium of choice is acrylic. He has great admiration for the work of other artists but is determined to continue his course in his style with no training. 
 
Color and design workshop: Margaret Chouest will teach the workshop Monday at the gallery. If you're interested, call Janet Mayfield at 872-3289. 
 
Exhibits: Karen Bordok is showing artwork at Griffins Po-Boy & Grill on Tunnel Boulevard in Houma during February. Guild members also maintain an exhibit on the seventh floor of the Government Tower, Main and Gabasse streets. 
 
Member news: Several guild members have had paintings accepted in the New Orleans Art Association National Show. It will be held during March at the New Orleans Academy of Art. Artists accepted are Betty Porche, Janet Mayfield, Michelle Eroche and Karen Kelly.
