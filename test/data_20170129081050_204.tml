<TEXT type="str">I am not a beach person. 
I write this as I sit on the deck of a house 199 steps (yes, I counted them) from a beach.But, I go to beaches just to get to the water. I&apos;ve never been much for relaxing on a blanket under the shoreline sun for hours. One of my least favorite things is the tedious trudge through cracked shells minefields and hot, soft sand on the way to the waves.Another of those &quot;least favorite things&quot; is the return from the beach coated with gazillions of sticky grains of sand.My burdens on a trek to the surf have consisted of the obligatory swim trunks, rash guard shirt, visor hat, beach towel and - for longer stays - a folding chair. Mind you, it&apos;s a full-sized chair, not one of those low-slung beach chairs that I find quite uncomfortable and unwieldy.If the grandkids are in tow, I might take a boogie board and a kite. But, usually not much more.I think, then, that I can be forgiven for not keeping up with all the gizmos on the market that have been designed to make walks to and hours on beaches easier.One such item that caught my attention is the Rinsekit Shower. I noticed it advertised in a Jersey Shore promotional magazine.&quot;No more muddy dogs or sandy feet,&quot; it promises.The $90 pressurized portable shower is the panacea for those who visit beaches with no public showers or even courtesy hoses with spray nozzles for quick feet and legs rinsing.The Rinsekit stores two gallons of water and pumps it out at 65 pounds per square inch, about the power of a home faucet.The product was invented by California surfer Chris Crawford, who often found himself stranded on a strand, up to his ankles in crud, and with no shower nearby.More power to the surfer dude and anyone who buys one of his inventions. He found a need and filled it. I hope he sells many.His firm is even expanded its product line with models in either black or white, a portable water heater for the device, and some sort of a $50 accessory kit that injects pressure into the water tank with a bicycle pump.But, those are 140 bucks I&apos;m not likely to spend.I have successfully navigated many treks to the tides without the aid of contraptions such as those bubble-wheeled carts. Only when absolutely obliged (or ordered) to do so do I lug a beach umbrella or canopy.But, I speak with a certain smugness, knowing that 199 steps from the sand is an outside shower and an air conditioned beach house.
