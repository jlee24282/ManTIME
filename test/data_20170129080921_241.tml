 What are the health benefits of purple foods?  
Purple foods’ talents go far beyond their duty of brightening up a dish – they pack a punch in the nutrients and antioxidants department too. 
 
The distinct purple colour comes from anthocyanins : an antioxidant which is medically proven to reap a vast amount of health benefits. This means that the deeper darker purple foods have a higher content of antioxidants and nutrition. 
 
According to data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), people who eat purple and blue food have a reduced risk of heart disease, diabetes and metabolic syndrome, which is a precursor for Type 2 Diabetes. Plus they have lower blood pressure and smaller waist circumferences. 
 
Studies have shown the many health benefits of purple foods, these include: 
 Helping fight cancer  
Resveratrol – a type of natural phenol – is present in purple grapes, blueberries and even red wine, and has shown promising results in studies which have helped induce cancer cell death.   
 Helping fight obesity  
Studies have shown that high levels of anthocyanins in purple foods such as purple sweet potatoes are imperative in helping control levels of leptin – otherwise dubbed the ‘Obesity hormone’.   
 Reducing damage to the liver  
Anthocyanins found in purple foods have been known to reduce damage to the liver, which can be caused by a variety of reasons.
