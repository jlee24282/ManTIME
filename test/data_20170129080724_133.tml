<content type="str">By SOMERSWORTH — Since the Spaulding Turnpike was built in the 1950s there has been a plan to create an exit for Somersworth. 
 
Regular travelers know there is an Exit 9 in Dover and an Exit 11 in Rochester, but no Exit 10. 
 
At the time the turnpike was built it was determined the exit wasn’t really needed and that mindset appears to have held fast for about 40 years. 
 
As the Tri-Cities of Somersworth, Rochester and Dover and the Route 108 corridor saw increased development there was a renewed interest in creating an Exit 10 and a companion access road. Notable efforts to build the exit occurred between 1994 and 2003. 
 
Reading through the archives of this newspaper, one finds great enthusiasm for the project rising like a king tide only to be dashed against the rocks by unattainable easements, lack of consensus and funding cuts. 
 
In 2003, Exit 10 appeared on the state’s 10-year Highway Plan (TYP) with funding in 2014, but it was later dropped from the plan as funding grew scarce during economic hard times. 
 
State Sen. David Watters, a Democrat, who represents District 4 which includes Barrington, Rollinsford, Somersworth and Dover, has fought for funding to rebuild roads and bridges and ensured the 10-Year Highway Plan supported Route 108 upgrades, Little Bay Bridges project and planning for Exit 10. 
 
Exit 10 was put back on the TYP in 2014 but without any funding and in 2015 funding for a feasibility study was secured and it is currently slated for five years from now. 
 
Regional planners agree the same reasons to support the road still exist, such as improving safety, easing traffic and reducing the environmental impact of the traffic. The key difference this time is the significant development along the Route 108 corridor and the potential for more has drawn hundreds of businesses with a vested interest. 
 
Somersworth Director of Planning and Community Development Shanna Saunders is fairly new to the job and the region. She said while she doesn’t have the history she has no trouble seeing the value Exit 10 would provide. 
 
“The city is very much in favor of it,” Saunders said. “It would be good for business retention and good for business development.” 
 
According to Saunders, the Route 108 corridor also known as the Medical Mile continues to be an important economic driver. 
 
The state&apos;s 10-year Highway Plan includes a $12 million complete streets project for the Route 108 corridor. The engineering is to begin this year and construction is slated for 2023-24. The complete streets concept looks to incorporate pedestrian and bicycle access into road projects. 
 
While the improvements would ease some of the traffic and help the corridor remain attractive, the Exit 10 access road would make getting to the turnpike much faster. 
 
Rochester Economic Development Manager Karen Pollard said the Rochester Economic Development Commission is firm in its support of Exit 10 from an economic development and community development perspective. 
 
“The development of Exit 10 makes the southern tier of Rochester more accessible from the Spaulding Turnpike and would be very beneficial to the businesses located in the Granite State Business Park,” Pollard said. “Many of these businesses like Albany International and Safran have testified to the fact that Exit 10 helps both their shipments in and out but also improves travel for their employees. 
 
Pollard said the development of Exit 10 would distribute the traffic at relevant intervals. 
 
“When the NHDOT improved exits 11 through 15, Rochester saw immediate economic impact in new private investment and commercial activity that is ongoing,” Pollard said. “Most impressive at exits 14 and 15, we have many new businesses that have located near the exits to take advantage of the new ramps and wider streets surrounding the NHDOT improvements.” 
 
In Dover, however, there has never been much support and the lack of enthusiasm still exists. Dover Economic Development Director Dan Barufaldi said the Garrison City doesn’t need another exit. 
 
“I can see the need in Rochester and Somersworth and why those communities are behind it,” Barufaldi said. “Frankly, I think Exit 9 is ripe for a lot more commercial development, so to poke another road through doesn’t make sense. We think that continuing to improve 108 would still be a better course of action and investment.” 
 
Barufaldi acknowledged traffic is heavy on Route 108 and said that is unlikely to change because there are people who will go that way to Rochester to avoid the toll and others who want to stop along the way to and from work at a coffee shop or similar business. 
 
The Strafford Regional Planning Commission (SRPC) is one of several regional planning commissions around the state that help member communities make informed decisions by providing technical studies, data analysis, collection and interpretation. 
 
Since the 2000 census, Strafford County has the fastest growing population in New Hampshire and in recent years has seen significant economic development in the Tri-City region, according to SRPC. 
 
To facilitate ongoing economic growth, while promoting a high standard of life in the region, it is essential to provide additional access to the Spaulding Turnpike in the vicinity of the Somersworth/Rochester city limits. 
 
Statistics provided by SRPC show the number of accidents along the corridor have increased by as much as 129 percent. 
 
Somersworth Mayor Dana Hilliard said Exit 10 has always been and continues to be a foundation to move Somersworth’s economic vitality forward. 
 
“This project has been studied, debated, and in some cases, promised to our community since my youth,&quot; Hilliard said. &quot;Somersworth has been overly patient about this project moving forward. The time for approval of Exit 10 is overdue. It is now time for it to become a reality.&quot;</content>
