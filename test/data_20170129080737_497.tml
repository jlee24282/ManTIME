<content type="str">DAYTON — Officials say a famous World War II aircraft will be on public display next year at the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force in Dayton after more than a decade of restoration. 
  
Museum curator Jeff Duford says the Memphis Belle, an Army Air Forces B-17F Flying Fortress bomber, will be unveiled on May 17, 2018. That date will be the 75th anniversary of the crew’s 25th mission over Europe.</content>
