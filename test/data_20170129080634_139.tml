<content type="str">Photo: A system of executive government should be looked at in Guernsey, according to a Deputy for St Peter Port South.

Deputy Dawn Tindall was speaking at a meeting on the &apos;State of Democracy&apos; in Guernsey this week. 

The comments came after a suggestion from Jersey Deputy Sam Mézec that Guernsey should go down the route of forming political parties, before moving ahead with islandwide voting. I quite like the idea of executive government. The answer that was given to me at the time [the new system of government was discussed] was that it would promote political parties, and from my perspective I don&apos;t see that as a problem. 

I think, if you have political parties, you have the ability to present policies and ideas before the election.
