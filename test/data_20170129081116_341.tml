<TEXT type="str">OK, so what say you Wise Ones over there: Since Oregon has gotten more than $60 million in revenue from taxes on pot sales do you see in our future an Oregon kicker check coming to us? 
 
— MadMax, by email 
 
We don&apos;t want to make you any madder, Max, but the kicker is not tied to increased revenue, it is tied to what the forecast is for that revenue. 
 
For anyone who may be entirely unfamiliar with the kicker, it is a refund the state of Oregon provides to taxpayers when revenues come in higher than expected. 
 
How it works is pretty simple to explain: The kicker is triggered when Oregon&apos;s tax revenues (minus corporate income taxes) exceed the forecast made at the start of the two-year budget cycle by 2 percent or more. When that happens, all the revenue above the forecast must be returned to taxpayers. There&apos;s also a corporate kicker, but the surplus generated by that kicker now goes to schools. 
 
If the revenue comes in at 1.99999 percent higher than predicted, the state gets to keep it. But if it hits 2 percent, the entire amount is refunded. Taxpayers get a refund equal to the amount exceeding the forecast, so if it&apos;s 3 percent over, individual taxpayers would get 3 percent off their next tax bill. The state formerly sent out rebate checks but said it was more efficient and less expensive to connect the payments to the next tax bill rather than sending out checks by the hundreds of thousands. 
 
But again, Max, the rebates occur only when revenues exceed the state economists&apos; prediction by at least 2 percent. So if the economists predicted a 20 percent increase in revenues — not likely, by the way — and it came in under 22 percent, the state would get to keep it. 
 
The reported $60.2 million in marijuana taxes could impact the likelihood of the kicker kicking. The refund announced in 2015 amounted to $402 million, which represented 3 percent more than what economists predicted. 
 
Critics of the kicker say that it is a faulty process, as circumstances can greatly change in the two years of the biennium, making those predictions a bit of a crapshoot. Kicker supporters say it is a way to keep state government from growing too fast and to keep more money in private hands. 
 
If there is a kicker attached to the current biennium, it would be announced following the end of the biennium, which is July 31. The announcement usually occurs in August.
