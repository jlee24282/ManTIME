<content type="str">With the exam season round the corner, Prime Minister Narendra Modi today exhorted students and their families to treat exams as a festival and not as a source of stress, saying they should &quot;smile more to score more&quot; and not take it as &quot;test of life&quot;. 
 
In his monthly &apos;Mann ki Baat&apos; broadcast, he underlined the need for students to relax by taking breaks from studies and rest properly and said that the memory&apos;s recall power is at its best when the mind is relaxed. 
 
He also asked students to chose &apos;anuspardha&apos; (competing with self) over &apos;pratispardha&apos; (competing with others) and cited the example of legendary batsman Sachin Tendulkar who kept challenging himself and bettered his records. 
 
Students, parents and teachers were the focus of Modi&apos;s 40-minute address as he noted that he found exams a source of concern for them wherever he went all these years and he always felt that they should come out of this &quot;strange psychological pressure&quot;. 
 
&quot;Examination should be a source of happiness. It should be seen as an opportunity to highlight all the hard work you have done in a year. There should be enthusiasm and zest. It is your decision to treat as a pleasure or pressure. Those who treat it as a pleasure will gain and those who treat it as pressure will repent. 
 
&quot;My view is that examination is a celebration. Take it as if it is a festival. And when there is a festival or celebration, then the best comes out of us. We feel the society&apos;s strength during celebrations. Whatever is the best comes out... Smile more to score more,&quot; he said. 
 
He gave the example of discipline seen among masses in &apos;kumbh&apos; fair even though it is generally felt that there is a lot of indiscipline among people. &quot;This is the strength of celebration.&quot; 
 
During examination, there should be a festive atmosphere among students, families and neighbours and it will convert this pressure into pleasure. 
 
He also asked people to put examination in perspective and not treat it as &quot;a question of life and death or as a test of life but merely of the study students have put in during the year&quot;. 
 
He urged students not to chase marks but gain knowledge. 
 
&quot;Only studying for marks will lead to shortcuts and one will limit himself or herself. It is important to study for knowledge. Marks and marksheetd have a limited use. Knowledge, skill, self-confidence and commitment will be of use to you during life,&quot; Modi said. 
 
He have the example of late President A P J Abdul Kalam&apos;s failure in an air force recruitment examination and said had he accepted it as a defeat, then India would not have got such a great scientist and President. 
 
He also asked students to desist from resorting to shortcuts and cheating to score more. 
 
&quot;To cheat is to be cheap. It makes you a bad person. If you form a habit of cheating, there will be no desire to learn. Trying to cheat involves one&apos;s time to find ways. Use it for better purposes. People have told you often but I am saying again -- do not cheat. Even if no one catches you, you know that you have cheated in exams,&quot; he said. (More)
