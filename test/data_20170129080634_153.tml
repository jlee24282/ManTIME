<TEXT type="str">A large number of people have staged a demonstration in the British capital to protest against the government’s policy on the National Health Service (NHS). 
 
The demonstrators marched on the parliament in London on Saturday with placards reading, “Hands off our NHS.” 
 
The protesters chanted slogans like “No ifs no buts, no NHS cuts” outside the parliament building. 
 
One group of demonstrators was carrying a fake coffin depicting the NHS logo, and others held up banners or placards stating their cause. 
 
The protesters are worried about plans by the government of Prime Minister Theresa May to fragment the NHS “in order to sell it off.” 
 
They demanded that the government rethink its NHS privatization plans amid growing waiting times and slashed resources.   
 
Organizers said the rally should serve as a notice to the government that the National Health Service is still a priority matter for the British public.
