<TITLE>Strategic Plan Can Aid Development City Administrator Tells Commission</TITLE>
<TEXT>City Administrator Steve Roth says the proposed comprehensive plan can influence retail development in the city. 
   
Throughout the process it was pretty clear that people want to see more commercial (retail) development, he said. The comprehensive plan can influence developers. 
   
Roth made the comments Tuesday, Jan. 24, at a special planning and zoning commission meeting to complete a final edit of the proposed comprehensive plan. He identified elements of the plan that he said could positively impact future retail development. 
   
Creating a mixed-use zoning district where both commercial and residential uses could be applied to one parcel would signal that the city is seeking retail development, he said. 
   
Roth pointed to the vacant property at the junction of Lamar Parkway and Old Gray Summit as a candidate for mixed-use zoning. 
   
The property is now zoned residential, but Roth said the commission can designate future land use and identify the area as right for commercial development. 
   
It would still be zoned residential, but developers would see (on the future land use map) that the city wants commercial there, Roth said. 
   
Commission member Linda Bruns pointed out that a developer had previously proposed constructing a mixed-use development with retail at the front and residences at the back on a nearby parcel, but neighbors opposed it. 
   
This room was full of people who didnt want retail there, she said. 
   
Roth said he thought the desire for more retail development might influence residences on future commercial ventures at that location. 
   
Alderman Nick Chlebowski, who has been editing the plan, said there are other areas in the city where mixed-use zoning districts might be attractive to developers. 
   
Mixed-use was originally put forth as a zoning tool to lure developers to the old downtown section, where mixed-use already exists in storefronts that have businesses on the ground floor and residences on the second floor. 
   
Chlebowski displayed a future land use map, which identified different areas of the city with different colors. He said he would not consider the area south of the tracks to be part of the downtown area. 
   
Chlebowski said the property south of Orleans Street between South First Street and the Meramec River could be designated a mixed-use district. 
   
Although the property is zoned residential, he said it would be a good candidate for mixed-use zoning with parks as one of the approved elements in mixed-use districts. 
   
Seeing the area, which is prone to flooding, designated as a future park would help with Alderman Steve Myers plan to create a Meramec River Access and establish Pacific as a trailhead. 
   
Bruns said she likes the idea, which reminded her of the Downtown Washington riverfront, where a hiking/biking trail allows public access. 
   
The area now contains a mix of residences and vacant lots that were impacted by floods in 2008 and 2015. 
   
P&Z members reviewed the final two sections of the proposed comprehensive plan at the meeting and said they are very close to bringing the completed version to a vote for adoption. 
   
Roth said its extremely important for the future development of the city for staff and P&Z to have a comprehensive plan as a tool to aid in development review. 
   
Were seeing a lot of activity of people who want to locate here, he said. We expect to be very busy for the immediate future. We need to get the plan approved.</TEXT>
