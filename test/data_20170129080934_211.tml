<TITLE>ZUCK: The president is teaching us how not to lead</TITLE>
<TEXT>I'm still trying to get used to the idea that the person who occupies our White House is not what I'd consider presidential material. He's a bully, he bragged about sexual assault, he mocked a person's disability, and he suggested closing America's borders to people because of their religion, among other things.

I have two young children who will someday learn about American history and about our government; they will eventually learn about and perhaps look up to the president of the United States. But I wouldn't want them emulating this particular man. What a shame, I think, that our current president is not, in my opinion, a positive role model for our youth.

And yet, there must be something positive we can take from these circumstances.

It reminds me of my first internship when I was going to graduate school to become a social worker. The director of the mental health center where I interned wasn't the most effective leader. He was a nice guy and a great clinician, but he'd been thrust into this administrative role that he wasn't well-suited for.

Staff meetings never started on time and were generally disorganized. Disagreements between colleagues sometimes went unaddressed and grew into bigger problems. I saw how proper doses of leadership here and there - in the form of making decisions, settling disputes and keeping our meetings punctual - could have made the agency operate more efficiently. By watching our director's example, I gained insight about how not to lead an organization.

And so it is with our current president; we can watch his example and learn what not to do. Should one of my children ask me why he personally insults and belittles his critics or why he traffics in half-truths and lies, I'll talk to them about what we can glean from observing his style of leadership.

Just because someone occupies a position of power, I'll tell them, doesn't mean everything they say is true. It's good to maintain a healthy sense of skepticism about one's leaders - and important to get your news and facts from reliable sources.

I'll talk to my children about the importance of standing up for what you believe is right, moral and just - especially when your leader doesn't agree with you.

What does success look like, I'll ask them, and how should one go about achieving it? Is it OK to amass wealth if you've done it by cheating others along the way?

I would tell my children to pay closer attention to what a person does rather than what they say. The best predictor of a person's future behavior is their past behavior.

The measure of a person - and of a nation, really - is how they treat those who are less fortunate. And whether you agree or disagree with your elected official's conduct, the value and importance of your vote is tremendous. These are just some of the lessons we might learn by watching our current president.

Up until now I cringed at the idea that my children might one day spot this president on television and see for themselves that such a self-centered, arrogant man has been elected as our country's leader. But now I realize that it can be a valuable learning experience - about everything from leadership to morality to the democratic process.
