<TEXT type="str">Republican leader in Israel is confident US embassy will eventually be moved to Jerusalem despite delays 
 
Israeli officials are delaying the implementation of president Donald Trump&apos;s controversial campaign promise to move the US embassy from its current location in Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, according to a report by the Ha&apos;aretz daily on Saturday. 
 
Co-chair of the Republicans Overseas organization in Israel, Marc Zell, 
told the newspaper that &quot;Trump has been unequivocally in favor of moving the embassy and remains so&quot; but &quot;is proceeding cautiously because of concerns raised by Israeli officials.&quot; 
 
Zell cited unnamed sources from both the US and Israel as indicating that what appeared to be waning momentum on the part of the Trump administration to make good on their promise was happening at Israel&apos;s request. 
 

 
Zell told Ha&apos;aretz that he was nonetheless confident that the embassy move would happen. 
 
&quot;Trump has repeatedly stated that his Administration will respect the wishes of the Israeli government and people on issues concerning the Land of Israel in general and Jerusalem in particular,&quot; Zell said. 
 
Zell&apos;s comments to the paper came after he took to Twitter to slam the Israeli government&apos;s lack of &quot;backbone&quot; to push forward with the embassy&apos;s relocation.

Various versions of statements pointing a reversal on Trump&apos;s promise caused a stir in the media last week, after White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said that the administration is &quot;at the very beginning stages of even discussing&quot; the subject, suggesting that the move would not be immediate. 
 
In a press conference the following day, Spicer was asked again about the embassy, to which he replied, &quot;I don&apos;t want to get ahead- if it was already a decision then we wouldn&apos;t be going through this process.&quot; 
 

 
Palestinian sources reported that the Trump administration has indicated to the Palestinians that the process of moving the US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem is not a priority and that he will instead focus his attention in the region on reviving the peace process. 
 
&quot;We have assurances from the US administration that the embassy [in Tel Aviv] is not going anywhere,&quot; for the time being Dr Ahmed Majdalani, a senior member of the PLO Executive Committee told i24NEWS on Wednesday. 
 
&quot;Trump&apos;s promise to move the embassy was nothing more than a campaign slogan, but now reality is different,&quot; Majdalani said. &quot;He realizes now that there will be consequences of moving the embassy.&quot; 
 

 
However, another senior Palestinian official who asked not to be named contradicted this statement, telling i24NEWS that &quot;no one really knows what is going on.&quot; 
 
The intention to move the embassy has been welcomed by Israel, but slammed by the Palestinians and many other countries and international organizations as a move that could sink the peace process. 
 
The status of Jerusalem is a flashpoint issue in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state, while Israel has declared the entire city as its capital. Most countries have their embassies located in Tel Aviv.
