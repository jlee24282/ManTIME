<content type="str">DUBAI Jan 29 (Reuters) - Most Gulf stock markets moved
little in early trade on Sunday, although Kuwait continued this
month&apos;s bull run in heavy trade. 
    
The Kuwaiti index added 1.1 percent to a fresh
26-month high with eight of the 10 most heavily traded stocks
rising and none falling. 
    
On Monday, the government plans to announce details of its
long-term economic development plan, which could help the stock
market if it gives more impetus to big infrastructure projects. 
    
Telecommunications firm Viva Kuwait fell 3.3
percent, however, after reporting a 6.8 percent rise in
fourth-quarter net profit to 10.8 million dinars ($35.4
million); SICO Bahrain had forecast 9.44 million dinars. 
    
Saudi Arabia&apos;s index edged down 0.1 percent. Builder
Khodari climbed 2.2 percent, but National Commercial
Bank dropped 1.4 percent despite proposing a higher
second-half dividend. 
    
Nama Chemicals jumped its 10 percent daily limit
for a second straight day after announcing the main elements of
a plan to recover from accumulated losses that exceeded 75
percent of its capital. The plan includes eventually increasing
capital to finance production of speciality chemical products
and boost capacity, and the sale of assets of an investment
affiliate. 
    
Dubai&apos;s index slipped 0.2 percent as GFH Financial
, the most heavily trade stock, pulled back 5.9 percent.
The stock, a speculative favourite of local investors, has been
very volatile in the past week. 
    
In Abu Dhabi another speculative stock, International Fish
Farming, plunged its 10 percent daily limit to 2.92
dirhams. It soared from 1.90 dirhams at the end of last month to
a peak of 4.65 dirhams, partly because of a rumour that a
well-known Abu Dhabi individual investor had bought a strategic
stake in the company. 
    
But in mid-January, an Asmak spokesman told Reuters that the
rumour was false, and the stock has been falling back since
then. Abu Dhabi&apos;s equities index fell 0.2 percent in
early trade on Sunday. 
    
Qatar&apos;s index dropped 0.3 percent but Widam Food
 gained 2.1 percent after saying annual net profit rose
to 91.3 million riyals ($25.1 million) from 69.1 million riyals.
