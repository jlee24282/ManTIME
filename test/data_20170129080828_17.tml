<TITLE>Henry Abram 'H.A.' Ratzlaff</TITLE>
<TEXT>LIMON, Colo. - Henry Abram "H.A." Ratzlaff, 80, passed away Jan. 20, 2017, at his home. H.A. was born Sept. 25, 1936, in Ford County, at the family home, the second of five children to Esther (Isaac) and Elias Ratzlaff.

He grew up on the homestead farm until a tornado took the home in April of 1947. After the tornado the family moved to Minneola, where H.A. grew up and graduated from high school in 1955. H.A. was an athletic man who enjoyed playing football, track, and basketball. He attended college on a football scholarship in Ottawa for one year and then attended the Community College of Dodge City.

H.A. met Kathleen (Copeland) in their senior year of high school on a blind date and they quickly fell in love and were married Aug. 29, 1955 at the Community Church in Minneola. They moved to Dodge City, where they settled down and started their family of three children which he adored, David (1957), Doug (1959), and Teresa (1967). Also during this time his love for cars became a passion for racing. He especially loved racing his super modified cars and held the track record for 20 plus years. H.A.'s ability of working with his hands led him into the construction industry where he strapped on his tool belt, his trademark bandana and started his own general contracting business in Dodge City. A new opportunity presented itself in 1977 for H.A. and Kathy to purchase Vermillion's Building Center in Limon, Colorado. In addition to the lumberyard, H.A. assembled his crew and began mentoring and building his own construction company in Limon. H.A.'s passions included a love of sports, racing, hunting and fishing. He was also active in his community church and youth groups. H.A. is described by many as a man who loved the Lord, had a passion for his trade, and a zest for life. He loved his family and absolutely adored his grandchildren and great grandchildren. His charismatic personality, tool belt, bandana, encouraging words, and kind heart will be greatly missed by many.

H.A. was preceded in death by his parents, Eli and Esther Ratzlaff; brother-in-law, Tom Randle; and niece, Vickie Harris. He is survived by wife, Kathy of Limon, Colo.; sons, David Ratzlaff of Pierce City, Mo., and Doug (JoAnn) of Limon, Colo.; daughter, Teresa Becker (Richard) of Hugo, Colo.; sisters, Arlene Randle of Dodge City, Vivian Luce of Great Bend, and Katherine McCalla (Jerry) of Emporia; brother, Don Ratzlaff (Harriet) of Olathe; grandchildren, Jennifer Nestor (Zane) of Limon, Colo., Jason Ratzlaff of Wichita, Melinda Holforty (Travis) of Windsor, Colo., Mandy Ratzlaff of Wichita, Justin Ratzlaff of Hugo, Colo.; and great-grandchildren, Emilee and Landon Nestor of Limon, Colo., Emma and Logan Holforty of Windsor, Colo., Jude Ratzlaff of Wichita; as well as many other nieces, nephews, family and friends that he loved dearly.
