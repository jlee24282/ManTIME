<content type="str">MURPHYSBORO â€“ Work continues to transform a former youth detention center in southern Illinois into a facility for prisoners about to re-enter the community. 
   
There is no firm timeline on when the former Illinois Youth Center in Murphysboro will reopen as the Life Skills and Re-entry Center, The Southern Illinoisan reported . It has been estimated that it will cost about $800,000 to repurpose the center. 
 
Department of Corrections spokeswoman Nicole Wilson said the department is committed to reducing the prison population and giving offenders tools that will help them become successful before they are released from custody. 
 
&quot;We are working diligently to create staffing plans and develop criteria and curriculum for the offenders who will be eligible to participate in the Life Skills Re-entry Center, located at the former IYC Murphysboro,&quot; Wilson said. 
 
Murphysboro Mayor Will Stephens said about a month ago he was told by the governor that the facility could open anytime from March to July. 
 
The facility is being created to provide training, education and support people who are near the end of their sentences as part of the governor&apos;s focus on prison reform in the state. 
 
&quot;I&apos;m happy that it&apos;s on the way,&quot; Stephens said. &quot;I know that a watched pot never boils.&quot;
