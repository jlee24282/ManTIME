<TITLE>Bettany Hughes: 'I worked by candlelight to avoid paying the bills'</TITLE>
<TEXT>Historian, television presenter and author Dr Bettany Hughes has been working in broadcast media since the late Nineties. She (Munich: SOQ.MU - news ) has written and presented more than 50 television and radio documentaries for several channels. 
 
Last year she presented Genius of the Modern World for BBC Four. She has written two best selling books, Helen of Troy: Goddess, Princess, Whore and The Hemlock Cup: Socrates, Athens and the Search of the Good Life. Ms Hughes, 49, lives in west London, with her husband Adrian and two daughters. 
 
How did your childhood influence your work ethic and attitude towards money? 
 
Both my parents were professional actors, so I grew up in a household that had no real financial stability. 
 
It was drilled into me from an early age that nothing is certain and that you have to be incredibly careful and sensible with money. However, if you are lucky enough to have a little bit spare, you should also try to enjoy it. 
 
It didnt matter that we didnt have foreign holidays or smart clothes; it was a happy childhood. I cleaned cars to earn pocket money and worked in the Body Shop on a Saturday (Shenzhen: 002291.SZ - news ) . My brother wrote articles for the local newspaper from a young age. Both of us wanted to be self-supporting as soon as we could be. 
 
Has there been a time in your life when you havent known how to pay the bills? 
 
There hasnt. I have never ever lived beyond my means. At university in Oxford, where I read Ancient and Modern History, I shared a house with four other girls. 
 
We worked by candlelight and avoided putting the heating on until it was totally necessary so we could afford the bills. 
 
I also never went to the pub as I just thought that was going to be too expensive and shopped for clothes in charity shops. 
 
I always wanted to be a historian. When I was at Oxford, friends were going for jobs as well-paid lawyers or consultants, but those paths never appealed. Being fulfilled by doing a job that I loved was always a priority. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 John Rutter: 'Money's like petrol. You only notice when the tank is empty'  Sir John Madejski: 'My fortune has been decimated. I lost hundreds of millions'  Richard Whitmore: 'I made 600k on my home. You can't lose with property'  
Do you remember your first pay packet? 
 
After I graduated, I carried on with my academic work, via grants but I often had a market stall on Camden Market selling hand-painted silk to make some cash. 
 
I would possibly make 35 a day in the Eighties and Nineties. It seemed quite a lot back then. 
 
My first salaried position was in 1992 as director of arts at the Riverside Studios. I think I got about 16,000 a year, but I left after a year. 
 
What has been the best-paid part of your career so far? 
 
That was probably before the big financial crash, around 2004 and 2005, when I had a two-book deal and I was making two big television series a year. 
 
What was your most lucrative work? 
 
The occasional motivational speech gig tends to pay better than the books and television. 
 
Some of the broadcast work I do isnt very highly paid at all. For some radio and podcast jobs, taking in the preparation time the daily rate can be as low as between 25-75 a day. 
 
Books are a slow burner. My latest book, Istanbul, took 10 years to write. Television does pay better. I have turned down a number of celebrity appearances on shows. I would much rather spend time doing work I love or be with my family. 
 
What was your best buy? 
 
The house, which we purchased in London about 20 years ago for around 200,000. It is worth a great deal more now. We chose it in order to live close to my parents, who helped me a great deal with childcare when my daughters were young. 
 
What has been your worst business decision? 
 
I dont want to sound self-congratulatory but I dont think I have made a worst business decision yet. 
 
After writing my book on Socrates, who wasnt paid for sharing his philosophy with the world, I feel I have his ghost hovering over my shoulders. I get asked on average to do 100 jobs for free a year, some of which I take on  I feel these are cultivating my soul, if not my bank balance. 
 
Are you more of a saver or a spender? 
 
I am definitely a saver. My daughters are my priority as we are helping them get through university. 
 
But I do like to splurge in a charity shop. I think I have a suppressed spender in me! 
 
If I have any spare cash, I occasionally go to a little shop near the British Museum and buy an antiquity for less than 100. I dont have many, though. I have never been interested in having an extravagant lifestyle.

Are you naturally good with money or do you have to work at it? 
 
I would say I was quite good as I have been freelance most of my working life and Im still solvent. 
 
I dont move my money to take advantage of better interest rates  if there were more hours in the day, I would. 
 
Whats the most difficult lesson youve learnt about money? 
 
I dont think I have had one. As my father had an agent, I got one pretty early on in my career. 
 
I only take on work that I like to do. I just ask myself: Is this work worthwhile? 
 
Do you prefer to pay by debit, credit or cash? 
 
Cash  I usually carry about 40 on me, plus various denominations of foreign currency from my travels. 
 
I bank with Lloyds and use a debit card otherwise. Ive never owned a credit card. I have never wanted to be in debt. So far, Ive survived without one but I am considering one for overseas travel emergencies. 
 
What are your financial priorities for the next five to 10 years? 
 
My work life is about to change as I have co-founded a new ethical production company with a very financially astute person. Ninety-nine per cent of the radio and television series Ive worked on have been my own ideas. 
 
We are in production on a number of international documentaries. The company has a commitment to produce the best work, by the best people, for the best reasons. It is going to be a very exciting and, hopefully, profitable venture. My role is creative director. 
 
Ive another couple of non-fiction books lined up with a publishing deal, too. 
 
Are you a good tipper? 
 
Yes, about 15pc in taxis. I would happily withhold a tip for bad service, though. 
 
If there was one thing you could change about the financial world, what would that be? 
 
I think everyone who is involved in the financial world needs to ask themselves a small quiet question in the morning: Is what I am doing going to be for the greater good?  
 
Socrates, Confucius and Buddha all shared the same philosophical ideas  that wealth in itself is not problematic, but it is if we acquire this at the expense of wisdom and virtue. I think if we followed this philosophy, we would have a robust exciting financial structure to modern society but also one is that is less abusive. 
 
Do you give regularly to charity? 
 
Yes, Im involved in Kids in Museums; Classics for All; Iris, an educational charity; the National Churches Trust and the Churchs Conservation Trust. Plus I happily spend in charity shops, and give regularly to Shelter. 
 
Does money make you happy, in your opinion? 
 
Money doesnt make you happy; anxiety about not having enough money, however, does make you unhappy.</TEXT>
