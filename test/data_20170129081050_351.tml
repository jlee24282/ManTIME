<TITLE>Restaurant For Sale: Only $125 and 200 Words</TITLE>
<TEXT>In less than 4 months restaurant owners, Dawn and David Bain, are handing over the keys to their 2,000 square-foot restaurant and everything in it to 1 lucky winner of their essay contest. 23 years ago, a close friend invested in their family and their future. After moving to Sierra Vista with their 2 kids, they built an award-winning restaurant with the help of that investment. So, when the thought of retirement came up, they made the daring decision to pay it forward. 

With only a $125 entrance fee and a 200 word essay on "Why I want to operate my own restaurant," the winner and new owner has a chance to change their life forever.
