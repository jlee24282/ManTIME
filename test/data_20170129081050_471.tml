THE 28-year-old call center agent and registered criminologist, who was killed during an anti-illegal drugs operation last January 19, was buried Sunday afternoon, January 29. 
 
Niño Rodel Taboada was killed in Barangay Duljo-Fatima after he allegedly attempted to shoot agents from the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA)-Central Visayas during a drug raid which prompted the authorities to shoot first. 
 
Authorities said Taboada is a suspected drug pusher and drug den maintainer. However, his relatives said the PDEA-Central Visayas operatives mistook the victim as a drug pusher. 
 
Taboada&apos;s family has formally filed a complaint before the Commission on Human Rights (CHR)-Central Visayas last Janaruy 20. 
 
Taboada’s case is the third extrajudicial killing incident allegedly attributed to PDEA-Central Visayas since President Rodrigo Duterte came into office last year. (SunStar Philippines)
