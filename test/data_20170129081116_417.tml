<TEXT type="str">HIRAM — Katherine Ann Kothera, 95, of Hiram, passed away Friday, Jan. 20, 2017, surrounded by her loving family. 
 
She was born Feb. 25, 1921, in Cleveland, to Joseph and Catherine Greicar Skiba. She spent most of her adult life living in Hiram. 
 
She graduated from John Marshall High School in Cleveland in 1939, and after graduation, she was a nurse’s aide for several years in the Cleveland area during the World War II era. 
 
Katherine was a member of St. Ambrose Catholic Church in Garrettsville. 
 
Katherine loved to sew and one year made all the cheerleading uniforms at both Crestwood and James A. Garfield high schools. All of her grandchildren were able to wear the nicest flannel shirts. Her sewing ability was so good that her children would sometimes wear the best and most fashionable clothes in the area. She spent much time at Crafty Ann’s in Garrettsville, doing things like painting and needlepoint work. She made many Christmas ornaments and other craft items for her children and grandchildren. She had the ability to take old, used items such as milk cans and broken pieces of roof slate and turn them into beautiful decorations for family homes. 
 
Katherine also enjoyed playing golf with her friends. She never missed any of her children’s or grandchildren’s sporting events. She devoted her life to being a loving mom and grandma. Family was her life! 
 
Preceding her in passing was her husband, William Kothera, to whom she was married for 65 years. 
 
Katherine is survived by her sons, Lee (Sandy) of Hiram and Clark (Sharyn) of Charlotte; daughters, Kris (Mitch) Collins of Newton Falls and Cathy Morehouse of Texas; grandchildren, Pam, Greg, Kim, Cody, Connie, Curt, Carla, Kelliann, Kassi, Kortni, Kirsti, Katie and Steve; and great-grandchildren, Lindsay, Luke, Stephanie, Nikki, Justin, Cameron, Maggie, Laney, Ella, Clara, Kayla, Carson, Sophia, Damien and Mason.
