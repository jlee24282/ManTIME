<TEXT type="str">Ambitious plans to bring a new Italian restaurant and Travelodge to a dilapidated building - and create nearly 50 jobs - has received almost unanimous approval from residents in Gainsborough.

The blueprint is for a 56-room hotel at the former Sun Inn building on the corner of Market Street and North Street in Gainsborough along with a Ponti&apos;s Italian Kitchen on the ground floor, forming part of a planned revamp of the town centre.

If allowed, the move will see 25 jobs up for grabs at the hotel site and 20 more at the restaurant. The family-owned Ponti&apos;s has restaurants in London and at Fox Valley in north Sheffield and the new Gainsborough restaurant will be the team&apos;s first venture in Lincolnshire and the East Midlands.

Ponti&apos;s boasts traditional ingredients in its cooking and set menus start from £16. It offers pizza, pasta as well as meat and fish dishes.

Developers Dransfield Properties held a public feedback event in the town and say the vast majority of people attending were behind the proposals.

&quot;We had an extremely positive response to the plans. Looking at the feedback forms 96% were in favour of the development plans,&quot; said Amanda Holmes, communications director at Dransfield Properties.

&quot;We had 95 forms filled in and 91 indicated they were in favour of the plans. We estimate we had 150-170 people visit the consultation throughout the session which took place on Tuesday this week.

&quot;We are delighted with the response we have received to the plans for the former Sun Inn site and the further improvements in this part of the town centre and would like to thank everyone who took the time to come to the public consultation event.

&quot;We had some lovely feedback about the design and look of the building, there is clearly a great deal of support in the town for a hotel in Gainsborough and of course to see investment on this key site in the town centre.&quot;

The company, which was behind the nearby Marshall&apos;s Yard development, is in partnership with West Lindsey Council and the first phase will be to deliver the new Travelodge and a Ponti&apos;s Italian Kitchen restaurant.

A wider regeneration scheme will also include:

The hotel and restaurant will support local businesses and create a huge boost for the town centre economy, particularly to the early evening trade, the company says.

Travelodge has more than 500 hotels across the UK as well as in Ireland and Spain and a recent £100m modernisation programme has just seen it upgrade more than 30,000 rooms across its estate with a new contemporary look and feel which will be reflected in the new Gainsborough hotel.

The Ponti&apos;s Italian Kitchen restaurant will be on the ground floor with entrances from Market Street and the Roseway Car Park.

The plans for the redevelopment of the run down former Sun Inn site have already been widely supported by the business community in Gainsborough and answer the need for a good quality hotel in Gainsborough, Dransfield Properties said.

Mark Dransfield, the firm&apos;s managing director, said: &quot;With these plans we wanted to look at the whole area and see what could be done to improve Market Street, we are delighted to be working with West Lindsey District Council on improving the public realm and shop fronts in the area.

&quot;This is an important site in the town and that is certainly reflected in the quality of design and architecture – we want to deliver a high quality building which is sympathetic with the area and using high quality materials which will stand the test of time.&quot;

The company has applied for a £1.4 million grant to deliver the new hotel development. The plans will be submitted to West Lindsey District Council&apos;s planning department following the public consultation event.</TEXT>
