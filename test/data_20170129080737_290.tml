<TEXT type="str">As someone who loves tennis unconditionally, it doesn&apos;t bother me that no American man has demanded our attention since Andy Roddick retired at the US Open in 2012. 
 
I simply want to see greatness, and Roger Federer (Switzerland), Rafael Nadal (Spain), Novak Djokovic (Serbia) and Andy Murray (United Kingdom) have carried men&apos;s tennis exceptionally well for the last decade-plus. 
 
However, for the casual tennis fan in America, they want to see Americans at the top of the game. Our country was spoiled for decades with Jimmy Connors, John McEnroe, Jim Courier, Andre Agassi and Pete Sampras displaying the superiority of the United States. 
 
In women&apos;s tennis, it&apos;s not a problem. The American Williams sisters — especially Serena — have dominated the sport for the last 18 years. Fittingly, Serena and Venus squared off yesterday for the first grand slam title of 2017 at the Australian Open. 
 
But everyone loves rivalries. Whether it&apos;s Ohio State-Michigan in college football, Duke-North Carolina in college basketball or Muhammad Ali-Joe Frazier in boxing. 
 
It&apos;s why today&apos;s match with Federer and Nadal for the Australian Open title is so fantastic. 
 
The undisputed best rivalry in men&apos;s tennis in the last dozen years is Federer-Nadal. The two all-time greats have combined for 31 grand slam titles — 17 for Federer (the all-time record) and 14 for Nadal, the King of Clay. 
 
The scintillating battles between the two have produced legendary matches, most notably when they battled nearly five hours — and through two rain delays — for the Wimbledon title in 2008. Nadal won that match 6-4, 6-4, 6-7 (5-7), 6-7 (8-10), 9-7. 
 
It&apos;s easy to forget the death-grip Federer and Nadal had on the sport a few years ago. From July 2005 to August 2009, they held the top two spots in the world rankings. From Wimbledon 2003 to the French Open in 2011, the duo combined to win 26 of 32 grand slam titles. 
 
It may seem like a one-sided rivalry when you consider Nadal has a 23-11 record against the Swiss superstar, including a 9-2 mark in grand slam tournaments (6-2 in finals, 3-0 in semifinals). 
 
While those numbers can&apos;t be denied, many of Nadal&apos;s wins came on clay (5-0 record at the French Open), a surface where he asserted his dominance to such a degree that he became the greatest clay court player in history. 
 
But the matches were almost always heavyweight prize fights, with both players throwing and landing big punches throughout. The battles captivated tennis fans across the globe and even casual fans. 
 
Part of the allure of this rivalry is the stark juxtaposition of the two men. 
 
Federer is the elegant, graceful master who makes everything look easy while maintaining his GQ style. He&apos;s the James Bond of tennis, casually blasting a one-handed backhand down the line like he&apos;s ordering a shaken-not-stirred martini. 
 
Nadal is the lefty dirt-baller who played the first half of his career in sleeveless T-shirts and capri pants. He&apos;s anti-elegance. He runs down shots as if his life depended on it. He loudly grunts as he muscles the ball over the net with his ferocious top-spin forehand. 
 
Over time, the aura of invincibility slipped from both players — Nadal due to knee injuries and Federer to age. Djokovic took over as the greatest player on the planet in 2011 and has held that title ever since, although he fell to No. 2 in the world last November, ceding the throne to Murray. 
 
Incredibly, it&apos;s been almost six years since Federer and Nadal have played in a major final. That was the 2011 French Open, which Nadal won in four sets. 
 
Today&apos;s final — yes, it began at 1:30 a.m. Arizona time — finally brings back a historic rivalry. In truth, it&apos;s likely the last time we will ever see Federer, 35, and Nadal, 30, play one another in a grand slam final. 
 
Other terrific rivalries will emerge once these two legends fade away, but we may never see another rivalry as great as theirs. It&apos;s the Rocky Balboa-Apollo Creed of our time. 
 
Ring the bell, because the heavyweight fight has resumed.</TEXT>
