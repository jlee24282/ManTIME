<TEXT type="str">French street artist Invader returns with his irreverent brand of mosaic graffiti with the opening of his new exhibition, &quot;Hello, My Name Is...&quot; at Le Musée en Herbe in Paris. Invader was inspired by a manifesto written by a group of MIT hackers in the early days of video game history called  The Theory of Computer Toys , which laid out three ground rules for video games: they should push the computer to its limits; each play should be different; and the game should be interactive. 
 
As a result, Invader created different artworks that reference milestone games such as  Pong,   Breakout which was the first game created by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak,  Pac-Man and  Tetris . The exhibition also includes a replica of Invader&apos;s studio, the Mothership. The show will run until September 3.
