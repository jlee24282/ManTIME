Elton John To Write Music For 'The Devil Wears Prada' On Broadway was a Top 3 story on Friday: (Radio.com) Elton John will write music for a new The Devil Wears Prada musical. The Rock and Roll Hall of Famer will lend his talents to a new musical production of Lauren Weisberger's 2003 novel. 
 
The book has also been adapted into a movie which starred Meryl Streep and Anne Hathaway. "Re-imagining The Devil Wears Prada for the musical theater is super exciting," Elton tells Deadline. 
 
"I'm a huge fan of both the book and the feature film, and a huge aficionado of the fashion world. I can't wait to sink my musical teeth into this hunk of popular culture." Read more - here.
