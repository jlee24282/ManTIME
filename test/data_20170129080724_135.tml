Eliminating the criminal defamation law 
 
House Bill 278, &quot;repealing criminal defamation,&quot; would have repealed the state law that provides for criminal defamation court action. That statute reads, &quot;644:11. Breaches of the Peace and Related Offenses: A person is guilty of a class B misdemeanor if he purposely communicates to any person, orally or in writing, any information which he knows to be false and knows will tend to expose any other living person to public hatred, contempt or ridicule. As used in this section &apos;pubic&apos; includes any professional or social group of which the victim of the defamation is a member.&quot; 
 
The House Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee held a public hearing and then voted 14 to 6 recommending the bill be killed. The majority reported, &quot;This bill would eliminate the misdemeanor crime of defamation. The sponsor argued that those who are defamed are adequately served by civil law. The majority of the committee believes that the state may, under certain, albeit infrequent, circumstances, have an interest in prosecuting criminal defamation. Repealing the statute was deemed by most to be unnecessary.&quot; 
 
The minority of the committee wrote, &quot;The minority of the committee feels this bill is a housekeeping measure. The testimony from the state was that 644:11 is almost never used, as it is too hard to prove in a court of law. If a person is defamed they could sue the person who defamed them in court, which is easier to prove.&quot; 
 
The House voted 262 to 92 in favor of killing the legislation. &quot;Yes&quot; is a vote in favor of killing the bill, &quot;no&quot; opposed killing the bill:

Marriage officiant licenses 
 
HB 206, &quot;establishing a special marriage officiant license,&quot; is sponsored by Reps. Cushing, Lovejoy and McBeath. The bill would have established a marriage license that would temporarily authorize an individual to solemnize a marriage. A person could apply to the N.H. secretary of state, pay a fee, and be authorized to perform only a civil marriage specifically designated on the registration form. Most of the fee would be deposited in an already existing state fund for domestic violence programs.  
 
The Office of Secretary of State estimated 300 special licenses would be issued per year, resulting in $24,000 in revenue for funding domestic violence programs. 
 
The House Judiciary Committee voted ​13 to 5 to recommending that the bill be defeated. Reporting for the committee recommendation, Rep. Wuelper wrote, &quot; This bill seeks to allow a new state license authorizing any individual to perform a single specified marriage for a fee of $90, with $80 of that going into the victim’s assistance fund. The committee felt that charging over three times the amount called for judges or justices of the peace to perform the ceremony was excessive. Testimony indicated that town/city clerks might have serious problems certifying the completion of marriages if people from other states or countries failed to complete and return the paperwork.&quot; 
 
The House voted 204 to 158 to kill the bill. &quot;Yes&quot; supported the motion to kill it, &quot;no&quot; opposed that motion:

Public hearing process - citizens vs. lobbyists 
 
House Rule 100 provides for duties of committees and committee procedure. Included are rules of process authorizing meeting notice requirements, quorums, and the methods of making and voting on motions of recommendation on individual bills heard at public hearings. 
 
Rep. Timothy Smith, D-Manchester, offered a change to the rule that would encourage committees to allow citizens to speak before paid lobbyists at public hearings. The rule he wrote was &quot;to ensure on a best-effort basis that members of the public are recognized to testify at public hearings before individuals properly identified as lobbyists.&quot; 
 
He pointed out that because of busy schedules, time may run out at public hearings before everyone wishing to speak can do so, and those not recognized to testify early may not be heard at all. Citizens who take a day off work to testify may not be heard. But a long-time committee chair opposed the new rule, saying the rule change could limit the committee from asking lobbyists to speak who may have important information to share. 
 
Before the vote on the suggested new rule change, two legislators, one for passage and one against, were allowed to ask &quot;parliamentary questions,&quot; suggesting how legislators should vote. Those questions, a tradition in the legislature, often best sum up the issue just before a vote is taken. Those asking the question thereby recommend pressing the &quot;Green&quot; button on each legislator&apos;s&apos; seat, which electronically is a vote for a motion, or the &quot;Red&quot; button, which casts a vote against the motion.  
 
Rep. Frost, supporting the rule change, asked &quot;If I know that this is the &apos;peoples&apos; house&apos; and not the &apos;lobbyists&apos; house&apos; would I now push the green button?&quot;  
 
Rep. Richard Hinch, R-Merrimack, asked, &quot;Mr. Speaker, if I have the utmost confidence in our leadership and our chairs and vice chairs regardless of political party over the years to have conducted the meetings in an orderly fashion, and if I believe also that the chairs are always cognizant of the rights of the public to speak and want to make sure that we want to hear from the public, do I now push the red button because this amendment is not necessary?&quot;  
 
The House voted 121 to 242 against the new rule. &quot;Yes&quot; favored the rule change, &quot;no&quot; opposed:
