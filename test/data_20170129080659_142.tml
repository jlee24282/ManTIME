DENVER — The new leader of the House Republicans isn’t earning a lot of friends on the Western Slope. 
 
That’s because many people are upset that House Minority Leader Patrick Neville, R-Castle Rock, didn’t appoint his caucus’ newest member, Rep. Marc Catlin, R-Montrose, to the House Agriculture, Livestock &amp; Natural Resources Committee. 
 
They considered it a no-brainer that Catlin would gain such an appointment. He is an undisputed expert in water issues, particularly on the Western Slope, 
 
“It’s just ridiculous,” said Christian Reece, executive director of Club 20, a Western Slope advocacy group. “The committee and the House as a whole would benefit greatly if they used his skills. One would think that appointments would be based on a legislator’s skill set. With attempts to implement the statewide water plan this year, it’s important to have a strong voice from the Western Slope on such a committee.” 
 
Instead of being appointed to the ag panel and the House Transportation Committee — as his predecessor, now Sen. Don Coram, R-Montrose, was — Catlin was assigned to the House Public Health Care &amp; Human Services Committee and House Finance Committee. 
 
Catlin has no health care, social service or financial background. Instead, he is an acclaimed expert on water issues. 
 
His job outside of public service is as water rights development coordinator for Montrose County. He also is a former manager of the Uncompahgre Valley Water Users’ Association and a longtime member of the Colorado River Water Conservation District board of directors. 
 
Neville, who refused to be interviewed for this story, has sole discretion over what committees members of his caucus get. But because Republicans lost seats in the House in last year’s elections, that also meant there are fewer seats in House committees for GOP members. 
 
As a result, coveted committees such as agriculture and transportation end up going to more senior members. 
 
Still, not including someone such as Catlin is a hard pill for Western Slope legislators to swallow because of his vast knowledge on water law, especially when considering who else is on the panel, those lawmakers said. 
 
The 13-member committee is dominated by lawmakers who hail not just from the Front Range, but from the South Platte River Basin. That’s the region that has the highest population and the greatest need for more municipal water supplies. 
 
The rest break down to two for the Colorado River basin on the Western Slope, two in the Arkansas River basin in southeast Colorado, and one in the Rio Grande River basin in the San Luis Valley. 
 
That means when water issues — which historically divide along basin lines rather than political ones — come up for votes, the northern Front Range region out-votes the other basins combined, 8-6. 
 
The Western Slope lawmakers on the panel are Reps. Yeulin Willett, R-Grand Junction, and Diane Mitch Busch, D-Steamboat Springs, both of whom agreed that Catlin’s voice on the panel would be welcomed. 
 
Chris Treese, executive director of the Colorado River Water Conservation District, said the Western Slope deserves a greater voice on that committee because the bulk of the state’s water is located here. And someone like Catlin, who has more direct experience with water issues than Willett, an attorney, or Mitch Busch, whose background is in sociology, can speak more knowledgeably about the subject, Treese said. 
 
“Marc’s whole life has been water, Marc’s family has been water, is water, and for the sake of the House ag committee and for the sake of the whole General Assembly, his expertise is being wasted,” he said. “From the perspective of his district, the vacancy committee elected him in large measure because of that significant background, that natural resource, water-specific background. I know they are disappointed that he is not being assigned in a way that’s consistent with the talents that he brings to the Legislature.” 
 
Montrose rancher Jay Jutten, a Republican, said people like him look to their elected officials to represent them in far-away Denver, and now is not so sure he’s getting that. 
 
“We’re over here in the back 40 and we see the Front Range getting a lot of attention,” he said. “The representation we get, we need them on those committees that are important to us. I’m not saying that the committees Representative Catlin is on aren’t important, but agriculture is huge, transportation is huge for the Western Slope.” 
 
Both Treese and Reece have sent letters to Neville in recent weeks asking him to reconsider Catlin’s appointments. Neville hasn’t yet responded to either. 
 
As a result, Reece sent a similar letter to other House Republican leaders, two of whom, Reps. Lori Saine of Dacono and Perry Buck of Windsor, sit on the ag committee. 
 
Coram, who replaced Sen. Ellen Roberts, R-Durango, when she resigned her seat in December, creating the vacancy for Catlin, said he’s been getting dozens of emails and telephone calls about the matter. 
 
Coram, who sat on the agriculture and transportation committees when he served in the House, was assigned to the Senate ag committee when he switched to the Senate. 
 
He said he’s aghast at Neville’s assignments not only for the ag committee, but transportation, too. 
 
“Looking back at the ag committee for as long as I can remember going back to the ‘60s, there has never been a time a Western Slope Republican agricultural person has not been on the committee,” Coram said. “And there was never a time when there wasn’t a Western Slope Republican on the transportation committee.”</TEXT>
