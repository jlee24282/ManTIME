<TITLE>Ollie Locke trained as actor</TITLE>
<TEXT>Ollie Locke trained as an actor. 
The Made in Chelsea star may have qualifications that could potentially see his name up in lights in the near future but hes adamant hed never agree to do a soap because hes enjoying his time on the E4 reality TV show with his close friends and family. 
Speaking exclusively to BANG Showbiz, he said: "I trained to be an actor but I think I will stick to Made In Chelsea for the moment [instead of starring in a soap]." 
As well as shooting scenes for the popular posh series, the 29-year-old hunk  who came out as bisexual in 2011  is in the middle of launching a gay dating app. 
He explained: "Im launching a very big gay dating app very shortly, and that will be very big when it comes. My love life is turbulent, as always. But its a big year." 
The app, which is called Chappy, wont be out until 2017, however singletons are encouraged to sign up now ahead of the launch. 
Meanwhile, in July, the socialite revealed he was looking for a male companion as being in a relationship with his ex-girlfriend Catherine Louise Radford  who he split from last December  made him realise hes no longer bisexual. 
Speaking about the previous series of the E4 reality show  which was set in Cannes  he said: "Its the first time the viewers have seen me as gay instead of bi. I do say the words I am a gay man." 
Ollie admitted that the series was a "big" deal for him as hes never "openly" talked about his sexuality. 
He said: "For me, this is a big series because Im talking very openly about gay life, which I have never really done before. 
"I lived with a woman last year when I was off camera, we had two dogs together. 
"And then we broke up and in December I thought, Thats it now, I think Im now gay."
