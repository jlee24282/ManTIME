Every Tuesday night from September to June, we welcome the great jazz artists from Winnipeg and from around the world! This week with Anna-Lisa Kirby! Anna-Lisa Kirby has made a big impression on this city since she arrived here from New York almost a decade ago. With performances in every possible setting, from the WSO to duos with husband Steve at private receptions, Anna-Lisa has moved listeners with her articulate and musical storytelling.
