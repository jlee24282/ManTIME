<TEXT type="str">It was a glorious night at the Freeman Coliseum in San Antonio Saturday, as the fans that witnessed NXT Takeover: San Antonio saw five very good matches, two title changes and one person from WWE’s main roster crash the party. 

Since there were only five matches, I will go through the card in chronological order and give my thoughts on each contest. 

Eric Young def. Tye Dillinger 

This was a pretty standard, but good match between the two Canadian wrestlers. 

There wasn’t really anything fancy here with the storytelling. Young, who was accompanied to the ring by Alexander Wolfe and Sanity’s newest member, Killian Dain, helped their leader win the match to continue the group’s rise to power. 

As for Dillinger, it was yet another disappointing loss at a Takeover event, but hopefully there are brighter days ahead, as it looks like he is poised for a call-up to the main roster. 

Roderick Strong def. Andrade “Cien” Almas 

This match lacked a story that fans could sink their teeth into heading into the event, but coming out of it, I think both Strong and Almas improved their stock within NXT with impressive performances. 

NXT Tag Team championship – Authors of Pain def. #DIY 

The performance that probably opened the most eyes was the Authors of Pain’s during their victory over #DIY to claim the NXT Tag Team titles. 

While everyone was aware of the talents of Tommaso Ciampa and Johnny Gargano, I believe the jury was still out amongst the fans as to whether the Authors of Pain could hang with a team like #DIY. 

The contrast in styles between the two teams made for a very entertaining match that told a simple, yet effective story, and to their credit, the Authors proved that they could hang with the likes of Ciampa an Gargano. 

Seth Rollins took over NXT Takeover 

Rollins decided to take matters into his own hands by taking over the show by jumping into the ring and demanding that Triple H show his face. 

Rollins got what he wanted when Triple H walked from behind the curtain, but the brains behind NXT didn’t run down to the ring for a fight. 

Instead, he signaled for security guards to come out and escort Rollins out of the ring. Rollins didn’t go without a fight, as he fended off about a half-dozen members of the security fleet. 

But right before Rollins could finally get his hands on Triple H, more of the cavalry came out to corral Rollins and take him out of the arena. 

I thought this was great because it was something we have never seen before on an NXT Takeover. I don’t think WWE main storylines should bleed into NXT often, but in this specific circumstance it made sense since everyone knows Triple H is backstage at every televised WWE event. 

In my mind, I was saying, “It’s about time!” that Rollins did something like this, and I thought it was cool that it happened on a Takeover instead of another episode of Raw. 

Rollins popping up made the show feel organic and spontaneous, which I think are two good qualities for a wrestling program to have. 

NXT Women’s championship – Asuka def. Payton Royce, Billie Kay &amp; Nikki Cross 

The stakes only got higher when these four women entered the ring and tore the house down in a match that exceeded a lot of people’s expectations. 

I thought the match was structured greatly by having each of the four women shine at various points. 

Since they look at themselves as a team, Royce and Kay worked together throughout the match and even managed to slam Cross through a table that was sitting next to the announce table. 

Just when it looked like Royce and Kay were about to take full control of the match, Asuka mounted a furious comeback that featured some devastating kicks to pick up the victory and retain the title she has held for more than 300 days. 

NXT championship – Bobby Roode def. Shinsuke Nakamura 

The main event was glorious before the bell even rang, as both Roode and Nakamura had tremendous entrances. 

Roode went to the ring with eight women walking with him arm and arm in a scene reminiscent to Ric Flair at one of the old Starrcade during the 1980s. 

Nakamura glided to the ring on a platform that was decked out with strobe lights. 

For whatever reason, great grand are par for the course in NXT, but are kept to a minimum in WWE. 

I understand not having grand entrances for every pay-per-view, but WWE should put a little extra effort into the entrances on the “big four” shows. 

The match itself was probably the best of the night and featured a very dramatic ending that NXT. 

Nakamura looked like he was in position to retain the NXT title when he delivered a KINSHASA to Roode on the ring apron. However, Nakamura hurt his knee on the way down and sold it beautifully the rest of the match. 

Nakamura eventually hit the KINSHASA again, but used his bad knee and injured his knee and worsened the injury in the process. WWE medical eventually ran to the ring to check on him. 

While that was happening, Roode took his time recovering after being knocked out cold thanks to the second KINSHASA, but bounced back just in time to hit Nakamura with a pair of glorious DDTs to win the NXT championship. 

I thought the finish was good because it protected Nakamura, as the injury was made to look so severe that he was nearly unable to continue the match 

As for Roode, he has gone from free agent to the subject of a humorous internet meme to the top man in NXT in less than a year. 

Overall, I thought NXT Takeover: San Antonio was a very good show that exceeded even my own expectations. 

As much as NXT seems to be hitting its stride again, the Royal Rumble is Sunday and WrestleMania is fast approaching, which means the brand could lose another crop of stars to the main roster, putting it right back in the position of reloading yet again. 

On the surface, that would be NXT in a precarious position, but if Saturday is any indication, the brain trust at the WWE Performance Center will find a way to keep things moving in a positive direction.</TEXT>
