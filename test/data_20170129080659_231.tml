What reviewers say: &quot;Right next door to the Old Town area of the city, it&apos;s the ideal location for exploring the city. Very close to The Deep. Breakfast is excellent value for money. Car parking is also very good at this hotel.&quot;

&quot;Very handy for the city centre, free parking, very comfortable beds, everything you&apos;d expect from a Premier Inn at a very good price, would definitely recommend it. The windows don&apos;t open as it&apos;s near a main road but there is air con - not that we needed it in January!&quot;

What reviewers say: &quot;Visited today to celebrate a birthday. 20 family members. Every single thing was perfect. Excellent and professional &apos;silver (not seen it done so well in years) service&apos; throughout. Food - all of it - every bite - was first class. We were made to feel so welcome, nothing was too much for the lovely staff.&quot; &quot;Our sixth stay at this centrally located city hotel. Ideal for shopping and seeing all the sites and museums in and around Hull. Great staff who are so welcoming and helpful and always have a smile no matter what you may need. Making plans for our next visit.&quot;

What reviewers say: &quot;Booked upper deck room for very good price. However, room was really only average. The Tassimo coffee machine was rather more trouble than it was worth and the Sky TV took lots of button pushing to turn on. Breakfast was fine but a little limited. Leisure facilities excellent.&quot;

&quot;This visit was all about the viewing the attractions in City of Culture and was the second time we have stayed in the Village Hotel in Hull and as previously experienced, the hotel was everything as we expected for the Village chain, great time, great staff.&quot;

What reviewers say: &quot;We have stayed here several times over the years and it&apos;s always been great. Friendly staff, comfortable rooms and good value breakfast (although we have to pay for the children now!). If you like a run get up early and go over the Humber Bridge, breathtaking.&quot; &quot;We stayed here as we wanted to be close to the Humber Bridge so we could cross to the south bank to watch the City of Culture fireworks. As always we were warmly welcomed by all the staff. The room was fine - one of the older rooms - which actually means it has more storage space which was good as we were there for 3 nights. Staff were run ragged at breakfast on the first morning - full hotel but not enough staff - they coped brilliantly and never stopped smiling.&quot;

What reviewers say: &quot;Good location, with most of the city&apos;s major landmarks within close walking distance. Getting a good night&apos;s sleep in Hull city centre is often a challenge due to road noise and emergency services vehicles throughout the night. But this hotel located on the Marina is quiet and a good night&apos;s sleep was had. Rooms are very spacious and comfortable.&quot;

&quot;The staff were really good we had an executive room. Not sure that was worth the money, the bed was barely a king size and the quilt only just fitted. The bathroom could have been cleaner. At first glance it looked clean but I&apos;m a bit particular and felt it had just had a once over. On the whole, would recommend just me being picky. Hull is a great place and the people are wonderful and friendly.&quot;

What reviewers say: &quot;The hotel staff on arrival were more than helpful. I was booked in and was informed of all of the services available, then directed to my room. The room was spotless and well aired and in the morning the breakfast was well presented and quite enjoyable, so all in all, highly recommended!&quot;

&quot;Recently stayed here on a Saturday night, the room was comfortable enough, but was woken at 2am by people on the same floor having a blazing row after returning from a night club. The police were called and the man was arrested, but the staff member walking up and down the corridor talking loudly on the phone did not help. As compensation, we were given a free breakfast, and although this was a nice gesture, it did not make up for the disturbed sleep.&quot;

What reviewers say: &quot;Would have liked to stay longer, but was for a funeral. Parked on road around the back by the police station. You only pay on meter after 8.30am, so was great for us. Room and shower were very good, bed was comfortable. Breakfast had a lot of variety, good value. Staff were excellent.&quot; &quot;We booked a room, and we were given a room next to the lift, we were filled with dread! But we shouldn&apos;t have been, we slept with window open too. The noise levels weren&apos;t a problem. Nice clean room, lovely helpful staff. We booked breakfast, it was very nice, the scrambled eggs looked a little off-putting but my friend said they were lovely. The staff were always polite, and spoke every time you walked past. We left a coat and went back after we had checked out but this wasn&apos;t a problem, they promptly went to get it. Looking forwards to our next visit.&quot;

What reviewers say: &quot;Very small, dated room. Cannot say it was classed as a double. Had to watch TV sitting on the bed. No room to put a chair. Window in room left open, struggled to close it. Friendly staff and good service at bar.&quot;

&quot;Stayed overnight on business. Staff have a great attitude and are very helpful. Breakfast resume for their staff, again extremely helpful. Amazing to see through the window in the restaurant that you&apos;re sat in the train station overlooking the platforms. My room was on the small side but clean and the bed was very comfortable. Heating was not working on the controller, however the radiator kept the room warm despite the single glazed large window on a very cold night.&quot;

What reviewers say: &quot;Still good rooms but didn&apos;t use the bar or food this trip as other bookings made. Still quiet and comfortable, even though they had builders extending. Handy to get around although out of town and the taxis are reasonable and run to booking times.&quot; &quot;Room was nice but in need of update - clean but not spotless. AVOID eating at table, food is very average and over priced and customer service is non-existent. But staff at hotel are first class.&quot;

What reviewers say: &quot;Just an overnight stay - not expensive, central location, service is OK, bed not great. I am thinking I will definitely avoid the breakfast - it was horrible. I will not look to return if I have the choice.&quot;

&quot;Room was OK. Bed settee was made up for my one-year-old daughter and I slept on there with her but very uncomfortable. My mum slept in the double. Not a lot of room at all, especially with a pram blocking the doorway as well. The room was very clean but breakfast wasn&apos;t the best - beef sausage and beans and scrambled egg that tasted of nothing! No bacon whatsoever but the usual toast, fruit, yoghurts etc were on offer. The staff very friendly and helpful.&quot;

What reviewers say: &quot;One night for conference. Improvements being carried out so up back stairs to room. Generally it is tired and scruffy so improvement presumably welcome. Room OK, bathroom unexciting with small bath. Bed amazingly comfortable, a proper double with excellent pillows.&quot;

&quot;OK hotel, plenty of parking, gym, rooms undergoing refurb. Fine for an overnight stop. Proper staff who all new their roles. Walking distance for a couple of pubs/resturants if required. Close to Hull and Beverley. All in all, better than average. GOOD would sum it up. Would stop again, found it good value.&quot;

What reviewers say: &quot;Have stayed here once a year for some years and last year found it really grubby. Think someone may have read review as this year it was better. The curtains were clean, no thick layer of dust on pelmet. The walls were clean, bedding spotless and big white towels. The breakfast is nothing special, juice, cereals, toast, the best thing on offer is fresh fruit.&quot; Location: Beverley Road, Willerby

What reviewers say: &quot;Absolutely loved this place, room was very clean and tidy. No noise even though I was at the front of the building. Very comfy and really welcoming. Check in was very easy. After some reviews I was worried about what I would find but they must have gotten the wrong hotel as my stay was perfect. Staff were fantastic.&quot;

&quot;Christmas night out in Hull and this hotel made it cheaper to sleep over than get a taxi home. I must admit after reading reviews I wondered what we were going to find. Check in was quick and friendly, room big and spacious, bed and bedding clean. Furniture tatty but bed comfy enough. Room in general was cleanish, some dust, few crumbs and in the morning found a dirty cup. Plenty warm enough and no noise issue as we were at back of hotel. Would consider using again in the future.&quot;

What reviewers say: &quot;Yeah it&apos;s a bit tired. But room was clean, bedding clean, no noise, hot water for shower. Basically, everything was great for the price. Would definitely stay here again if around this area.&quot; &quot;We booked this hotel in October for the New Year and City of Culture celebrations. We arrived on New Years Eve to our room 331 on the top floor. We could not believe what greeted us. The room was freezing with all the windows open, hoping to rid the room of the musty smell l think. lt did not work. All the fixtures and fittings are dated, worn out and very over-tired and the bed is beyond words. Disgusting is not even close. The flooring and curtains came from a charity shop we think. The bathroom was dirty and shabby. We had to request pillows and even a spoon for our tea tray. The room never even had a chair. If we had not arranged to meet friends at an evening dinner and the city of culture celebrations the next day, we would have left demanding our money back.&quot;

What reviewers say: &quot;My husband and I have stayed at this hotel on many occasions over the last five years and I can honestly say the facilities have really gone down hill. Unfortunately, the cost of staying there has also gone up, at one point being quoted £84 which is excessive for what you get.&quot;

&quot;I stayed here after struggling to find vacancies in Hull and thought it looked quite nice driving into the complex when I arrived after a busy day. The receptionist was nice but in a rush to go home and for me to leave the bar after one drink at 9pm. I was able to have another drink if I took it to the room. When I got to the room, it smelled strongly of stale cigarette smoke, bedding appeared clean but the rest of the room dirty and carpets sticky and filthy. Unusual key system left me unsure if the door was locked and when I tried to ring to ask for advice and explain about cigarette smell, the staff had gone home and no answer. I then checked reviews which said this was a well-known hot spot for sex trade! I hadn&apos;t yet tried the shower but looking at other reviews I hope it works and hope my clothes don&apos;t smell too much of smoke at work tomorrow. I paid £59 to stay here without breakfast. Will not be staying again!&quot;
