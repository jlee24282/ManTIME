<TEXT type="str">The angry Facebook post was more of an opportunity to vent than anything else. 
 
After arriving at the former Holy Trinity Church on Falls Street Monday night and finding a statue of the Virgin Mary missing, Marg Domagolski just wanted to let the world know how awful she felt. 
 
“This is something that really sat in my heart and I had to let people know,” she explained of her decision to post news of the theft to Facebook. 
 
Domagolski never expected what came next. Here’s a look at how her initial post led to the statue&apos;s safe return the next day. 
 
After discovering the theft about 5 p.m., it wasn&apos;t long before Domagolski turned to Facebook. 
 
At 5:57 p.m. she posted: “My heart is heavy this evening. As I was making my way to the complex around 5pm, I realized as I was driving in front of the church that the statue of Mary was missing. I immediately pulled over and hoped that she was behind the base (as happened a couple years ago). Unfortunately, whoever was able to remove the statue from its base also took it with them. There is no respect or remorse for someone else&apos;s property. I know this may be a long shot, however, I pray that our statue of Mary will be returned in one piece.” 
 
Minutes later, at 6:04 p.m. she received her first response, &quot;I hope the statue was found. Whoever took it is the lowest of the low!” 
 
The mood hovered between disgust and hope for much of Monday night with one of the day&apos;s final friends offering,“Praying for safe return,&quot; at 11:04 p.m. 
 
By Tuesday morning, news of the theft became a bit more personal with Dennis Michaels posting at 6:07 a.m., &quot;The statue was donated in honor of my grandmother, so very sad.” 
 
The base of the statue notes that it was set in place in 2002 in memory of Wanda &quot;Sunny&quot; Ciurylo, a former church parishioner who died a year earlier. Her daughter, Barbara Michaels, said the family covered the cost of installing the stone statue because they thought it would be a fitting tribute to her mother. 
 
&quot;That&apos;s terrible,&quot; reads the final response at 7:08 p.m. before the story made a turn for the better. The original posting had generated 42 comments and 65 shares. 
 
“That first post reached over 9,000 people, which is incredible for us,” Domagolski said, adding, “When we have an event and post it to Facebook we usually reach 200 to 300 people.” 
 
Around 8 p.m., Domagolski said Falls police were alerted that a statue similar to the one being discussed on Facebook was standing on the sidewalk on the 1600 block of Falls Street, about two blocks away from the church building. 
 
Minutes later, at 8:52 p.m., an excited Domagolski posts: “The power of prayer, the power of faith and the power in numbers of friends and social media. 
 
I am elated to share the news that the Blessed Mother statue was found this evening and returned by the Niagara Falls Police department just a few moments ago. 
 
A very special thank you to each and everyone of you who commented, shared my post from yesterday, prayed for a safe return, and to the individual who spotted Blessed Mother and called the Police Department. Of course, thank you to the Niagara Falls Police Department as well. She is back home. Thank you Jesus for answering our prayers for a safe return.” 
 
The entire incident was a lesson in the power of social media for Domagolski. 
 
She was both surprised in the response her initial posting generated and feels whomever took the statue had second thoughts after all the attention it drew. They then left the Virgin Mary on the Falls Street sidewalk so it could easily be found. 
 
&quot;I have a strong faith,&quot; she said, &quot;that&apos;s my belief — God works in his way.&quot;</TEXT>
