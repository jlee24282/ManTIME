<content type="str">Two years ago, a lockdown occurred at Fremont High School after a student brought a gun into the building with the intent to cause harm. 
 
Last Dec. 1, on the anniversary of that lockdown, Mueller Park Junior High School in Bountiful was evacuated because of a similar incident. 
 
At Mueller Park, the 15-year-old suspect had a 12-gauge shotgun and a 9mm handgun that he concealed underneath a long coat as he walked to school that morning, according to news reports. 
 
His parents were concerned, and checked their gun safe that morning before leaving work. It was what they didn&apos;t find that caused them to spring into action. 
 
The shotgun and handgun were missing, along with boxes of extra ammunition. Dropping everything, the parents drove to the junior high. As they ran into the building, the sound of a single shot reverberated through the school, sending the school into lockdown. 
 
The story which isn&apos;t being told is how a student and a science teacher in the classroom began to talk the shooter down. The teacher acted on hours of gun violence training, and possibly saved the lives of the students in the class. The student who stepped up was in no way obligated to do so but both the student and teacher were willing to put their lives at risk to save their friends and classmates. 
 
Bountiful Police Chief Tom Ross said in news reports that the student and teacher were able to talk to the suspect long enough to distract him, giving his mom enough time to intervene. 
 
&quot;A teacher and a student in that room immediately engaged him verbally in trying to talk him out of doing this,&quot; Ross told the press. &quot;I believe those seconds played a big role in the outcome.&quot; 
 
Fremont High likewise had a student who saved the lives in one of our classrooms in 2014, reporting to the school officer that they had seen a gun in the waistband of another student. Seniors remember that Wednesday two years ago — all classrooms placed on lockdown, due to uncertainty about whether there were more suspects involved. 
 
We sat in our classrooms during the lockdown, some laughing to release tension, some crying with fear, some stone-faced with anxiety. Some kids called their mothers while others scanned social media platforms in an attempt to gain information. Students in English classes soon tweeted and texted about the snipers on the roof of the school, visible from the windows. 
 
Class by class, students and teachers were evacuated from our Plain City school, leaving their backpacks and belongings in classrooms to be checked by officers and bomb detection dogs that night. 
 
SWAT team members frisked us for weapons and then we were led by a convoy of officers out of the school and onto the football field. It was freezing outside as we waited for rides home from parents, neighbors and friends. 
 
The lockdown drills replayed in our minds, and all of us are still grateful to this day for the unnamed student who wasn&apos;t afraid to speak up. 
 
The next week, after the Fremont lockdown, an assembly was held to help inform students about gun violence, bullying and what to do in similar situations. However, there hasn&apos;t been much information given since then. 
 
In light of recent events in schools, why haven&apos;t we had more assemblies and drills, or received information about how to prevent, spot and act in gun violence situations? The release of the body cam video of the Bountiful police officer who was the first to arrive at the scene at Mueller Park Junior High, and the viral video &quot;Evan&quot; released by the victims of the Sandy Hook school shooting about noticing signs of gun violence, make me wonder if students know how to react in such a situation. 
 
We have the support system set in place, but are we utilizing it to its full potential? 
 
Fremont High, as well as all middle and high schools in the Weber School District, have a Student Response Team. The members of the team participate in training every year about suicide, depression, mental illness, bullying, violence, and some basic counseling strategies to help students. 
 
While these students are not counselors themselves, they are critical in bringing other students to counselors and safe places in each school where they can get help. 
 
People talk about the elephant in the room, but the training students receive doesn&apos;t fully cover school shootings. If we are to prevent gun violence, shouldn&apos;t the school address how to look for signs and what to do if a situation were to occur? 
 
I believe the reason is similar to a myth that surrounds discussion of suicide. Talking about the effects of suicide, and how to prevent it, doesn&apos;t make people suicidal. Talking about the effects of gun violence in schools, and how to prevent it, doesn&apos;t make people want to become aggressors. 
 
I believe we would benefit from yearly training, in class or through an assembly, with students who were in the lockdown, and with officers who have been at the scenes of school shootings or have helped prevent gun violence in schools. The recent anti texting and driving campaign in schools hit home because a real person whose life was affected by texting and driving — not an expert — spoke to us. 
 
To drive the gun-violence message home, having a presentation of the facts, and what to look for and what to do, would make a larger, longer-lasting impact to help prevent similar tragedies in our schools — and to help students like me feel safer.
