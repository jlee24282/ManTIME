Prince William and Prince Harry said it was the right time to &quot;recognise her positive impact&quot; both at home and abroad with the monument. 

It will be erected in a place she knew well, the public gardens of her former London home at Kensington Palace. 

&quot;It has been 20 years since our mother&apos;s death and the time is right to recognise her positive impact in the UK and around the world with a permanent statue,&quot; a statement from the princes said. 
Commissioned by her adoring sons, the statue of Princess Diana will be erected  in the public grounds of Kensington Palace, which was the centre of public tributes to &quot;the people&apos;s princess&quot; in 1997. 
&quot;Our mother touched so many lives. We hope the statue will help all those who visit Kensington Palace to reflect on her life and her legacy.&quot; 

William was 15 and Harry just 12 when their mother was killed in a car crash in Paris on August 31, 1997. 

William made a rare public admission earlier this month about his feelings following the accident, saying during a visit to a London bereavement centre he felt &quot;very angry&quot; when his mother died.

Harry revealed last summer during an interview he had not talked about Diana&apos;s death &quot;for the first 28 years of my life&quot;. 

Kensington Palace said work on the artwork would begin soon but it was not possible to say when it would be unveiled, although it is hoped the ceremony would take place this year.
