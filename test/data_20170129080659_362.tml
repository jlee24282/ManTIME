<TEXT type="str">BOXING: The chances of a home-town fight against Manny Pacquaio for Brisbane-born Jeff Horn have moved a step closer with the Queensland government tabling a bid to host the bout. 
 
The WBO world welterweight battle is set for April 23 but a venue has yet to be decided. 
 
Former Mt Gravatt schoolteacher Horn, 28, has been hoping to fight the Filipino superstar on home soil and now could get his wish. 
 
Queensland tourism minister Kate Jones confirmed the state government had put its offer to promoters with Suncorp Stadium the proposed venue for what would be one of the biggest fights in Australian boxing history. 
 
Jones said a partnership bid from the Brisbane City Council was still in negotiation as promoters decided on whether to accept the offer. 
 
Horn is unbeaten in his 17 professional fights so far, winning 16 and drawing one. 
 
He has already called the bout a dream fight against 11-time world champion Pacquiao.</TEXT>
