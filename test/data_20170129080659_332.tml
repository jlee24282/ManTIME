Question: How does it feel to get to 1,000 career points?

Answer: Really good. I was a little bit nervous at first, I just wanted to get it over with so it wasn&apos;t on my mind. It feels good.

Q: You&apos;ve been a cornerstone of this program for as long as you&apos;ve been here. What does it feel like to see this program grow the way it has?

A: It&apos;s rewarding. I think my first year we came in and we won three games. Now we&apos;re up to six. Every game this year&apos;s been close whereas other years we&apos;ve been beat by 40 or something. It&apos;s nice to be in the game. Feels good.

Q: Why did you decide to come to Presentation and what do you like about it?

A: I wanted to be a nurse and they had a good program that works with basketball. I&apos;m from Atwater, Minn., about three hours, three and a half. I like that it&apos;s small. You know everybody, you have friends everywhere, your class sizes are small and you&apos;re close with your professors. I like that.

Q: What kind of a nurse do you want to be?

A: I don&apos;t really know (laughs). I&apos;ve got to figure it out I guess, I graduate in May.

Q: What&apos;s something people might not know about you?

A: My brother plays on the men&apos;s team, nobody probably really knows that.

Q: What&apos;s something you like to do when you&apos;re not playing basketball?

A: I like to take naps, when I can. Other than that just hang out with friends.

Q: Favorite kind of music?

A: Not anything really, I listen to it all. Probably favorite is country.

Q: Who&apos;s your favorite country guy or gal?

A: I don&apos;t know, anybody really.

Q: What do you want to do when you&apos;re done here? Do you want to go back home?

A: Probably, I don&apos;t know, right away anyway. In the long run I want to probably become a travel nurse, traveling around the country.

Q: What are the biggest memories you&apos;ll take away from your time with the team?

A: Those conference wins are always big memories, after not winning any to winning two, then three, it feels good. Good to win those.

Q: Is there a message you&apos;d want to leave for those who come to the program or remain after you leave?

A: Don&apos;t take this time for granted because it goes by super fast. We&apos;re already at five weeks left in the season. That&apos;s crazy. I feel like I was just a freshman, now I&apos;m at the end of my career.
