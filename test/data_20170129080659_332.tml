<TITLE>Q&A: Senior Sydney Larson looks back on a great career</TITLE>
<TEXT>Editors note: This is part of an ongoing series of question-and-answer segments with college athletes that will appear in the sports section on Sundays.

Question: How does it feel to get to 1,000 career points?

Answer: Really good. I was a little bit nervous at first, I just wanted to get it over with so it wasn't on my mind. It feels good.

Q: You've been a cornerstone of this program for as long as you've been here. What does it feel like to see this program grow the way it has?

A: It's rewarding. I think my first year we came in and we won three games. Now we're up to six. Every game this year's been close whereas other years we've been beat by 40 or something. It's nice to be in the game. Feels good.

Q: Why did you decide to come to Presentation and what do you like about it?

A: I wanted to be a nurse and they had a good program that works with basketball. I'm from Atwater, Minn., about three hours, three and a half. I like that it's small. You know everybody, you have friends everywhere, your class sizes are small and you're close with your professors. I like that.

Q: What kind of a nurse do you want to be?

A: I don't really know (laughs). I've got to figure it out I guess, I graduate in May.

Q: What's something people might not know about you?

A: My brother plays on the men's team, nobody probably really knows that.

Q: What's something you like to do when you're not playing basketball?

A: I like to take naps, when I can. Other than that just hang out with friends.

Q: Favorite kind of music?

A: Not anything really, I listen to it all. Probably favorite is country.

Q: Who's your favorite country guy or gal?

A: I don't know, anybody really.

Q: What do you want to do when you're done here? Do you want to go back home?

A: Probably, I don't know, right away anyway. In the long run I want to probably become a travel nurse, traveling around the country.

Q: What are the biggest memories you'll take away from your time with the team?

A: Those conference wins are always big memories, after not winning any to winning two, then three, it feels good. Good to win those.

Q: Is there a message you'd want to leave for those who come to the program or remain after you leave?

A: Don't take this time for granted because it goes by super fast. We're already at five weeks left in the season. That's crazy. I feel like I was just a freshman, now I'm at the end of my career.
