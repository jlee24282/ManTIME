<content type="str">Mumbai (Maharashtra) [India], Jan. 29 (ANI): The Shiv Sena, which has called off its ties with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ahead of the BMC polls, on Sunday trained guns at Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and alleged that he is surrounded by &apos;shakuni&apos;.

&quot;Even the Chief Minister has filled his party with &apos;gundas&apos; as many of the members are rapists, murderers, thieves, dacoit, hooligans. Our party is the protector of Maharashtra&apos;s culture. The BJP has given space to 2000 gundas in their party. There is no difference between the BJP and Samajwadi Party,&quot; Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut told ANI.

The Shiv Sena leader further accused the BJP of raking up the Ram temple issue only during elections.

&quot;The BJP will not get 280 seats in Lok Sabha. So, if they want to build Ram temple then make it now. The BJP will not get a second chance and why they always remember the Ram Mandir issue during elections and they send Ram ji to exile after the elections,&quot; he added. (ANI)</content>
