NEW YORK  Elton John has been tapped to write the songs for a devilish upcoming musical  The Devil Wears Prada. 
 
Producer Kevin McCollum said last week that John, the composer of Broadway hits The Lion King and Aida, will supply the music for a stage adaptation and playwright Paul Rudnick will write the story. 
 
No timetable was revealed. 
 
The Devil Wears Prada began as a best-selling novel by Lauren Weisberger, inspired by the authors own experiences working as an assistant for Vogue magazine Editor Anna Wintour. It was adapted into a hit film starring Meryl Streep and Anne Hathaway. 
 
The new musical will be produced by McCollum, Fox Stage Productions and Rocket Entertainment. Its part of a big new push by movie studios to adapt films for the stage, including Mrs. Doubtfire.</TEXT>
