Firefighters in Derbyshire are warning of the dangers of tumble dryers after they were responsible for three blazes in the county within a 24-hour period. 
 
In one incident fire crews from Melbourne, Nottingham Road and Ascot Drive were called to a house fire in Twyford Road, Barrow on Trent after a tumble dryer burst into flames. The blaze, which happened at 11pm, caused extensive damage to a utility room. 
 
Earlier the same day - on January 18 - at 3pm firefighters attended a house fire on Roecar Close, Chesterfield. The occupant had extinguished the fire prior to the crew&apos;s arrival. 
 
Then at 10.30am firefighters attended a house fire on Holbein Close, Dronfield. No-one was injured in the incidents and all three homes had working fire alarms. 
 
Area manager Alex Johnson said: &quot;We have responded to three separate fires involving tumble dryers this week, but thankfully, all three properties were fitted with working smoke alarms and nobody sustained any injuries.

&quot;It&apos;s important that everyone takes a moment to familiarise themselves with our electrical safety advice, which can help prevent accidental fires from occurring and help protect families from the devastating consequences of a house fire.&quot; 
 
It is estimated 6,000 fires have been caused by tumble dryers in the past six years - and a year ago Whirlpool said more than four million of its tumble dryers, sold under the Hotpoint, Indesit and Creda brands, were at risk of catching fire if fluff catches the heating element and customers have been advised to have modifications carried out to stop them over-heating. 
 
One of the most notable cases was when a dryer caused a huge fire in an 18-storey London tower block in Shepherd&apos;s Bush. 
 

 
Derbyshire Fire and Rescue Service is reminding people of the importance of having working smoke alarms fitted on every level of the home and again have issued safety advice relating to tumble dryers and other electrical items. 
 
Tumble Dryer Safety 
 Always follow the manufacturer&apos;s instructions.  Don&apos;t use tumble dryers at night or while unattended.  Don&apos;t overload plug sockets.  Remove the lint from the trap after every load of clothes dried. Do not cover the vent or any other opening.  Ensure the vent pipe is free of kinks and is not crushed in any way. Only use recommended vent pipes, and not improvised ones.  Only vent the warm air to the outside of a building. Do not put rags or materials into your tumble dryer if they have been used to soak up flammable liquids.

Electrical Safety 
  Always check that you are using the right fuse to prevent overheating.  Make sure an electrical appliance has a British or European safety mark when you buy it.  Certain appliances, such as washing machines, should have a single plug to themselves, as they are high powered.  Try and keep to one plug per socket.  Keep your eyes peeled for signs of dangerous or loose wiring such as scorch marks, hot plugs and sockets, fuses that blow or circuit-breakers that trip for no obvious reasons, or flickering lights.  Check and replace any old cables and leads, especially if they are hidden from view behind furniture or under carpets and mats.  Unplug appliances when you&apos;re not using them or when you go to bed.
