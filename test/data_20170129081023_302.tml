<TITLE>BNL shrugs off slow start, paddles past Indian Creek</TITLE>
<TEXT>TRAFALGAR  came out messing around in the first quarter Saturday against big underdog Indian Creek.

For the finaly three periods there was no more messin and a whole lot of Messmore as the Lady Stars closed the 2016-17 regular season with a 75-54 road bashing of the Braves.

After falling behind, 18-15, after one quarter, the Lady Stars had a meeting of the minds and rolled the rest of the way to win their eighth consecutive game heading into Tuesdays Floyd Central Sectional contest against Seymour.

Junior guard McKenzie Messmore led the way with 15 points, seven rebounds and seven assists, while also playing lock-down defense over the final three periods on Indian Creek leader Katie Burkman, who had seven in the first period, but just three the rest of the way. Senior forward Kennedy Bunch added 19 points while swishing 5 of 8 3-pointers, and sophomore center Jorie Allen had 18 points and eight rebounds.

I think Mac and Kennedy are both playing with a lot of savvy right now, said BNL head coach Jeff Allen. They both read things so well and theyre such calming influences for us, Mac with her ballhandling and Kennedy with key shots and leadership.

The Lady Stars seemed to be up the Creek without a paddle. Or compass. Maybe a leak or two. BNL appeared to take the 10-12 Braves lightly, but Indian Creek had some holdovers from a 21-5 sectional-championship team, and it caught BNL flat-footed at the defensive end. The Braves got seven points from center Caitlyn Snyder and two 3-pointers from Katie Burkman in the first period to take an 18-15 lead at the first break.

I was a little perturbed, but its easy for a coach to be upset and what Im more concerned about is how my kids respond, Allen said. We took a timeout there (with 2:10 left in the first quarter) and they could see on my face that I wasnt real pleased.

Indian Creek played really hard and we didnt come out ready to play, but they responded well the rest of the game.

The Lady Stars found their anchor and oars in the second stanza. A halfcourt trapping defense interrupted Indian Creeks rhythm, and BNL cranked up its running game on offense.

Allen scored twice in transition, Messmore hit a fast-break layup, and the Lady Stars went 5 for 8 from the arc with Bunch (twice), Messmore and Jacy Hughes all connecting as BNL blazed to a 26-point period and 41-29 halftime lead.

We were trying to work on some things as far as mixing up our defenses and switching them faster, and we wanted to get out and go with the ball today, Allen said. There were a couple of glitches, but all in all we executed pretty well after the first quarter.

The Braves kept battling and sliced the margin to nine behind the play of forward Madelyn Gary, ICs lone senior playing her final home game. She converted a three-point play to narrow it to 45-36 with 5:40 showing in the third. But after a free throw by Allie Crulo-Rood, Fugate took a charge and then swished a rainbow trey to restore order.

Messmore slashed down the lane on a fast-break drive, and Bunch buried another 3-pointer as the Lady Stars pulled back out to a 56-42 lead going to the fourth. When Allen posted up twice in a row to score starting the fourth quarter the outcome was no longer in doubt. BNL, which shot 53 percent (27 of 51) from the field and committed 11 turnovers, led by as much as 24 late in the game.

Gary finished with 13 points and six rebounds for Indian Creek, which committed 15 miscues, shot 14 for 42 (.333) from the field, and was outrebounded, 34-25.

Fugate added 11 points and six boards, while Jacy Hughes had seven points for the Lady Stars (17-4), who face the Owls (15-8) in the second game Tuesday night at Galena, following the 6 p.m. opener between Jennings County (9-14) and Floyd Central (13-10). Jeffersonville (16-7) and New Albany (15-6) drew first-round byes.
