<TITLE>Around the remote: Chuck Barney's TV picks for Jan. 29-Feb. 4</TITLE>
<TEXT>DON'T MISS: "The 23rd Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards" - Yes, it's another excuse for movie and TV stars to get all dressed up and wear sparkly things. At least his celebration of top performances should offer some clues as to who might collect Oscars a few weeks from now. Will "La La Land" dance off with lots of trophies? Will "Moonlight" shine extra brightly? Hard to say. What we do know is that Lily Tomlin will be honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award. 8 p.m. Sunday, TNT and TBS.
