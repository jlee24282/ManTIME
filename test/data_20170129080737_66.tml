<content type="str">Liverpool playmaker, Philippe Coutinho, has revealed that he snubbed a move to Barcelona to sign a new five-year deal at Anfield , because he can see the ambition of the club. 
 
The 24-year-old Brazilian was a target for the La Liga chmpions, but has now pledged his future to the Reds, with a contract that makes him the club’s highest earner at £150,000 per week. 
 
Coutinho told Daily Mail he had no second thoughts, as soon as he was offered fresh terms. 
 
“No need to wait. I know. I live this every day, I can smell it. I see the ambition of the club, my teammates, the manager. I am living it, seeing it. Wait to sign? No. No. Now is the right time,” he said. 
 
“I understand what Liverpool means. We can say [Kenny] Dalglish, [Ian] Rush, [Alan] Hansen, [Graeme] Souness, [Luis] Suarez, [Steven] Gerrard. I’ve been here quite a few years already, it’s not like I am new. I understand. 
 
“To have signed a new contract at this club, my goal is to be thought of one day in the same way as these players. They are legends. You define the success of a player by his loyalty or his titles. Or both. In order to be part of this group, I have so much to do. 
 
“I want to win titles. Five years is my new contract … it gives me that opportunity.” 
 
Coutinho has said he was not keen on the big money on offer in the Chinese Super League. 
 
“China, no. I am not interested. I don’t think about that, not for one moment. My football is here. My heart is here. I don’t think about any other club. Not at all,” he said.
