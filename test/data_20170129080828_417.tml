<TITLE>Bulldogs defender on way back after missing grand final</TITLE>
<TEXT>AUSTRALIAN RULES: Matt Suckling could only watch as his team-mates claimed a drought-breaking flag for the Western Bulldogs in last year's grand final. 
 
Now, with his leg on the mend, the 28-year-old with the pin-point boot is eager to play a major role in the club's 2017 campaign. 
 
A tough pre-season training camp on the Sunshine Coast has helped him get back into the groove. 
 
"The achilles put me back a little bit (but) I started running just after Christmas and (am) working through that at the moment, he said. 
 
"It's a lot of hard work at the moment but (it's) looking good. 
 
A two-time premiership winner with Hawthorn, Suckling linked with the Bulldogs a year ago before copping a mid-season kick in the back of the leg which significantly hampered his progress. 
 
He played in some late games but the injury was likely a contributing factor when he missed out on selection for the grand final. 
 
"Obviously it would have been nice to have been out there (in the decider) but the achilles was giving me trouble for the second half of the year, he said. 
 
"(But) it was nice to play in the first couple of finals and help the boys get through to a prelim and I was so happy for them to win it (the grand final) and see the celebrations after. 
 
Watching his team-mates win a premiership did not motivate him any more to win a flag in 2017. 
 
He's already determined enough. 
 
"Seeing the boys do it last year doesn't make me any more hungry, he said. 
 
That (winning a premiership) is why you play footy, that's why you keep turning up and working hard each day. 
 
First he has to break back into the club's top-22. 
 
"Just get my achilles right at the start and then start playing footy again and then I'll be fine, he said. 
 
"When you do get injured you always worry it's going to happen again but that's why over the break you put in so much effort and so much work, so you can come back and so it (the injury) won't let you down again. 
 
There were droves of Bulldogs fans at Kuluin on Sunday, when the reigning premier was put through its paces in the heat. 
 
"The sessions have been really hard but the boys love getting up here (to the Sunshine Coast), he said. "There's a few boys who like getting a tan so they're very happy with that.</TEXT>
