<TEXT type="str">AUSTRALIAN RULES: Matt Suckling could only watch as his team-mates claimed a drought-breaking flag for the Western Bulldogs in last year&apos;s grand final. 
 
Now, with his leg on the mend, the 28-year-old with the pin-point boot is eager to play a major role in the club&apos;s 2017 campaign. 
 
A tough pre-season training camp on the Sunshine Coast has helped him get back into the groove. 
 
&quot;The achilles put me back a little bit (but) I started running just after Christmas and (am) working through that at the moment,” he said. 
 
&quot;It&apos;s a lot of hard work at the moment but (it&apos;s) looking good.” 
 
A two-time premiership winner with Hawthorn, Suckling linked with the Bulldogs a year ago before copping a mid-season kick in the back of the leg which significantly hampered his progress. 
 
He played in some late games but the injury was likely a contributing factor when he missed out on selection for the grand final. 
 
&quot;Obviously it would have been nice to have been out there (in the decider) but the achilles was giving me trouble for the second half of the year,” he said. 
 
&quot;(But) it was nice to play in the first couple of finals and help the boys get through to a prelim and I was so happy for them to win it (the grand final) and see the celebrations after.” 
 
Watching his team-mates win a premiership did not motivate him any more to win a flag in 2017. 
 
He&apos;s already determined enough. 
 
&quot;Seeing the boys do it last year doesn&apos;t make me any more hungry,” he said. 
 
That (winning a premiership) is why you play footy, that&apos;s why you keep turning up and working hard each day.” 
 
First he has to break back into the club&apos;s top-22. 
 
&quot;Just get my achilles right at the start and then start playing footy again and then I&apos;ll be fine,” he said. 
 
&quot;When you do get injured you always worry it&apos;s going to happen again but that&apos;s why over the break you put in so much effort and so much work, so you can come back and so it (the injury) won&apos;t let you down again. 
 
There were droves of Bulldogs fans at Kuluin on Sunday, when the reigning premier was put through its paces in the heat. 
 
&quot;The sessions have been really hard but the boys love getting up here (to the Sunshine Coast),” he said. &quot;There&apos;s a few boys who like getting a tan so they&apos;re very happy with that.”</TEXT>
