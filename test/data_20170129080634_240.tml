Alexander Bublik will compete in Burnie this week fresh from one of the biggest results of his young career. The 19-year-old will compete in the main draw of the 2017 Caterpillar Burnie International fresh from a win over 16th-seeded Lucas Pouille of France in his first Grand Slam appearance at the 2017 Australian Open.

Bublik won three qualifiers in Melbourne before defeating Pouille in four sets which included a 6-0 first set win to open the game. 

Bublik is ranked 207th in the world and has been tipped as one of men to beat in Burnie and said his performances in Australia had been positive so far. 

He also praised the new-look Burnie Tennis Club ahead of his first match on Monday. 

“I’m from Russia originally but I play for Kazakhstan now,” Bublik said. 

“I have been here before [Australia] for juniors two years ago and back then I was in Traralgon and I was also in Melbourne playing. 

“This is my first time in Burnie and the club looks really nice.

“I like it so far, it’s a beautiful place but it’s in the middle of nowhere, but the club is nice and I was very surprised when I got here.

“The courts are really good and everything is new so the organisation has done very well.”

Bublik has an interesting history with tennis having come from a family with success in a different sport. 

“I was born in a small village, well it’s not small because there’s 300,000 people living there but for us it’s pretty small.

“So I was born there about 20 minutes from St Petersburg and my dad got me into tennis very young. 

“He was actually a former basketball player and my grandfather was also a basketball player, my uncle is basketball player and my godfather is basketball coach.

“But my father sat me down and we decided on tennis. 

“He also trained to become a tennis player but started at 16-years-old and went to the army so it was a bit tough. 

“So we said OK let’s try and we have put everything into it and here we are.”

The teenager will face Japan’s Yuya Kibi in round one of the tournament and said his performance in the Australian Open had high riding a wave of confidence. 

“I feel quite confident right now, I was good at the Aussie Open and got a good run of games there.

“I played four great matches and beat a top 20 player.

“So losing in the second round of a major was good for me, it was my first Grand Slam for men’s so it has given me a lot of confidence.”

When looking ahead to the week, Bublik said it was clear what his was while in Tasmania. 

“I want to win this tournament, why else would I come here,” he said.”</TEXT>
