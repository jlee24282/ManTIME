<content type="str">As of late 2016, Bozeman-based company, Jelt has moved manufacturing for all new belt lines from China to Montana. The Jelt Extreme launched in December as the company’s first belt to be manufactured in Montana. Founder and CEO Jen Perry, has made it a goal to move all future belt and product manufacturing to Montana and within the U.S. Jelt is committed to giving back to the community and strives to help people live a more productive life. That is how the contract between Jelt and the Montana Correctional Enterprise (MCE) Program at the Montana Women’s Prison came about. This privileged program guides incarcerated women through an application and interview process, which is required for program participation. These women develop a strong work ethic, new job skills and grow their confidence, which will make them a more marketable employee in the future. Jelt is proud to be a continued supporter of MCE and other quality programs that empower people to be successful in life. Perry actively manages multiple aspects of her business with the help of her local team and continues to use her business as a platform to give back to Bozeman-based nonprofits.</content>
