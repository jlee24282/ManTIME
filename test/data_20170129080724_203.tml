<TEXT type="str">Many people assume that the Delaware &amp; Hudson railroad reduced its belt line train service between Troy and Albany in order to encourage greater use of its United Traction trolley service. If that’s the plan, The Record advises that “additional cars – not to say better equipment must be operated.” 
 
First-hand accounts from our reporters show the trolleys to be overcrowded, underheated and frequently late. Commuters waste minutes and sometimes hours waiting for a trolley that has room enough to pick them up. 
 
One reporter goes out this snowy evening to see how long it takes for him to catch a southbound trolley on the Fourth Street line. Leaving the office, he arrives at the corner of Fourth and Broadway at 5:55 p.m. He sees three cars go by in ten minutes, but each is too crowded to pick him up, not to mention the ten other people at the corner. 
 
Thinking he’ll have better luck if he moves further north, the reporter walks to Fulton Street. There are three times as many people waiting here, many huddled in doorways or under awnings to avoid the snow. He sees three more cars go by, “fully as crowded as the ones preceding, and without opening a door.” 
 
 
It’s no better another block north at Franklin Square. After seeing two more packed trolleys pass him by, he heads to Bridge Avenue. At last a Stow Avenue trolley stops for him. It does not stop at Franklin Square, Fulton Street, Broadway, State Street or Congress Street, where the reporter’s erstwhile companions are still waiting for a trolley. 
 
Earlier today, a reporter rides the trolley to test the temperature. “Notwithstanding the moderate temperature which prevailed [outside], ‘cold storage conditions’ prevailed on the early morning cars,” he writes. 
 
“It was so cold that the moisture from the breaths of passengers froze and was plainly visible. The care was held up in the North Albany barns for ten minutes, but no explanation was received by the twenty passengers, who huddled together to keep as warm as possible in the cold, damp air which filled the car.” 
 
Meanwhile, D&amp;H train service is as bad as ever. “That Delaware and Hudson officials shed complaints as ‘a duck does water’ may be seen in the fact that another slap at Trojans was taken through the belt line service,” a reporter writes after a 5:50 a.m. bus commuters depend on to take them to jobs in Albany arrives in Troy 15 minutes late. It reaches Albany 30 minutes late. Other Troy –Albany runs are between five and twenty minutes late leaving the Collar City.
