The German made a clean start to head the field with Harrison Newey losing a place to Mawson going into the Turn 1. 
 
While Schumacher kept his lead, Newey and Mawson were involved in a race long battle for the second position, with the Australian defending hard from the British driver.

Behind the leaders, Felipe Drugovich finished a distant fourth chased by Rinus van Kalmthout, the Dutchman once again ending up fifth this weekend. 
 
Brazilian Pedro Cardoso at seventh was sandwiched between the two Estonians Juri Vips and Ralf Aron, the former in sixth while the latter at eighth.
