<TITLE>Buddh MRF Challenge: Schumacher doubles up as Mawson fights off Newey</TITLE>
<TEXT>Mick Schumacher closed in on championship leader Joey Mawson after winning the third MRF Challenge race at the Buddh International Circuit.  
The German made a clean start to head the field with Harrison Newey losing a place to Mawson going into the Turn 1. 
 
While Schumacher kept his lead, Newey and Mawson were involved in a race long battle for the second position, with the Australian defending hard from the British driver. 
 
Eventually, Newey had to settle for third with Schumacher claiming a dominant win over championship leader Mawson to bridge the gap in the points table. 
 
Behind the leaders, Felipe Drugovich finished a distant fourth chased by Rinus van Kalmthout, the Dutchman once again ending up fifth this weekend. 
 
Brazilian Pedro Cardoso at seventh was sandwiched between the two Estonians Juri Vips and Ralf Aron, the former in sixth while the latter at eighth. 
 
Meanwhile, Dylan Young on his birthday was back into the points after a disastrous Saturday to finish ninth as Kimi Schramm completed the Top 1</TEXT>
