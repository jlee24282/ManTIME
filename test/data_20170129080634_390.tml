<TITLE>FG Urged To Revive Ajaokuta Steel</TITLE>
<TEXT>A nongovernmental organization, Ajaokuta/Itakpe Revival Movement (ARM), a component of the Nigeria Alliance for Industrial Revolution and Advancement (NAIRA) has called on the federal government to as a matter of urgency revive Ajaokuta/Itakpe Iron Ore and Steel Plants.Speaking to journalist shortly after an awareness walk not a protest against the government but, rather a campaign to draw the attention of Nigerians and the federal government to issues as well as the gains of completing the Ajaokuta/Itakpe Iron Ore and Steel Plants, the convener, NAIRA, Dr. Okeme Arome called on President Muhammadu Buhari to handle all businesses relating to the steel plants as a way of cutting out the cabal, bureaucratic bottleneck and also getting firsthand information on the processes and procedures involved in its revival.Arome urged President Buhari to set up a high powered delegation to meet with the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin to open bilateral talks that include finding ways of bringing back TyazhPromExport (TPE), the original builders of the plant to complete the remaining two per cent for the plants take off.Arome also urged the federal government to facilitate royalties and compensation for the community that houses the steel plant, including families of those who lost their lives in a genuine cause of fighting patriotically for the protection of our national interest during the Ogaminana Massacre of 2008.We urge President Buhari to terminate forthwith any agreement with Global Infrastructure Nigeria Limited (GINL), and that the company be declared Persona non grata in Nigeria. If achieved, these objectives will no doubt start the conversation to bring Nigeria close to becoming a major player in the industrialized world, a vision that should be shared by all Nigerians, he added.
