One program has captured back-to-back championship titles. The other a single win in three seasons. 
 
From a numbers perspective, Brentwood Academy and Austin Peay  couldn’t be more different. Success versus a program with the worst active losing streak in Division I football. 
 
And yet, Austin Peay is on its way to having at least five former Brentwood Academy players on its roster this fall in just two recruiting classes. Signing day is Wednesday. 
 
Defensive back Trent Taylor, defensive back/linebacker Chris Hopkins and running back Prince Momodu were part of Austin Peay coach Will Healy’s first signing class. This year, two of the early commitments to Austin Peay were Brentwood Academy’s Jack McDonald and three-star quarterback Jeremiah Oatsvall . 
 
So why would a player from a successful high school program such as Brentwood Academy – which beat Montgomery Bell Academy in 2015 and 2016 to claim the Division II-AA title – even consider Austin Peay? 
 
Oatsvall said it’s because “there’s a coaching staff that understands that they need kids from winning programs to help turn the program around.”

Selling an 0-11 team isn’t easy. Healy and his staff have to focus on the future, the potential, the plan to turn it around and how the recruit fits into this vision. 
 
It worked with Oatsvall, who said being a priority was an appealing part of the pitch. 
 
The coaches aren&apos;t bad recruiters, either. 
 
“Those (Healy and his staff) are probably the most impressive recruiters I’ve ever been around,&quot; Brentwood Academy coach coach Cody White said. &quot;They are just really good with the kids. I think they lay out a vision, and they do a good job explaining that to our players.” 
 
Healy and his staff’s openness about the rough first year, vision for the future and overall approach has left White with no qualms if any of his players mention interest in Austin Peay. 
 
Both McDonald and Oatsvall, who took an official visit to the university recently, mentioned an immediate sense of belonging and care for them as a person from the coaches. However, having guys they know and trust on the roster did help both truly vet the program and are a reason why they are optimistic for the future. 
 
“Once you play with people that you know and grow that brotherhood, that friendship, that automatically makes your play on the field that much more better,” McDonald said. 
 
And getting better is something that both believe will happen; otherwise, they wouldn’t be going there. 
 
“There is no doubt that we are going to win games,&quot; McDonald said. &quot;Starting next year. I believe that. Eventually, we’ll win championships. That’s what I believe, and that’s what is going to happen.”
