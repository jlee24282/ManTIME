<content type="str">Readers respond to a recent Motormouth column, &quot;Baby boomer blasts new car tech, millennials&quot;: 

I have to disagree with your response to C.P. from Elmhurst, Ill. All he was stating is not everyone wants or needs some of the features that are now on new vehicles. I appreciate the technology that now offers antilock brakes, collision avoidance, etc. In fact my last new car was ordered with manual transmission and no air-conditioning, and the option package offered no choice of radio or interior trim. That was fine with me.

Our club of car enthusiasts unanimously (15) found your answer to C.P. from Elmhurst to be impolite, condescending, and indicating a rather large lack of information about this. Polls taken over the past year at various national club meetings indicate that most people over 55 find the new auto tech to be unnecessary. I have several friends who sell new cars, and a few who actually have dealerships. Guess what is the most common complaint most of the car-buying public age 45 or older is? When you need classes or a CD to learn how to run you car after paying $45,000-plus, it seems a bit over the top.

You did not answer part of C.P.&apos;s question. Specifically, you did not answer &quot;Are any car manufacturers building any vehicles without all this high-tech stuff.&quot; It is a fair question that deserves some attention, especially from the manufacturers. I have a 2012 Buick LaCrosse with a ton of stuff on the dashboard. I do not think I have ever used one-tenth of it.

I read your sarcastic answer. Boomer had some good points. Driving is a function to get from one place to another - it is not meant to be entertainment. Your snarky answer asking if he wanted to go back to no seat belts and air bags concerned safety improvements - while he was complaining about bells and whistles. Don&apos;t dismiss all his points as they are shared by many other drivers.

I have to agree with the irate baby boomer who wrote in asking for a basic car without all the bells and whistles. I think there would be a huge market for this and will congratulate the automaker that addresses the need for a basic vehicle. All of this unnecessary electronic mumbo-jumbo just adds cost and distraction. How about something for auto-disabling text on phones or impaired-driver detection? Best wishes for a happy new year!

Answer: Many thanks to our readers who took the time to write - both those who took us to task and those who did not. We took the liberty of editing your responses for space. Yeah, maybe we were a bit snarky. Even Mrs. Motormouth said so, and she is married to this boomer. You can still find vehicles without all of the electronic wizardry. Just shop the lower-end models. You will get what you need, without much of the stuff you don&apos;t want.
