<TITLE>Lunch: Friend or foe?</TITLE>
<TEXT>For some people, lunches may be a stumbling block when it comes to achieving health goals and maximizing energy. With a little preplanning, however, a healthy lunch can assist with fueling, nutritional, and weight goals. 
 
When lunches are eaten out, they can often contribute to excess calories, low nutrient intake, overconsumption of less healthy food ingredients, and fatigue (as the body focuses on digesting larger amounts of food or heavier food options). 
 
Lunches may also be a meal that is skipped. This might be due to a lack of planning, a busy schedule, overconsumption of filling beverages, or the misconception that skipping meals will assist with weight loss. Not eating lunch, however, can lead to fatigue, inadequate intake of important nutrients, a craving for less healthy options and overeating the rest of the day. 
 
Prioritizing a healthy, appropriately-sized lunch can be extremely beneficial. Think of it as a mini brain vacation that will send you into the afternoon with better fuel and increased efficiency. As you decide what to eat, think by food groups and ideally have each represented. Consider writing down possible lunch combos that you might put together when eating out or when packing a lunch. Maybe write these ideas on index cards as a handy reference. 
 
When it comes to addressing the potential problems of eating out, there are several actions steps that might be helpful. For people with jobs that include a lot of car travel instead of being at the mercy of eating establishments along the way, consider packing meals and snacks in your car. You can choose to pack less perishable foods or take along a small cooler. 
 
The same is true if you have a desk job where packing lunch not only puts you in total control of the types and quantities of food you eat for lunch, but can also save you money. 
 
If packing food is not possible, seek out eating establishments that are more likely to offer healthier foods and where you have the option of smaller portions. Be on the lookout for foods high in sodium, saturated fat, added sugars, or fried foods and limit these. Choose less processed higher fiber foods (whole grain products, fruit, vegetables, beans, nuts, seeds) when possible. 
 
When a school or work site has a cafeteria, consider which are the healthier offerings. Salad bars may be a good choice for a lunch or side dish, but watch the higher calorie extras. Ideally, your salad should include dark leafy greens, lots of colorful vegetables, and a source of healthy protein (grilled chicken, fish, beans, nuts, seeds, eggs, etc.). 
 
If you have chosen a salad as your lunch entre, dont forget to also include a source of whole grain, a starchy vegetable, milk, yogurt, fruit, beans, or other source of healthy carbs as part of the meal. These provide brain and body fuel for the afternoon, especially if you plan to be physically active. Choose an oil-based or lite dressing rather than fat-free if the meal has no other fat source (some nutrients needs a little fat for absorption). 
 
If you prefer sandwiches at lunch, keep in mind a few guidelines, whether you are purchasing it at a sandwich shop or packing one from home. Choose whole grain bread products  bread, pita, wrap, roll, bagel, etc. Note that some bread products count as more than one or two servings of grain. For instance, a 4-inch bagel or a whole large pita equals about three to four slices of bread. A 6-inch sub roll and most large wraps count toward about three slices of bread. If the bread item has a label, stick to an amount that provides no more than about 30 grams of carbohydrates (about two grain servings) for the whole sandwich. 
 
For protein, choose lean meat or poultry items or fish, while limiting processed meats. If you are packing your own lunch, consider cooking some chicken or turkey breasts, cutting them into bite-sized pieces, and portioning these into snack bags. Some can be frozen for later use, and the rest can go in the refrigerator as an add-in for sandwiches, salads, soups, or stir fries. Proteins might also include nut or seed butters, hummus, beans, or eggs. Limit high fat cheeses which contain a lot of saturated fat and calories. 
 
Some sandwiches can hold veggies as well. You could also add a salad, vegetable soup, or some raw veggies on the side. These not only provide a lot of nutrients, but can fill you up on fewer calories, leaving less room for excesses of other sources of calories. 
 
Be careful of the condiments and sandwich spreads you use. Some of the better ones might be assorted mustards, hummus, guacamole, sun dried tomato paste, olive tapenade, horseradish spread, or pesto. 
 
Consider what you could include in your lunch that provides some calcium. It could be a glass of milk or soy milk, a latte, yogurt, cottage cheese, or some low-fat cheese. Some of the milk alternatives are fortified with calcium, but tend to have minimal other nutritional value. 
 
Fruit is a great way to add a little bit of sweetness to lunch without the guilt. This might be a grab-and-go piece of fruit, some unsweetened applesauce, a couple of tablespoons of raisins or other dried fruit, a serving of fresh berries, or cut-up fresh fruit. 
 
Leftovers are another possibility for lunch. Keep in mind the proportion of the My Plate image  half the meal veggies, a quarter of the meal protein, and a quarter some type of healthy starch. One-dish meals work well here  think soups, chili, stews, stir fry, or cooked whole grain dishes with veggies and a protein source. You can purposefully make larger amounts every time you make dinner so that you have some to use for lunches. 
 
So with a little preplanning, lunch can be a friend rather than a foe in your quest for better health.
