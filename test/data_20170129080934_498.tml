<TEXT type="str">Sir, 

Since my teen years, I have always had this voracious and insatiable appetite for reading. 
 

I also had this passion of one day writing something that would make people sit up and read. 
I am grateful to the Times SUNDAY editor for availing me that opportunity on numerous occasions, in the past, to share my life experiences. 
 

I do concede that I am fallible, like all men and may err here and there but I always endeavour to ask God to give me the wisdom to share some of His truths. 
These truths need to be shared with and by all because we are incessantly and rapidly approaching our final appointment with our Creator and whether we like it or not, will be compelled to account for our every deeds – both good and bad, while we journeyed on this earth. 
 
One publication that is keeping me engrossed lately is that age-old Book of Wisdom, penned years ago by diverse men who were inspired by God’s Holy spirit to write. This is the Bible. 
Many of us own this remarkable book but we only read a few pages of it. 
 

We forget that this Book is our passport to being considered worthy of being accepted in God’s heavenly kingdom. 
If you happen to read many prophecies of the Bible, do you happen to read Matthew ‘saccount of Christ’s Olivet prophecy  in Chapter 24 verse 6, about the unprecedented preaching of God’s Word as one of the signs that we are now in the very last stages of earth’s calendar? 
 

Let us read Matthew’s account: 
”And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.” 
Take note of the words ‘as a testimony’.These really caught my eye. 
 

One does not need not to be a rocket scientist to discern that whether we choose to ignore it or not, the magnitude of the preaching of God’s Word in the whole world has reached such overwhelming and glorious levels. 
This is testimony to both believers and non-believers alike, that something is brewing in the air and that many of us, by deliberately ignoring the preaching of the Word on radio, television, churches, in the streets, through the internet, in many crusades, revivals - you name it, when we stand before the judgement seat of God, no one will have any excuse that the Word was not preached to him or her. 
 

Revelation 14 verse 6 reveals further testimony and a very sombre warning about an angel flying in the air, proclaiming these chilling words: 
“Then I saw another angel flying in midair and he had the eternal gospel to proclaim to those who live on earth – to every nation, tribe, language and people.” 
The eternal Word of God is not limited to being preached in Swaziland only but in every nook and cranny of the world and in many languages. 
It is available in some places at a nominal fee, at times free and to all those who thirst for spiritual truths – at no cost! 
 

Sadly, we choose to ignore it and leave our bibles in our room dividers or cupboards to gather dust without bothering to page through. 
We ignore the fact that time is running out fast for many of us and we lose sight of the fact that our appointment with eternity is just on the horizon. 
 

Why do many of us choose to ignore such valuable wisdom? I have no doubt that the hand of Satan is playing a very major role in many minds, influencing us to disregard God’s Word and view it as boring and a waste of time. 
Satan is very adept at blinding many minds because he is, since his fall from Eden, very intent on preventing us from seeing the light of the gospel, which has the propensity to change our lives and enable us to be spiritually linked to the heavenly kingdom. 
Remember that he was cast out from heaven, in the process taking with him a third of the angels because of pride, as a result of his malicious intent of wanting to be like the Most High God.
