<TEXT type="str">OREM, Utah - The New Mexico State Aggies simply do not know how to lose.  
 
Utah Valley nearly pulled the upset at home, but the Aggies overcame a seven-point halftime deficit to win their 18th game in a row, 74-69.  
 
The Wolverines held a one-point lead with just over a minute to play, but Ian Baker was able to find Eli Chuha for the go-ahead layup.  
 
After a defensive stop, NMSU then scored again on the same combination to take a three-point lead with just under ten seconds to play.  
 
Utah Valley took a timeout to draw up a play, but Baker stole the inbounds pass to effectively seal the win for the Aggies.  
 
NMSU improved to 20-2 on the season and remained unbeaten in WAC play at 7-0.  
 
The Aggies were able to overcome 18 turnovers (compared to Utah Valley&apos;s 11) and a poor performance from downtown (just 8-28 from beyond the arc) to get the win.  
 
NMSU now has sole possession of the second-longest active winning streak in the country after Oregon lost Saturday.  Gonzaga still holds the top spot after winning its 22nd in a row Saturday night.  
 
The Aggies next play a non-conference game against Northern New Mexico on Monday before resuming WAC play at home against Chicago State on Feb. 4. </TEXT>
