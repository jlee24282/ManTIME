<TITLE>Letter to the editor: It's hard to 'get over it' when you're fighting for your life</TITLE>
<TEXT>This is for all those people who cant understand why many Americans cant just, Get over it or, Let it go.

For the first time in my life, I am worried that my ability to survive will be taken away by a bunch of reverse Robin Hood politicians, who want to take from the poor and give to the rich.
