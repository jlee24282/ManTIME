India sharply trimmed exposure to US government securities, lowering the holding to USD 118.7 billion in November 2016 -- the month which saw Donald Trump win the American Presidential polls. 

Asian economic majors Japan and China continued to be the two top holders of US government securities. While Japan's holding touched USD 1.11 trillion that of China was tad lower at USD 1.05 trillion last November. 
 
Latest data compiled by the US Treasury Department showed that India reduced its holding by nearly USD 5 billion to USD 118.7 at the end of the month. In October, it was USD 123 billion. 

In recent months the level of India's holding of these securities has been fluctuating and it stood at USD 117.2 billion in June last year. 

Among the BRIC nations, India has the third lowest exposure to American government securities after China and Brazil -- which saw its holding touching USD 258.3 billion in November. Russia's holding was at USD 86.6 billion. 

The US saw surprise victory of Republican candidate Donald Trump in the Presidential elections in November, and he took charge earlier this month. 

Meanwhile, official data revealed that the American economy, also the world's largest, saw its growth slowdown to 1.9 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2016. 

In the July-September period of last year, GDP had expanded 3.5 per cent. 

According to the US Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), the deceleration in real GDP in the fourth quarter reflected a downturn in exports, an acceleration in imports, a deceleration in personal consumption expenditures, and a downturn in federal government spending. 

However, these factors were partly offset by an upturn in residential fixed investment, an acceleration in private inventory investment, an upturn in state and local government spending, and an acceleration in non-residential fixed investment, BEA said while releasing GDP numbers on Friday.
