Said I would lose the primaries, then the general election. FAKE NEWS!&quot; Trump wrote on Twitter on Saturday, Efe news reported. He also referred to a post-election Times letter to readers in which it claimed it treated both Trump and Democratic Party rival Hillary Clinton (whom it endorsed) fairly but acknowledged underestimating the real-estate mogul&apos;s appeal among many Americans and vowed to &quot;rededicate ourselves to the fundamental mission of Times journalism.&quot;

&quot;Thr (sic) coverage about me in the @nytimes and the @washingtonpost gas (sic) been so false and angry that the times actually apologised to its dwindling subscribers and readers,&quot; Trump wrote. &quot;They got me wrong right from the beginning and still have not changed course, and never will. DISHONEST.&quot;

Trump did not indicate what sparked his latest tweet storm, although the Times and Post regularly post scathing editorials criticising Trump and his administration&apos;s policy proposals. The tweets also came a day after both dailies extensively covered his signing of executive orders that, among other things, suspended the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days and imposed a 90-day suspension on the issuance of visas to anyone planning to travel from seven Muslim-majority countries - Libya, Sudan, Somalia, Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Iran.

The New York Times fired back at Trump on Twitter.
