Naval historian James D. Hornfischer’s subjects are the battles of the U.S. Navy on and around the Japanese-held islands in the Pacific in 1944 and 1945, and the enormous buildup of ships, planes and amphibious craft right up to the end of the war on Sept. 2, 1945. The subtitle of &quot;The Fleet at Flood Tide&quot; is &quot;America at Total War in the Pacific, 1944-1945.&quot; 
   
A “flood tide” it was, with the construction through the end of 1944 of 24 aircraft carriers, eight battleships, 34 cruisers, 100 escort carriers, 1,117 auxiliaries, 293 destroyers, 503 destroyer escorts, 167 submarines, 2,489 patrol and mine craft, and 68,737 landing craft, plus the planes, ammunition and supplies and all the sailors, Marines and Coast Guard men to man and fight them. “Total war” indeed. 
   
While the Army under Gen. Douglas MacArthur supported by the Seventh Fleet took the war to the Japanese through the Philippines, Hornfischer’s main emphasis is the Central Islands campaigns of the Third Fleet commanded by Admiral William F. Halsey and the Fifth Fleet commanded by Admiral Raymond A. Spruance. I read a lot of military history, but it took me a long time to figure out that these were not separate fleets, but one fleet with alternating commanders. 
   
“In early May (Admiral) King and (Admiral) Nimitz met in San Francisco and devised a scheme of command whereby Spruance and Halsey would alternate as task force commanders, with (Rear Admiral) Mitscher and Rear Admiral John McCain as their respective underlings in command of the fast carrier task force. The rotation of Halsey and Spruance would ensure an ongoing study in contrasts along the doctrinal divide. When Spruance and Mitscher had command, their forces would be known as the Fifth Fleet and Task Force 58. When Halsey and McCain took over … the names would change to Third Fleet and Task Force 38.” 
   
The “doctrinal divide” was that Spruance used the carriers to protect the landing forces, while Halsey used them to pursue Japanese carriers. Spruance’s use of the carriers protected the landing in the Marianas chain of the islands of Guam, Saipan and Tinian. Halsey sent the carriers after Japanese carriers leaving the landing at Leyte in the Philippines unprotected allowing destroyer escorts and escort carriers to be destroyed when Japanese battleships came through a passage between islands left unprotected by Halsey’s Third Fleet. Heroically the sacrifices of four destroyer escorts and two escort carriers caused the Japanese to turn back before they got in among the landing forces. 
   
Hornfischer does not disguise his admiration for Spruance, who was not given a fifth star as a fleet admiral while Halsey received one. Hornfischer extensively covers Spruance and only has brief passages concerning Halsey and his battles. He writes of how the tenacious Japanese defense, literally to the death, of Iwo Jima and Okinawa convinced planners the invasion of Japan would be a costly and deadly undertaking. Everyone was relieved in 1944 when the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki on Aug. 6 and 9, respectively, ended the war. 
   
Hornfischer praises MacArthur’s control over post-war Japan, a nation that essentially switched from vicious war-making to acceptance of defeat and cooperation as the Americans provided food and assistance to a defeated people. The last two chapters are a good narrative of the post-war environment in Japan. There will never again be a navy with this many ships!
