<content type="str">Ipswich Town manager Mick McCarthy says there is no way Tom Lawrence will be joining Leeds United in the January transfer window. 

Lawrence is currently on a season-long loan with Ipswich from Premier League champions Leicester City but the 23-year-olds form has seen a number of clubs being linked with a January move for the forward, including Leeds in recent days. 

Sunderland, Newcastle, Derby, Cardiff and QPR have also been linked but McCarthy says, Lawrence, who netted his sixth goal in his last six games in the draw at Preston North End on Saturday, is not leaving Portman Road before the end of the season. 

&quot;I spoke to Leicester, I spoke to (Foxes director of football) Jon Rudkin the other day and as far as they`re concerned he`s with us,&quot; McCarthy told The Green Un . 

&quot;We`ve a commitment to them to the end of the season and they`ve a commitment to us. 

&quot;And the only way that can be broken if we say &apos;We don`t want Tom Lawrence`. Well that`s going to happen, isn`t it? 

&quot;There are clubs interested. I think Cardiff are interested, I was told that QPR are interested and I`ve also been told that Leeds were interested and I also spoke to Leeds and told them that he`s with us to the end of the season so they`re kind of p***ing in the wind. It`s not going to happen. 

&quot;Leicester haven`t received any bids. He`s with us. No way, any how will I be sanctioning Tom Lawrence going anywhere else. That categorical enough?&quot; 

With just over two-days remaining before the January transfer window closes, Leeds are still to add to the squad this month with only on loan Pablo Hernandez turning his loan deal with the club into a permanent move. 

Three players have left the club with midfielders Luke Murphy and Toumani Diagouraga leaving the club on loan and Alex Mowatt making a permanent switch to Barnsley on Friday. 

The sale of Mowatt to Barnsley had Leeds head coach Garry Monk telling the press ahead of the clash with Sutton United today that Leeds needed to bring in a couple of additions before the window closes at 11pm on Tuesday evening.
