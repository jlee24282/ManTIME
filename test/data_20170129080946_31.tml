<TEXT type="str">So of course, it&apos;s pretty shocking to hear that Kendall actually kept a huge secret from both her parents back during her days as a high-school student. 
 
Kendall, who was homeschooled for a majority of her teens, shared that the craziest thing she ever did &quot;during that time was fib to my parents about where I was at night&quot;. 
 
&quot;I&apos;ve grown up a lot since [high school], but I feel like, personality-wise at least, I was pretty similar to how I am now&quot;. The &quot;Keeping Up With the Kardashians&quot; star has opened up about feeling so mortified about telling mother Kris Jenner and her father Caitlyn - formerly Bruce Jenner - of her relationships because she thought she would get told of. &quot;Because my parents weren&apos;t very strict, Ky and I were super responsible&quot;, she wrote. The supermodel, now 21, took to her blog on Friday, January 27, to share the &quot;wildest thing&quot; she ever did in high school. &quot;We&apos;d invite a bunch of people over to hang out but it was never a rager, lol&quot;. They were OK with it if we went to parties because they knew we weren&apos;t getting into trouble-we never did anything that bad! 
 
&quot;My dad didn&apos;t really know I had a boyfriend!&quot; 
 
So if there was a mutual level of trust between Kendall and her parents, what could possibly be enough to make the model lie and what more importantly what was the lie about?</TEXT>
