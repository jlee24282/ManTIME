<content type="str">Everyone’s got questions about “Riverdale,” the new series, which premiered Thursday on The CW, based on the enduring characters from Archie Comics. Here, then, are the answers: 
 
QUESTION: Some people refer to this series as “Dawson’s Creek meets Twin Peaks.” Is that accurate? 
 
ANSWER : It isn’t just “some people” who say that, it’s Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa himself, a TV and comics veteran who is the Chief Creative Officer at Archie Comics and the creator of “Riverdale.” He told comicbookresources. com in 2014: “Something we talk a lot about is, ‘Imagine if Riverdale were like “Twin Peaks,” and was a really weird small town.’ But “Twin Peaks” had some very funny black humor stuff to it; obviously it was very serious as well. So that kind of balance is what we’re going to try to strike with the show.” 
 
QUESTION: So it’s going to be weird. 
 
ANSWER : A little, yeah. It begins with the death of Jason Blossom, the identical twin of Riverdale High’s Queen Bee and resident Mean Girl, Cheryl Blossom (Madelaine Petsch). Much like “Twin Peaks,” Riverdale is going to be the ’50s throwback town with dark secrets beneath the seemingly perfect surface. 
 
QUESTION: Why do that? Why change these wholesome characters from our youth? Is nothing sacred? 
 
ANSWER : Because the wholesome characters from our youth don’t sell well anymore. I read them until middle school and then quit, and I bet so did you. And younger kids today are playing video games, not reading Archies. Up until recently, the Archie titles were selling in the low thousands. 
 
So for the last few years, Archie Comics has been working to fix these problems by placing the gang in new situations — zombie-apocalypse-survivor Archie in “Afterlife with Archie,” grown-and-married Archie in “Life with Archie,” not-long-for-this-world Archie in “Archie vs. Predator.” The publisher assumed affection for the characters would carry readers through, and it worked. 
 
The core line of Archie books has been rebooted as well. The new titles still feature a group of basically good (and funny) kids, but the humor is more sophisticated and the approach more modern. They’re written and drawn by mostly A-list talent, and appeal to older readers as well as their children. 
 
“Riverdale” is just an extension of that game plan. 
 
QUESTION: Will I recognize any actors on this show? 
 
ANSWER : Oh, sure. Most of the principals are essentially newcomers, but you’ll see Luke Perry of “Beverly Hills 90201” as Archie’s dad, Fred Andrews. Molly Ringwald, who seemed to star in every movie John Hughes made in the ’80s, plays Archie’s mother, Mary Andrews. Madchen Amick, waitress Shelly Johnson at the Double R Diner in “Twin Peaks,” is Betty’s mother, Alice Cooper. Cole Sprouse, of “Grace Under Fire,” plays Jughead. Shannon Purser, who played Barb on “Stranger Things,” is “Big” Ethel Muggs. Sarah Habel, who plays Miss Grundy, was in “Hostel: Part III,” which makes her sorta famous, I guess. 
 
QUESTION: Wait, Sarah Habel is a hottie! Miss Grundy is supposed to be an old bat! 
 
ANSWER : Not in “Riverdale”! And she’s something of a twentysomething cougar, having seduced Archie into an illicit affair at the beginning of the show. 
 
QUESTION: Wait, there’s sex in Riverdale? That’s new. 
 
ANSWER: We still don’t see it in the comics. As to “Riverdale,” we shouldn’t be surprised. There was sex when we were in high school, too, and always has been. We just didn’t talk about it, and girls who got pregnant “went to visit their aunt” for six months. Welcome to the 21st century, where what goes on behind closed doors is discussed at Pop’s Choklit Shoppe. 
 
QUESTION: Speaking of sex, it looks like Betty and Veronica are kissing on one of the “Riverdale” trailers. I guess in the 21st century, they just don’t need Archie. 
 
ANSWER: Don’t worry, the central love triangle is still mostly intact on “Riverdale.” Betty Cooper (Lili Reinhart), who has been best friends with Archie (KJ Apa) since childhood, is wrestling with stronger feelings for him. That’s complicated by the arrival of Veronica Lodge (Camila Mendes), who snags Archie’s attention. 
 
But Reinhart told holly woodlife.com that the kiss on the trailer is a dodge. 
 
“They’re not romantically involved,” she said. And while there’s a lot of fan fiction out there about “Beronica,” and some fans would love to see them as a couple, Reinhart says “That’s not our show.” The girls are the best of friends, according to The CW description, and they’re unlikely to jeopardize that by fighting over a boy. 
 
QUESTION: So there’s no homosexuality on the show? 
 
ANSWER: I didn’t say that. Kevin Keller (Casey Cott) is an openly gay student at Riverdale High, as he is in the comics. And while it’s by no means definite, Entertainment Weekly describes Ethel as someone “who has a major crush on Jughead ... in the comics. But, on Riverdale, Ethel will find herself in a romantic relationship with someone very different.” It’s a good bet that someone is of a different gender. 
 
QUESTION: Or a different race? 
 
ANSWER: That’s possible, too. The original Archie cast was created in the 1940s, so by default they were all white. “Riverdale,” however, reflects the America of today. 
 
Veronica and her mother Hermione (Marisol Nichols) are Latina. It’s unclear who plays resident genius Dilton Doiley — both Daniel Yang and Major Curda have been mentioned — but he’s definitely Asian. Josie &amp; the Pussycats, which used to have one black member, is now entirely African-American (starring Ashleigh Murray as Josie, Hayley Law as Valerie and Asha Bromfield as Melody). Ross Butler, who plays Archie foil Reggie Mantle, is part Indonesian. 
 
QUESTION: Reggie, Dilton, Josie and the Pussycats — who else made the cut? 
 
ANSWER: Riverdale High’s coach Clayton (Colin Lawrence) appears, so maybe his son Chuck will, too. 
 
Marmaduke “Moose” Mason (Cody Kearsley) is on the show, but so far there’s no sign of girlfriend Midge Klump. Cheryl’s Mean Girl posse includes Ginger Lopez (Caitlin Mitchell-Markovitch) and Tina Patel (Olivia Ryan Stern). But probably the most interesting cast member could arrive from neighboring Greendale. 
 
QUESTION: You mean ... ? 
 
ANSWER: Yep. Rumor has it that Sabrina the Teenage Witch is due to appear in the last episode of what will hopefully be just the first season of “Riverdale.” Anybody know what Melissa Joan Hart is doing these days?</content>
