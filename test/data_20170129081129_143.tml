<content type="str">BEDFORD — Three employees hired to assist with projects made possible by federal Joint Chief’s Award funding have begun working in their new positions.

This group will focus on timber stand improvement and invasive species control. Funding for this work is expected to last for the next year and a half, after which these employees may transition to different responsibilities.

The Joint Chief’s Project began in 2016 when Chiefs of the Forest Service and Natural Resource Conservation Service awarded the agencies in southern Indiana $1 million for special projects.

David Solomon will work primarily out of the Bedford office of the Hoosier National Forest. Solomon earned a bachelor’s degree from Florida State in creative writing. Since graduation, he has honed his plant skills while working for both the National Park Service and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. He also spent a season working for the Missouri Department of Natural Resources. He is living in Bedford.

Robby Stenson has worked two seasons as a seasonal employee for the Tell City District of the Hoosier National Forest and will move into a new area of work. Stenson is originally from Thief River Falls, Minnesota. He graduated from the University of Minnesota Duluth with a bachelor’s degree in recreation management and outdoor education.

Katie Slezak came to Indiana from Utah, where she had worked with the AmeriCorps doing environmental education. A native of Pennsylvania, Slezak has experience working with invasive species control with Toledo Metro Parks. Slezak earned a bachelor’s degree in environmental science from Bowling Green State University in Ohio.

Stenson and Slezak are both residing in Tell City.</content>
