<TEXT type="str">Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson today issued the following statement: 
 
&quot;The President&apos;s executive order on immigration is un-American and unconstitutional. 
 
&quot;My team and I are working this weekend to explore our options to oppose this illegal action. 
 
&quot;The rule of law applies to everyone — including President Trump — and I will use the authority of my office to hold him accountable to it.&quot;
