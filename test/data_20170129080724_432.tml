<TEXT type="str">Adam Lallana has agreed a new four-year deal to remain at Liverpool. 

Express Sport understands the winger will pocket £120,000 a week on his new contract after committing his future to the Merseyside outfit.

Jurgen Klopp is keen to use the winger as part of his plans going forward and Lallana&apos;s new deal follows Philippe Coutinho and Joe Gomez signing new contracts earlier this week.

Liverpool are hoping to sign Roma star Leandro Paredes before the transfer window shuts, according to reports.
