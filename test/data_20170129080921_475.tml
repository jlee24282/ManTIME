<TITLE>''Smile more, score more,'' is Modi's mantra to tense students</TITLE>
<TEXT>In the prevailing exam time tension, Prime Minister Narendra Modi today did some pep talk with students, advising them to be relaxed and take exams as pleasure not a pressure. ''Smile more and score more'' was his mantra given in his 'Mann Ki Baat' monthly radio programme. The Prime Minister also underscored that passing or failing in exams was not the only measure of success and failure in life, as life was much wider things that could not be measured by the marks one gets in exams. In this context he gave the example of former president Dr APJ Abdul Kalam who failed in his test for entry into Air Force. ''Had Dr Kalam succeeded in that exam, the country would not have got such a great scientist,'' he said. Mr Modi exhorted students to take exams in a festive spirit. ''Festivals bring out the best in you, so if you take exam as celebration not as a headache it will bring out the best in you,'' he said The Prime Minister also had a word of caution for parents who expect too much from their children and burden them to live up to that. He advised parents to create a relaxed atmosphere at home so that their children could prepare for exams without any tension. More UNI NAZ SHS ADG 12</TEXT>
