<content type="str">Days after Cornwall Council launched its bid to see Truro voted European Capital of Culture for 2023 a group is hoping to help raise its profile as a cultural destination for tourists thanks to a new pot of cash from central Government. 

Cornwall 365 has secured the £150,000 grant from the Arts Council England and tourist board VisitEngland to enable arts and culture organisations to work better with the tourism sector and bring cultural visitors to the Duchy.

It is the second Cornish group to benefit from the national £3.2 million cash pot, with The Isles of Scilly also receiving £147,600 to increase cultural tourism there. Sixteen groups and projects in England have shared the funds. The Isles of Scilly have also received funding form the Arts Council England to promote cultural tourism.

Cornwall 365 bosses said the funding will be used to support young people to be cultural ambassadors, help build a distinctive events programme, and create a new travel app for Cornwall.

Fiona Wotton, director of Cornwall 365, said: &quot;Tourism and the creative industries are very significant sectors in the Cornish economy and by working in partnership we are connecting new audiences with our year-round cultural experiences, creating economic value and celebrating our distinctive and fascinating region.&quot; Cornwall 365 is a network of leading cultural and tourism organisations and since its launch in 2014, has been helping locals and visitors to experience a deeper sense of the region, enhancing their bond with the place and putting culture at the heart of Cornwall&apos;s visitor economies.

This has increased audiences and footfall, added economic value and ensured visitors return to the area. 

Cornwall 365 has also run a series of sessions encouraging people in the tourism sector to become &apos;cultural ambassadors&apos;. These developed knowledge of what there was to do, see and experience in Cornwall and helped tourism industry workers offer &quot;rich, bespoke, compelling cultural adventures, enhancing the experience for their customers and encouraging them to return&quot;.

Can Truro achieve European Capital of Culture status by 2023? 

Phil Gibby, area director for Arts Council England, said: &quot;This is a fantastic result for Cornwall&apos;s cultural, destination and tourism organisations. The investment will help position culture as a significant part of the visitor offering, helping to drive growth of the visitor economy and allowing more people to experience Cornwall&apos;s exciting arts and culture.&quot;

The grants are being made through Cultural Destinations, an initiative developed by the Arts Council as a result of a three year partnership with VisitEngland. More Cornwall News</content>
