<TEXT type="str">London : Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger praised the mental strength and resilience of Danny Welbeck after the England forward scored twice on his first start since suffering a serious knee injury in May during a 5-0 FA Cup thrashing of Southampton. 
 
Welbeck followed his first-half double at St Mary&apos;s on Saturday with an assist for former Saints star Theo Walcott, who completed his hat-trick in the second half of a comfortable fourth-round win for the Gunners over their Premier League rivals.

Wenger was pleasantly surprised by the display of former Manchester United striker Welbeck, making his first start since a 2-2 draw away to Manchester City in May. 
 
&quot;I didn&apos;t expect him to be at that level,&quot; said veteran French manager Wenger. &quot;I knew that he had worked very hard but you never know how much efficiency there could be to transfer that into a competitive game. 
 
&quot;So it was great to see that he hasn&apos;t lost his runs or his finishing and shows as well that when you are able to channel that frustration at not playing into efficiency, that&apos;s a special guy.&quot; 
 
Wenger added: &quot;You have always two fears, the first is that it takes him too long to get his decision-making (back) and secondly that the player is scared to go into any contact. So when he made the runs and was fighting with the defender, that was a very important moment for me.&quot; 
 
The injury had been Welbeck&apos;s second affecting the same knee since joining Arsenal in 2014 and Wenger was relieved the player had not shown any psychological ill-effects. 
 
&apos;Delighted&apos; 
 
&quot;He worked very hard,&quot; Wenger said of the 26-year-old Welbeck. &quot;He went through some moments of very deep disappointment when he had the setback and we had to go in again in the knee, when you are a professional football player that is very difficult. But after the first disappointment he worked even harder. 
 
&quot;He is highly respected inside the club because he has shown so much dedication and never moaned. He has worked very hard and everybody is delighted for him.&quot; 
 
But even Wenger had his doubts over whether Welbeck would come back a second time. &quot;You wonder and I wondered,&quot; he admitted. 
 
The dominant overall display of his team, which featured encouraging performances from Jeff Reine-Adelaide and Ainsley Maitland-Niles in midfield, meant Wenger could relax in the directors&apos; box during the first game of his four-match touchline ban for pushing fourth official Anthony Taylor during the 2-1 league victory over Burnley on January 22. 
 
&quot;Yes, it was pleasant to watch,&quot; he said. &quot;We had individually strong performances, and collectively as well. It was a good opportunity to see some players who came back like Welbeck and see some young players in midfield who did very well.&quot; 
 
Both managers had made 10 changes to the teams that had played their previous matches but Saints&apos; young side was no match for Arsenal&apos;s more experienced XI. 
 
But with his side reaching a Wembley final by beating Liverpool in the last four of the League Cup at Anfield in midweek, Southampton manager Claude Puel insisted he had little choice over his team selection. 
 
&quot;It was difficult today,&quot; said Puel, a former protege of compatriot Wenger. &quot;At the start the players were nervous and every situation was difficult,&quot; the Frenchman added. 
 
&quot;The second half was better but without reward. 
 
&quot;Before the game we had nine players not available and to play always the same players is not possible. 
 
&quot;Of course I&apos;m disappointed for the young players, but it&apos;s a good lesson for the future.&quot;</TEXT>
