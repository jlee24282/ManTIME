<TITLE>Live updates: This is a peoples alliance, says Akhilesh on SP-Congress merger</TITLE>
<TEXT>Out of the 403 assembly seats in Uttar Pradesh, Congress will be contesting in 105 and SP in the rest of 298 seats. Days after stitching up an electoral alliance for the upcoming Uttar Pradesh assembly polls, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi and Samajwadi party president Akhilesh Yadav arrived in Lucknow for a joint press conference on Sunday. This will be followed by a joint road show in the state capital. The meeting also assumes significance as this would be the maiden outing of the two leaders since reaching a seat-sharing agreement for the polls, which starts from February 11. Out of the 403 assembly seats, Congress will be contesting in 105 and SP the rest of 298 seats. With an aim to tell people that the two parties were their choice in the elections, Rahul and Akhilesh would launch a poll campaign with a tagline  UP ko ye saath pasand hai (UP relishes this alliance). The duo are expected to send out a strong message to party cadres from both sides, urging them to work together to ensure the defeat of BJP and BSP.
