The Panthers (10-11, 5-5) lost their first five Missouri Valley Conference games but now have won five in a row. 
 
Jeremy Morgan, making 8 of 10 free throws, scored 16 points, and Bennett Koch also scored 16 points, on 7-of-8 shooting, for Northern Iowa, which made 20 of 27 free throws to 7 of 10 for the Bulldogs. 
 
Ore Arogundade had three 3-pointers and 15 points to lead the Bulldogs (7-15, 5-5), who had a five-game home winning streak snapped. 
 
An 8-0 run with a 3-pointer from Carlson and a basket and 3-pointer from Dubuque Senior grad Luke McDonnell gave the Panthers the lead for good at 44-37 with 10:45 left. Arogundade made a 3-pointer to cut the lead to four with just under eight minutes left but Northern Iowa answered with a 12-5 run to lead by 11 and Drake wouldn’t get closer than eight.</TEXT>
