<TEXT type="str">KABUL， Jan. 29 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan security forces have destroyed six heroin labs， as the war-hit country struggled to fight the narcotics， said Defense Ministry on Sunday.

The Afghan National Army&apos;s Special Forces carried out operations in Sangin and Naw Zad districts of southern Helmand province on Friday， destroying six heroin factories， it said in a statement posted on the ministry&apos;s website.

Among the drugs and materials， 1，000 kg of morphine， over 16，000 kg of ammonium chloride， 277 barrels of a chemical substance which has been used in making heroin， were also destroyed， the statement added.

&quot;One militant was killed and two others wounded as a result of the raids， which were conducted on confirmed tip-offs， and the security force also destroyed four vehicles， three motorcycles and six weighing scales，&quot; the statement noted.
