<content type="str">A rogue woman lived like a Washington elite for a day by using counterfeit credentials to impersonate a congressman&apos;s wife during a Republican retreat in which President Donald Trump spoke. 
 
The anonymous woman snuck into the GOP Retreat in Philadelphia on January 26 where President Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and British Prime Minister Theresa May met with lawmakers. 
 
The shocking security breach was announced by the president of the Congressional Institute, Mark Strand according to CNN.  
 
During the Congress of Tomorrow Republican Member Retreat, thousands of protesters gathered outside the Loews Hotel.

Since she was masquerading as a spouse, the trespasser would not have been invited to policy sessions. It is not known if she weaseled her way in anyway.  
 
But she may have had the chance to have lunch with President Trump or meet with Vice President Pence. 
 
Strand said in a letter: &apos;The Congressional Institute is continuing to investigate this breach in order to fully understand how it happened and to ensure it does not happen again.&apos; 
 
The woman may have responsible for the leaking of a private meeting about GOP members discussing stripping down the Affordable Care Act.

People in the sessions were reportedly concerned about the market in response to the fallout from dismantling the health policy.  
 
 The audio, obtained by the Washington Post, features members of the GOP questioning how to replace the Affordable Care Act without disrupting the health insurance market or increasing the financial burden on middle-class families. 
 
Some warned against settling for a &apos;quick fix&apos; and worried about having to carry the new law&apos;s legacy. &apos;That&apos;s going to be called Trumpcare. Republicans will own that lock, stock and barrel,&apos; Representative Tom McClintock said. 
 
One senator also told his fellow GOP lawmakers they should not use the new healthcare law to defund Planned Parenthood, warning it would amount to &apos;walking into a gigantic political trap&apos;.   
 
The recording, sent from an anonymous email address, came from a closed-door meeting during this week&apos;s Republican congressional retreat in Philadelphia. All lawmakers quoted by the Washington Post confirmed their remarks to the newspaper either themselves or through their offices.  
 
Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, Republican Representative from Washington and the chair of the House GOP conference that hosts the event, told CNN  in a statement, &apos;leaks from internal member discussions are unacceptable.&apos; 
 
She continued by saying the Congressional Institute is working with Capitol Police to find the culprit.  
 
Members of Capitol Police were in the room to make sure press did not roam where they were not welcome. A small group was escorted by security to listen to Trump&apos;s speeches.  </content>
