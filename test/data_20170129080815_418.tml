It was known as “The Town Too Tough to Die,” but Tombstone, Ariz., made its bones through an infamous gunfight that has been glorified for decades through tall tales and cinema. 
And although fewer than 2,000 people call the dusty, Old West town in southeastern Arizona home, thousands of folks still flock to the area to visit the streets where Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday and Ike Clanton – not to mention Val Kilmer, Kurt Russell and Kevin Costner – ambled, packing their six-shooters and shotguns. 
 
The shootout at the OK Corral, pitting the Earps and Holliday against the Clantons and their followers, was, in reality, a brief skirmish that actually occurred in a nearby alley and left Billy Clanton and brothers Tom and Frank McLaury dead and several others wounded.

Still, the corral ( ok-corral.com ), remains and is open to visitors, with life-size cutouts placed in the approximate spots as detailed in a map drawn by Earp depicts. Daily re-enactments depict the drama as it unfolds.

And the neighboring Historama, through the voice of Vincent Price, tells the Tombstone tale from the town’s founding in connection with a major silver strike, through the various gunfights, a fire that nearly leveled the town and the assassination of Morgan Earp. Geronimo and his Chiricahua band of Apaches frequented the nearby mountains.

Although it was the shootout that gave Tombstone its everlasting fame or infamy, it was the lure of silver that first attracted the miners, then the bandits and desperadoes to the town. 
 
A great way to see how it all started is a trip deep into the Good Enough Mine ( goodenoughmine.com ). 
 
The oldest of the historic sites in Tombstone, the mine is the original one where Ed Schieffelin discovered silver in the late 1870s. There are two tours, one of which lasts about 45 minutes and takes visitors down 58 steep steps into a big room where the first big vein was discovered, mine owner Shirley Dejournett said.

A longer tour, which requires reservations, lasts about 2½ hours and drops more than 500 feet, approaching the water table, she said. 
 
It’s a much more compelling, extreme trip, covering about a half-mile, with carved rooms 750 long with ceilings 40 feet tall and 40 feet wide, Dejournett said. 
 
“This is a physically challenging tour,” she said. “But the history and the geology you’ll see are more than worth the effort.” 
 
Although the town has a deservedly rough-and-tumble reputation, there’s an artistic side to it as well, which can be seen in the Rose Tree Museum ( tombstonerosetree.com ).

The museum is home to what’s called the world’s largest rose tree, a Scottish white Lady Banksia rose planted in 1885. In 1937, Robert Ripley wrote about it in his syndicated column,”Believe It or Not.”

The tree now covers about 5,000 square feet and its perfume can be smelled several blocks away. 
 
The Tombstone Courthouse State Historic Park, built in 1882 in the shape of a Roman cross, is a 12,000-square-foot museum that tells the history of the area and includes such interesting memorabilia as a tax license for operating a brothel and an invitation to a hanging. 
 
The courtyard includes a replica of a gallows where five men were hung in 1884 for killing four people during a robbery in nearby Bisbee. 
 
The five, as well as those killed in the shootout, are among the many notorious people buried on the outskirts of town in Boot Hill Cemetery, which also is open to the public. 
 
And with a name like Tombstone, it’s fitting that the town’s newspaper is called the Epitaph, started by its first mayor, John Clum. Its offices are also a museum and a copy of the paper’s original story on the famous shootout is on display. A local edition of the paper has been published biweekly by the University of Arizona journalism department since 1975. 
 
The newspaper’s original Washington hand press is also on display, and in the back shop, composing stones, linotype machines, type cases, and interpretive displays describe how the Epitaph did business.</content>
