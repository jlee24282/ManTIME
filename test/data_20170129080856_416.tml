<TEXT type="str">A report claims recordings of conversations detail intentions to discredit opposition parties in a campaign costing R50 million. 

JOHANNESBURG – The City Press has revealed that secret recordings of an African National Congress (ANC) meeting show exactly who was involved in the war room allegedly set up to discredit other parties ahead of the 2016 local government elections.

Public relations expert Sihle Bolani has turned to the courts saying she was not paid for helping constitute the campaign.

This led to ANC general manager Ignatius Jacobs and Shaka Sisulu being implicated in establishing the war room, a claim Sisulu has denied.

The newspaper is reporting that recordings of a conversation between Jacobs, Bolani and Joseph Nkadimeng detail the intention to discredit opposition parties in a campaign costing R50 million.

A TV broadcast in the background confirms the date of a meeting at Luthuli House in November.

The paper says the recordings indicate Bolani was not to report to Luthuli House but directly to Sisulu and Nkadimeng. 

However, the recordings show there was a problem with raising the required funding.

Jacobs repeatedly asked for updated reports from Bolani. 

Questions have been asked about ANC members’ knowledge of the war room and to what extent it was supported.</TEXT>
