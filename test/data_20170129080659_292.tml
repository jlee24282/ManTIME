<TEXT type="str">RIO DE JANEIRO, Jan. 29 (Xinhua) -- Vasco da Gama have secured a one-year loan deal with Fiorentina left-back Gilberto.

The 23-year-old will undergo a medical at Vasco&apos;s Sao Januario headquarters in Rio de Janeiro this week, according to the Uol news outlet, which cited an unnamed Fiorentina official.

Capped 11 times for Brazil at under-21 level, Gilberto joined Fiorentina in 2015 from Rio de Janeiro club Botafogo.

But he made just five appearances for the Italian Serie A side before being loaned to local rivals Hellas Verona.

Vasco earned promotion to Brazil&apos;s top flight after finishing third in the Serie B last year.
