<TEXT>Comments(0)

Knops had lost his place in the starting line up to left back Scott Tanser who made his Vale debut after signing from Rochdale on Friday on a deal until the end of the season.

JJ Hooper restored Vale's lead on 59 minutes but goals from Ivan Toney, on 62, and Tom Hopper, on 71 minutes, condemned Vale to a 3-2 defeat which sends them down three places to 18 th .
