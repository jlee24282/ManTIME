<TITLE>Crosswalk buttons difficult to access</TITLE>
<TEXT>ONTARIO  Some people have been making their way over 2-feet or higher snow- and ice-covered berms that are currently engulfing crosswalk buttons and their respective poles at intersections throughout the Western Treasure Valley. Still, others have been seen ditching the effort, altogether. The berms were made taller this week in some areas around Ontario such as this intersection on the corner of Southwest Fourth Avenue and Southwest Fouth Street. 
   
When Oregon Department of Transportation maintenance crews cleared the right-hand lanes of several feet of packed snow and ice along Fourth and Idaho avenues this week, the city had to make the decision between road and sidewalk, said City Manager Adam Brown in an email to the Argus. 
   
We made a decision that the roadway and bike lane were more valuable.Pedestrians were already having trouble on the sidewalk, he said. Businesses were having trouble keeping up with it, and the longer they waited, the harder it got. 
   
Pointing out that people had been walking in the middle of the road prior to ODOT crews coming to town, officials made a choice to open up the traffic lanes, Brown said. 
   
As for those sidewalks that are now buried in feet of snow and ice from passing ODOT crews clearing away the right-hand lanes with tractors, plows and gigantic snowblowers, the city is going to be lenient. 
   
We will not be enforcing the sidewalk ordinance along Fourth Avenue, Brown said. We will not be attempting to clean them ourselves either. 
   
He recommends pedestrians use alternative routes, such as those roads a block to the north or south of Fourth Avenue. 
   
Brown did not say wether the city intends to haul off any snow, but now that storm drains are clear it may not be necessary. 
   
We are going to have to wait for the snow to melt, he said. 
   
And cold temperatures have prevented much of that so far, but nearly 40 to 50 percent of the citys storm drains have now been cleared, according to Brown. 
   
All the plowing and snowfall, however, have created some hazards, including ruptures of natural gas meters and lines. The amount of snow has also made them difficult to locate in the case of emergencies, a news release from the City of Ontario states. 
   
Please take extra care while removing the snow and in the event a meter is hit, call according to the release. For blowing gas, dial 911, it states, and for other natural gas related issues, call (888) 522-113</TEXT>
