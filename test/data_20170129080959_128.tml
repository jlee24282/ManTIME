He married the love of his life, Alta Hilz, from Beulah, on March 1, 1953. For their first year, they lived north of Hazen and worked on the family farm before moving to their own farm south of Bismarck, near Emmons County. The couple raised two sons, Ross and Randy. 
   
Larry loved to plant trees and planted all the trees around his farm. He and his wife played countless games of pinochle with their friends and neighbors. Larry retired from his farm and dairy operation in 1982, when he and his wife began to travel and sell many different items. He loved to talk, joke around and sell many different items at swap meets and state fairs.

He is grandpa to two loving granddaughters, Amber (Mike) Erickson, West Bend, Wis., and Holly (Aaron) Folk, Hazen, and four great-grandchildren, Alice and Logan Erickson, Carter Volk, and Teagan Folk; two brothers, Clayton Schramm and Lester (Virginia) Schramm; his sister, JoAnn (Leonard) Becker, all of Bismarck; and many nephews and nieces.
