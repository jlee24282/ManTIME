<content type="str">Nilay Patel writes:The federal court for the Eastern District of New York issued an emergency stay halting President Donald Trump’s executive order banning entry to the US from seven majority-Muslim countries tonight, following widespread protests at airports around the country.The court ruled on a habeas corpus petition filed by the ACLU on behalf of Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, who were denied entry to the US upon landing at JFK airport in New York City and detained indefinitely by Customs and Border Patrol. Darweesh spent a decade working for the United States military in Iraq as an interpreter and engineer and had been granted an entry visa after background checks; Alshawi had been granted a visa in order to join his wife and son who are already permanent residents of the US after their similar service with the US military.xJudge: &quot;Class is pretty well defined as outline in the papers - otherwise would be reviewing stays for a hundred people&quot; so stay is national— Jackie Vimo January 29, 2017x4 factors have been met: Irreparable harm established, likelihood of success on merits, no harm to govt. Likelihood of class cert.— Jackie Vimo January 29, 2017UPDATE: From Shane Savitsky:What we know right now…The executive order is now frozen until the case can briefed, probably in February.No one who is currently being held can be sent back to their country of origin, but whether they will be released is unclear.The judge ordered the federal government to provide a list of all people currently held in detention.According to the ACLU&apos;s lawyer, there still can be no new arrivals from countries under the ban, but the ACLU — and other organizations — are working to file additional suits to roll back other portions of the order.</content>
