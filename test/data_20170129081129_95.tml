<content type="str">Oscar-nominated Canadian filmmaker Denis Villeneuve spoke Saturday of his exasperation at the Academy overlooking Amy Adams&apos;s acclaimed performance in sci-fi thriller &quot;Arrival.&quot; 

The alien invasion drama, re-released in US theaters this week, has eight nominations for February&apos;s Oscars, including for best film and for Villeneuve&apos;s direction. 

But Adams, widely expected to get a sixth Oscar nomination for &quot;Arrival&quot; -- and perhaps another for &quot;Nocturnal Animals&quot; -- was left off the list, leaving the trade press and many leading industry figures bewildered. 

&quot;I was very disappointed, because she is the soul of the movie. She was my biggest ally. She gave everything, she gave a tremendous, very complex performance,&quot; Villeneuve, 49, told AFP at the Producers Guild Awards (PGAs) in Beverly Hills. 

Taking its cue from classics such as &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot; (1977) and &quot;Contact&quot; (1997), &quot;Arrival&quot; was filmed in Villeneuve&apos;s native Quebec for a relatively small $50 million. 

Adams, 42, was universally lauded for her portrayal of Louise Banks, a linguist enlisted by the army after alien pods pop up worldwide, to help figure out what their occupants want. 

The picture pairs Adams with fellow &quot;American Hustle&quot; star Jeremy Renner, playing against type as a shy, soft-spoken mathematician. 

The best actress Oscar nominations went to Emma Stone (&quot;La La Land&quot;), Natalie Portman (&quot;Jackie&quot;), Ruth Negga (&quot;Loving&quot;), Isabelle Huppert (&quot;Elle&quot;) and Meryl Streep (&quot;Florence Foster Jenkins&quot;). 

Villeneuve told AFP he had spoken to Adams several times since the nominations and that she had been nothing but magnanimous. 

&quot;Amy Adams is the incarnation of grace,&quot; said the director, who made &quot;Sicario&quot; (2015) and has just finished filming the much-anticipated sequel to iconic sci-fi favorite &quot;Blade Runner.&quot; 

&quot;She just said to me, &apos;Danny -- it&apos;s all right. The movie is nominated, you are nominated, it&apos;s all good. Don&apos;t think about it, please just celebrate.&apos;&quot; 

&quot;Arrival&quot; was competing for best film at the PGAs alongside &quot;Deadpool,&quot; &quot;Fences,&quot; &quot;Hacksaw Ridge,&quot; &quot;Hell or High Water,&quot; &quot;Hidden Figures,&quot; &quot;La La Land,&quot; &quot;Lion,&quot; &quot;Manchester by the Sea&quot; and &quot;Moonlight.&quot; 

&quot;Blade Runner 2049&quot; -- which comes out in October, some 35 years after the cult neo-noir original -- sees Harrison Ford reprising his role as Rick Deckard, this time opposite Ryan Gosling. 

&quot;It was like the most powerful and intense cinematic experience of my life. It&apos;s tough to talk about it -- I&apos;m still in it -- but it was a very powerful experience,&quot; Villeneuve told AFP. 

Describing his 74-year-old star as his &quot;childhood hero,&quot; he admitted to being in awe of Ford when filming began last summer in Budapest, Hungary. 

&quot;A good thing is that Harrison is a very humble, very funny, generous human being. He broke the ice,&quot; Villeneuve said.</content>
