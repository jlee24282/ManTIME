Nicholls was recruited by the band after Osborne was sacked in 1979 having played for five years with previous band Quartz.

He first appeared on 1980 LP Heaven and Hell and finally became an "official" member in 1985. 

He held this title until Osbourne's return in 1996 and was permanently replaced by keyboardist Adam Wakeman in 2004.

Black Sabbath was instrumental in creating heavy metal in the early 1970s with dark and high-volume guitars coupled with a keen interest in the occult.

Osbourne went on to a successful career as a solo artist famous for sensational shows.</TEXT>
