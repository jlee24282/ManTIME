Ten people were injured during a shooting at a party in Brownsville, Tennessee, on Friday night.

According to Brownsville Mayor Bill Rawls, there was a high school party at the National Guard Armory, located in the 200 block of Morgan Street. During the party, a fight broke out and someone started shooting around 11:45 p.m.

Rawls said the shooter came from Jackson, Tennessee. He says the party was unsanctioned.

Originally, reports said that eight teens were injured, but Tennessee Bureau of Investigation said that number is actually 10, ranging in ages from child to young adult.

Two people were taken to the hospital in Memphis and are being treated with non-life threatening injuries. Another victim was taken to the hospital in Jackson. The other seven were either treated and released or are in the process of being released.

Brownsville resident Tracie Williams was taken back by the news.

&quot;The first thing that went through my mind was, OK this is Brownsville, this is not Atlanta. This is not New York, this is Brownsville, and I was just shocked that something like that would happen here,&quot; Williams said.

Katlyn Day’s cousin was one of about 100 people at the party. She is thankful that everyone is expected to be OK.

“He says he&apos;s probably going to be scarred for his whole life,” Day said of her cousin.

Her cousin told her that the party turned into pandemonium when the fist fight turned even more violent.

“All of a sudden they started hearing gunshots,” Day said. “And they told everybody to get out or to duck down. Most people ran trying to save themselves from the bullets. But most people ran out the door to get their car.”

Knowing the shooter was from Jackson is something that made Williams feel a bit less uneasy.

“It made me feel good to know, OK, at least it wasn&apos;t anyone from Brownsville doing that. So that made me feel a little bit better,” Williams said.

TBI is helping solve the case.

Rawls says they have a SOS (Save Our Streets) initiative for these types of situations and working hard to curb crime.
