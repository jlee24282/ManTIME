<TEXT type="str">Chantel Osahor would like to clear up one misconception about her body. She’s not 6-foot-2, as the University of Washington lists her. 
 
“Without shoes, I’m 5-11¾,” she said in a phone interview. “With shoes, maybe 6-1.” 
 
Still, Osahor is an imposing figure on the basketball court. She is a very large woman with a very large game. While the Huskies have the nation’s leading scorer, senior guard Kelsey Plum, who averages 30.7 points, the team also revolves around Osahor, the nation’s leading rebounder. 
 
In a game against Washington State last week, she grabbed a Pac-12-record 30 rebounds. She’s averaging 14.5 a game; the next best rebounder in the country gets two fewer per game. She’s also averaging 15.5 points. 
 
“She’s a unique player,” Stanford head coach Tara VanDerveer said. “A lot of teams learn the hard way: Don’t let the frame fool you. On top of being very physical, she’s a very cerebral player. She has a nose for the ball and great hands. She just rips the ball. People don’t take it away from her.” 
 
The No. 10 Cardinal (18-3 overall) will tangle with her and the No. 7 Huskies (20-2) at 5 p.m. Sunday in Seattle. Both teams are tied with Oregon State for first place in the Pac-12 at 8-1. 
 
Opponents tend to underestimate Osahor because of her girth, but as Stanford forward/center Erica McCall says, “Then she makes one move, and they know better. She has so much strength, and she has quick feet.” 
 
Plum and Osahor carried the Huskies to the Final Four last season, and it was Osahor, not Plum, who was the MVP of the Lexington Regional. In those games, Osahor had 19 points and 17 rebounds against Kentucky, and 24 points and 18 rebounds in a win over Stanford. 
 
Over the past couple of years, she has become a national role model for large girls who had rarely seen others with their body type be so successful. “I hear from a lot of parents of kids who have my body frame,” she said. “I think it just shows people can be successful if they work hard.” 
 
She thinks rebounding is not just a skill but an art. 
 
“A good rebounder knows where the ball is going to go,” she said. “I say it is an art. It’s something you’ve got to do to get on the offensive end. I wouldn’t say it’s dirty work. But it’s something that should be more glorified than it is.” 
 
Being wide “helps me, but I have good hands too. There are people who can jump over you. I’m a lot more agile and quicker than people think.” 
 
Although her percentage isn’t great, she has hit 108 three-point shots in her career despite shooting completely flat-footed. She is also an excellent passer. She had 10 assists in one game and nine in another this season. 
 
“I try to see stuff before it happens,” Osahor said. “I’ve been like that since I was 9 years old. I played with the same girls (on the Arizona Warriors club team) for a long time, so we knew what each other would do. Me and Plum have that too.” 
 
Huskies coach Mike Neighbors said he discovered her at St. Mary’s High School in Phoenix because he went to the wrong gym and UW was the only team actively recruiting her. “We beat absolutely zero people to get her,” he said. 
 
Not true, Osahor says. “My high school won a national championship my junior year,” she said. “Washington wasn’t the only school. Utah was late coming after me, but I was already leaning to Washington.” 
 
Her career in Seattle took a while to get going. During Osahor’s freshman year, she was hit by a car while riding her bike on campus just before the first scrimmage in late October. She injured her shoulder and was out a month. Shortly after she returned to action, she was diagnosed with a stress fracture in her foot. She missed 24 games in all as a freshman. 
 
You would have to say she has made up for lost time.
