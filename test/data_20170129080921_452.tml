German Chancellor Angela Merkel and US President Donald Trump have agreed on the fundamental importance of the NATO alliance and that all NATO members must pay a fair share for their collective security. 

Trump and Merkel spoke by telephone on Saturday about issues including the Middle East, North Africa, their ties to Russia and the conflict in eastern Ukraine, a German government spokesman said, in a statement approved by both countries. 

He said Merkel and Trump agreed to expand their co-operation in combating terrorism and militancy. 

Trump accepted Merkel&apos;s invitation to attend a summit of G20 industrialised countries in Hamburg in July, and said he looked forward to welcoming Merkel to Washington soon.</TEXT>
