Soccer lovers in Kwazakhele and surrounding areas will soon be treated to top-class Premier Soccer League matches on their doorstep. Chippa United plan to bring two of their home fixtures to Wolfson Stadium.

The Port Elizabeth-based side will play Ajax Cape Town and their last home game for the season against Supersport United at the stadium. 

Wolfson hosted two of Chippa’s home league fixtures last season with games featuring Maritzburg United and Platinum Stars. 

It has also hosted an international friendly match between the Chilli Boys and Wolfsburg. 

Chippa United chief operations officer, Lukhanyo Mzinzi said taking some of their small home league fixtures to the Kwazakhele stadium had been part of their relocation contract from the start. 

However, the stadium had not been in good shape to host PSL matches and had also been used by rugby and football clubs. 

“They [the municipality] have closed the stadium over the past few years,” Mzinzi said. 

“We have played a few games and even hosted an international friendly against Wolfsburg, but the pitch condition was not perfect. 

“Now the municipality has done a good job with the stadium. They have built world-class dressing rooms, they have worked on the pitch and they have improved certain aspects that were requested by the PSL. There is still more to do, but the stadium is up to PSL standard.” 

Before getting the thumbs-up from the PSL the stadium had needed certain improvements and the municipality had been hard at work to make sure the stadium was in top condition, he said. 

The only issue still outstanding is the lights. They do not conform to PSL standards so the stadium can only accommodate day-time matches. 

“The municipality has committed to sort out the lights issue in the next financial year. Most of our home fixtures are played at night and Wolfson does not yet have PSL-standard lights,” Mzinzi said. 

“However, we are glad to announce that there are two games that we are taking to the stadium. 

“The Ajax Cape Town and Supersport United matches will be played at Wolfson later in the season. 

“We hope that those two games will draw numbers of spectators and also allow our people in the area to celebrate Chippa United.</content>
