HUNTINGTON - Freshman Safiyyah Mitchell of Huntington picked up her first collegiate win Saturday, hitting the tape first in the 60-meter hurdles (8.64 seconds) to give Marshall its one win in the Thundering Herd Invitational at the Jeff Small Track at the Chris Cline Athletic Complex. 
   
The Thundering Herd also had a school-record performance and several top-20 finishes. Senior Danielle Wright finished fifth in the 60-meter hurdles finals (8.90). 
   
Senior Andrea Porter finished 15th overall in the mile, but her time of 5:06.99 is a school record. Marian Brooks set the mark (5:07.23) in 1997. That gives Marshall eighth athletes who have tied for broken school records. 
   
In the triple jump, Antonique Butler took second 40 feet, 4.25 inches (12.30m). Melany Belot placed fifth (11.91m) and freshman Denisha West seventh (11.71m). 
   
Kametra Byrd placed seventh in the 60 meters (7.71) and Hope Julmiste eighth (7.72). In the shot put, Elena Marchand placed eighth (14.20m), Ericka Budd 14th (12.43m) and Whitney McAtee 17th (39-5). In the high jump, Sarah Bever cleared 5-5 to take eighth and Torie Darrow cleared 5-0 for 14th. 
   
In the 400, Danere&apos;s White was ninth (57.22), Christina Dougas 19th (58.31) and Breanna Hargrove 20th (58.34). Barkley Castro was ninth in the 800 (2:16.67). Mitchell came back in the 200 and placed 11th (25.22). Both of her times were PRs. Kametra Byrd was 15th (25.44). 
   
&quot;I&apos;ve been chasing after this record ever since I came to Marshall, so to get it today on the home track with my friends, teammates, and family here meant the world to me,&quot; Porter said. 
   
On Friday, Adriana Cook placed third in the 5,000 meters(17:28.86). That&apos;s a school-record time. Bever and Derrow placed fourth and fifth, respectively, in the five-event pentathlon. 
   
Facility records were set by Chelsey Hargrave from Appalachian State in the long jump (19-feet, 6.75 inches), Annette Echikunwoke from Cincinnati in the weight throw (72-6.25) and Rachel Wahlny from Bowling Green in the 5,000-meter run (16:46.27). Echikunwoke is the national leader in the weight throw with a season-best of 73-11. 
   
Marshall returns to action next weekend at the Akron Invitational. On Feb. 11-12, the Herd will be host school for the Chipotle Marshall Invitational. 
   
HUNTINGTON - Marshall set three Fitch Natatorium records in a 144-118 women&apos;s swimming and diving dual meet victory against Vanderbilt on Saturday.
