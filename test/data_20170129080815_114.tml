<content type="str">&quot;La La Land&quot; has won top honors at the 28th annual Producers Guild Awards.

The guild recognized the candy-colored musical with its Darryl F. Zanuck Award for theatrical motion picture production at a ceremony Saturday night in Beverly Hills, California.

For seven of the past eight years, the winner of the producers&apos; Zanuck prize has gone on to win best picture at the Academy Awards. Last year was an exception: &quot;The Big Short&quot; won the guild award, while &quot;Spotlight&quot; got the Oscar.

The Oscar nominees for best picture announced earlier this past week echoed the producers&apos; best picture nominees, with the exception of &quot;Deadpool,&quot; which made the cut with producers but not the film academy.

&quot;Zootopia&quot; won the Producers Guild prize for animated feature.</content>
