<TEXT type="str">Out of the 403 assembly seats in Uttar Pradesh, Congress will be contesting in 105 and SP in the rest of 298 seats. Days after stitching up an electoral alliance for the upcoming Uttar Pradesh assembly polls, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi and Samajwadi party president Akhilesh Yadav will hold a press conference on Sunday followed by a joint road show in Lucknow. The meeting also assumes significance as this would be the maiden outing of the two leaders since reaching a seat-sharing agreement for the polls, which starts from February 11. Out of the 403 assembly seats, Congress will be contesting in 105 and SP the rest of 298 seats. With an aim to tell people that the two parties were their choice in the elections, Rahul and Akhilesh would launch a poll campaign with a tagline – UP ko ye saath pasand hai (UP relishes this alliance). The duo are expected to send out a strong message to party cadres from both sides, urging them to work together to ensure the defeat of BJP and BSP.
