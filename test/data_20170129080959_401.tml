<TEXT type="str">Funeral services were pending Friday for Barbara Hale, the actress best known for her role as legal secretary Della Street opposite Raymond Burr&apos;s ace lawyer Perry Mason on the hit legal drama of the same name in the 1950s and 1960s. She was gracious and kind and silly and always fun to be with. She was a &quot;wonderful actress and smart businesswoman&quot;, Katt said, and &quot;most of all a treasure as a friend and mother&quot;. She received two Emmy nominations (winning in 1959) for her role in Perry Mason . 
 
Hale starred in 270 episodes of &quot; Perry Mason &quot;, and 30 TV special spinoffs in the 1980s. Della was quietly overpowering: &quot;She knew when to speak and when to keep her mouth closed&quot;. 
 
Hale was born April 18, 1922, in DeKalb, Illinois. &quot;And Raymond was the man&quot;, Hale told the Los Angeles Times in 1993, adding that Burr had &quot;the greatest sense of humor of any person I ever met&quot;. 
 
&quot;He said into the phone, &apos;There&apos;s a kid in the office right now&quot;. I liked that she was not married. 
 
&quot;We&apos;ve all been so lucky to have her for so long&quot;, Katt wrote. That got her tryout at RKO. &quot;I had one line, but you know about those things&quot;, she said. 
 
She married actor Bill Williams, with whom she had worked on films in the 1940s before he became the star of the 1950s&apos; TV series &quot; The Adventures of Kit Carson &quot;. 
 
Hale had said she almost turned down the role when it was first offered to her because she was busy raising three children and doubted the viability of a TV series built on long-winded courtroom scenes. &quot;We&apos;re all a little lost without her but we have extraordinary stories and memories to take with us for the rest of our lives&quot;.</TEXT>
