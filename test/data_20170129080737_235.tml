Eagles 59, Cowgirls 43

Playing 15 hours after giving up a fourth-quarter lead to Mountain View, Thompson Valley was bound and determined there would be no comeback for Denver West on Saturday afternoon at the TVHS gym.

The Eagles (6-9) came out fast and shooting well, scoring 19 points in each of the first two quarters, then clamped down on defense in the final stanza to post the non-conference win. Syd Wagonmaker had a big game, hitting four 3-pointers to finish with 20 points, with three other Eagles finishing with seven or more.

&quot;We finally shot the ball worth a darn,&quot; TVHS coach Chad Walker said. &quot;We started to get a flow, and everything was in the offense. We still missed some bunnies, but we started to hit some shots from the outside. It was good ball movement and getting good shots in the rhythm of the offense.&quot;

Mattocks Invitational

DENVER — Thompson Valley placed seven and came away with the team title in the 34-team field at Lincoln on Saturday, scoring 127.5 points. Kasey Gault lead the way with his championship at 113 pounds, while Zach Kennison reached the finals at 132, taking second place.Advertisement Airiel Siegel (106) placed third, Hunter Williams (145) and Chris Ringus (220) took fifth, Chase Englehardt (152) sixth and Jay McLaughlin (126) was seventh. Gault won his title with an 8-6 decision over Dilan Esparza of Vista Peak.

&quot;It was definitely a team win. Even guys who didn&apos;t place got some pins, picked up some bonus points for us, and I&apos;m proud of them,&quot; TVHS coach Steve Gerrard said. &quot;Kasey is improving. It&apos;s a shame he missed the first part of the season, but he&apos;s seeing the competition and knowing what needs to work on after a tough match. He&apos;s making those improvements after each match. &quot;

Valley Invitational

GILCREST — Berthoud placed four in a solid field, with Austyn Binkly (132) and Matt Bailey (138) both taking third for the Spartans. Wyatt Larson (170) was fourth, and Isaiah Garcia (145) took fifth. No team scores were available.

Coach Will Carron said the team looked good on the mat, showing an ability to turn their opponents and get escapes, but getting to those spots was the issue, saying they need to be better on their feet setting up shots and then finishing them. However, Bailey&apos;s finish was a strong sign in his eyes.

&quot;Bailey had a great tournament,&quot; Carron said. &quot;His third-place match was great. He never got out of position, wrestled smart and he&apos;s definitely starting to click toward the end of the year.&quot;

Brighton Invitational

BRIGHTON — Mountain View placed nine wrestlers at the tournament, including a championship for Erik Contreras at 145, to take third as a team with 137 points. Host Brighton won the title with 232.

The upside was the number of placers, but the Mountain Lions lost six of their placement matches — some to highly ranked foes — and coach Scott Barker said the next step is winning in that round. Contreras won a 5-4 decision over Prairie View&apos;s Santana Salas for his title, while teammates Semaj Spencer (170) and Braden Barker (182) took second. Malachi Contreras (106) was third, Jackson Gilbert (152), Joseph Montoya (195), Martin Rodriquez (220) and Josh Boles (285) took fourth and Kaley Barker (113) was fifth.

&quot;The matches we lost, all were to pretty good kids, but that&apos;s the next step,&quot; coach Barker said. &quot;It&apos;s wining those matches; a couple we lost, we were right in it and just got pinned. They&apos;re all right in it, we&apos;ve just got to shorten up a few mistakes and learn how to win the tough matches. We were very happy with how I felt we looked on Thursday to today, it was night and day. Everything is there, we just have to put the mental pieces together.&quot;

Front Range League Meet

FORT COLLINS — Poudre ran away with the team title (222 points) as Loveland was able to place two at the 13-team tournament, with Oscar Espinoza-Diaz reaching the finals at 170.

Espinoza-Diaz dropped a 5-4 decision to James Campbell of Poudre in the finals, and Isaac Lujan placed fourth at 106. Coach Troy Lussenhop hopes the depth of the field will only serve his team well down the stretch.

&quot;It&apos;s a heck of a league. Isaac beat Dean Noble (of Poudre) again, did it in triple overtime and put him on his back for the win,&quot; Lussenhop said. &quot;Being top four at that tournament, that&apos;s a heck of a confidence booster. Oscar wrestled great, had a great tournament. We also had five others who made the consolation semifinals. We&apos;re wrestling tough.&quot;
