<TEXT type="str">Ollie Locke trained as an actor. 

The &apos;Made in Chelsea&apos; star may have qualifications that could potentially see his name up in lights in the near future but he&apos;s adamant he&apos;d never agree to do a soap because he&apos;s enjoying his time on the E4 reality TV show with his close friends and family. 

Speaking exclusively to BANG Showbiz, he said: &quot;I trained to be an actor but I think I will stick to &apos;Made In Chelsea&apos; for the moment [instead of starring in a soap].&quot; 

As well as shooting scenes for the popular posh series, the 29-year-old hunk - who came out as bisexual in 2011 - is in the middle of launching a gay dating app. 

He explained: &quot;I&apos;m launching a very big gay dating app very shortly, and that will be very big when it comes. My love life is turbulent, as always. But it&apos;s a big year.&quot; 

The app, which is called &apos;Chappy&apos;, won&apos;t be out until 2017, however singletons are encouraged to sign up now ahead of the launch. 

Meanwhile, in July, the socialite revealed he was looking for a male companion as being in a relationship with his ex-girlfriend  Catherine Louise Radford - who he split from last December - made him realise he&apos;s no longer bisexual. 

Speaking about the previous series of the E4 reality show - which was set in Cannes - he said: &quot;It&apos;s the first time the viewers have seen me as gay instead of bi. I do say the words &apos;I am a gay man.&apos;&quot; 

Ollie admitted that the series was a &quot;big&quot; deal for him as he&apos;s never &quot;openly&quot; talked about his sexuality. 

He said: &quot;For me, this is a big series because I&apos;m talking very openly about gay life, which I have never really done before. 

&quot;I lived with a woman last year when I was off camera, we had two dogs together. 

&quot;And then we broke up and in December I thought, &apos;That&apos;s it now, I think I&apos;m now gay.&apos;&quot;</TEXT>
