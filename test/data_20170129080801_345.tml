<TEXT type="str">Theirs has arguably been the greatest rivalry in sport over the last decade. Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal&apos;s epic clashes have enthralled audiences the world over on many occasions. Their contrasting styles of play and personalities make their battles a riveting experience for tennis lovers. 
 
However, it isn&apos;t&apos; just their game that captivates one-and-all. It&apos;s the genuine bonhomie between the two and the respect they have for the game that sets them apart. 
 
It doesn&apos;t come as a surprise then that Federer and Nadal&apos;s Australian Open final clash on Sunday has overshadowed any other news in sport as of now. The Swiss and Spaniard enjoy long legions of fans, many of whom are famous celebrities. And the anticipation to watch the two icons clash in the final of a Grand Slam once again has gone through the roof. 
 
Not to be left far behind, Indian cricket&apos;s God Sachin Tendulkar joined the conversation on Saturday when he posted a picture on Twitter of the two tennis gladiators with the caption: &quot;Without any doubt, one of the biggest matches in tennis history. Any guesses who I would be cheering for??&quot;

Well, the answer to Sachin&apos;s question is fairly straightforward. The batting legend has on multiple occasions admitted to the fact that he is a huge Federer fan. The two legends had even met during Wimbledon in 2011, where they exchanged notes on their respective, illustrious careers.
