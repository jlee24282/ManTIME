<TEXT type="str">LOS ANGELES, Jan. 28, 2017 /PRNewswire-iReach/ -- Autocarsinsurancetips.com has released a new blog post explaining how the location influences auto insurance prices. 

Location can have a big impact on auto insurance prices. In some states, insuring a vehicle can be cheaper than in others. Since auto insurance has to be bought from the state in which the driver&apos;s&apos; license has been issued, clients do not have much of a choice in this respect. They would have to suffer the positive or negative consequences of their respective state laws. 

When comparing car insurance plans, clients will notice some differences in the rates they give. Some agencies will rate an area better or worse than others provider, however, living in a bad neighborhood will always make auto insurance costs more. 

Clients are able to get auto insurance quotes from http://autocarsinsurancetips.com/. To get a list of offers, they have to complete two simple steps: 

Enter the ZIP code. Clients will have to enter their ZIP codes in the box found on the website&apos;s homepage. The ZIP code will tell brokers where to look for offers and location also plays an important role in determining coverage prices. Auto insurance is cheaper in some states than in others. 

Complete the online form. The website collects data that it passes on to brokers who, based on the way in which someone completed the online form will select quotes and determine accurate prices for each customer. 

Clients who compare car insurance quotes will be able to save more on coverage. Brokers estimate that comparing auto insurance quotes helps drivers reduce their premiums by more than 25%. This is a big percentage and can amount to a high sum, which is saved each year.
