<TEXT type="str">Academy has blasted President Donald Trump&apos;s travel ban branding it &quot;extremely troubling&quot;. 

Iranian filmmaker Asghar Farhadi, who wrote and directed the 2017 Oscar-nominated foreign language film &quot;The Salesman,&quot; would not be able to enter the US for the awards under Trump&apos;s recently enacted travel ban, reported Variety. &quot;The Academy celebrates achievement in the art of filmmaking, which seeks to transcend borders and speak to audiences around the world, regardless of national, ethnic, or religious differences. 

&quot;As supporters of filmmakers - and the human rights of all people - around the globe, we find it extremely troubling that Asghar Farhadi, the director of the Oscar-winning film from Iran &apos;A Separation,&apos; along with the cast and crew of this year&apos;s Oscar-nominated film &apos;The Salesman,&apos; could be barred from entering the country because of their religion or country of origin,&quot; statement released by the Academy&apos;s official spokesperson read. 

Trump signed the executive order on Friday to suspend entry of refugees to the US for 120 days, and imposed an indefinite ban on refugees from Syria. A 90-day ban was also placed on citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. 

The 2017 Academy Awards will take place on February 26.
