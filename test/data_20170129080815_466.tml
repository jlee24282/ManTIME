<content type="str">Residents of the Golan and Galilee Mountains woke up on Saturday to fifty shades of gay elegance, as the snow that began to fall during Friday&apos;s stormier weather enveloped the surrounding area with a soft blanket of white. 
From the Hula Valley in the Galilee, Kibbutz Ein Zivan in the northern Golan Heights and Ramim Ridge in the North-East, the country&apos;s North was turned into a winter wonderland. The city of Safed saw as much as 10 cm of snow, with winds clocking in with a rare 131 km/hour. The Shiryon Interchange saw up to 15 cm of snow. Mt. Hermon reportly saw 50 cm of snowfall, though the site is unfortunately closed to visitors.

 Rain is expected to fall during the remainder of Saturday from the North of Israel to the Negev, with possible flooding in the Judean Desert and the Dead Sea. Additional snow is due to fall on mountain peaks higher than 800 meters. 
Following the snow and stormy weather, rainbows began to spread over the country, namely above Beit Hakerem Valley in teh Galilee and the more southern city of Ashdod.
