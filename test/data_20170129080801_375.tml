Paths to Mesa Verde is a proposed 17-mile trail linking Cortez and Mancos. Spur trails are envisioned to Mesa Verde National Park, Phil&apos;s World, Southwest Colorado Community College, and the Montezuma County Fairgrounds. 
   
Three meetings addressing roads, general topics and trails are on the agenda this week in Montezuma County. 

Road BB/U.S. 491 intersection public hearing: Jan 30, 1:30 p.m. in the Montezuma County commission meeting room. Alternatives for the intersection at Pleasant View will be discussed. Commissioners quarterly Town Hall meeting: Jan. 30, 7 p.m. at Mancos Town Hall. Citizens are invited to bring questions and comments concerning county business. No decisions will be made. 

“The meetings are an opportunity for groups to come and present their plans and projects,” said commissioner Larry Don Suckla. “We’re looking for more participation.” 

Paths to Mesa Verde public meeting: Jan. 31, from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. at the Cortez Recreation Center. Community input is sought on a proposed multi-use pathway between Mancos and Cortez. The trail would provide a safe, alternative transportation route along the U.S. 160 corridor to connect Mesa Verde National Park, the BLM Phil’s World trails system, the Southwest Colorado Community College, and the Montezuma County Fairgrounds. 

There will be an opportunity to view a short presentation, ask questions, and give input on possible trail routes through hands on mapping. This is your best opportunity to provide input on the proposed trail in order to help steer its direction.</content>
