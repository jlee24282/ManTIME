It was the Kings’ second sectional title in three years and third all-time. 
 
“They work so hard, they deserve this,” Cass coach Nate Burrous said. “We’ve got 13 through to regionals which is a record for us. We’ve never had more than 10 before. So now we’re going to go back next week and get ready and hopefully we get a bunch of them to semistate.” 
 
Cass won the title with 221 points, followed by Logansport (168).

 BOYS HOOPS  EASTERN 55, CLINTON C. 49  
Eastern broke free from a 37-all tie after three quarters to beat Clinton Central in the fifth-place game of the Hoosier Heartland Conference&apos;s tournament at Clinton Prairie. 
 
Draeden Graber came up big for the Comets (7-10) with a team-high 20 points. Ethan Henry added 13 points, Zach Robinson and Nolan Smalley had six each. 
 
Eastern coach Mike Springer said in the fourth quarter the Comets &quot;changed from man-to-man to zone, that helped us as well. Graber scored 10 of his 20 in the fourth quarter, and we attacked the basket and controlled the tempo really well. 
 
&quot;[Graber] had two 3s and had two big free throws down the stretch to solidify the game. It was just a good team effort that last quarter. Both teams had played three games in five days and I was really proud of the kids, the way they stayed mentally strong that last quarter.&quot; 
 
Clinton Central (6-10) got 23 points from Keenan Orr but Eastern found ways to limit CC&apos;s offensive effectiveness. 
 
&quot;Orr had 14 of his 23 in the first half, he was really carrying them early and I really felt like it was a good team effort [by Eastern],&quot; Springer said. &quot;Robinson ended up with five assists. Smalley had six boards, Graber and Henry did a good job scoring, [Luke] Monize had six rebounds as well. [Scott] Mullenix] came off the bench and got us a very big basket early in the game, and [Sam] Querry did a really good job on [CC&apos;s Axle] Brandenburg, who was averaging 19 a game, held him to 11.&quot;
