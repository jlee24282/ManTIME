Now that you&apos;re breathing a collective sigh or relief, do read on.

My first born, Samantha, who is 18, really has a pretty clear idea of what she wants out of life.

She sure didn&apos;t get that from me. I still don&apos;t know!

She got her acceptance letter from Fairleigh Dickinson this past week. She wants to study engineering, in keeping with her tradition of being on the award-winning Mount Olive High School robotics team for the past four years. She knows what she wants to study, and even knows that she wants to come back to the high school as a mentor, to work with the up and coming robotics team kids.

She&apos;s busy looking for women in engineering scholarships, with an impressive &quot;resume&quot; of having been key to the robotics team at the high school for four years.

She&apos;s got it all kind of figured out. I told her last week that I was impressed, and that I was precisely the opposite!

Now, let&apos;s talk about me 25 and 30 years ago.

I had no idea what I wanted to do. Zero. I was terrible at math. I was terrible at science.

But I guess I could write pretty well, even back then. Still, where to go with that? I just had no clue. No ideas at all.

In high school, I wrote absolutely nothing for the Lenape Valley newspaper. Nothing. It never even would have dawned on me. I remember one time being asked what my favorite junk food was. And my name made it into the school newspaper. I thought that was a pretty big thrill. But other than that, my only writing experience was in creative writing. I remember once writing a kind of gruesome horror short story.

The result of that was a trip to the school psychologist, just to make sure I was operating on all thrusters.

When it came time for college, I knew I had to do it, or should do it, but I wasn&apos;t enthused. I wasn&apos;t looking forward to much of anything, except when the next Star Trek movie was coming out. (Come to think of it, I&apos;m still often in that mindset!) I was just kind of going through the motions, not really knowing what I wanted to do. I never dreamed back then that this keyboard I&apos;m sitting at now and composing this literary masterpiece would ever play such a big role in my life.

My mom had to beg me to take a typing class. And yes, those were the days when it was still a &quot;typing&quot; class. I was hesitant. &quot;What will I ever need that for?&quot; I recall asking.

Out of high school, I quickly liked the notion of attending County College of Morris. Not only was it a highly rated school, but they had a good journalism program. Kind of by default, I chose my major.

What would I later do it it I had no idea. But, CCM was close enough to Byram, and would still leave me lots of time to pursue other interests? Like what? Good question! Well, attending Star Trek conventions. Going to movies. Visiting Circle Lanes in Ledgewood You know, that really important kind of stuff.

The point was, I just didn&apos;t that much care. And I certainly wasn&apos;t excited about school. I didn&apos;t totally hate it. I just wasn&apos;t excited. It was kind of just there. I have always been afraid of change, so it took some getting used to.

But, I fell in kind of comfortably at CCM. Part of the requirement of the journalism curriculum was to choose a &quot;beat&quot;, about which I would be required to regularly submit an article. And it wasn&apos;t easy! I wound up with the social sciences department! Talk about boring. I can remember pestering Jackie Crimmel, the department secretary, for a story idea every week. Years later, I&apos;d be after her for quotes and comments again, when I got this job and found out she was on the Roxbury school board. We always joked about the days I&apos;d visit her office and ask &quot;what&apos;s going on&quot; in the exciting field of the social sciences department.

Typically, my story would be something like &quot;Teacher to revise sociology text book&quot; or some other equally exciting subject.

It wasn&apos;t until I wrote my first-person account of meeting President Richard Nixon outside his home in Saddle River that things started to get exciting. I can remember that week&apos;s paper, and all the teachers talking about it, and kids asking me was I the one who made that trip. It was fun. I started to like having my stuff read.

Later, commuting to William Paterson, I again didn&apos;t write much for the student newspaper, but I began freelancing for a now defunct newspaper covering meetings in Byram, Stanhope and Netcong, mostly.

Unlike the other kids in class, I was actually out there doing it. While the professors were talking about the life of a journalist, I was experiencing it. That was kind of neat. I remember one professor critiquing one of my masterpieces in front of the class. That didn&apos;t go too well. I like to think I&apos;ve gotten better.

And then, out of school, I found Roxbury. And Roxbury found me. It has been a pretty happy union for the past two decades.

And now, I count Harding, and all of the towns The Citizen covers as &quot;my towns.&quot; And I have to admit, it has been pretty enjoyable.

Just don&apos;t ask me what I want to do next.</TEXT>
