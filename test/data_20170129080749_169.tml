<content type="str">00 PM - 07:00 PM You-nique Bou-tique - La Porte Business Development La Porte Chamber of Commerce Description MiniLightbox(&quot;#event_lightbox_1&quot;); Join the Downtown La Porte business You-nique Bou-tique for a Business after Hours on Wednesday, February 1st at 5:00 p.m. This chic boutique with a vintage flair, located at 800 Michigan Avenue in La Porte, will help you prepare for Valentine&apos;s Day- with either a great new outfit for the ladies or a thoughtful gift for men to give their lady.

You-nique Bou-tique, affectionately called &quot;You Bou&quot; by regular clients, opened their new La Porte location in mid-May of 2016. The boutique offers brand-new fashions and eclectic jewelry for ladies who love to dress and feel unique. Shoes, hosiery, and handbags were also added last year in their own section of the store referred to as &quot;Shu Bou.&quot; Chrissy Berry, Fashion Stylist, commented &quot;Our style is vintage-inspired; ruffles, layers, lace and crochet; very feminine and extremely pretty. I love to help our customers pull together a special outfit or suggest an embellished top that works well with a beloved skirt for a fresh new look!&quot;
