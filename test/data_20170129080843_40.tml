MOBILE — Having cut his coaching teeth working under Jerry Glanville and Bill Belichick, in addition to his two years as head coach of the Miami Dolphins before coming to Alabama, Nick Saban has quite the reputation around the NFL. 
 
And for the most past, it’s a pretty good one, especially among the coaching ranks. 
 
“I saw Nick today, he and I go way back — he was the DB coach at the Houston Oilers when I was the DB coach at Pitt,” Chicago Bears head coach John Fox said Tuesday following his first practice coaching the North team during Senior Bowl week. 
 
“So we kind of came up through the college ranks about the same time, sprung into pro football about the same time, and obviously he’s gone back to college as a head coach in a couple of different settings, and had a lot of success.” 
 
That success, especially at Alabama, is well documented — four of his five national championships and five SEC titles since 2008 — and it carries weight around NFL circles. 
 
Of course, much of that perception stems from how Saban has used an NFL model — from the front office to what appears on the field — to build the Crimson Tide into a perennial national power. 
 
“A lot of it is what they’ve been exposed to, scheme-wise,” Fox said. “I think primarily up to this point (Alabama has) been a pro-style offense and defense, and I think that helps guys transition to the National Football League.” 
 
That has shown in the sheer numbers of former Saban products going into the NFL. 
 
Since not having a single player taken in the 2008 draft, following his first season at the helm, Alabama has had 55 players drafted, including an NCAA-best 18 in the first round. This past season, 42 former Alabama players were on NFL rosters — though not all played under Saban. 
 
Of them, Saban and Alabama had a league-high six former players named to the Pro Bowl — Oakland’s Amari Cooper, New England’s Dont’a Hightower, Baltimore’s C.J. Mosley, Atlanta’s Julio Jones, Green Bay’s Ha Ha Clinton-Dix, and New York Giants’ Landon Collins. Since 2012, 10 different Tide players have been named All-Pros a total of 16 times. 
 
Those figures could continue to rise, especially if projections hold true and the Crimson Tide has between five to seven players selected among the first 32 picks in April’s upcoming NFL draft. 
 
“Whenever you’re dealing with human talent, it’s not automatic,” Fox said. “But they’ve obviously had a lot of guys in the league that have performed well, so we consider that.” 
 
Saban often uses that strong connection to the NFL as a recruiting tool, pointing to the dozens of former players he’s sent to play at the next level in his four decades as a college coach. It’s one of the many reasons Alabama is potentially closing in on its seventh consecutive No. 1 recruiting class in the country. 
 
“You know that if they’re competing for national championships every year, competing for the playoffs, that means they’re stacking their roster with good talent,” said Marc Lillibridge, the director of Elite Performance who has 20-plus years of experience as an NFL agent and scout with the Green Bay Packers and Kansas City Chiefs. 
 
“A lot of (NFL scouts) know that … because everybody knows Nick Saban can recruit. So you’re going to go into that school and find those guys.” 
 
But how NFL personnel view Crimson Tide players goes beyond the number of stars they had coming out of high school. 
 
League personnel value several intangible qualities that players tend to have after working under Saban, including a relentless work ethic and never-satisfied approach to the game that tend to be staples of Saban’s “Process.” 
 
“Teams know that they’re getting a player that played at a program that demanded effort, demanded that trademark toughness,” CBSSports.com senior NFL draft analyst Dane Brugler said. “They’re not all going to be Ryan Andersons or O.J. Howards — there will be some misses — but you know first and foremost he’s going to bring talent to Tuscaloosa, and then he’s going to develop them.” 
 
Of course, while Saban’s name alone won’t help improve a player’s draft stock, the knowledge of the sort of training those players have been subjected to under Saban certainly has an effect on how scouts and NFL executives evaluate Alabama players. 
 
“Obviously you know what type of instruction these players are getting (at Alabama), you know the program that they have,” Brugler said. “So you’re not going to move a player up just based on where he comes from — you try to look at all these players without a logo on the helmet — you’re looking at just the individual player. But it’s impossible not (to take that into consideration). 
 
“And if Nick Saban has a lot of nice things to say about Ryan Anderson, you don’t dismiss that. You take what Nick says and you include that in your report. But you’re not going to move a player up or down just based on who his coach is.”</content>
