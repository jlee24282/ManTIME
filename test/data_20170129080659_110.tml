Mexico has lashed out at the Israeli regime for applauding the new US administrations contentious plan to erect a wall along the Mexico border in a sweepingcrackdownon immigration. 
 
In a tweet on Saturday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin expressed support for US President Donald Trumps plan, saying a similar barrier built by Tel Aviv along the Egyptian border stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea. 
  
Irked by the Twitter post, Mexicos Foreign Ministry released a statement later in the day, saying it had expressed to Tel Aviv via the regimes ambassador to Mexico City its profound astonishment, rejection and disappointment over Prime Minister Netanyahus message. 
  
Meanwhile, the Central Committee of the Jewish Community in Mexico also issued a statement and forcefully rejected Netanyahus message. 
 
As Mexicans and Jews, we support the actions taken by President Enrique Pena Nieto in negotiations with the US, the statement said. 
 
Facing the criticisms, Israeli foreign ministry spokesman Emmanuel Nahshon tried to justifyNetanyahus comments, which he said were referring to Israels specific security experience, and had nothing to do with US-Mexico ties. 
 
On January 25, the US presidentsigned executive actions to begin the construction of the Mexico border wall and increase the number of immigration enforcement officers who carry out deportations.

Trump has also imposed a ban on entry to the US for people from certain Muslim-majority countries. 
 
The US presidents calls earlier this week for Mexico to pay for the border wall sparked a rift, promoting Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to drop a planned visit to Washington.

Tel Aviv began building a barrier fence on its border with Egypts Sinai Peninsula in 2012 to stem the flow of African refugees into the occupied territories. 
 
The regime has been under heavy criticism for its ill-treatment of some 45,000 African refugees, mostly from Eritrea and Sudan, thousands of whom are kept in detention facilities. 
 
Israel has also set up barriers around the blockaded Gaza Strip and along much of the occupied West Bank, what Palestinians call the Apartheid Wall.</TEXT>
