<TEXT>WHAT were your favourite moments of 2016? 

According to a poll of 2,000 Brits, Andy Murray's Wimbledon triumph was top of the list. 

Here's the top ten of events that captured our imagination last year. 2. Leicester Citys Premier League victory. 4. The moment the baby iguana escaped the snakes in Planet Earth 2. 

5. When Alistair Brownlee helping his brother, Jonny, across the Triathlon World Series finishing line (sacrificing his own first place position). 

6. Mo Farah making Olympic medal history in Rio. 

7. Tim Peake completing his 185-day stint in space. 

8. Ed Balls rendering the nation speechless after dancing Gangnam Style on Strictly. 

9. Leonardo DiCaprio finally winning that Oscar. 

10. Devon pensioner Joe Bartley being offered a job, after putting a desperate advert in the local paper. 

There were plenty of other momentous moments - here to prove it are some of the 'winning moments' that didn't make the top ten. 

11. TV favourites, Ant & Dec, finally getting their OBEs. 

12. Jon Snow being re-incarnated on Game of Thrones. 

13. Emmerdales Robert Sugden and Aaron Dingle revealing they are to tie the knot. 

14. Candice Brown winning The Great British Bake Off 2016. 

15. Englands Rugby Union team going unbeaten for a whole year.
