From its Flexible Grantmaking Fund, the foundation also awarded $175,000 to the Thunder Valley Community Development Corporation in Porcupine, South Dakota, to fund continued actions against the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline, support the protestors, and help build a planning and organizing infrastructure for longer-term sustainability in the region.
