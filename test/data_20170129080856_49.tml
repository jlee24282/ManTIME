<TEXT type="str">CONVERSE — Oak Hill’s wrestling team held on to its claim on sectional hardware Saturday, winning the Oak Hill Sectional by the slimmest margin since 2008. 
 
The Golden Eagles won their fourth straight sectional title in a three-team race that came down to the final weights. Oak Hill finished with 231 points, followed by Western at 226.5 and Eastern at 212. Kokomo was fifth with 162.5 points and Taylor ninth with 16. 
 
It was the closest race for the title since Marion edged Oak Hill 193-192.5 in 2008. 
 
“We had the lead, then we lost the lead, then we got the lead back, then we lost it again, got it back, we couldn’t hang on to it,” Western coach Chad Shepherd said. “I don’t know if I’ve seen this tournament this competitive.” 
 
The final round got progressively more tense as the team lead changed hands and big matches drew loud responses from the Oak Hill and Western contingents. 
 
“If people didn’t enjoy [Saturday’s] wrestling, they just don’t enjoy wrestling,” Eastern coach Bob Jarrett said. “It was a good day of wrestling for everybody.” 
 
Western entered 13 individuals and is advancing a dozen to next Saturday’s Peru Regional. The top four wrestlers in each weight class advance. 
 
The Panthers scored two champions, freshman Hunter Cottingham and sophomore Carter Ciscell. Cottingham scored a 4-1 decision over Marion’s Jaylon Gibson in the 126-pound final. Wrestling as a No. 4 seed, Ciscell wrecked the 145 bracket, beating the top seed and then topping No. 2 seed, Oak Hill’s Cole Ridgeway, by pin with 26 seconds left in the title match. 
 
“We wrestled great,” Shepherd said. “Coming into this, people probably had us third, I would guess. We lost a couple close matches, I think we lost two one-point matches. We had a four seed win the tournament. That’s pretty cool. We had a third seed get second [Dylan Goudy], we had a six seed come in third [Braxton Erb], we did really well. We’ve been talking about this for two weeks, getting ready for this tournament and I thought they did a great job.” 
 
Also advancing for Western are Payton Lechner (second at 106 pounds), Chandler Ciscell (third, 113), Goudy (second, 132), Donavan Shepherd (third, 152), Kevin Lenahan (second, 160), Jacob Allen (third, 170), Matt Scott (third, 182), Erb (third, 195), Luke Lushin (fourth, 220), and Lane Eubank (third, 285). 
 
“We’ve got a chance to get some guys out [to the semistate] next week, I’m really happy with them,” Chad Shepherd said. 
 
“I just think it’s great how much they’ve grown. We wrestled Oak Hill in an eight-way earlier in the year and ... I think they beat us by 40, 50, 60 points, something like that. [To lose by] 4-and-a-half is a big improvement. And we don’t have a 120-pounder.” 
 
Eastern advanced nine wrestlers to the regional and three Comets were crowned champs. Freshman Gerald Pearson beat Oak Hill’s Bhupesh Chauhan 9-2 in the 113-pound final, freshman Tytus Morrisett beat Goudy 4-1 in the 132-pound final, and unbeaten senior Evan Ellis pushed his record to 35-0 with a 6-0 decision over Oak Hill’s Owen Perkins — a returning state qualifier — in the heavyweight final. 
 
Also advancing for the Comets are Macaiah White (third, 120), Aren Turner (second, 138), Eli Elkins (third, 145), Corbin Hetzner (second, 152), Ben Cole (third, 160), and Garrett Hetzner (second, 170). 
 
“We wrestled well, it was a good day, it just wasn’t a great day,” Jarrett said. For us to be up there with [Oak Hill and Western] everything had to go just right and obviously it didn’t, but not truly disappointed, nine [advancing] is not bad.” 
 
Highlights for Jarrett were: White beating the same higher-seeded Oak Hill wrestler twice in the same day, first in the quarterfinals, then in the third-place match; the two freshmen title-winners; Ellis’ continued dominance; and Garret Hetzner’s good start including an upset of the No. 2 seed. 
 
Kokomo scored three champions and advances seven to the regional. Senior Jabin Wright won the 120-pound championship, getting up big in the title match before pinning Mississinewa’s Courtland Smith with :50 left in the third period. Gavin Herrera, the No. 2 seed at 195, beat top-seeded Tony Fuller of Oak Hill 4-2 in the championship. And Nick Fox won the 220-pound final in an all-action performance, beating Eastbrook’s Jackson Bush 18-3. 
 
Also advancing for Kokomo are Nigel Lenoir (third, 106), Seth Johnson (fourth, 126), Rafael Lopez (fourth, 138), and DaShaun Barbary (second, 182). Barbary was leading 1-0 in his title match before Oak Hill’s Blaney Harrison scored in the final seconds to score a 2-1 win. Lopez and Johnson were seeded outside the top four spots, but managed to get into the top four to advance to Peru. 
 
“We only had five guys seeded so those guys are expected to get out [to the regional],” Kokomo coach Ryan Wells said. “To get seven out — everybody wrestled at or above their seeds and that’s a great thing. For [Lopez and Johnson] that’s absolutely great for them. Their records aren’t as stellar as some of those other guys, to punch their ticket to the regional is pretty special for them. 
 
“We had four guys in the final, we had three champs. Gavin being a 2 seed and winning, he avenged a loss to Fuller from Oak Hill, he wrestled real well. Jabin is just lights out right now, he’s up by 15 points and pins the kid. He’s just really, really looking good. Fox looked great in the finals, tech falls his kid, a tough kid from Eastbrook. DaShaun, he’s winning the entire [final] match, he won 5:45 of that match and gave up [points] at the end. He’s good enough to beat anybody in the state. We firmly believe that and next week he’ll get another shot at him.”</TEXT>
