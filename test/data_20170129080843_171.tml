The Seaholm High School band recently returned from taking a group of 130 students, staff and chaperones to Rome for a week. 
 
The highlight of the trip was the band marching in the Rome New Year's Day Parade, along with several other high school and college bands from the U.S.,in front of a crowd that was estimated at 50,000 people. 
 
The band also had the opportunity to perform in the small hilltop town of Frascati,12 miles outside of Rome. One of the interesting aspects of the Frascati performance, band leaders said, was they met two Seaholm alumni (one from the 1950s and the other from the 1970s) who lived in nearby towns and came out to see the performance. 
 
In addition to their performances, students had the opportunity to experience many of the amazing historical treasures in Rome and the surrounding areas, including the Colosseum, Forum, Circus Maximus, Pantheon, Vatican City and Pompei. Band leaders said they had "a great time on the trip and were outstanding representatives of our community."
