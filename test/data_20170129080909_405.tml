This student - who did not want to be named - says her car was stolen on the UKZN Westville campus in September last year. She says it was later recovered by a vehicle tracking company. 

 
&quot;Personally, I feel this campus is being targeted on a daily basis, or maybe weekly - there are vehicles that are going missing, and it hasn&apos;t being brought to the attention of people on this campus. Only when we go to report an incident with our vehicles, then we know a vehicle has been stolen or tampered with,&quot; she said.

UKZN spokesperson, Lesiba Seshoka, says campus security has been briefed. 
 
&quot;We are quite hopeful that with the improved security measures we have put in place, we won&apos;t have these crimes anymore,&quot; he said. 
 
Seshoka has appealed to students to ensure their vehicles are locked at all times, and that their belongings stowed away safely.
