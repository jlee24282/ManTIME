<TEXT type="str">INDIO, CALIF. - In a heart and soul performance before a sold-out crowd at Fantasy Springs Resort Casino, Miguel &quot;El Alacran&quot; Berchelt (31-1, 28 KOs) pulled the upset of a lifetime and was crowned the new after an 11th round stoppage of former two-time world champion Francisco &quot;El Bandido&quot; Vargas (23-1-2, 17 KOs). The fight featured moments of heavy exchanges, which resulted in the reopening of a former cut above one of Vargas&apos;s eyes during the ninth round. 
  
&quot;I wanted to fight the best of the best, and this fight happened because of that,&quot; said Miguel &quot;El Alacran&quot; Berchelt. &quot;Francisco is a great champion, he has fought the best and has been in two Fight of the Year contests. I knew what I was getting into; he has great heart. I left my heart and soul on the mat. I am young and hungry, and I want to fight the best because that is how champions are made. I want to thank Vargas for this incredible opportunity.&quot; 
  
&quot;I want to wish Berchelt all the best. It was a tough fight, and he&apos;s young with a lot of heart and passion and hunger. He cut me, and I just wasn&apos;t able to see because the blood kept coming into my eyes. I am not the type of fighter to give in, and I will always be fighting. I am a warrior, and I will be that to the very end. I probably would have kept going if they wouldn&apos;t have stopped the fight. I want a rematch.&quot; 
 

  
In a spectacular slugfest performance and strong Fight of the Year candidate, the evening&apos;s co-feature had Takashi Miura (31-3-2, 24 KOs) defeat Mexican warrior, and number two WBC rated Miguel &quot;Mikey&quot; Roman (56-12, 43 KOs) with a 12th round stoppage in their super featherweight battle. 
  
&quot;My hands feel great despite it being a war in there,&quot; said Takashi Miura. &quot;These are the types of fights that I want. I want the winner of the next fight [Vargas vs. Berchelt] next.&quot; 
  
&quot;This was an amazing fight to be a part of, and I will be meeting with my promoter to be discussing future opportunities to continue fighting,&quot; said Miguel &quot;Mickey&quot; Roman. &quot;I was caught off guard by some of his low punches, but all in all it was a great fight. I wish him the best.&quot;
