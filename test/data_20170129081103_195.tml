<TITLE>Letter: Cal Water bullies citizens, shows its greedy side</TITLE>
<TEXT>As a member of Lower Oroville Water Rates (LOWR) I have spent the past year studying the private water company, Cal Water, and I have come to the conclusion that they are the epitome of a greedy corporation. 
 
They have operated for about 100 years without a franchise in Oroville. They have no water of their own, so they have to buy it from PG&E. They charge rates two to four times higher than the other two companies that serve Oroville. They siphon out about $5 million a year from our city and send it to their home office in San Jose to lavish it on their CEO, executives and stockholders. They neglect their infrastructure and then raise rates when it comes time to finally do some upgrades or repairs. 
 
They are trapped between two publicly owned companies, Thermalito Water & Sewer and South Feather Water and Power, so they cannot increase their customers, which means the only way they can raise more revenue is to continually raise their rates. 
 
So, as residents let their trees die and give up on growing gardens because of Cal Waters onerous rates, and businesses are forced to compete with other businesses, sometimes just across the street from them, while paying much higher water rates, Cal Water complains, bullies and threatens because the city wants to have a regional water study done to see if they can possibly reduce the water rates for their constituents. Despicable!
