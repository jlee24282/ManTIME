<TITLE>Politics needs a new image, says UDC Director</TITLE>
<TEXT>There needs to be a new image of politics in order to attract the right people to lead Barbados into the future. 
 
Saying that politics was now being perceived as a nasty business, Director of the Urban Development Commission Derek Alleyne highlighted that many young persons had lost interest in becoming politicians because of this. 
 
The age group in Barbados in the 24s to 30s seem to have no interest in what is happening politically, he said, pointing out that adults too did not have anything positive to say about politics. 
 
We do not encourage our kids to get involved . . . and I know that talking to some of the kids of the former ministers, there is a perception that they get battered so much as children and see the way their parents are treated and things that are said about them that they get turned off, the former labour officer said. 
 
However, he stressed that there must be change in this view as the only alternative was people only with an interest in gaining power rather than a genuine interest in developing their country. 
 
If we leave it to those people who will make statements in the short term, whose only interest is in getting their hands on the government, who have no idea as to where Barbados should go, if we leave it to those people, we will get worse and the quality of politicians will continue to receive the same reviewsthat they are wicked, he said. 
 
Earlier in his presentation Politics, Politicians: Public Perception and Realities at the Friday lunchtime lecture at the Democratic Labour Party headquarters, Alleyne outlined that the role set by Prime Minister Freundel Stuart was an excellent one for others to follow. 
 
In Prime Minister Stuart we have a politician of exemplary class, taste, fashion and behaviour and I think all of us should be proud to have Freundel Stuart as Prime Minister of Barbados, he said, adding For the first time in a long while we have a Prime Minister who no one can speak of tyranny, who no one can accuse of any wrongdoing, whose life is an example for any young man or young woman, who carries himself with distinction.
