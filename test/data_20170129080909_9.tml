<content type="str">Fire devastated a house and shattered the windows of a neighboring residence Saturday morning in Ukiah, said John Strangio, a fire captain at the Ukiah Valley Fire Authority. 
 
Flames were coming from multiple windows of the two-story building in the 800 block of Cypress Street by the time the first crews arrived at the house at 6:51 a.m., about six minutes after neighbors reported hearing sounds of cracking and popping coming from the house, Strangio said. Five fire engines and four support vehicles ultimately responded to the blaze, which was brought under control shortly after the first units arrived, Strangio said. 
 
The occupants of the house were away traveling and returned later that day, Strangio said. Nobody was injured, and foul play is not suspected, he said. 
 
The entire rear half of the building was destroyed and will need to be rebuilt, while the front half was severely damaged and will require remodeling, Strangio said. The fire department declared the house a total loss. 
 
The outside panes of several dual-pane windows on a neighboring house were shattered by heat emanating from the fire, Strangio said. Several plastic fixtures were melted, and shrubbery growing up the wall of the house was destroyed, he said. 
 
On the other side of the house, firefighters damaged a fence after scrambling to get into position with their hose, Strangio said. 
 
Luck played a critical role in the fire’s quick suppression, Strangio said. The north and south stations were transitioning between shifts just as the neighbors’ call came in, so the department had twice the manpower they usually had to respond, he said. 
 
Without the extra personnel, the fire could have expanded and caused more damage, Strangio said. The added help allowed fire crews to subdue the blaze before it destroyed the adjacent building, he said. 
 
Fire personnel were still investigating the cause of the fire on Saturday afternoon, Strangio said. It would take them about 48 hours to release their findings, he said.
