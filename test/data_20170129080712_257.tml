<content type="str">IT’S the question mark that’s long hung over Illawarra but coach Rob Beveridge believes his side showed a play-off ready hard edge in their three-point win over league leaders Adelaide on Saturday, 
 
The 36rs were well in command of the clash for most of the first half but were overwhelmed by a onslaught in the second half that saw the hosts claim a much needed victory and 3-1 series bragging rights. 
 
Sixers coach Joey Wright bemoaned his side’s lack of physicality in the aftermath and Beveridge, who’s never shied away from questioning his side’s toughness in the past, was full of praise for the mettle his troops displayed in knocking off the competition leaders. 
 
“I said to the guys in the change rooms [post-game] that we just proved to ourselves, we’ve set a standard, where we can actually compete with the best team in the league and beat them,” Beveridge said. 

 
“I’ve continually challenged our guys, and I’ve been very public about the fact we’ve had a soft underbelly at times, but this is the pointy end of the season and for us to put on that gritty performance was outstanding. Adelaide deserve to be the number one team and the [title] favourites and all of those things. 

 
“They wanted to flex their muscles out there because they’ve been playing so well and we had to stand up to them tonight because our last performance against them was simply not good enough so we showed massive, massive backbone. 

 
“I think we showed we actually do deserve to be in the top four after that performance.” 

 
The win was a crucial one for the Hawks, giving them a thin cushion in second spot ahead of Sydney, who knocked off New Zealand on Sunday, and Perth who edged out Melbourne at home on Saturday. 
 
“I think every single team in the comp wanted us to lose tonight,” Beveridge said. 

 
“We lost two last week and if we lost tonight we’re on a slide. Mentally trying to pick the guys up, with the competition being so close, would’ve been really tough for us. 
 
“We’re still not [in the play-offs] yet, and we’re not going to think because we won on Saturday we’re there. There’s no way in the world we can go with that attitude because if we have that attitude we’re out. 

 
We still need to win at least one if not two games to stay in it but what it did was keep us in the fight. It keeps us there and it puts a lot of pressure on other teams as well.”</content>
