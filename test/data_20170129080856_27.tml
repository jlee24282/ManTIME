<content type="str">Its the  crossover showdown between heavyweight boxer Floyd Mayweather and UFC superstar Conor McGregor we’re all waiting for, and Mayweather says is likely to happen. 
 
After signing off his professional career with a points win over Andre Berto in September 2015 to take his record to a perfect 49-0,  the former five-weight world champion, who turns 40 next month, has in recent months been linked with a so-called ‘super fight’. 
 
After Irishman insists his next fight will be in a boxing ring, he has branded Mayweather ‘scared’, but Mayweather is keen for the bout to go ahead but has no timescale. 
 
He said, “That’s the only fight that will get me back in the ring. He’s going to do a job on his side and we are going to do a job on my side and hopefully all the fans in the UK come over and support me. 
 
“I don’t know (when it will be), I need to communicate with my team, the fight hasn’t been made yet, but it is all about entertainment so hopefully we can make it happen.”
