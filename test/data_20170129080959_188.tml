<content type="str">In defense of President Donald Trump’s desire to reduce voter fraud, I believe that everyone showing up at the polls to vote should have to present a special photo ID card that clearly indicates citizenship status. This card can then be scanned into a national database to capture important voter participation/​demographic data.

Also, with regard to protecting our southern border, we should locate/​construct military bases there as a way of utilizing scarce and existing resources in an efficient, effective manner. Our troops would be receiving valuable on-the-job training while defending our nation. Enlistment would, in all probability, rise. Our war on drugs would become highly visible. That, in itself, would serve as a major deterrent to those who would harm us.
