<content type="str">The results follow in the footsteps of the XC90&apos;s, which was the first auto from any manufacturer to score full points in the Euro NCAP Autonomous Emergency Braking vehicle to auto rear-end tests (AEB City and AEB Interurban). Interestingly, the Volvo XC90 was the first vehicle from any manufacturer to score full points in the Euro NCAP Autonomous Emergency Braking auto to vehicle rear-end tests (AEB City and AEB Interurban). Additionally, the models surpass the best overall score of any model tested a year ago, and now make Euro NCAP&apos;s top three best performing cars ever, all Volvos (including the XC90). 
 
The all new Volvo S90 saloon and V90 estate have earned five-star Euro NCAP  scores and did it easily racking up a score higher than any score recorded in 2016. 
 
According to Euro NCAP, the AEB Pedestrian tests have been designed such that they check the performance of the pedestrian-detection systems using three road-crossing scenarios, all of which would result in a fatal collision if the AEB system did not intervene. 
 
Like the XC90, both models also come equipped as standard with Volvo&apos;s City Safety suite, which works day and night identifying potential hazards such as vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists or even large animals. Volvo&apos;s success in the Autonomous Emergency Braking tests are aided by the advanced City Safety system, which is standard in all new Volvo cars. 
 
Malin Ekholm, Director of the Volvo Car Safety Centre at Volvo Cars Group, said, &quot;We work hard to ensure that our cars fulfil all safety requirements and pass all testing procedures that the ratings agencies develop&quot;.</content>
