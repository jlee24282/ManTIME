AKRON -- Summit County Prosecutor Sherri Bevan Walsh was sworn in Jan. 19 for a history making fifth term as Summit County Prosecutor. 
 
Walsh is the first Summit County Prosecutor in the past 60 years to be elected to five consecutive terms. 
 
Former Summit County Domestic Relations Court Judge Carol Deszo conducted Prosecutor Walsh&apos;s investiture. Judge Deszo retired from the bench earlier this month. 
 
In 2017, Prosecutor Walsh enters her 17th year as Summit County Prosecutor, surpassing former County Prosecutor Lynn Slaby, who served from 1980 to 1995. Former Summit County Prosecutor Alva Russell is the longest serving prosecutor in Summit County history, holding the office from 1936 to 1956. Walsh will accomplish that feat at the end of her fifth term. 
 
&quot;I want to thank Summit County voters for having the faith in me as their county prosecutor,: Walsh said. &quot;It has been an honor to serve them. My passion and mission has not changed since my first day in the office back in 2001 to make Summit County a safer and better place to live. Every day I am excited about coming to work and fighting for the rights of victims.&quot;
