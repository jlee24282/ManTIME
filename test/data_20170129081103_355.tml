<TEXT type="str">DUBAI ( ) - A decision by President Donald Trump to temporarily ban Yemeni citizens from traveling to the United States is &quot;illegal and illegitimate,&quot; authorities controlled by the Iran-allied Houthi group in Yemen&apos;s capital said. The war-damaged and impoverished country in the south of the Arabian Peninsula is one of seven majority Muslim countries whose citizens now face a 90-day ban on entering the United States while the U.S. administration says it studies ways to keep militants out.

The Houthi-controled news agency SABA quoted a foreign ministry source as saying the ministry was aware that such action is the sovereign right of the U.S. government.

But &quot;the source said emphatically that any attempt to classify Yemen or its citizens as a possible source of terrorism and extremism was illegal and illegitimate.&quot;

Yemen has been divided by nearly two years of civil war.

The Iran-allied Houthi group has de facto control of northern areas, including the capital Sanaa and the country&apos;s largest international airport, while the internationally recognized government is based in the south and east.

An official in that administration said on Saturday that it was &quot;dismayed&quot; by the visa ban.</TEXT>
