Chinese websites have again blocked searches for &quot;Fatty Kim the Third&quot;, as many Chinese mockingly call North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, with China&apos;s foreign ministry saying it did not approve of ridiculing foreign leaders. 
 
Chinese internet users began reporting last week that searches on the Twitter-like microblogging site Weibo and search engine Baidu for the expression returned no results, the normal sign that something is being blocked despite its wide usage. 
 
The term - which refers to the weight of Kim, his father and grandfather - was last blocked in September after neighboring North Korea&apos;s latest nuclear test. 
 
Kim is unpopular in China because of his country&apos;s repeated nuclear and missile tests. 
 
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said reports the government had banned the search term &quot;did not accord with the facts&quot;. 
 
&quot;What I want to stress is that China has always dedicated itself to constructing a rational, cultured and healthy environment for public opinion,&quot; Geng told a daily news briefing. 
 
China &quot;does not approve of insulting or ridiculing language to address any country&apos;s leader&quot;, he added, without elaborating. 
 
Both Baidu Inc and Sina Corp, which owns Weibo, declined to comment. 
 
China&apos;s internet regulator did not respond to a request for comment.</content>
