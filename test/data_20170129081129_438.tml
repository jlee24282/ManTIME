<TITLE>Strawberry Shortcake Berry Beauty Saloon - Best App for Kids</TITLE>
<TEXT>trawberry Shortcake Berry Beauty Salon puts Strawberry Shortcake and her friends in the salon chairs and kids in the shoes of the salon service providers, choosing outfits, giving manicures, and fixing hair. Its all sweet fun with quite a few options for creativity. Kids can take pictures of the makeovers and view them in each characters Fashion Diary. The app is designed with preschool attention spans in mind, including fun bubbles to pop while waiting for different activities to load. Kids do need good fine motor control to maneuver the characters and tools, though.\r

STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE BERRY BEAUTY SALON gives kids lots of options for creativity and role-play fun, including several characters, several makeover activities, and plenty of color and accessory options within each. Strawberry Shortcake fans and kids who enjoy dress-up play will adore this sweet app, which will entertain them for quite a while. Maneuvering the tools and the characters may require some trial and error or multiple attempts for little hands as they figure out how to line up the nail polish brush or to hold the character as they drag her into place. Theres no rush or stress, though, in the relaxing and fun salon.
