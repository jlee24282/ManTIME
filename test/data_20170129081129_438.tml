STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE BERRY BEAUTY SALON gives kids lots of options for creativity and role-play fun, including several characters, several makeover activities, and plenty of color and accessory options within each. Strawberry Shortcake fans and kids who enjoy dress-up play will adore this sweet app, which will entertain them for quite a while. Maneuvering the tools and the characters may require some trial and error or multiple attempts for little hands as they figure out how to line up the nail polish brush or to hold the character as they drag her into place. Theres no rush or stress, though, in the relaxing and fun salon.
