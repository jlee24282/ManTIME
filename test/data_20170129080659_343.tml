<TEXT type="str">The Board of Directors of the Montana East-West Shrine Game have approved the donation of $100,859 to the Shriners Hospital for Children in Spokane, Wa.

One-third of the sum will be retained for the local Baghdad Hospital Transportation Fund. The Spokane hospital is the sole beneficiary of the Montana Shrine Game, and has benefitted over $2,500,000 in the game’s history.

The 2016 game was held in Butte on the Montana Tech campus, with the West winning, 45-14. The East leads the all-time series 38-32.

The stop was the game&apos;s third in Butte since the game began rotating locations in 2010. The Montana Shrine Game has been one of the top performing games in the United States since beginning the rotation, donating over $700,000 in that span.

Events surrounding the 2016 game included: golf tournaments in Butte, Great Falls and Kalispell, a cheer camp, a screening clinic, a patient/player experience, a banquet, a high school athletic combine, a parade and a telethon.

“The 2016 game was a great success,” West coordinator Jeff Hartwick said. “We added some new events like the combine and telethon, which will continue to grow. The statewide golf tournaments are very successful.

&quot;The game atmosphere at Montana Tech was incredible. Due to the work of game organizers and board members, and the generosity of the game sponsors, the 2016 game in Butte was one of the most successful games in the United States this year -- and one of the largest donations ever from the Montana Shrine Game.

“We want to extend our appreciation to all the sponsors, fans, players, cheerleaders, coaches, family members, Shrine Hospital patients and representatives, the Shriners from all three temples in Montana, the board of directors, and the huge volunteer group that helped with every aspect of the event. It’s a state-wide team event, and the success of this game is due to all of these groups.”

The 71st annual Montana East-West Shrine Game will be played at Rocky Mountain College in Billings on July 15.

HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — Gabby Williams scored 19 points and grabbed 10 rebounds to lead top-ranked UConn to its 95th straight win, a 91-42 rout of Houston on Sunday.

The sophomore, coming off the first triple-double of her career, has scored and rebounded in double figures 16 times, including seven this season.

Katie Lou Samuelson and Kia Nurse each scored 16 and Napheesa Collier added 12 points and 10 boards for the Huskies, who are 20-0 for the 10th time in the program&apos;s history.

Freshman Jasmyne Harris had 14 points to lead Houston (8-13, 1-7 AAC), which has lost seven in a row after an 8-6 start to the season.

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The Minnesota Twins plan to honor former manager Tom Kelly with a bronze statue outside Target Field.

The team made the announcement at TwinsFest on Friday night. The statue will be unveiled this season, although the date is not yet set.

Kelly led the Twins to World Series titles in 1987 and 1991. His record of 1,140-1,244 places him first on the Twins&apos; managerial list in wins and games. Kelly retired after the 2001 season. His No. 10 was retired in 2012, the first Twins manager to be so honored.

At Target Field, Kelly&apos;s statue will join the likenesses of Kirby Puckett, Rod Carew, Harmon Killebrew, Calvin Griffith, Carl and Eloise Pohlad, Tony Oliva and Kent Hrbek.</TEXT>
