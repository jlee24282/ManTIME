<TITLE>Plenty of action but shy bidders at two weekend auctions</TITLE>
<TEXT>THERE were 91 homes opened up to potential buyers, sticky beaks and sellers in Mackay on the weekend but only two were auctions. 

Gardian real estate agency hosted these auctions, the first one at Glenella and the second at Blacks Beach. 

It was hot at Eden Court early and the team had an esky full of branded water for potential buyers. 

There were about 35 people at the auction of the large four bedroom, two bathroom and two garage home with a swimming pool. 

Despite the numbers there were only four registered bidders. 

But Gardian managing director Eric Rickman said there were more people interested in the home but hadn't sorted out their finances to buy it on the spot on Saturday. 

Without them auctioneer Russell Leonard started asking for bids but was forced to call the property in with bidders failing to put up their hands as the price rose to $645,000. But within five minutes there was an official offer to buy the home. 

Mr Rickman wasn't surprised as he said the business had had its best patch over the past three months since it opened in March 2013. 

He said his enquiries were up and the business had 19 settlements in December. 

One, or several, of those enquiries would have been by Paul Stibilj. He was a registered bidder at the Glenella auction but thought the property was a "tad overpriced. 

He said his family needed a bigger home because his son was moving back in.

After the auction he was off looking at more homes, on a mission to buy the right one. 

The Blacks Beach home with ocean views, a pool, six bedrooms, three bathrooms and three car garage was quieter with two registered bidders. 

But Mr Leonard started the bidding at $700,000 and also didn't receive a bid. However, the agents believe they had a serious buyer who just wasn't keen to jump into the market just yet.</TEXT>
