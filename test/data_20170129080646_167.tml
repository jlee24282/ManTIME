Kudos to the personnel at the Arizona City Fire Department. They are well trained, competent and compassionate. 
 
Last spring I called 911. Because of their fast response and quick assessment of his condition, they saved my husband&apos;s life. 
 
They were also concerned with my driving to the hospital. Our resident go-to guy, Bill Mahan, gave me a ride, called our son in Phoenix and waited until our son arrived. 
 
&quot;Thank you&quot; can&apos;t ever be enough for all the help.
