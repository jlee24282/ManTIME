<content type="str">Exeter Chiefs skills coach Ricky Pellow lavished praises on Italy centre Michele Campagnaro after his tremendous performance in the Anglo-Welsh encounter against Wasps.

Campagnaro scored hat-trick of tries as Exeter Chiefs went on to complete a 52-5 victory at Sandy Park that saw them climb to the pole position in Pool 2.

The 23-year-old last played for Italy in June last year but is likely to be included in the Six Nations squad based on his terrific performances for Exeter Chiefs.

&quot;It&apos;s been a solid set of recent performances from Michele and, while we are sorry to temporarily lose him from our squad, he&apos;ll be excited about bringing that form into the Six Nations to show what he can do,&quot; Pellow said.

&quot;It was a great performance from us and I&apos;m especially pleased with the defensive effort in the last 10 minutes to keep our line intact.&quot;

&quot;It&apos;s now in our hands but it will be a tough game as Bristol have turned a corner but we are anxious to progress to the next round.&quot;

Apart from Campagnaro, Mitch Lees, Stu Townsend, Sam Simmonds, Shaun Malton and Lachie Turner also crossed over for the home side while Will Rowlands was the lone try-scorer for Wasps, who fielded a young side.

Assistant coach Lee Blackett said: &quot;It was a great eye-opener for the young lads as it showed how tough it can be when you step up to the next level.

&quot;We had four guys who played for the under-18s last weekend but I&apos;m still disappointed with the result as we made too many individual errors in the first half.

&quot;I&apos;m proud at the way we reacted in the second half but Exeter were very clinical as they&apos;ve got massive strength in depth and they took their opportunities and we didn&apos;t.&quot;</content>
