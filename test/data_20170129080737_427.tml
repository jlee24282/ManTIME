<TEXT>Conference Championship NFL DFS Starting Points: Vegas Lines

You know that targeting the highest scoring games and particularly the teams with the highest implied totals makes sense in fantasy football. This analysis will highlight exactly which situations are the best to take advantage of and which you might want to avoid within those games. Well also highlight a game to use caution with as well a less obvious target.

Or at least that was the plan. With just two games on the final NFL DFS slate of the season, lets just break it down one at a time. Offense beat defense in this post-season, which is going to make for some great DFS.

Pittsburgh at New England

Total 51, Patriots -6

The Pats have enjoyed these high lines all season long, but typically with larger spreads. Its a little weird considering that New England has allowed the fewest points in the league and Pittsburgh is by far a lower scoring team on the road. The Patriots have been especially tough against opposing running backs, allowing just 83.5 rushing yards per game and four rushing touchdowns during the regular season. That doesnt bode well for superstar LeVeon Bell, who has rushed for 337 yards and two touchdowns so far in the playoffs. Hes been the safe road Steeler all season long, but given what weve seen from New Englands defense at home, Im having a hard time biting the bullet at $9,500. That leaves Ben Roethlisberger and Antonio Brown to do the heavy lifting if Vegas is right about the Steelers team total. Well, lets not forget about Chris Boswell, but you know what I mean. Big Ben and Brown are the safest way to spend on Steelers this weekend, though Boswell is sure to be a hot play as the cheapest kicker coming off a 6-FG game in Kansas City.

The real attraction here is the Patriots, starting with Tom Brady and Julian Edelman. Though the Steelers had allowed only 20 passing touchdowns during the regular season and ranked 30th in fantasy points allowed to opposing wide receivers, I think we have to take Vegas into consideration here. I am a tad worried about the ability of the Steelers to rush the passer, ranking ninth in sacks (38), but Brady is well protected and healthy enough to evade pressure as he showed last weekend vs. Houston. I like Brady because I think after a heavy dose of Dion Lewis last week theyll be looking to shake things up with some deeper passes this week. That could provide some additional upside for guys like Chris Hogan and Malcolm Mitchell if he plays this week. Edelman remains the safest Patriot receiver by a long mile.

LeGarrette Blount is another candidate for the Bill Belichick mix-it-up plan, as he was utterly disappointing vs. Houston last week (31 rushing yards). Pittsburgh allowed the sixth-most fantasy points to running backs this regular season and Blount has been overall better for DFS in home games. His price is nice, as they say, $500 below Dion Lewis, and I love Blount in tournaments. For that matter, Lewis is also a tournament-only play for me, though I think he will be over-owned based on last weeks heroics.

With all four of these teams being offensive powerhouses, where do you go for defense? All four rank 25th or lower in terms of fantasy points given up to opposing defenses. The price difference between most and least expensive is only $400, so Im not letting that drive me too much. I like a home team, and the fact that New England has allowed the fewest points per game makes them the best option on paper. Its a position that may have to break some rules this weekend, since there are only four teams to draw players from as it isavoiding an offensive player facing your defense may not be as optimal as usual.

Green Bay at Atlanta 

Total 61, Falcons -4.5

This is the highest point total Ive seen all season. But it makes some sense because among these four teams, the defenses of Atlanta and Green Bay are the most generous for opposing quarterbacks. Green Bay allowed the second-most passing yards per game (269), while Atlanta was right behind with 267 passing yards per game allowed. Both were top-seven in terms of fantasy points allowed to quarterbacks as well and allowed 31 passing touchdowns during the regular season. I think its a mistake to not use one of Aaron Rodgers or Matt Ryan as your cash game quarterback this weekend. Julio Jones was limited by Seattle last week, but still caught six of eight targets and a touchdown pass. Dont let his toe worry youhes going to play and with the leagues best WR matchup for fantasy (or worst secondary if you prefer), he should be a top play this week. Ryan has the ability to make Taylor Gabriel and Mohamed Sanu relevant too, which is also enhanced by the Packers defense. Sanu is the safer play while Gabriel is the more dynamic, volatile player. Use them accordingly.

With Rodgers, who appears unstoppable lately, you get the high volume floor and multi-touchdown upside. The issue is that without Jordy Nelson, the number one receiver is a moving target (see what I did there?). There are two tight ends, three receivers and a hybrid (Ty Montgomery) competing for Rodgers attention plus theres a chance Jordy is back. That makes Rodgers an easy play, but theres no one receiver I trust absolutely given what Ive seen lately. Devante Adams is the target leader with Nelson out, so hes the safest receiving play of the bunch while Montgomery is the most versatile of the bunch and can take advantage of both the poor secondary of the Falcons, as well as their generous run defense.

When it comes to the Falcons run game, Green Bays defense ranked 8th in rushing yards per game (94.7). Devonta Freeman and Tevin Coleman were a vicious two-headed monster last week against Seattle and should continue to find success on the ground as defenses have to keep Ryan and Jones honest. I still prefer Freeman to Coleman based on the home/road splits and the slightly higher volume he sees. That said, if you can build a lineup you love and Coleman is the back that fits, Im okay with him too. Options are limited to say the least. Either kicker is fine here, but I wont be rostering either D/ST from this game.</TEXT>
