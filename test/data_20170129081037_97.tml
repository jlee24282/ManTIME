<content type="str">After trailing archrival Saginaw Valley State for most of the second half, Northwood got a handful of huge plays from Matt Crowl down the stretch and hung on to beat the Cardinals, 64-63, by mere inches Saturday after Garner’s desperation shot from midcourt caromed off the back iron as time expired.

While the Timberwolves’ players came together at halfcourt in what resembled an impromptu mosh pit, Rekeweg almost immediately bolted for the student section at Riepma Arena, sharing smiles and high fives with his team’s frenzied fans.

In a matchup of two teams for whom the 2016-17 season hasn’t gone quite like they had hoped, SVSU rode a big first-half run to a five-point halftime lead, then clung desperately to that lead for most of the second half, while the Timberwolves patiently and methodically chipped away.

NU finally took its first lead of the second half at the 5:06 mark, and it was white-knuckle time for both teams’ fans from then on out, as the momentum swung wildly back and forth the rest of the way.

While Crowl stole the show late, Zach Allread was equally huge for Northwood, scoring all 15 of his points in the second half to help the Timberwolves keep pace.

According to Crowl, the biggest difference was simply playing better defense than NU has been lately.

[...] the Timberwolves closed the gap entirely, as Allread’s third triple of the half knotted the score at 53-53 with 7:55 to play.

A couple of minutes later, Crowl gave NU its first lead of the second half, 56-55, with a free throw at the 5:06 mark, setting the stage for a thrilling stretch run.

Wells answered with a driving layup to give SVSU the lead back, then later drained a 3-pointer to give the Cardinals a 61-58 edge with 1:19 to go.

[...] after Hall hit a jumper for Saginaw Valley, Crowl drew a foul while crashing the offensive boards and calmly sank two free throws to trim SVSU’s lead to 63-62 with 29 seconds left.

On the other end, Weaver missed a contested layup, but Crowl was fouled away from the play and went back to the line with 2.6 seconds remaining and a chance to give the Timberwolves the lead.</content>
