<TEXT type="str">I am all for making the streets safe for bicyclists and pedestrians (“Putting Tulsa on the Go Plan,” Jan. 15). I’m all for it right after the streets are restriped so we can see the median and the lights are turned on again.

The danger of dark streets, and particularly the interstate where vehicles travel 65-70 mph, makes it very difficult to see exits and, more important, people. There have been four tragic pedestrian deaths recently.
