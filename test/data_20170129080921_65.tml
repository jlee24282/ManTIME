In India, we celebrate the spring season with Basant Panchami on February 1. It is an occasion to worship knowledge. 
 
My dear countrymen, Akashwani will be adding new dimensions to 'Mann ki Baat.' 
 
This has been broadcasted in regional languages as well. It has been received well by many states. People are writing to me. 
 
My best wishes to you all, Thank you.

Indian Coast Guards complete 40 years on 1st February 2017. I thank all jawans, Coast Guards for serving the nation. 
 
With 126 indigenous ships, 62 aircraft, we are among the world's four biggest Coast Guards. Women are also successfully performing in Coast Guard duties, be it pilot, observers or handling hovercrafts. 
 
Maritime security is a very important job here.

If you form a habit of cheating, there will be no desire to learn. Trying to cheat requires time, creativity. Use it for better purposes. See every challenge as an occasion. March ahead with this mantra. 
 
11.25 a.m. 
 
To cheat is to be cheap. So please do no cheat. If the examiner catches you, it will take a bad turn. If they do not catch, you'll always carry the burden throughout your life. 
 
11.23 a.m. 
 
I urge parents to accept rather than expect. Our expectations from our children should not be too much.

Sachin Tendulkar challenged his own records, which is inspiring. 
 
11.16 a.m. 
 
Competing with others can make you unhappy and jealous. Complete with yourself and you will be energised & more determined to excel. 
 
11.11 a.m. 
 
Knowledge matters more. Remain stress free to score more marks in exams. If you're relaxed, you can recall more. 
 
11.07 a.m. 
 
Examinations should be celebrated as festivals. They should bring out the best in you. 
 
This is the season of exams. Exams are trying times for the entire family. 
 
Panic prevails during exam times. It is more depressing than inspiring. 
 
One tends to forget important things at exams. We may recall it after coming out of the exam hall, since we get relaxed after the exam is over. We need to be relaxed during the exam too. 
 
11.05 a.m. 
 
I congratulate all soldiers, families, who won gallantry awards. 
 
The valour of these soldiers is extraordinary. 
 
We also feel proud and get inspired. 
 
Many soldiers in Kashmir have been martyred due to avalanche. My deepest condolences. 
 
11.02 a.m. 
 
We celebrated our Republic Day with great enthusiasm. Our Constitution reminds us of our duties towards nation. 
 
As it is a cultural festival, Republic Day in a festival of democracy as well. 
 
We need to dwell more on our duties and rights. The more we introspect on this issue the better. 
 
Duties and rights must be stressed equally at all levels. Tomorrow is 30th January. The death anniversary of our beloved Bapu ji. We observe it as Martyrs' Day. We observe 2 minute silence in honour of all martyrs. Let it become a spontaneous practice on this day.</TEXT>
