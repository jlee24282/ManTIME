<TEXT type="str">Prime Minister Narendra Modi &quot;On February 1, Indian Coast Guard will be completing 40 years. On this occasion, I want to congratulate all the officers and its personnel for their contribution towards the country,&quot; Modi said in his &apos;Mann Ki Baat&apos; radio programme. &quot;This is a matter of pride that Indian Coast Guard, with its 126 ships and 62 aircrafts, continues to be among the four biggest Coast Guards in the world.&quot;

Mentioning that the coast guards were continuously guarding Indian coasts from various threats and difficulties, the Prime Minister said they were also taking initiatives towards the cleanliness of costal areas.

&quot;Last year, the Coast Guard personnel had taken the responsibility of keeping coasts clean, due to which thousands of people became part of it,&quot; said Modi.
