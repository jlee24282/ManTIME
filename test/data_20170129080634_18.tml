Have you ever noticed yourself or anyone biting nails? It is commonly caused by anxiety. It is a strange way indeed, but it is perhaps one of the most common ways that both children and adults do when they feel tension. 
 
Many have the urge to stop this habit, but it is just something that we cannot completely get rid of especially that this usually happens unknowingly when your mind is puzzled by anxiety. It is not entirely clear why nail biting occurs but it’s considered an impulse control problem as well as a habit. Some people believe that most likely nail biting is instinctual, left over from our time as primates, and that when we’re stressed these instincts come out against our will. Biting your nails is just one of many habits that the body seems to do when it’s stressed. Some people pick at skin, while others pull out hair (this is known as trichotillomania). Different effects to different people.
