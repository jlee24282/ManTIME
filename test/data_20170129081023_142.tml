<TEXT type="str">The guild recognised the musical, starring Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, with its Darryl F Zanuck Award for theatrical motion picture production at a ceremony on Saturday night. 
  
For seven of the past eight years, the winner of the producers&apos; Zanuck prize has gone on to win best picture at the Academy Awards. Last year was an exception: The Big Short won the guild award, while Spotlight got the Oscar. 
 
The Oscar nominees for best picture announced earlier this past week echoed the producers&apos; best picture nominees, with the exception of Deadpool, which made the cut with producers but not the film academy. 
  
Zootopia won the Producers Guild prize for animated feature.
