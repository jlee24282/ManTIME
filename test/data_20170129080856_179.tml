<content type="str">FOOTBALL: Melbourne City&apos;s bid for back-to-back W-League titles faces its next sudden death clash in Canberra next week after the finals make-up was completed on Sunday afternoon. 
 
As a club, City is already hunting its third trophy of the season after the senior men&apos;s side won the FFA Cup in November and the juniors won a thrilling National Youth League final on Saturday. 
 
City women will enter the playoffs brimming with confidence having now won back-to-back games for the first time in almost two months. 
 
After defeating Brisbane Roar in a crucial contest last Sunday, City downed Newcastle 2-0 in Coffs Harbour on Friday night in a game in which a win for the Jets would have sent them through to the finals at City&apos;s expense. 
 
Previously City had endured a frustrating six-game winless run, but the evidence from the past eight days suggests the side currently led by player-coach Jess Fishlock still has what it takes to win its semi-final against Canberra, despite United sealing top spot. 
 
Canberra defeated Melbourne Victory 5-1 on Saturday before Sydney women squandered the opportunity to win the premier&apos;s plate today, suffering a shock 5-2 loss to Adelaide at Coopers Stadium. 
 
Sydney will now play in Perth next week after the Glory secured second spot with a 1-0 win over Western Sydney, the victory coming courtesy of a 92nd minute goal from Caitlin Doeglas. 
 
No team has won back-to-back W-League championships. 
 
City and Canberra have played twice this season, with the away team recording a 2-1 victory on both occasions.</content>
