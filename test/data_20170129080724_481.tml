<TEXT type="str">&apos;HOBA&apos; Lets Users Book a Boat Trip Whenever They Want  
 Taking the time to book a boat trip often requires extensive planning and scheduling, but &apos;HOBA&apos; aims to change things up. Designed with an on-demand interface like Uber, &apos;HOBA&apos; enables users to chat directly with captains that are in the area, choose a time to set sail, pay directly from the app and much more. 
Taking to the water is a great way to explore a new location when you&apos;re on vacation, but travelers are often only privy to preset trips or what&apos;s available through their hotel. &apos;HOBA&apos; makes it far better to book a boat trip without having to follow the traditional course in order to get a more exclusive experience and never feel like they&apos;ve missed out on a great time.</TEXT>
