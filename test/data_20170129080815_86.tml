This week offered sheer intergalactic delight in the form of breaking Star Wars news. Episode VIII , the next film in the third trilogy, has been given an official title : The Last Jedi . The internet was immediately ablaze following the announcement. What does the title mean? And who is the last Jedi ? And what will he or she do? Amid all the chaos, though, something even more interesting has come to light in reference to the title. When you combine it with the name for Episode VII ( The Force Awakens ), the two titles actually make a complete sentence. Once you see it, you can&apos;t unsee it. And furthermore, if the theory behind it is true, everything could change.

All this time, it seemed like Episode VII was making an entirely different statement: that the Force had been dormant for some time, and for some inexplicable reason — a ripple through the galaxy, perhaps — it had emerged from that state. If this theory is correct, though, it means two things. For one, maybe the Force was always awake, and in this trilogy, it is performing that very action and awakening the &quot;last Jedi.&quot; And second, if the first two installments of this trilogy are two parts of a sentence, then there&apos;s a strong chance Episode IX will complete it. &quot;The Force awakens the last Jedi&quot; . . . to defeat Supreme Leader Snoke ? To breed a whole new generation of powerful Jedi knights? These seem a little long for an Episode IX title, but hey, it&apos;s gotta be something along those lines. Sadly, we&apos;ll have to wait a while for the next installments ; The Last Jedi doesn&apos;t hit theaters until Dec. 15 of this year, and Episode IX isn&apos;t slated until 2019. Settle in, everyone.
