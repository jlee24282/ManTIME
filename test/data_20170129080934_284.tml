<content type="str">Penzance is seeing a jump in Council Tax in a bid to safeguard its historic pool and local services.

It comes after the Town Council voted for a precept increase of 50.98% from this April - resulting in a £64.50 increase for the average Band D home.

Councillors say the extra money, from the town council part of Council Tax, will help to fund local amenities and services, such as public toilets, weed removal and parks - and also protect the future of the iconic Jubilee Pool.

Nigel Pengelly, part of the Jubilee Pool steering group and a town councillor, said: &quot;The pool&apos;s important, not just for those that actually go to the pool, like the locals and the families that enjoy going there - but also for visitors.

&quot;Last year was one of the best year&apos;s we had in Penzance for visitors, and I think most came, if not to go in the pool, to look at the pool.

&quot;It&apos;s such an iconic thing - some people aren&apos;t in favour of the pool. They say they never go to the pool, so why should they pay for it?

&quot;Some people also say they have to pay for the public toilets - but they don&apos;t go to them.

&quot;But taxation isn&apos;t selective like that, I&apos;m not involved in the UK Space Exploration Programme, but I&apos;m still paying tax for that.&quot;

Altogether, the Town Council&apos;s precept will rise from £838,572 to £1,298,233 - a £459,661 increase.

Major causes for the growth in spending include the need to improve services recently taken on from Cornwall Council, as the county council continues to devolve services to local town councils in a bid to save £196 million by 2019.

Town Councillor Dick Cliffe, Chair of Finance, said: &quot;Nobody likes increasing the precept and especially by nearly 51%, councillors have agonized over it.

&quot;The Town Council is trying to save services and service standards that residents&apos; value. These are under threat because of Cornwall Council&apos;s dire budgetary constraints and its need to focus resources on delivering statutory services like adult care and childrens&apos; services.

&quot;Penzance &apos;came to the table late&apos; as far as devolution of services to Cornish towns is concerned. We are now picking up costs similar towns picked up costs in the past. It means our precept is now catching up those of Bodmin, Newquay, Truro and Falmouth. Even after the increase our precept is still lower than these comparable towns.

&quot;Having set this much higher precept Councillors and Council staff now need to deliver results.&quot;

According to the Finance &amp; General Purposes Committee, they also saw an increase thanks to that of £32,000 in planned expenditure due to recruitment of an administrative apprentice, increased legal work related to devolution of services, pension contributions (addressing a shortfall) and website improvements.

The Committee will also lose £21,000 income from Cornwall Council&apos;s Council Tax Support Grant in 2017/18.

The overall impact was the need for an increase of £53,</content>
