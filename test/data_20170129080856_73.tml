<TEXT type="str">Marina Beach, where the protest against the ban on jallikattu took place, has now turned into an epicentre for youth movement, and fearing that it might lead to something else, Section 144 was invoked along the beach. It prohibits people from gathering in large numbers or holding meetings of any sort. 

There has been huge security deployment at the beach since morning, and ADGP south Chennai said the prohibition will not apply to families who have come there for recreational purposes.</TEXT>
