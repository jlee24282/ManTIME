<TEXT type="str">The house that I live in has five rooms in its center. That center, built in the mid-1800s, leaks heat the way an old wooden dam leaks water — all the time, in innumerable places. 
 
But in mid-November, two workmen from HE-Energy Solutions came and calked hundreds of those leaks. They installed new weather-stripping on all my doors, wrapped pipes and replaced more than 20 of the light bulbs in the house with new LED bulbs that will use much less energy and last for years. 
 
It took the two men about four hours to do all the work. It cost me $124, but all the weather-stripping, all the LED bulbs, all the calking and insulating wrapping on my pipes were included in the price. 
 
The work should save me about $400 a year on heating oil and electricity, if I remember to keep the back door closed on cold days. (“Do you think you’re living in a barn?” my parents used to ask rhetorically when I left the door open as a kid. I guess I still do think that.) 
 
And it’s a very small, useful way of reducing the energy I use. The less energy, the less need for new transmission wires and natural gas generators and heating oil pumped out of the ground. I know it’s only a tiny fraction of everything, but it’s my tiny fraction. 
 
And those fractions add up. The 2015 Report of the Connecticut Energy Efficiency Board estimates that in that year, all the energy efficiency programs in the state took nearly 3.3 million tons of carbon dioxide out of the air, equivalent to taking 786,694 cars off the road. 
 
“We should think of this as recycled energy, energy that’s returned to the marketplace,” said Diane Duva , director of energy demand at the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection . “It’s like when we recycle aluminum. We get to use it again.” 
 
Each year, about 40,000 Connecticut homeowners avail themselves of the work I had done, through Energize CT’s Home Energy Solutions program. To learn more, or to sign up, go to energizect.com or call 1-877-WISE-USE. 
 
A few years ago, Ridgefield First Selectman Rudy Marconi had Home Energy Solutions stop up at least some of the energy leaks in his home, built in the 1890s. He figures it now saves him at least $75 a month in energy costs. 
 
And, other being at home when the workmen arrived, it required no work on his part. 
 
“It’s a very smart thing to do,” Marconi said. “It’s good for the environment and it saves you money. It’s a win-win situation.” 
 
While the state utilities help administer the Home Energy Solutions program, Connecticut residents pay for it, with a few pennies a month from every utility bill put aside for energy efficiency programs. 
 
“It’s really something you can do right now,” said Mitch Gross , spokesman for Eversource. “It helps the state control energy costs and it makes your house more comfortable. It keeps the warm air in in the winter and the cool air in in the summer.” 
 
Gross also pointed out that the program installs equipment like aerators to faucets that can reduce water use in a home by as much as 1,000 gallons a year. That saves money on water bills and also helps the community at large. 
 
“The last time I checked, we were still in a drought,” Gross said. 
 
Another way of thinking of energy that’s not used — and is therefore available to be used at a later date — is as alternative energy. It’s like wind power without the turbines, solar power without the panels. 
 
“It’s by far the cleanest source of energy we have and the cheapest,” said energy consultant Joel Gordes . 
 
“It costs 4 cents a kilowatt hour to conserve energy and 17 cents an hour to purchase it.” 
 
Chris Phelps , executive director of Environment CT , said that Connecticut is a national leader in its energy efficiency programs. 
 
“What we’re now seeing is that while energy use overall in the state is leveling off, or even declining slightly, the state economy is growing,” Phelps said. “We’ve been able to break the linkage between use of energy and economic growth.” 
 
A new study shows that nationwide, about 2.2 million people are employed in energy efficiency work, Phelps said. That’s more than in any other sector of the U.S. energy production. 
 
“It’s not just about power plants anymore,” he said.
