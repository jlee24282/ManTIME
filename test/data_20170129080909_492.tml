<TITLE>China-Art Performance/New Year</TITLE>
<TEXT>Local folk artists captivated audiences with an extravagant display of molten iron splashing in the air Friday night in north China's Hebei Province to celebrate the Chinese Spring Festival. 

Molten iron splashing in the air to create a unique light display is a unique folk art known as "Dashuhua". It was staged in the town of Nuquanin in Yuxian County, Zhangjiakou City. 

The town has a history of over 500 years in "Dashuhua" performances during the Lunar New Year. 

Performers threw over 1,000 degree of molten iron onto the cold brick wall to create a breathtaking firework-like display to usher in the new year and to extend wishes for success. 

Apart from the local audience, the performance also attracted visitors from Beijing, Tianjin and from the neighboring Shanxi Province. 

"We came to watch the Dashuhua performance on Chinese New Year's Eve. It is astonishing and brings out new perceptions for bettering our lives," said an audience member. 

Before the molten iron was ready to be displayed, various performances set the mood with lantern dancing, folk dancing and other traditional cultural performances.</TEXT>
