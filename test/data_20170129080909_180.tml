<content type="str">The Hamilton Place Rotary Club has partnered with Operation Warm for the past seven years to provide local students with new winter coats through the club&apos;s annual Warm Coats for Cool Kidz project. 
 
This year, 180 coats were delivered to nine elementary schools: Woodmore, Bess T. Shepherd, Harrison, East Lake, Spring Creek, East Side, Hillcrest, Orchard Knob and East Ridge. 
 
A new winter coat can be more than just a coat. It helps build self-esteem and tells a child, &quot;You&apos;re worth it.&quot; A new winter coat can inspire pride and joy within a child, while also increasing peer acceptance. It can change a child&apos;s life and empower them with greater self-confidence and increased school attendance.
