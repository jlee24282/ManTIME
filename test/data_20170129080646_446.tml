New Delhi: Consider exams as pleasure not pressure, Prime Minister Narendra Modi told students in his monthly Mann Ki Baat radio address on Sunday, adding that gaining knowledge was a more important goal than gaining marks. 
 
&quot;Expectations are the root cause of all sorts of problemsâ€¦ Competing with others can make you unhappy and jealous. Compete with yourself and you will be energised and more determined to excel,&quot; he said. 
 
&quot;Concentrate on how to work hard and increase your knowledge bank. There are few who get good marks in exam but fail in real life,&quot; he said. 
 
Modi also paid a tribute to soldiers who died in an avalanche in Jammu and Kashmir. &quot;When we were happily celebrating Republic Day, soldiers were killed in an avalanche,&quot; he said. &quot;I salute them.&quot; 
 
In the beginning of the address, he appealed to the youth to observe two-minute silence in remembrance of Mahatma Gandhi on January 30, Martyrs&apos; Day. He also asked them to share the story of this year&apos;s Ashok Chakra winner on social media.</content>
