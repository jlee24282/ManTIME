<TEXT type="str">The body of a Tamil Nadu fisherman, who went missing along with another person after their fishing boat allegedly capsized near Pudukottai coast was washed ashore at Devipattinam hamlet near here today, fisheries department official said. The marine police identified the victim as Bhagyaraj(34) of Jegadapattinam village in Pudukottai district. The fate of other fisherman Vignesh (19) from the same region is unknown, the official said. The duo had ventured into the sea on January 21, when their boat capsized amid choppy waters stirred by strong winds, near Jegadapattinam. As they did not return to the shore, a search and rescue operation was carried out for six days to locate them but in vain, Pudukottai district Fisheries department Assistant Director Sekar said. The marine police retrieved the corpse of Bhagyaraj and sent it to the government hospital. However, the marine police are still searching for the body of Vignesh, he said.</TEXT>
