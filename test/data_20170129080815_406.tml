LE MARS — The Le Mars Community School District Foundation honored two district staff members as Employees of the Month for January. 
 
Beth Collins and Amy Davis, secretaries in the high school principal’s office, were surprised with the honor Jan. 13 during a mid-morning presentation. 
 
The two were nominated for the award by LCS Associate Principal Neal Utesch. 
 
In the nomination, Utesch wrote, “Both of these ladies take on any task that they are asked to do. If they do not know how to do something, then they figure it out with no questions asked. 
 
“They are the face of the building that welcomes all community members, students, and staff on a daily basis. They are dedicated to the students and to the school and bring a comfort to all who come into the office. 
 
“Not only are they great at their job, but they work well together. They complement each other greatly as they work together to make sure that the day runs as smoothly as possible. 
 
“They are hardworking, fun to be around, and make the day better with their winning smiles and positive attitudes.” 
 
Collins and Davis have been the high school secretaries for four years. 
 
Both women said they were surprised by the honor, and also by the fact that everyone was able to keep the presentation a secret from them.</content>
