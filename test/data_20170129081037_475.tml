During 2016, the Sudan Humanitarian Fund allocated $38.8 million through the first allocation and the Reserve for Emergencies. 
The first allocation targeted needs triggered by new and protracted displacement in Darfur, South Kordofan, West Kordofan and Blue Nile. Focus was placed on gender and protection mainstreaming in parts of South Kordofan and supporting nutrition assistance in El Ni√±o-affected areas in eastern Sudan. This allocation also supported the refugee response in White Nile. 
The Reserve for Emergencies allocated $9.6 million to life-saving activities, addressing new humanitarian needs due to internal displacement, refugee influxes and a spike in acute malnutrition. In Q4, a health and WASH response to the acute watery diarrhoea outbreak in eastern Sudan was funded.</TEXT>
