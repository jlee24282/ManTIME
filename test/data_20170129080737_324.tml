<TEXT type="str">Ippei Watanabe set a world record in the men&apos;s 200-meter breaststroke on Jan. 29 in a meet in Tokyo, finishing in a time of 2 minutes, 6.67 seconds. 
 
A second-year student at Waseda University, Watanabe, 19, competed in the Rio Olympics where expectations were high that he would win a medal. However, he could only place sixth in the final. 
 
At the Kosuke Kitajima Cup 2017 held at the Tokyo Tatsumi International Swimming Center, Watanabe improved by 0.34 second, the previous world record held by Akihiro Yamaguchi of 2 minutes, 7.01 seconds, which was established in September 2012.
