The South Lake High School HOSA (Health Occupations Students of America) team attended the 2017 HOSA Regional Competition at Keiser University on January 21st. Students competed in a variety of healthcare-related events that included performing skills in front of judges, and taking rigorous knowledge tests. The skill events included CPR/First Aid, CERT skills, EMT skills, Veterinary Science, Nursing Assisting, Home Health Aid, Forensic Medicine, and Career Health Display. South Lake High had numerous top 5 finishers who were recognized on stage, and the top 3 finishers in each event have advanced to the HOSA State Competition, which will take place in April at the World Center Marriott in Orlando. We congratulate our wonderful South Lake High HOSA students for their accomplishments, and wish them well at the next level of competition.
