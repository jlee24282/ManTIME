Competing  in  the  fourth  annual  Okanagan  Valley  Throwdown  (OVT)  Jan.  28  to  29  at  the  South  Okanagan  Events  Centre  felt  like  another  Saturday  at  the  gym  for  Cory  Hilditch. 
 
Hilditch,  a  Penticton  resident,  was  among  350  athletes  to  compete  in  the  crossfit  event  co-presented  by  Hoodoo  Adventures  and  Evolution  Athletics,  and  fuelled  by  Muscle  MLK  Canada.

“You  wake  up,  you  go  to  the  gym,  you  lift  something  heavy  to  start  and  then  do  some  conditioning,”  said  Hilditch,  catching  his  breath  after  a  long  workout.  “Hang  out  with  a  group  of  guys  or  girls  that  are  at  the  gym  and  kind  of  just  one  big  family.” 
 
The  OVT  is  programmed  uniquely  using  movements  that  include  weightlifting,  powerlifting,  medicine  ball  and  kettlebell  training,  rowing,  running,  skipping,  plyometrics,  and  gymnastics.  While  the  event  is  geared  towards  fitness  enthusiasts  who  already  take  part  in  crossfit,  either  competitively  or  recreationally,  the  Throwdown  appeals  to  athletes  of  all  abilities,  especially  first  time  and  recreational  competitors. 
 
Hilditch  said  it  was  “pretty  cool”  to  compete  in  his  hometown. 
 
“There’s  not  a  whole  lot  of  peole  from  here  that  are  actually  doing  it,”  he  said.  “To  be  part  of  Penticton  and  being  in  this  arena  …  seeing  the  Vees  play  on  this  rink  all  the  time,  it’s  cool  to  be  down  on  ice  level  and  feel  what  it’s  like  being  in  an  arena  with  fans  watching,  cheering  you  on.” 
 
The  attracts  individual  men  and  women,  recreational  groups,  competitive  and  masters  (ages  40 + )  teams  from  across  Western  Canada  and  the  US. Beach City Crossfit, a local gym, has nearly 20 athletes competing.
