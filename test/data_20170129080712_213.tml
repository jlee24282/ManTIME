<TEXT type="str">Britt Cox and Matt Graham have claimed twin World Cup victories in Canada, marking the most successful day for the Australian mogul skiing team.

Overall leader Cox won the women&apos;s event in Calgary - her third triumph of a standout season.

Shortly afterwards, Graham saluted in the men&apos;s event in Calgary, edging out local hero and overall World Cup champion Mikael Kingsbury, widely regarded as the most-successful World Cup mogul skier.

&quot;Today was an amazing day for Australian mogul skiing,&quot; he said. &quot;To share the top step of the podium with my teammate Britt was really special. She is having a great season so I am super stoked for her.&quot;

&quot;I skied really well today in a challenging course. My goal was the execute my runs and lay down two clean jumps and tidy turns each run, so to do that makes the win more satisfying,

&quot;I really felt like I won today, so this gives me a lot of confidence going into the rest of the season,

&quot;It was pretty bizarre being the last to go and up there by myself. It was windy with a cross tail-wind,

&quot;There was the sound of the wind and I just got in a good head space,&quot; he said.

Cox, 22, said she was particularly thrilled to wear her green jacket and the yellow bib reserved for the World Cup leader on the first day of training in Calgary, which just happened to be Australia Day.

&quot;I was really happy with my skiing today and glad to execute in all three rounds,&quot; Cox said. &quot;Especially as the conditions changed throughout the day.

&quot;It feels unreal to share the top spot on the podium with Matt. We train together all year round and I&apos;m stoked to see his hard work paying off,&quot; said Cox.

There are seven more World Cups before the world championships in early March in Spain.

In other action, Australian slopestyle skier Russ Henshaw finished third in the World Cup round in Seiser Alm, Italy.</TEXT>
