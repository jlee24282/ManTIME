<TEXT>A performance by giant ants on Warrnambool's Civic Green was a big hit with children. 

There was no problem getting young volunteers to help with the performance of Ants on Warrnambools Civic Green on Saturday and Sunday.

Youngsters were keen to collect cushions representing oversized bread crumbs for the ants who were arranging them in patterns across the Civic Greens lawn.

While the giant ants with their other-wordly clicking sounds might have at first seemed daunting, the children soon overcome any reservations to become keen ants assistants.

Ants was performed by Polyglot Theatre which described the work as an immersive, interactive performance.

The theatres Stephanie Riddel said the performance, which has travelled throughout Australia and Asia, invited children on a journey of discovery with ants.

Children also got the chance to make ant antennae to wear to add to their experience.

Among the fans of performance was Jake Goddard, 9, of Warrnambool who said working with the ants to lay out the mock breadcrumbs made him feel brave.

Jake said he liked ants because of the way they grouped together and were able to go underground.

Ants was a free event presented by the Warrnambool Art Gallery and the Lighthouse Theatre.</TEXT>
