<content type="str">Natalie Portman has paid tribute to Sir John Hurt. 
 
The 35-year-old actress co-starred with John, 77, in &apos;V for Vendetta&apos; and &apos;Jackie&apos; and paid an emotional tribute to him following his death after a battle with pancreatic cancer. 
 
She said: &quot;I&apos;m so extremely sad to hear of John&apos;s passing. I was lucky enough to make two films with him - both of which were taken to the next level because of his performances. He was the most talented actor, and also a deeply good and funny and poetic and smart and warm human being. I send my love to his family at this terrible time, and join his fans in watching his films that we are lucky enough to have forever.&quot; 
 
&apos;Jackie&apos; director Pablo LarraÃ­n added to Entertainment Weekly: &quot;John was invincible. Unflinching. Eternal.&quot; 
 
A number of other stars have also paid tribute to the star, with Mel Brooks tweeting: &quot;I was terribly sad to learn of John Hurt&apos;s passing. He was truly a magnificent talent ... No one could have played The Elephant Man more memorably. He carried that film into cinematic immortality. He will be sorely missed. (sic)&quot; 
 
Bonnie Wright, who played Ginny Weasley alongside Hurt&apos;s wand-making alter-ego Garrick Ollivander in &apos;Harry Potter&apos;, simply wrote: &quot;John Hurt. What an acting legend. Rest in peace dear Sir. Wand shopping won&apos;t be the same without you. (sic)&quot; 
 
David Schneider starred alongside Hurt in 1999&apos;s &apos;You&apos;re Dead&apos; and said he was so taken by him he forgot his lines. 
 
He wrote: &quot;Sad re John Hurt. I was in a film with him and he was so mesmerising I kept forgetting to act and just watched him. A genius &amp; lovely man (sic)&quot; 
 
&apos;Lost Boys&apos; star Kiefer Sutherland said: &quot;My deepest sympathies to John Hurt&apos;s family friends and fans. He was a dear friend. (sic)&quot; 
 
Sharon Stone said: &quot;God speed to John Hurt, a legendary and good human being (sic)&quot; 
 
And 59-year-old screenwriter Richard E. Grant wrote: &quot;So so sad to have lost such an extraordinary talent and friend. Sir John Hurt R.I.P. (sic)&quot;</content>
