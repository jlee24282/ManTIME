<content type="str">The Western Sydney coach said the Kearyn Baccus incident has already been put to rest and was stunned to leave Brisbane without a point on Saturday night. 

Western Sydney Wanderers coach Tony Popovic has dismissed the midweek drama surrounding midfielder Kearyn Baccus as a factor in their 2-1 defeat at the hands of Brisbane Roar on Saturday night.

The Wanderers looked all but certain to cling on for a point before former Socceroo Brett Holman struck three minutes into injury-time to steal a heart-stopping victory.

It left the Wanderers in eighth spot on the A-League ladder, while Brisbane climbed to third after the win ahead of their home clash with undefeated Sydney FC at Suncorp Stadium on Friday night.

As promised, Baccus started the match having been publicly backed by Popovic earlier in the week, soon after it was revealed he would face court in February after being charged with assault. Police will allege Baccus punched a man during an altercation near Sydney Airport.

Popovic said the matter had no bearing on the preparation or outcome and was quick to brush aside any suggestion of such after the match.

&quot;We had no dramas. We had no dramas with Kearyn. That was dealt with. He was fine,&quot; Popovic said. &quot;He played very well. I thought he had a very good game, like most of the team tonight.&quot;

Western Sydney were forced to play with 10 men for a crucial final 10 minutes of the match. The Roar were quick to up the energy on a humid night in Brisbane and had the stroke of luck they needed as the clock ran down and Holman&apos;s strike slipped through the hands of keeper Vedran Janjetovic.

Defender Scott Neville was marched after his second yellow card, which was a straightforward booking compared to the first when he was ruled to have made contact with Thomas Broich as he scooted towards the box.

When asked if he thought that incident deserved a card, Popovic replied: &quot;The referee did. That&apos;s all that matters, doesn&apos;t it?&quot;

Janjetovic appeared to keep his side in the contest in the second half as he rattled off a series of high-quality saves, making his final play of the night a bitter pill to swallow.

Popovic was sympathetic but said he felt his stopper had little work to do prior to the attempt at saving Holman&apos;s 20-yard heave.

&quot;It&apos;s part of football. He&apos;s been fantastic since he&apos;s come in. He had very little to do today. He saved a few balls from outside the box. They had many shots from outside the box, which shows how good our structure was,&quot; he said.

&quot;In the end, it was a shot from outside the box that was our undoing. That&apos;s how it goes sometimes. For us at the moment, an unfortunate error like that from the goalkeeper results in a goal. An outfield player can make a mistake and recover.&quot; The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.</content>
