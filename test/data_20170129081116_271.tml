<content type="str">Raising their voices once again, this time against the Muslim ban, stars like Mark Ruffalo, Mark Hamill, Ava DuVernay, Michael Moore, Miley Cyrus, Chrissy Teigen and others spoke about controversial anti-Muslim immigration ban in the US. 
 
US President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Friday afternoon to suspend the entry of refugees to the US for 120 days and imposed an indefinite ban on refugees from Syria. A 90-day ban was also placed on citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. 
 
According to a report by Reuters, Gillian Christensen, spokeswoman for Department of Homeland Security said that the ban applied to green card holders as well. 
 
Star of HBO&apos;s show Silicon Valley , Kumail Nanjiani, who is a Pakistani immigrant, said, 
  
As someone who was born in Pakistan I can tell you coming into America is VERY difficult. A #Muslimban accomplishes nothing but hate.

You&apos;re saying to a billion people &quot;You&apos;re all the same. You&apos;re all dangerous to us.&quot; Children hear this. You breed evil here &amp; everywhere.

Indian-American actor Kal Penn, better known for his role in Kumar and Harold movies, who has also worked closely with Obama administration, called out a troll and started a fundraising page for Syrian refugees in his name.

Speaking about Iranian filmmaker Asghar Farhadi being barred from attending the Oscars 2017 ceremony owing to the ban, director Ava DuVernay quoted parts of his 2012 Oscar acceptance speech for A Separation .

According to a report in Variety , the Academy of Motion Picture Arts &amp; Sciences issued a statement slamming the ban: &quot;The Academy celebrates achievement in the art of filmmaking, which seeks to transcend borders and speak to audiences around the world, regardless of national, ethnic, or religious differences. As supporters of filmmakers — and the human rights of all people — around the globe, we find it extremely troubling that Asghar Farhadi, the director of the Oscar-winning film from Iran A Separation , along with the cast and crew of this year’s Oscar-nominated film The Salesman, could be barred from entering the country because of their religion or country of origin.&quot; 
 
Mark Ruffalo, who has been very vocal about opposing Trump&apos;s policies and decisions, be it Standing Rock protests or the anti-Trump rally in New York on the eve of Presidential Inauguration, shared images of protests outside New York&apos;s JFK airport with the caption, &quot;The day the music died.&quot;

Documentary maker Michael Moore apologised to the Muslims of the world on behalf of American citizens. 
  
To our Muslim neighbors in the world: I &amp; tens of millions of others are so very sorry. The majority of Americans did not vote 4 this man.

Here are more reactions: 
  
Donald Trump has no fucking clue. His desperate need for self aggrandizement is destroying US. Nothing will fill his black heart. #MuslimBan

Day 1, @POTUS talks &apos;maybe&apos; going into Iraq to take the oil. But Iraqi refugees who #SupportTheTroops ? &apos;We don&apos;t want them here.&apos; #Criminal

1. Trump&apos;s #MuslimBan is against the law. The 1965 Immigration &amp; Naturalization Act eliminated national origins as a basis for immigration.

We&apos;ve lost something very precious. 
 
And traded it for a cowardly, foolish illusion of safety. 
 
I&apos;m ashamed. #MuslimBan

And the fact that they did it on Holocaust Memorial Day... 
the most vile thing I&apos;ve seen in a long, long time. #MuslimBan

I moved to America 32 years ago. Yesterday was the first day I felt ashamed to be part of this country.
