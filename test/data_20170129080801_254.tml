<TEXT type="str">Tevin Panchal made two baskets all game. The last one will be remembered for some time to come. 
 
Sacred Heart Prep took an 11-point lead into the fourth quarter of its nonleague boys&apos; basketball with visiting Piedmont on Saturday. 
 
The Highlanders rallied and took a two-point lead with 12 seconds remaining. 
 
The Gators inbounded, went the length of the court, and Panchal hit a 3-pointer as time expired to give Sacred Heart Prep a 48-47 victory. 
 
It&apos;s the type of game the Gators (9-9) lost at the beginning of the season but are now turning the tables. 
 
Tuesday&apos;s 6:30 p.m. West Bay Athletic League contest at Pinewood becomes an important game. Both teams are involved in a three-way tie for second place, with Priory, and the win over Piedmont (11-9) will help when it comes time for the Central Coast Section seeding meeting. 
 
Sacred Heart Prep opened the season 1-6, with three of those losses to current league leaders and two more by five points or less. 
 
Over their past nine games, the Gators have won four times by three points or fewer. 
 
Winners of five of its last seven, Sacred Heart Prep has an opportunity to maintain its momentum. 
 
After traveling to Pinewood, the Gators still have a home game against Priory and road games at Menlo and Eastside Prep. They can certainly influence the final standings. 
 
Eric DeBrine led Sacred Heart Prep with 15 points and Kyle Stalder added 1</TEXT>
