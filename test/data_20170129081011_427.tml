<content type="str">Adam Lallana &amp; Liverpool 

One of the transfer stories which has popped up over the past few weeks has centred on Liverpool midfielder Adam Lallana

 

Lallana has been excellent for the Reds for most of the season and the likes of the Times have previously reported that his performances have triggered Barcelona and PSG to have a look at the England international

 

On Sunday the Express extend the list of Lallana’s suitors to include Tottenham

 

Whether that holds any weight is up for discussion but in any event it’s all rather immaterial as the Express believe that Liverpool and Lallana have agreed terms over a new deal

 Reds continue to lock up stars 

Last week the big contract news out of Anfield was that Philippe Coutinho has signed a new five year deal

 

According to the Express Lallana is now set to follow suit as the following is reported

 

Adam Lallana has agreed a new four year £120000 a week deal ending fears that he could be lured away from Anfield this summer

 

Tottenham Hotspur boss Mauricio Pochettino was keen on reuniting with the 28 year-old who he managed at Southampton

 

Lallana’s current contract expires in 2019 while he’s scored seven Premier League goals already this season

 

Hopefully this news will lift the spirits of Liverpool fans who have seen their side win just one of their last eight matches as they’ve been knocked out the EFL Cup and FA Cup in back to back matches</content>
