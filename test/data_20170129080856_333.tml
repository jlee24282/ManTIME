&quot;The Janiza prayer and interment is slated for tomorrow (Sunday) by 10am.&quot;

The aide added that Pa Masaba fore-told his death and was prepared for it.

Bello said: &quot;Baba had told us that his time was up. He told me personally during his last moment that he has completed his divine assignment and was ready to meet his creator.

&quot;He told us to remain dedicated to the cause of Islam and urged us all not to deviate from all his teachings on righteousness, piety and total submission to the will of Allah.

&quot;He warned us to shun adultery, but that we should marry our women because it is ‘Hallal’ before Allah.&quot;</content>
