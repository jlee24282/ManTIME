<TITLE>CAF IN IT FOR MONEY</TITLE>

T  HE Confederation of African Football (Caf) is milking some of the poorest continental countries. 
 
It is time the federation change its selection criteria, as far as Afcon hosts are concerned. They should stop picking countries, based on whether theyll benefit financially from the tournament. 
 
Its great and honourable to host such a big event, with guests coming from the continent  and even as far away as Europe  to support Africas premier tournament. 
 
But when the tournament ends, poorer states are left to pick up the pieces  with nothing to show for it from Caf. 
 
You see, when Caf awards hosting rights to a country, they expect it to have a Local Organising Committee (LOC) that will include members from the football federation and government to get commitment from all relevant parties. 
 
Well, this is also what Fifa requires before going ahead with permission to award a hosting rights certificate. 
 
But the difference is Caf expects the host nation to renovate stadiums (if not build new ones), upgrade airports and road infrastructure using that nations money. 
 
This is good for the citizens of that country because they wouldnt have had their roads and airports renovated, and business booms for hotels. 
 
All this aside, it left a bitter taste in my mouth when we arrived in Gabon, landing at the Leon Mba International Airport in Libreville, to be surrounded by abject poverty, more now than in 2012. 
 
Our short drive to the Chinese-owned Latoille Hotel was an eye-opener to how opposition parties in the country had made a valid point by calling for the boycott of the competition  to prevent from taking place in their country. 
 
Gabon is still in a bad state, and their currency (Xaf) has collapsed to its lowest levels. 
But President Ali Bongo Ondimba insisted on continuing with the competition. 
 
Some locals even told this reporter that Gabon would benefit nothing from Afcon proceeds. 
 
They say Asians in the country are the ones making money because they own hotels and taxis to transport tourists across cities. 
 
And this was a valid point, as I didnt see any need to build the Stade de Port-Gentil in the outskirts of town  some 25km away from under-resourced masses. 
 
I wonder whose decision was it to abandon the 100 unfinished houses built around the stadium. 
 
There was the Stade de l-Amitie in Libreville, which was renovated after being first built during the 2012 Afcon, when Gabon co-hosted the tournament with Equatorial Guinea, another poor state. 
 
Unlike the Fifa World Cup, Afcon doesnt come as a catalyst for new and improved facilities to support development of the game. 
 
Thats because Fifa donates money to the host nation and helps monitor development of the game in the country. 
 
Remember, Fifa helped Safa with money before the 2010 World Cup to build its headquarters? 
 
But I guarantee you foreign nationals will be the ones to reap the rewards from the 2017 Afcon tournament in Gabon. 
 
This, as their companies own hotels, their contractors built new stadiums and upgraded existing ones  and they are the ones who also own shops in the city. 
 
The only benefit for the Gabonese population will only be their employment salary. 
 
But Ali Bongos government is the beneficiary of these partnerships, greater commercial activity and investment from sponsors, broadcasters and big companies. 
 
I can go on and on with how Issa Hayatous Caf is reaping from the poorer companies. 
 
I wonder, who will use all the stadiums built in Gabon, especially the one with a hotel at the Stade de 
Port-Gentil  and when will they host another big event? 
 
This looks like a big chunk of money just down the drain!</TEXT>
