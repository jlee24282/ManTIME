<content type="str">ISLAMABAD, Jan 29 (APP): Around 90 per cent of Pakistani 
population would have access to 3G networks while 80 per cent 
of them are estimated to enjoy 4G services by year 2020. 
Amid heavy investments, 3G coverage in Pakistan – from all 
operators combined – reached 65 per cent of population by 
2015 while it stretched to around 75 % of population by 
mid-2016, the facts revealed in Global System Mobile Association 
(GSMA) report. 
A web-based portal, ProPakistani, quoting the report said 
key findings of report are 3G coverage reached 75 per cent of 
Pakistani population by mid-2016, 4G coverage reached 18 per cent of 
Pakistani population by mid-2016 and 29 per cent of Pakistani 
population use mobile Internet (2G, 3G or 4G). 
The report said mobile broadband uptake has been slow, mainly 
due to fact that many citizens either cannot afford or do not know 
how to use devices and services that deliver mobile broadband. 
With time, mobile broadband (3G and 4G) users in Pakistan are 
estimated to grow to 60 million by 2020. 
With continued investment – it is estimated that investments 
for 3G network expansion will reach $ 2.8 billion over next four 
years (not including any additional spectrum costs) – and it will 
enable around 90 per cent of the population with 3G access, said the 
report. 
With only two operators, 4G roll-out has expanded rather 
slowly and reached 18 per cent of the population by mid-2016. 
However, with Mobilink acquiring Warid and Telenor beginning 4G 
services, 4G coverage is expected to rapidly increase to 80 per cent 
of the population by 2020. 
The report said today’s users will accelerate their 
transition to mobile broadband from 2G services, with improved 
network coverage and more affordable smartphones with time. 
By 2020, mobile broadband will be accessed by about a third of 
the population, albeit predominantly those migrating from 2G. 
Given the lack of fixed line broadband connectivity in 
Pakistan, the digital divide – between those that have access to the 
internet and those that do not – will remain substantial. 
Pakistan is an emerging digital society. Digitization is still 
in its early stages, and is used mainly as a tool for accelerating 
socio-economic development, particularly in improving digital and 
financial inclusion. 
However, through its Vision 2025 strategy, Pakistan aims to 
complete its transition to a knowledge-based economy, creating a 
globally competitive and prosperous country that provides a high 
quality of life for all its citizens. 
Vision 2025 aspires to a more advanced digital society. Digital 
development can drive increased engagement between individuals and 
institutions, provide huge growth potential and productivity gains 
in all sectors, and enable more advanced and innovative government 
services. 
Pakistan’s mobile sector is in a unique position to support the 
country’s digital development for three key reasons: 
Mobile can connect more people than any other technology, 
particularly in underserved rural areas, mobile can provide secure 
access to a variety of digital services such as health and education 
and mobile can provide a platform to provide financial inclusion, 
engaging many people in the economy for the first time. 
In parallel, innovative services that run over mobile networks 
can support many of the government’s Vision 2025 objectives, such as 
increasing enrolment in education, improving food security and 
driving private sector growth. 
Mobile operators in Pakistan are playing their part in 
innovating to deliver the services that will accelerate progress 
towards the goals of Vision 2025 – and in doing so generating 
growth, jobs and investment in wider economy. But they have an 
opportunity to do more. 
Three key areas require immediate attention: a competition 
policy that considers all market players, not just telecoms service 
providers, in a technology-neutral environment aimed at preventing 
bottlenecks and exclusionary conduct; clear and simplified licensing 
practices based on function rather than technology or legacy 
industry structures, which can accommodate the rapidly changing 
market and encourage investment and innovation; and a new framework 
for physical network cooperation (including network and spectrum 
sharing) that is light-touch and focuses on general competition 
principles and transparency. 
There is a real opportunity for the government, institutions, 
mobile operators and the wider mobile industry to work together to 
make the regulations a better fit for modern digital ecosystem, the 
report maintained.</content>
