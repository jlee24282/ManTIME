<TITLE>PASSHE review to consider options including school closings and mergers</TITLE>
<TEXT>Lagging finances and enrollment decline have prompted Pennsylvanias state university system to undergo a strategic review that could eventually result in the merger or closure of one or more of its 14 member institutions, according to state system officials.

The Pennsylvania State System of Higher Educations current organizational and funding approach is unsustainable, Chancellor Frank T. Brogan said in his prepared remarks delivered in an annual State of the System address Thursday.

Thats not just philosophical, its mathematical, Brogan said at PASSHEs Board of Governors meeting. And its only going to get worse if we dont do something about it.

Brogan noted the reorganization of public university systems in other states, including the merger or closure of institutions.

Is that where we are headed? Brogan said. Thats a question I cant answer today, nor can anyone else.

California University of Pennsylvania is a charter member of the State System, becoming a part of the system in 1983.

State System spokesperson Kenn Marshall told the Herald-Standard that the system hopes to have its organizational review completed by the end of 2017, adding that the system currently has a request for proposal soliciting consultants to work on the review.

That consideration cant be off the table going into this review, Marshall said of merging or closing one or several state universities.

Marshall stressed that the review will be comprehensive, focused on finding solutions by reviewing payroll and other procedures.

Were going to be looking at the way we do everything, Marshall said.

Marshall added that the State System must plan to attract more nontraditional students with new educational programs catering to part-time and adult students, as well as making it easier for community college students to transfer to state universities for their third and fourth collegiate years to obtain a bachelors degree.

These are the kinds of things we need to do, Marshall said, adding that declining Pennsylvania high school graduation rates have also hurt state universities.

Pennsylvanias public high school four-year adjusted graduation rate increased from 83 in 2010-11 to 84.8 in 2014-15, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.

Marshall said that the State Systems funding appropriation is still $60 million less than it was prior to the 2008 recession despite funding increases from the Legislature in the past two years. He also cited competition from the states 300-plus postsecondary schools as another factor in declining state university enrollment, specifically noting Penn States 24 campuses and the University of Pittsburghs five campuses throughout Pennsylvania.

Cal Us enrollment has declined sharply since peaking at 9,483 in fall 2011, according to State System data. Its enrollment has dropped 20.35 percent from fall 2011 through fall 2016, the sixth-largest decline among the 14 state universities in that span. Only two state universities, West Chester and Slippery Rock, have seen their enrollments increase over the same span.

Thats the reality of the real world, Chair of Cal U Council of Trustees and Washington County Commissioner Larry Maggi said of Brogans announced consideration of merging or closing state universities. The fit survive.

A 1979 Cal U graduate, Maggi said the university is Washington Countys third-largest employer.

Its very important to us, Maggi said.

But Maggi observed that high school students in southwestern Pennsylvania are entering lucrative industries such as HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning) and trucking that dont require a four-year degree.

On the same morning of Brogans State of the System address, Maggi was at Penn Commercial in Washington as the school announced a partnership with Lennox and unveiled plans for its new HVAC lab.

Theres a demand for that, Maggi said, adding that higher education has not adapted to the local demand among gas companies and other employers for workers with particular skills.

Maggi indicated that Cal Us Council of Trustees had discussed strategies to attract more students on a limited basis in recent years.

Its a combination of everything, Maggi said of discouraging factors like lagging state funding, greater postsecondary school competition and the issue of student debt. Its almost like the perfect storm of things going on.</TEXT>
