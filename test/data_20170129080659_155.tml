Tennessee-based Correct Care Solutions, the contractor that employs health care workers at the Mesa County Jail — and which is due for a contract renewal, possibly later this month — faced legal scrutiny before being named in the civil suit filed by the family of Tomas Beauford. 
 
The company, which employs health care staff at facilities in 38 states, is listed as a defendant in scores of lawsuits across the U.S. In 2015, it was named in a suit filed by the family of Jennifer Lobato after she died in a Jefferson County jail cell after waiting hours for medical attention. The case remains ongoing. 
 
In Beauford’s case, attorney David Lane wrote: “A common thread in (several civil suits against the company) … is that CCS and related companies ignored obvious signs and symptoms to deny inmates access to necessary emergent care. Such deficiencies are the custom, practice and standard operating procedure of defendant CCS and its related entities.” 
 
Company spokesman Jim Cheney wouldn’t comment on Beauford’s case specifically, but said Lane’s claim was ludicrous and that the company’s employees are trained under policies that follow National Commission on Correctional Healthcare guidelines. 
 
“To make the broad assertion that it is our standard practice to ignore the needs of our patients is simply ridiculous and completely without merit,” Cheney wrote in an email. 
 
Cheney said policies are in place to deal with patients who refuse medication. In the case of low-functioning patients, employees are expected to try to identify their guardian, then follow local protocol for mental health patients. 
 
Correct Care Solutions has a year-to-year contract with the county, according to Mesa County sheriff’s spokeswoman Megan Terlecky. 
 
The company has held the contract since 2015, although it also acquired other groups that held the contract dating back to 2002. Mesa County commissioners are expected to vote on renewing the existing contract sometime soon.</TEXT>
