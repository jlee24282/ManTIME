<TITLE>FA Cup: Chelsea in comfortable 4-0 home win over Brentford</TITLE>
<TEXT>Branislav Ivanoviccelebrated what may well be a farewell goal in Chelseas comfortable 4-0 home win over Brentford to help his side through to the FA Cup fifth round. 
 
The 32-year-old has been heavily linked with a move to Zenit, which would bring to an end his nine-year stint at Stamford Bridge, but he netted the third on Saturday to offer a timely reminder of his quality. 
 
Brazil international Willian opened the scoring with a curling free-kick early onas the Premier League leaders underlined the gulf in class againsttheir second-tier visitors. 
 
Pedro doubled the Blues advantage with acool finish midway through the first half, with Brentforddigging in to avoid further first-half punishment. 
 
Willian celebrates putting Chelsea ahead 
Despite showing a much higher tempo and more attacking intent after the break, Dean Smiths side could not seriously trouble a Chelsea line-up showing nine changes from the weekend win over Hull City. 
 
And the match was ended as a contest when substituteIvanovic drilled in the third, beforewinningthe penalty from which MichyBatshuayi completed the scoring,keeping Chelsea on course for an eighth FA Cup crown following a 10th consecutive home win. 
 
Chelsea took the lead in the14thminute when Pedro won a free-kick on the edge of the box andWillian, off a short run-up, bent it home from 20 yards. 
 
John Terry, sent off in the 4-1 win over Peterborough United in the previous round, sent a scuffed shot wide soon after, with Chelsea enjoying plenty of the ball. 
 
They made that possession count when Pedro,who netted twice in that third-round triumph, finished through DanielBentleys legsfromBatshuayisdefence-splittingpass. 
 
It could have got worse for the Bees before the interval, butBatshuayisscrambled close-range effort was kept out on the line by a recovering Bentley, who also produced a superbsave to deny Ruben Loftus-Cheek. 
 
Brentford who earned a replay against their illustrious neighbours when they met in 2013 emerged for the second half with renewed vigour and LasseVibe should have done better when the ball fell for him six yards out, with Asmir Begovic smothering at the Danesfeet. 
 
Yet it was still Antonio Contes men who carried the greater threat and only the crossbar denied Loftus-Cheek as he attempted to lift an angled shot over Bentley. 
 
Begovicwas called into action just past the hour mark to thwart NicoYennaris, before Smith sent on star striker Scott Hogan for the final 25 minutes, the Bees top scorer having been left on the bench amid reported interest from West Ham. 
 
But it wasIvanovicwho made the impact offthe benchas hedrilledlow into the net from inside the box followingsome excellent link-upplay with KurtZoumaand Pedro. 
 
The Serbia international was then fouled in the box byYoann Barbet andBatshuayi made no mistake from the spot to wrap up a convincing triumph.
