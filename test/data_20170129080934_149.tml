<TEXT type="str">DEAR EUGENIA: On Dec. 8, 2016, my little dog fell ill with an inflamed trachea. After the vet gave her a steroid shot, she rallied and then began to fail. I am guilt-ridden that I did not take quicker action to take the 90-minute drive to a nearby larger city to help her. The local vet took the weekend off, and in that time, my little pup couldn&apos;t breathe and her heart and lungs failed. 
 
Could I have saved her? She passed Dec. 10 at 4:20 p.m. She was born Sept. 8, 2006. It seemed to be a boondoggle of missed communications and my delayed reaction, for which my regrets are profound. Was her passing pre-ordained, or did I really mess up? -- Distraught Pet Owner 
 
DEAR DISTRAUGHT PET OWNER: I chose your email firstly because I am a dog lover who has been fortunate enough to have several tiny teacup pups grace my life. A vast number of small dogs have trachea problems, and many have a similar fate as your little pup. 
 
Secondly, I wanted to let people know that a pet’s natal chart is just as revealing as yours or mine. I make a point to ask for the birth data of the dogs I bring home to ensure that they will be a good fit for my family as well as to see if any health issues are revealed that will help me look out for the animal&apos;s best interest. 
 
After looking at your pup&apos;s chart, it is obvious that she was prone to problems with the trachea, lungs and inflammation, and I highly doubt given the transits that she was going through in December that she could have bypassed her fate. More than half of her chart was under siege, with many indicators pointing to a sudden and unexpected ending. 
 
Had you reacted sooner and headed to the big city, she would have been put through greater stress. Being in the comfort of her home with you by her side would have been her choice. 
 
As animal lovers, it’s difficult to let go of our pets; at the same time, we know their lifespan is short. Don’t let this loss deter you from giving another little critter a chance to have a loving home and you as a companion. It will do you both a world of good. If there is a doggie heaven, it will make your pup proud of you. 
 
DEAR EUGENIA: I was born May 6, 1973, at 3:47 a.m. Would you please give me some insight on romantic relationships? I have been told previously that Cancers would be an ideal match, but I dated one off and on many moons ago, and one more recently, and they really threw me for a loop. I wouldn&apos;t dare date another! 
 
I always find myself mentally and physically attracted to Aquarians, but know from experience and astrology that they are probably the worst sign for me. I also find myself attracted to Geminis and Scorpios, but I don&apos;t think either would be a good match due to the twin&apos;s split personality and the scorpion&apos;s moods. 
 
I feel my best matches through experience are Capricorns, but they tend to be hard to figure out, as they don&apos;t share or express their feelings easily or clearly. I don&apos;t mean in a deceitful way -- they just don&apos;t know how to express themselves, which leaves me confused. 
 
I am currently interested in someone born Dec, 28, 1959. I also feel like I could be very compatible with a Pisces. What do you think? -- Taurus 
 
DEAR TAURUS: You should never go by Sun signs. That is why astrologers offer astrological compatibility charts. No one’s chart is composed of one sign. For example, you are a Taurus by Sun sign, and although you do have your natal Sun, Mercury and Venus in that sign, you have strong Aries, Gemini, Cancer, Libra, Sagittarius and Aquarius influences. Although Capricorns do mix nicely with the Taurus and Cancer in your chart, the area of your chart that deals with relationships doesn’t bode well with a goat. 
 
What I am trying to tell you is that your chart is like your fingerprint, and to find a good match you must consider all the planets and luminaries and their placements in both charts to see what’s favorable and what isn’t. 
 
No relationship is perfect, but if you are both willing to work together to build something special and you are aware of the flaws that might hinder your relationship, you can strengthen your bond. 
 
Regarding your Capricorn man: He thinks like a Sagittarius and loves like a Scorpion. The planets and luminary he has in Sagittarius (Moon, Mercury, Mars and Jupiter) fall in an area of your chart that deals with learning lessons; therefore, he is probably in your life to teach you something. The comparison, although decent, shows limitations along with some deception. 
 
Astrologically, I feel you can do better, but if you are both willing to work toward establishing an equal relationship, you may overcome the limitations that appear. 
 
DEAR EUGENIA: Is my life going to get better? Will I ever meet someone to share my life with? 
 
I am a widow, born Sept. 14, 1951, at 10:10 a.m. I retired early due to illness. I&apos;ve been alone for 14 years, dealing with trying to live on disability and taking care of two grandsons. That stress alone has made life miserable. 
 
I try to think positively, and I am thankful I manage to pay the bills and put food on the table. I&apos;m tired of being lonely. I would like someone to share good times with, but I want someone who won&apos;t run when bad times hit. -- Lonely Widow 
 
DEAR LONELY WIDOW: Anything is possible, but first you must get past the couple of years that have beaten you down so harshly. You have been facing some major limitations, and that can make it difficult for you to get out and meet people. 
 
The next couple of years do hold greater opportunities for you, but you will have to get organized if you want to take advantage of what’s out there for you. Socializing is the most important thing; however, that can be difficult when you are caring for little ones and you don’t have money. 
 
Between now and the fall of next year, it’s important for you to take the time to explore your options and look for help in your community and organizations where other grandparents like yourself have been given the task of raising their children’s children. This appears to be a growing phenomenon, and one that requires great strength and courage. If there isn’t such an affiliation in your community, start one or look for one online. 
 
If you can get this part of your life in order, you will be able to surround yourself with the support and help you need to have a little “me time.” You will find what and who you are looking for next fall. Nothing will change without help. Take the steps to make it happen.
