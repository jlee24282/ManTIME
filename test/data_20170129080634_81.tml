FRANCONIA - It&apos;s been a long time coming, but big league ski racing has arrived at Cannon Mountain. 

Last weekend, the Franconia Ski Club hosted two FIS-level men&apos;s giant slalom races on Baron&apos;s Run at Cannon&apos;s new Mittersill facility, and UNH held the alpine events of its winter carnival on Baron&apos;s Run and the adjacent Taft Training Slope Friday and Saturday, drawing top collegiate racers from throughout the Northeast, along with a few past and current members of the U.S. Ski Team. 

&quot;This is a game changer,&quot; Franconia Ski Club coach Ryan Boissonneault said of the training and racing venue at Mittersill, which has been in the works since 2012. &quot;The U.S. Ski Team guys were helping out Friday with our kids who were training. They&apos;re really good role models.&quot; 

Six members of the U.S. Ski Team&apos;s Europa Cup men&apos;s group raced in both last weekend&apos;s events and the UNH carnival. They also trained on the Taft slope Thursday, preparing for their next race circuit, a series of NorAm races in Colorado, which includes some speed events. 

&quot;Thursday&apos;s training was absolutely phenomenal,&quot; said Chad Wolk, assistant coach for the U.S. Ski Team group. &quot;We had a 12-gate Super-G on Taft, and the guys took eight or nine runs in an hour and a half.&quot; 

The Mittersill venue has been a cooperative effort between the Franconia club and partner Holderness School, the state-owned ski area at Cannon, and the U.S. Ski and Snowboard Association (USSA). Mittersill was designated a USSA training site in 2015. 

Baron&apos;s Run, part of the original Mittersill Ski Area, which opened in 1945 and closed in the 1980s, was widened and graded, with snowmaking added. The trail is designed as a giant slalom and Super-G course. The Taft Training Slope, which is wide enough to accommodate multiple training courses simultaneously, and adjacent Valar T-bar were opened this season. 

&quot;Baron&apos;s is a really cool hill. It definitely has a European feel,&quot; said Wolk. &quot;It&apos;s got enough of a pitch and is long enough that you can be creative with the set (of a course). It has some tactical challenges in the middle, then a long flat at the bottom. It penalizes if you do make mistakes.&quot; 

Funding for the $4 million project came from the USSA Facilities Foundation, a federal Northern Borders Regional Commission Development Grant, the Kelly Brush Foundation, the Macomber Family Foundation, and more than 500 distinct gifts from individuals and families. 

&quot;The smaller need that the Mittersill Project originally hoped to address was the lack of appropriate terrain on which to train giant slalom (at Cannon),&quot; said FSC President Christina Valar Breen. &quot;Little did we know that our hopes for a partially dedicated training hill would produce world-class results. FSC now has venues commensurate with the quality of its development program, and the East has a new alpine ski racing resource, right in the heart of New England.&quot; 

UNH will host the NCAA finals at Mittersill in March, with the men&apos;s and women&apos;s giant slalom slated to be held on Baron&apos;s Run March 8 and the slalom on Taft March 10. 

Last weekend&apos;s races were the first held on Mittersill in several decades, and the local ski racing world is excited about the prospects for the future - both for the chance to see great racing and for the training opportunities it opens for young ski racers in the region. 

&quot;We are so lucky to have this venue in our backyard,&quot; said Ivar Dahl, snow sports director for Holderness School, and a former Franconia Ski Club racer and longtime coach. &quot;Mittersill brings a wider variety of terrain, ample room, the ability to run full length GS. variability, and more interaction with coaches, teammates, and visitors. It&apos;s the ultimate playground for alpine ski racers.&quot; 

It&apos;s not just the coaches who are excited about the opportunities Mittersill presents; the club kids who are there on the hill training alongside collegiate racers and U.S. Ski Team members - and watching them ski - are liking the new normal. 

&quot;The other day, we trained next to UNH kids, and I&apos;ve seen some U.S. Ski Team racers warming up,&quot; said Nolan Sweeney, age 13, who lives in Littleton and trains with the FSC Academy. &quot;The hill is really great. You know it&apos;s a good hill with the U.S. Ski Team is training here.&quot; 

It seems likely those U.S. Ski Team racers will continue showing up at Mittersill when they&apos;re in the area. 

&quot;Everything we&apos;ve seen here has been positive,&quot; said Wolk. &quot;People are excited to have racing here. Everyone in the East should come here and train.&quot;
