<TITLE>Vegan meringue kisses to sweeten your coffee</TITLE>
<TEXT>Israeli innovation is behind a new meringue kiss sweetener that can double up as a replacement for sugar in a hot drink or a low calorie sweet treat of its own. 
 
Lampados International, a family-owned company in Caesarea which specializes in tabletop sweeteners and health products, has announced that it is launching Liteez, a next-gensweetener, at the ISM show in Cologne, starting today throughFebruary 1, 2017. 
 
The sweetener is shaped like a meringue, is egg-free, sugar-free, and vegan. 
 
The meringue kisses can be added to a hot drink and will melt when stirred. Two Liteez contain about two calories instead of 20 calories in one teaspoon of table sugar. 
 
The idea was to craft a whole new concept for a healthier, tasty, and indulgent sweetener to simply create a new experience for coffee and tea or as a casual snack, says Noam Kaplan, CEO of Lampados. 
 
The patent-pending vegan meringue kiss is a plant-based snack, free from allergens such as eggs, gluten, lactose, or nuts, and contains only six simple ingredients. 
 
Many consumers crave something sweet both in and with their coffee, says Kaplan. Our new kiss fulfills both needs for a delicious, low-cal sweetener or as an indulgent dessert, without compromising on taste and while helping with weight management. 
 
Liteez was developed in collaboration with Practical Innovation, Israel, an award-winning global innovation company. 
 
Our mission was to help a traditional sweetener company make a completely novel product that takes the concept of sweet indulgence to a unique level, says Tal Laizer, CEO of Practical Innovation.This is not just a new sweetener but an entirely new look and feel a complete 3D flavor experience. 
 
Liteez uses a vegetable protein that has the ability to foam like eggs to help create the desired kiss texture and form. Sugars functionality is replaced with prebiotic fibers to form a stable foam and maintain the kiss shape, while being highly soluble in hot drinks, such as coffee or tea. 
 
We hear a lot about sugar tax andsugar reduction. At the end of the day, consumers seek healthier sweetening choices, but they dont want to skip indulgent experience, says Kaplan.
