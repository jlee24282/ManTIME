<TEXT type="str">By TAUNTON — When Kelly Moreno realized her family dog Rosie was missing she immediately took to Facebook asking for help by creating a #findrosie Facebook page to spread the word.  
 
It didn&apos;t take long before an outpouring of help arrived for Moreno and her family, with more than 100 people actively searching for the 2-year-old pitbull and lab mix, hundreds of people sharing and following the search for Rosie on Facebook and almost 1,000 posters spread throughout the city.   
 
But these people helping were not just friends of the Morenos, in fact it was mostly strangers to the family who just wanted to help reunite the Taunton dog with her family.  
 
&quot;To be honest I was really shocked that the search for Rosie blew up on Facebook,&quot; Moreno said. &quot;I was honored and humbled by it and it really showed me how special the Taunton community is.&quot;  
 
Over the next three weeks and three days Rosie would face a snowstorm, hunger and wandering the city of Taunton in search of home — but nothing was stopping the community from finding her.  
 
&quot;Whenever I started to give up someone on Facebook would be right there to pick me back up,&quot; Moreno said. &quot;People would share their stories of lost pets being found with me and it was so helpful.&quot;  
 
The #findrosie Facebook page, which had updates on Rosie, new leads on the search and a network of support for the family, gained more than 500 followers.  
 
&quot;People began recognizing me around town,&quot; Moreno said. &quot;I would be at Dunkin Donuts and someone would say, &apos;Hey you&apos;re Kelly, Rosie&apos;s owner. I really hope you find her soon.&apos;&quot;  
 
On Dec. 16, Rosie was on a doggy playdate when a gate was accidentally left open, Moreno said. When no one was looking Rosie began to wander off.  
 
&quot;By 10 o&apos;clock that first night there were almost 30 cars in the area searching for Rosie,&quot; Moreno said. &quot;And many of those people were strangers.&quot;  
 
As time went on more and more people became attached to Rosie and her story.  
 
&quot;Rosie is a unique dog,&quot; Moreno said. &quot;She can go from being super playful, to a lap dog instantly. When she plays it is nonstop, her favorite toys are basketballs and soccer balls. She is really gentle too — she loves little kids.&quot;  
 
During the search the family also got help from Missing Dogs Massachusetts, who had heard about Rosie.  
 
Clothes were put out for Rosie to track the scent home, her favorite toys (basketballs and soccer balls were spread across town) cameras and traps were set up, and during this entire time people continued to post on the Facebook page saying they were praying for the return of Rosie, had been out looking for her or just asking for the most recent update.  
 
&quot;I don&apos;t know if it was our love as a family for her or me and the family constantly posting, that made people so dedicated to finding her,&quot; Moreno said. &quot;I think because we were so adamant about finding her it made someone else adamant and someone else.&quot;  
 
Because of the constant search for Rosie the search teams found two other lost dogs along the way, which people had originally called in thinking they were Rosie — who is all black except for some white on her nose and chest.  
 
&quot;I remember seeing a picture of Rosie that someone had taken one day and then she ran off,&quot; Moreno said. &quot;She looked so scared it melted my heart. I was so happy just to know she was alive but I bawled knowing how scared she must be.&quot;  
 
Over the weeks, sightings of Rosie were reported and the Morenos learned about their dog&apos;s adventure including a cat friend Rosie had made and played with, her jumping around in the snow after the first storm, playing hide and seek with an employee at the landfill and wandering around town. 
 
And on Jan. 9, the search ended.  
 
The Morenos had gotten a call about two possible sightings. Jose Moreno, Kelly&apos;s husband, drove to Dean estates, one of the sighting locations, saw animal tracks and followed them only to discover a deer, not Rosie.  
 
He drove around the area when he saw something black.  
 
&quot;He said, &apos;Hi pretty girl&apos; in a sweet voice like he always does and when the dog turns around it is Rosie,&quot; Kelly Moreno said. &quot;He dropped to his knees and said it again, in an even sweeter voice.&quot;  
 
&quot;She started walking over closer to him until she is about 15 feet away and all of sudden starts wagging her tail and whimpering realizing it is Jose.&quot;   
 
Moreno said Rosie ran to Jose, jumping on him and licking him before happily getting into the car and finally after 24 days out wandering in Taunton was going home.  
 
&quot;We all were so happy to see her and now that she is back it is like she never left. She lost about five pounds but besides that is in good health,&quot; Moreno said. &quot;The funny part is geographically she was very close, just across the river from us. It was like she was trying to get home but she just couldn&apos;t cross the river.&quot;  
 
But that wasn&apos;t the end of the community&apos;s involvement in Rosie&apos;s or the Morenos&apos; lives.  
 
Right after Rosie was found, Moreno put pictures of Rosie and the family smiling from ear to ear on the #findrosie page, and dozens of pictures followed over the next few days — but they were not of Rosie.  
 
&quot;People began taking pictures of their own pets and posting them on the page saying &quot;Welcome home Rosie,&quot; Moreno said. &quot;It was really, really touching.&quot;  
 
On the page are pictures of cats and dogs, of all breeds and sizes, with messages welcoming home Rosie.  
 
&quot;Since then people have been leaving toys and even dog beds on our porch too,&quot; Moreno said. &quot;The overwhelming amount of support we have received from the community during this is incredible.&quot;  
 
Moreno said some people have been so captivated by Rosie&apos;s story that they have asked to meet her.  
 
&quot;We want to host a meet and greet with Rosie for everyone to meet who helped bring her home,&quot; Moreno said. &quot;We want to have a day in the spring.&quot;  
 
Since Rosie has been found Moreno has been using the #findrosie page to pay it forward and let it be an area where she and other people can pass the word along about other lost dogs or post pictures of dogs found without an owner, in hopes of reuniting families.  
 
&quot;I am so incredibly grateful to everyone, whether they just kept a lookout for Rosie, called for a possible sighting or just passed the word along — all of that helped find Rosie,&quot; Moreno said. &quot;We all found her together.&quot;  </TEXT>
