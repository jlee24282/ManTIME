<content type="str">Concordia University&apos;s athletic teams are in the final year of a three-year process to become an NCAA Division II program, transitioning from being in the NAIA. 

Terilyn Jackson is one of many at the university who believes times are changing for the Eagles and so much is needed, including an actual Concordia University Hall of Fame area/section. Jackson was excited to speak about her late father, Kenneth A. Walker, Friday night when the Hall of Fame in his name was unveiled in Concordia&apos;s gym. 
 
&quot;Our university is becoming a grown-up,&quot; said Jackson, a Newport Beach resident, who played volleyball at Newport Christian, Huntington Beach High and Concordia. &quot;And with that some things need to happen and one of those things is creating a professional, athletic look to our facilities. I think this is a major start to that.&quot; 

Jackson&apos;s father, who lived in Huntington Beach, died two years ago. He played basketball at USC and enjoyed watching his children and grandchildren play in their activities. Brothers Phil Walker played water polo and Jim Walker played tennis. Jackson&apos;s sister, Paige, who died while Jackson was a student-athlete at Concordia, competed in tennis and was a cheerleader. 
 
Jackson is now Concordia&apos;s dean for equity diversity and inclusion. 

&quot;Amazing,&quot; Jackson said of the unveiling event, which included a gathering of family, friends, coaches and Hall of Fame inductees. &quot;This went better than it ever could. My dad would be really proud.&quot; 

The Kenneth A. Walker Athletic Hall of Fame at Concordia University, designed by alumna and former Eagles soccer player Amanda Koman of the Temeka group, features a prominent timeline on the wall next to a trophy case. 

This year&apos;s Hall of Fame inductees Alexsondra Peters (swimming) and the 2011 CUI baseball team played a big part to the success seen in that timeline. Concordia has had a Hall of Fame for its past athletes, but now has a physical area to honor them. 

Peters was named NAIA National Swimmer of the Year in 2011 when she was a three-time national champion. The 2011 Eagles baseball team won the university&apos;s first baseball national championship, finishing with a 43-19 record. 

The endowment in Kenneth A. Walker&apos;s name also includes a $50,000 renewable scholarship awarded annually to a student-athlete who demonstrates excellence in athletics, the classroom and the community, regardless of sport, gender or year. 

The first recipient is expected to be named beginning in the 2018 academic year. 

Walker, who was a Southern California real estate developer, enjoyed giving back to his community and was known for his community involvement, Jackson said.</content>
