<TITLE>Little interest in program promoting downtown home ownership for Dubuque safety personnel</TITLE>
<TEXT>Despite minimal interest, city and neighborhood officials remain optimistic about efforts to entice public safety personnel to live downtown. 
 
As part of an effort to promote home ownership in the area, Dubuque City Council members in 2015 approved a package of financial incentives for city police officers and firefighters buying homes in the citys urban core. 
 
The program is called Officer at Home, or OATH. 
 
Thus far, only one Dubuque police officer has utilized the program to purchase and rehabilitate a home in the Washington Neighborhood. The officer was provided a $40,000 loan. 
 
Of that, $10,000 will be forgiven after five years and $10,000 was offered at no interest with a 20-year term. The remaining $20,000 is due on sale of the property, and also carries no interest. 
 
While participation in the program hasnt met expectations yet, it may in the future and is something we still need to work towards, said Chuck Harris, president of the North End Neighborhood Association. Its still a positive to try to continue to push for and attain that goal where we want officers living everywhere in the city, not just on the periphery. 
 
A vast majority of the citys officers live on the south and west ends of Dubuque, according to police officials. 
 
Two Dubuque firefighters have also expressed interest in the program, said Kris Neyen with the citys housing department. 
 
The officer and firefighters declined to speak with the Telegraph Herald for this article. 
 
Modeled after a federal initiative, city leaders hope to encourage a sense of safety and security downtown and increase investment and involvement in revitalizing the citys low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. 
 
Properties must be purchased in the citys downtown urban renewal district, which encompasses an area from 25th to Stafford to Bluff streets. People also must live in the homes at least five years after purchase. 
 
While not enough to entice veteran officers to sell existing homes, city officials hope the incentives will be attractive to new hires and first-time buyers, according to Mark Dalsing, the citys police chief. 
 
Fire Chief Rick Steines said the department plans to use the program as a selling point in upcoming recruitment efforts. Information about the program is included as part of orientation for new officers, Dalsing said. 
 
He said new officers have expressed initial interest, but tend to delay purchases until after their first year, once theyve completed training and probation. Dalsing also noted that more younger Americans are choosing to rent rather than own homes. 
 
Dubuque County Sheriff Joe Kennedy attributed low participation to the very thing city officials are attempting to combat that has kept others from investing in the area  crime. 
 
Officers dont want to have to deal with work-related stuff when theyre not at work, Kennedy said. They dont want to come home and have their vehicle be damaged because (someone) knows theyre law enforcement  and people just dont want to have to deal with the hassle of living downtown when they can live on the West End, where there are fewer problems. 
 
Downtown Neighborhood Association President Joe Noll contends there have been fewer issues downtown over the past year, thanks to new lighting and city surveillance cameras that have helped deter problems. 
 
Weve had some success with renovated apartments, and a lot more young professionals are living downtown, Noll said. 
 
But, if we could get more city employees and law enforcement to own homes downtown, I think that would help foster a greater sense of pride, investment and security in that part of town.</TEXT>
