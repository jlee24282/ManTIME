  Passengers spell out the word “HELP” aboard the disabled Carnival Lines cruise ship Triumph as it is towed to harbor off Mobile Bay, Ala. in Feb. 2013. Carnival Cruise Lines knew about the risk of leaks from engine fuel hoses and recommended taking precautions on the ill-fated Carnival Triumph, which caught on fire at sea, according to documents. A “compliance notice report” sent to the Triumph one month before it departed Galveston for what was planned as a four-day cruise recommended spray shields be installed on engines’ flexible fuel hoses. less  Passengers spell out the word “HELP” aboard the disabled Carnival Lines cruise ship Triumph as it is towed to harbor off Mobile Bay, Ala. in Feb. 2013.
