B orn from a playlist that became a live night and a radio show helmed by website GRM Daily ’s Caroline Simoniescu-Marin , New Gen provides a snapshot of London’s fast-moving urban scene, where grime meets R&amp;B. It’s a compilation that doesn’t merely compile; these tunes were laid down specifically for the project, taking cues from US trap sounds as well as London’s Caribbean forms. You might have heard of smooth crew WSTRN , here with Loose, but the MCs steal the show. Kojey Radical lights up Fuck Your Feelings, while the reflective Life Support (feat Bonkaz and Tiggs Da Author ) belies grime’s surface obsession with noisy macho posturing in favour of space and calm.</content>
