<content type="str">A woman who stole almost £450 worth of beauty products from Debenhams said she did it because she couldn&apos;t live on £60 a fortnight in benefits.

Lincoln Magistrates&apos; Court heard Sherree Conlon, of Coleridge Green, Lincoln, went into the Lincoln city centre department store on January 6, 2017 and stole £445 worth of goods

Prosecuting, Jim Clare, said: &quot;She entered the Debenhams store and selected numerous bottles of fragrances concealing them in a bag she had with her.

&quot;She then goes upstairs to the ladies section and conceals more items.

&quot;It appears she&apos;s confronted by security and the items are recovered.

&quot;In police interview she said she only gets £60 a fortnight on benefits and doesn&apos;t know how she&apos;s expected to live on that.&quot; In mitigation Mark McNeil said: &quot;I&apos;ve represented her for about the last eight years.

&quot;She&apos;s had a lot of difficulties, particularly in the last eight to 12 months.

&quot;Her children were taken away from her and placed elsewhere.

&quot;She used to be in receipt of an income when she had the children.

He said the 30-year-old found it very difficult to manage her finances and support herself on the £60. He added: &quot;Now she seems to be managing her finances better.

&quot;It wasn&apos;t linked to drugs or drinking and the issue behind the offending has now resolved.&quot;

Conlon appeared at Lincoln Magistrates&apos; Court on Friday, January 27.

She was given a 12 month conditional discharge and ordered to pay £1</content>
