Only a combined three points separated Sydney from their two WNBL opponents in round 16, but it was enough to secure a finals spot and move the Flame to top spot. 
 
Sydney survived two thrillers on the road against once-mid-table rivals Canberra and Townsville on Thursday and Saturday night, prevailing by two and then one point each respective game. 
 
Regardless of the margins, it leaves Sydney first with three rounds to play, four wins clear of most of those fighting it out for a spot in the top four. 
 
However, the stories could have been so different in both games. 
 
In Canberra on Australia Day, the Capitals led by three at halftime, and had scores tied at 75-75 with nine seconds to play, before Sydney&apos;s Leilani Mitchell landed a two-point jump shot. 
 
Capitals guard Lauren Mansfield then missed a last-ditch three-pointer from just inside Sydney&apos;s half to seal the deal. 
 
Belinda Snell was the star for Sydney, landing 30 points, eight rebounds and four assists in the two-point win. 
 
Two days later, Sydney were again saved on the bell. 
 
After almost two minutes of scoreless action and the Flame leading 76-75, Townsville star Suzy Batkovic (21 points, seven rebounds) missed two free throws to take the lead in the final two seconds. 
 
The Fire then had another chance to claim the win when Mia Murray grabbed the rebound, but her shot bounced off the ring into Snell&apos;s hands - finalising Sydney&apos;s fifth-straight win to go 15-6. 
 
Townsville and Canberra&apos;s losses were then further compounded when Perth easily accounted for last-placed Adelaide 80-60 on Friday night, before shocking then-first placed Dandenong on Sunday 87-77. 
 
Bendigo also did their best to dampen Canberra and Townsville&apos;s spirits, beating seventh-placed Melbourne on Saturday 76-69. 
 
It means Perth remain third at 13-7 with four games to play, while Townsville and Bendigo are two wins further back in fourth and fifth respectively. 
 
Canberra are sixth at 10-9 but have a game in hand. They play Adelaide twice and the three teams immediately above them once. 
 
In the weekend&apos;s only other game, Dandenong (14-6) defeated Melbourne 78-66 to initially keep top spot, a position they held until Sunday&apos;s loss.</content>
