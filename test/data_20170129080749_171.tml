<TEXT type="str">Bengaluru: Former High Court judge Justice P Vishwanath Shetty was on Saturday sworn in as the Karnataka Lokayukta, a year after the post fell vacant following a bribery scandal that had hit the office of the anti-graft ombudsman. 

Shetty was administered the oath of office by Governor Vajubhai R Vala at a ceremony at Raj Bhavan. 

Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, state ministers, judges of the High Court and senior officials were present at the ceremony. 

The Governor had given his assent to Shetty&apos;s appointment on Thursday after the government replied to clarifications sought by him. 

Vala had returned the file seeking some clarifications, reportedly following allegations that Shetty&apos;s family owned a site in violation of norms. 

The post had remained vacant since Y Bhaskar Rao, a former High Court Chief Justice, stepped down in December 2015 amid public pressure to quit over an alleged bribery scandal involving his office and son.</TEXT>
