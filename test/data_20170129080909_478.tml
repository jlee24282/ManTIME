<content type="str">DALTON, Mass. — Richard L. Vigeant, a longtime Dalton resident, passed away at home on January 25, 2017.  
 

He was born August 22, 1930 to Gregoire &amp; Delphine Vigeant in Central Falls, R.I. His schooling included Sacred Heart Academy in Central Falls, a bachelor&apos;s degree from Providence College (Go Friars!) and a master&apos;s degree from Boston College.  
 

Prior to attending Boston College, he served in the Army during the Korean War for three years as part of Counter Intelligence in Tokyo, Japan. His education continued there as he attended Sophia University where he studied Japanese.  
 

After graduating from Boston College, he moved to Dalton, where he taught for 30 years at Dalton High, which later became Wahconah Regional High School.  
 

His love for his first language, French, led him to study at the University of Laval in Quebec, Georgetown University, and the University of Pau in France, He took a sabbatical leave from teaching for a year and studied at Alliance Francaise in Paris, France. While living in Paris he and his wife, Sue, traveled throughout France and Europe. They took two groups of students to France after returning to teach at Wahconah. Many students took with them the love of French and the travels with Le Petit Prince which he taught every year.  
 

He was an avid bowler and belonged to several leagues over the years. He also belonged to Wahconah Country Club where he shared special moments with his good friend, Jack Franklin. He always enjoyed seeing several of his former students sharing special moments such as memories of heated ping pong games with Mr. Reardon and taunting them when he called them &quot;Mon Espece.&quot;  
 

He is survived by his wife of 46 years; his brother, Raymond Vigeant and his wife Pauline of East Greenwich, R.I.; his brother-in-law John Davison and his wife Betty of Pensacola, Fla.; as well as several nieces and nephews.  
 

Two brothers, Fernand Vigeant and Roger Vigeant, as well as his parents predeceased him.
