<TITLE>Voice of The Southern: The lost art of compromise</TITLE>
<TEXT>It seems such an antiquated, genteel notion these days.

Like much of the English language, the definition of compromise seems to have altered inexplicably. When used in the context of negotiations, compromise used to mean Ill give a little if you give a little.

But thats just reminiscing about the good old days.

This somewhat whimsical dalliance concerning the definition of a simple word is not without purpose. We are thinking of the impasse between the State of Illinois and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.

Negotiations between the entities have broken down. The case was presented to the National Labor Relations Board, which ruled that an impasse does exist. AFSCME has already voted to take a strike vote.

As can be expected, a virtual state of war exists between the two parties. Both are stumping to claim the high moral ground. And, frankly, after looking at some of the most contentious issues, there appears to be room for negotiation.

Gov. Bruce Rauner and his staff are advancing the argument that AFSCME should accept the terms because 20 other unions have agreed to the same terms. Although an interesting fact, thats a non-starter.

The purpose of a union is to negotiate for its members. Agreements made between the state and other unions are completely irrelevant.

Some of the issues keeping the two sides apart deal with overtime pay, insurance benefits and a wage freeze.

The state wants overtime pay to begin after 40 hours. The current contract calls for overtime to be paid after 37.5 hours. For most people to work in the private sector, that seems quite reasonable, especially given Illinois dire economic situation.

At the very least, that issue seems to provide wiggle room for negotiation.

Conversely, the state wants AFSCME employees to pay a larger share of their health insurance. On the surface, that sounds eminently reasonable. Corporations that provide health insurance to their employees routinely pass along the increased cost of insurance.

But, as is frequently the case in these negotiations, the devil is in the details.

According to members of Gov. Rauners staff, employee contributions would double if they want to maintain their current coverage. That isnt insignificant.

The state counters that employees could select between a wide variety of plans. Well, thats fine. But, if a person goes to a restaurant and finds the menu overpriced, and finds nothing appealing on the menu, they wont buy something they cant afford or dont like.

Surely, when youre dealing with a 100 percent increase in premiums, there is room for negotiation.

Another sticking point is a temporary wage freeze. The wage freeze would last through the proposed contract, which would expire in 2019. The freeze would be absolute, no cost of living increases.

Given the state of Illinois finances, asking for a wage freeze at this time is understandable. On the other hand, wage freeze is a term no employee ever wants to hear.

There are a couple other ancillary issues that seem almost bizarre  the state is asking for additional latitude in alcohol testing. One would hope that drinking on the job isnt a major issue with state employees, but surely a reasonable policy, acceptable to both parties, can be negotiated.

And, the state is arguing that AFSCME employees are well-paid. Wage figures for public sector employees are readily available for anyone interested enough to look. We did look. And, most state employees appear to be well-compensated for their work.

On the other side of the coin, AFSCME members see their fellow workers being laid off and being replaced by private contractors. That prospect has to have a chilling effect.

Which brings us all the way back to the word compromise. Obviously, something has to give. In a true compromise, no one gets everything they want. Surely, adults can still sit down together and hammer out a deal that is fair to taxpayers and workers.</TEXT>
