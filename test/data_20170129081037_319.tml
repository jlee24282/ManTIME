<TITLE>The War on Abortion Is Only Just Beginning</TITLE>
<TEXT>The Trump administration is rapidly setting a disastrous course for womens health and rights.      
f youve ever wondered what the oft-used and much maligned word patriarchy looks like, you need look no further than a picture of Donald Trump , surrounded by white men, reinstating the global gag rule. The policy, which bans funding any international organization that dares to even talk about abortion, has contributed to thousands of womens deaths across the globe . 

The executive order was just the beginning. In the short time Trump has been president, his administration has set a disastrous course for womens health and rights. On Tuesday, days after historic marches that put millions of women on the street globally, Republican congressmen introduced the first ever federal heartbeat bill - a policy that would ban abortions after six weeks, well before most women even know theyre pregnant. 

That same day, the House passed a bill that would make the dangerous and discriminatory Hyde Amendment  which prevents federal funds from covering abortion, even in cases of fetal abnormalities and maternal health issues  permanent. The bill , which targets poor women, would also impact abortion coverage for women with private insurance. Congressional republicans have even introduced a federal personhood bill that would define life as beginning at conception. 

While the bills will not likely get far, the new administration is sending a clear message  theyre keeping Trumps promise to punish women who have abortions , and rolling back hard-won rights. These are far-reaching and radical policies that quite literally kill women. There is no overstating just how harmful they are. 

So youll excuse me for laughing off recent suggestions that feminists embrace pro-life women in the name of inclusivity. You dont get to feel bad about being banned from the treehouse when youre in the middle of setting the trunk on fire. 
And lets be clear: these political positions are not about reducing the number of abortions. The global gag rule, for example, has been shown to increase abortion  especially illegal and unsafe abortions. The same is true for state level abortion bans; hundreds of thousands of women in Texas have tried to induce their own abortions . Anti-choice policies dont prevent women ending their pregnancies, they just ensure that women do it dangerously. 
If anti-abortion legislators or so-called pro-life feminists were interested in decreasing the number of abortions theyd be enthusiastically supporting comprehensive sex education, affordable birth control, and access to over-the-counter emergency contraception. Theyd be introducing legislation to mandate paid parental leave and subsidized child care. 

But theyre not. And they wont. So lets not fool ourselves  these next four years are about fighting for whats right, not searching for the nonexistent distraction of common ground. 

Conservative, and mostly male, legislators will continue to push extreme policies; not necessarily with the hope that theyll pass, but with the understanding that less radical laws might then seem reasonable. Diane Horvath-Cosper from Physicians for Reproductive Health told the Guardian this week, So when a congressman introduces a 20-week bill, it looks moderate by comparison. 

But there is nothing moderate or reasonable about forced pregnancy, not at any point. There is no common ground with an administration that would put the rights of a fertilized egg above those of a living person. So keep those pink hats handy - were going to need them.
