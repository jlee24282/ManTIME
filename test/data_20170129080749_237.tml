&quot;My advice is that if you&apos;re just starting and you&apos;re not sure if you&apos;ll continue with it, is not to spend to much initially. I started by buying cameras on Ebay,&quot; he said. 
 
He added that it was best to start off with a more basic camera and to build up and that there are plenty of places to get help and advice. 
 
He said: &quot;There are loads of online and Facebook amateur groups who share pictures and chat about their images and you can find tutorials on YouTube.&quot;
