ARE you a fan of photography? 
 
Perhaps you avidly take pictures on your mobile but are now looking to get a bit more serious? Or perhaps you got a new camera for Christmas and you're looking to put it to the test at some picturesque spots across our area. 
 
We've complied a list and picked out the top 10 most photogenic locations in our area to give you a head start. 
 
Bob Riach is an amateur photographer and not only takes pictures in Scunthorpe and North Lincolnshire, but also across the country. He has shared some of his pictures and top tips to help inspire others in photography. 
 
He said that one of his favourite places to take pictures in our region is the iconic Humber Bridge.

This is his picture of the Humber Bridge at night. He said that many photographer's like to take pictures of the bridge, but he tries to make his unique by taking pictures of it at night time. 
 
He also said that he likes to take pictures of Normanby Hall including its ground and wildlife.

And he has also taken pictures of places and buildings in Scunthorpe that in every day life we might take for granted. 
 
Mr Riach said: "At The Pods you can get some lovely reflections from the pond." 
 
He also gave these tips for anyone looking to get into photography: 
 
"My advice is that if you're just starting and you're not sure if you'll continue with it, is not to spend to much initially. I started by buying cameras on Ebay," he said. 
 
He added that it was best to start off with a more basic camera and to build up and that there are plenty of places to get help and advice. 
 
He said: "There are loads of online and Facebook amateur groups who share pictures and chat about their images and you can find tutorials on YouTube."
