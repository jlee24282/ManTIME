The Election Commission has ordered legal action to be initiated against Delhi Chief Minister and Aam Aadmi party convener Arvind Kejriwal for violation of Model Code of Conduct for polls. 

The poll panel said, &apos;necessary legal action be initiated by filing an FIR/complaint against Arvind Kejriwal for statements on and after 8 January in Goa.&quot; 

The Election Commission has stated that compliance report regarding legal action on Arvind Kejriwal should be sent to the Commission latest by 3.00 pm on 31 January. 

Earlier, the Election Commission had censured Arvind Kejriwal for his bribery remarks at a poll rally in Goa on January 8. 

Kejriwal had reportedly told the voters to take money from the BJP and the Congress but vote for Aam Aadmi Party in the assembly elections. 

The BJP had lodged a complaint with the Election Commission, which later issued notice to Kejriwal. 

The poll panel said that Kejriwal&apos;s Goa speech violated the model code of conduct, which came into force on January 4. 

The Election Commission held that Kejriwal&apos;s statement amounted to &apos;abetting and promoting electoral offence of bribery&apos;.</TEXT>
