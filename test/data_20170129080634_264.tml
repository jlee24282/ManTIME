<TITLE>Manorama News conclave logo unveiled</TITLE>
<TEXT>Kochi: Kerala has turned 60 recently, but how happy and content are Malayalees as a community? 
 
In a bid to find an answer to this question, Manorama News will organize a conclave covering the states social-political-cultural spectrum in Kochi on March 8. 
 
The logo of the conclave was unveiled at a function held here on Saturday. 
 
The conclave with the central theme happiness quotient will discuss a wide range of topics such as politics, entertainment, self-confidence of Malayalee women, emerging talents, and wellness, among others, said the organizers. 
 
Experts from different fields including politics, cinema, industry, and renowned social activists will attend the one-day event. 
 
A Happiness Survey to measure happiness of Malayalees would also be conducted as part of the conclave. 
 
Many countries have rejected Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as the only way to measure progress as they feel Gross National Happiness (GNH) should be the measurement to gauge a nations prosperity. 
 
Denmark has been declared the planets most contented nation, while India ranks 118th out of 156 countries in a global list of the happiest countries. Kochi stands at a lowly 13th position on a list of 16 happiest cities in India. 
 
Interestingly, it is for the first time a Malayalam channel is taking up a task of this magnitude. 
 
The questionnaire for the Happiness Survey will soon be uploaded on the conclave website, the organizers added.</TEXT>
