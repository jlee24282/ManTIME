Empty safes reeking of marijuana and its residue were discovered where a father and son were shot during a robbery last week, a San Antonio Police Department report reveals. 
 
The men robbed were preparing to eat just before 9 p.m. in the 7100 block of Oaklawn Drive when four people wearing black hoodies barged in through their unlocked door, the police report states. 
 
One of the suspects, who were all armed with handguns, shot the 24-year-old man in the head as they fought just outside the apartment, police said.

He was taken to University Hospital in critical condition. An update on his condition was not available Friday. 
 
The victims told police that one of the suspects shouted “Caught you slipping!” as he entered the complex, police said. 
 
Investigators noted the suspects demanded only their cash, but didn’t believe the victims had given all they had.

As the injured man’s 54-year-old father was being interviewed by detectives, they noted he realized he had been shot below his waist and dropped his pants to reveal the injury. 
 
The father was also taken to UH, the report states. 
 
While examining the home, investigators found marijuana paraphernalia where the son and a third person were sitting at the dining table. 
 
Multiple safes in the home were found empty, but still had the scent of marijuana with its residue present, investigators noted. 
 
A search, which the victims consented to, also revealed that a bedroom was ransacked. Investigators said it appeared someone was looking for something very quickly. 
 
The suspects may have been spotted on surveillance cameras fleeing past a nearby convenience store, investigators said. 
 
Police had not identified any suspects as of Friday night.
