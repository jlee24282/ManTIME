A source close to Chaitanya said: &quot;It&apos;s going to a very private affair and only the families of the couple and very close friends will be present. Even the venue has been kept a secret as they don&apos;t want public to come hoping to catch a glimpse of the couple.&quot; 
 
The event will take place at a plush hotel. 
 
Samantha&apos;s parents and her close friends from Chennai, where she grew up and studied, will be present. 
 
&quot;Samantha will be wearing a specially designed outfit by Kresha Bajaj. She&apos;s really excited about it,&quot; the source said. 
 
Chaitanya and Samantha first met on the sets of Gautham Vasudev Menon&apos;s Telugu romantic-drama Ye Maaya Chesave  and went on to work together in films such as Autonagar Surya  and Manam .</content>
