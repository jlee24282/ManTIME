<content type="str">Pinal County seems to be off to a good start after hiring its first chief medical examiner, Dr. John Hu. He had worked for Maricopa County for 16 years while Pinal had contracted with Pima County to do autopsies for many years. 
 
The county has grown to a point where cost savings are likely by doing the work in-house. That is based on the number of autopsies one ME can do and the comparative cost of contracting out that work. Other benefits are savings in transportation, faster service and having an expert witness readily at hand on the county payroll. 
 
In 2015, the county paid for 227 autopsies and 68 external examinations. 
 
The Board of Supervisors and other county officials deserve praise for the addition and accompanying savings for taxpayers.</content>
