<TITLE>Nuts & Bolts: National party offices</TITLE>
<TEXT>Welcome back, Saturday Campaign D-I-Yers! For those who tune in, welcome to theNuts & Bolts of a Democratic campaign. Each week, we discuss issues that help drive successful campaigns. If youve missed prior diaries, please visit our group or followNuts & Bolts Guide.While this series has focused on what it takes to build a successful campaign and successful county and state organizations, Ive been taking January and February to talk about how you, as a voter and activist, make a difference through elections in your local community and party.For the next few weeks in a row, the DNC will be hosting Future Forums, this week in Houston, TexasthenDetroit, Baltimore, and of course the final vote in Atlanta. I've been fortunate to receive a lot of emails and questions about proposals and positions held by candidates for different offices, and how they might impact the rank and file Democratic voters. This week, to match the DNC Future Forum, I hope to answer some of your questions in comments about the DNC elections, the purposes of these offices, and how proposals advanced by candidates may impact you.</TEXT>
