<TITLE>Alzheimers Care: Communication is Key</TITLE>
<TEXT>Frisco, United States, January 29,2017/Free-Press-Release.com/ -- The director of The Cottages offers insights on how to effectively communication with a loved one living with Alzheimers disease. 
Frisco, TX  Helping loved ones living with Alzheimers disease enjoy life to its fullest is a concern for millions of Americans. With an estimated 5 million people nationwide affected by this incurable memory disorder, the key to helping people thrive often lies in learning how to effectively communicate as a caregiver. 

Keeping an open line of communication, even as symptoms progress, is important for ensuring a loved one receives a high level of care and his or her needs are adequately met, says Trent Quinn, founder, president and CEO of The Cottages. As symptoms do progress, there are simple tips that can help keep the lines of communication open to ensure loved ones are able to articulate their thoughts, needs and desires. 

Quinn and many other providers of care for people living with Alzheimers disease recommend keeping these things in mind when communicating with loved ones: 

 Exercise understanding  People living with Alzheimers disease may not always say what they mean or what others expect them to. Rather than get upset or take comments personally, its strongly urged that caregivers take a deep breath in these situations, regroup and move on. 

 Avoid the temptation to correct  Forgetfulness is a common symptom associated with Alzheimers. Constantly correcting a loved one, however, can lead to agitation and may upset the daily routine. To keep things on a calm and even keel, its best to avoid the temptation to correct. 

 Let the person live in the moment  For people living with Alzheimers disease, memories from 40 years ago might be more vivid and real that what is happening in the here and now. When this occurs, simply let them live in the moment and remember to avoid that urge to correct. 

Compassion and understanding go a long way toward keeping the lines of communication open with loved ones living with Alzheimers disease, says Quinn. Listen to their thoughts, requests, needs and concerns with an open mind and open heart. Doing so can help them  and you  enjoy a higher quality of life.
