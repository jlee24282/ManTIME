Patrons at the trance music festival told 9NEWS drug taking at the event was rampant, despite warnings from Victoria Police. 
 
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews this morning denied any alterations to the states pill-testing policies at music events. 
 
We wont be making any changes, Mr Andrews said at a press conference. 
 
Earlier, festival director Tim Harvey said in a statement that organisers would work with authorities to determine exactly what happened.

Rainbow Serpent considers the safety of patrons a priority, the statement read. 
 
The mans cause of death is yet to be determined. 
 
In 2012, the death of a 34-year-old man from a drug overdose at the festival sparked debate around drug testing. 
 
The festival has previously expressed support for pill-testing, advocating for the Victorian government to bring in relevant laws. 
 
The festival hosts about 10,000 people each year.
