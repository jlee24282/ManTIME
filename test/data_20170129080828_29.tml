A mosque is opening its doors to feed the homeless a three course meal. 
 
Around 30 people are expected at the Kirkcaldy Mosque enjoy an Asian themed meal. 
 
Pakora and curry is on the menu, with pasta for those who can&apos;t handle the spice, with a dessert to finish.  
 
The event is sponsored by local businesses and charities, including Insure Smart Foundation, Frontline Fife, Frae Fife, and Caspian fast food.  
 
On their Facebook page, the organisers said: 
 
&quot;This event is not for the great and good to attend in dinner jackets.  
 
&quot;The guests of honour at this red-carpet dinner are the homeless and vulnerable people of Fife.  
 
&quot;We all agree that it is our duty as human beings: it could be any of us in need.&quot; 
 
Food is served from 12-4pm.
