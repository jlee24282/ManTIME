St. Joesph, Mo. 
 
For a moment in the second half, it looked as if the Missouri Western Men were going to pull of the unthinkable, upset the Number 1 team in the country. But Northwest flexed their muscles, and used a stout defensive effort in the second half to beat the Griffons 74-58. 
 
&quot;Defensively, we wore them down,&quot; Bearcats head coach Ben McCollum said of his teams defensive performance. &quot;We just stuck with what we did, just did a little better. Over time, hopefully that happens where we wear teams down and were able to score enough to make a run yourself and that&apos;s what happened in that little stretch we had.&quot; 
 

&quot;We can compete, but yet we&apos;re still a big step away. I&apos;m not disappointed in how our mindset was coming in, I&apos;m not disappointed in how we competed, I&apos;m disappointed certainly in some of the execution,&quot; Griffons head coach Brett Weiberg said. 
 
Northwest (19-0, 11-0 MIAA) remains undefeated while the Griffons (7-13, 3-8 MIAA) are struggling to find a true identity. Northwest is back in action Thursday 2/2 as they take on Lincoln University in Jefferson City. Missouri Western will hit the hardwood again on Thursday as they travel to St. Charles for a date with Lindenwood. Both games are set for 7:30 p.m. 
 
On the Women&apos;s side, Western was able to sweep their rivals from the North behind a strong defensive performance in the second half en route to a 78-57 win. 
 
Western forced Northwest in 30 turnovers in the game, while committing only 8 themselves. 
 
 &quot;I was really pleased with our kids,&quot; Western head coach Rob Edmission said. &quot; I thought defensively for the whole game we were pretty good, we just got in such severe foul trouble, it didn&apos;t allow us to stretch the game a little bit, be up one at half and their shooting 60 plus percent, I felt pretty good about that.&quot; 
 
 &quot;Their kids that came in off the bench really did a great job keeping up their momentum and staying aggressive and keeping the pressure on us and we didn&apos;t do a good job of handling that,&quot; Northwest head man Buck Scheel said. &quot;When you have 30 turnovers, that&apos;s pretty rough and you&apos;re not going to beat anybody playing like that.&quot; 
 
Missouri Western (15-5, 7-4 MIAA) is back in action this Thursday, as they will travel to Lindenwood University. Meanwhile, Northwest (7-11. 2-9 MIAA) will also play on Thursday, only they will play Lincoln in Jefferson City. Tip-off for both games is set for 5:30 p.m.</content>
