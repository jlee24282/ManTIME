Japanese swimmer Ippei Watanabe has broken the world record in the men&apos;s 200m breaststroke. 
 
The 19-year-old university student swam two minutes, 06.67 seconds to beat the 2012 time of 2:07.01 by compatriot Akihiro Yamaguchi. 
 
Watanabe set the new mark in Sunday&apos;s 200m breaststroke final at the Tokyo metropolitan championships. 
 
Watanabe competed in the 100m breaststroke at the Rio Olympic Games but didn&apos;t qualify for the final. He also broke the Olympic record for the 200m breaststroke during the semi-finals in Rio.</content>
