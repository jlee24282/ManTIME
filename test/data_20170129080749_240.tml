Hygiene inspectors have been visiting food outlets across North Lincolnshire and the results can be revealed. 
 
The Food Standards Agency hosts the ratings scheme, which follows environmental health checks by North Lincolnshire Council into all premises offering or handling food, from restaurants and cafes to takeaways, school canteens and business kitchens. 
 
Ratings for premises which were visited by council inspectors in December 2016 are below, along with the date on which they were inspected. 
 
No inspections conducted during the month resulted in a zero-star rating being given, with two resulting in a one-star rating, three places being given two stars, one being handed three stars, 11 getting four stars and 17 receiving the maximum five stars.

The rating system works as follows: 
 NO STARS: Urgent improvement necessary  ONE STAR: Major improvement necessary  TWO STARS: Improvement necessary  THREE STARS: Generally satisfactory  FOUR STARS: Good  FIVE STARS: Very good
