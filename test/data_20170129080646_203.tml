<content type="str">Japan teenager Ippei Watanabe has set a world record in the men&apos;s 200-meter breaststroke with a time of 2 minutes, 06.67 seconds. 

The 19-year-old university student improved on the previous mark of 2:07.01 set by compatriot Akihiro Yamaguchi in 2012. Watanabe set the record time in the final of the 200 breaststroke at the Tokyo metropolitan championships on Sunday. 

Watanabe competed in the men&apos;s 100-meter breaststroke at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics but didn&apos;t qualify for the final. He also broke the Olympic record for the men&apos;s 200-meter breaststroke event during the semifinal in Rio.</content>
