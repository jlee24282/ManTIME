<TEXT type="str">A train derailed in Queens early Saturday, suspending overnight service, officials said. 
 
Four wheels of a northbound 7 train came off the tracks at 12:45 a.m. as it entered Mets-Willets Point station, MTA spokeswoman Marisa Baldeo said. 
 
The operator pulled the emergency brake when the train arrived at the station, and all passengers disembarked safely. 
 
Service resumed in both directions about 7:05 a.m. and the faulty train was pulled from service, she noted.
