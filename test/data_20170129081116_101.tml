Restaurant owners decide to give away their restaurant for $125 entrance fee 
 
Sierra Vista, Arizona (PRWEB) January 29, 2017 
 
In less than 4 months restaurant owners, Dawn and David Bain, are handing over the keys to their 2,000 square-foot restaurant and everything in it to 1 lucky winner of their essay contest. 23 years ago, a close friend invested in their family and their future. After moving to Sierra Vista with their 2 kids, they built an award-winning restaurant with the help of that investment.

With only a $125 entrance fee and a 200 word essay on “Why I want to operate my own restaurant,” the winner and new owner has a chance to change their life forever. 
 
In the coming months, David and Dawn will be hosting a series of Facebook Live sessions to answer questions, showcase the restaurant, and more. The schedule is as follows: 
 
January 23rd: Q&amp;A with David Bain 
February 20th: TBA 
March 13th: TBA 
April 13th: TBA
