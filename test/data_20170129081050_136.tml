<TITLE>March for Life attendees express hope for Trump presidency</TITLE>
<TEXT>Anti-abortion advocates descended on the National Mall on Friday  joined by Vice President Mike Pence and White House advisor Kellyanne Conway  to rally in favor of defunding Planned Parenthood, creating federal legislation banning abortions after 20 weeks and appointing pro-life Supreme Court justices. 
 
It was the first time that a vice president attended the march and addressed it in person. Attendees were ecstatic about the visit, which Pence said was encouraged directly by President Donald Trump. 
 
Protestors came from far and near to march from the Washington Monument to the steps of the Supreme Court. 
 
Emily Boudreaux, a 22-year-old college student who attends Louisiana State University of Alexandria, voted for Trump. She arrived at the rally about four hours early to get a front row view of Vice President Pence. 
 
To know our movement has support from the White House just makes you think that this can go further, she said. 
 
Taisya Gowlovech, an 18-year-old student at OGorman High School in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, said she drove in a vehicle with her best friend for 28 hours to be a part of March for Life. She, too, wanted to see the vice president speak on behalf on the president. 
 
The vice president coming makes more people want to come, Gowlovech said. Hes getting more people on board. 
 
The crowd was noticeably youthful. Demonstrators from Catholic schools and Right to Life student organizations were visible everywhere, and marchers packed Constitution Avenue for more than an hour. 
 
This is because of Donald Trump, said Kristin Hawkins, President of Students for Life, an anti-abortion organization that focuses on millennial outreach. Theres lots of optimism that were going to see a lot of great things come out of the administration. 
 
However, that optimism is also paired with caution. Hawkins said that just because President Trump has promised to defund Planned Parenthood, reinstated the Mexico City Policy and promised to push restrictions on abortion providers, the movement will have to continue to hold the administration accountable. 
 
Monica Stuckwisch, who works with the American Association of Pro Life OB/GYNs, said she didnt vote for Mr. Trump in part because he didnt make abortion a common talking point on the campaign trail. Instead, she cast her ballot for Darrell Castle of the Constitution Party. 
 
Although Stuckwisch recognizes President Trumps flip-flop on abortion since the 90s, she said Pence reassured her at the rally that the administration was fighting for her side. 
 
Greg Ingel of Detroit, Michigan, was another front-row supporter at the March for Life protest. He proudly sported a Make America Great Again hat and said he voted for the president because of the Supreme Court. 
 
Ingel said he wasnt one-hundred percent sure about Mr. Trumps personal views on abortion, but Pences participation at the rally gave the March for Life a new enthusiasm. 
 
Mr. Trump may have not been the perfect candidate for many in attendance. But most felt he could ensure a swing of power in the US Supreme Court that could lead to the repeal of the Roe v. Wade decision of 1973, which legalized abortion nationwide. 
 
Kansas Governor Sam Brownback was one of many Republican politicians in attendance. He, like many, reiterated the importance of President Trumps first Supreme Court nomination, which is due to be announced next Thursday.
