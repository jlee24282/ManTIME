<TEXT type="str">When a team combines consistency and confidence, success is the next thing to follow. That’s exactly how Penn State’s divers started out the Penn State Zone A Diving Invitational. 
 
Area opponents Drexel, Lasalle, Loyola, Richmond and Rowan came to Happy Valley this weekend for the one-meter and three-meter diving competition as the postseason approaches. 
 
Penn State divers started hot by occupying three of the top eight spots after six preliminary dives. Mackenzie Cornell and Hector Garcia led after the preliminaries with a respective 305.5 and 396.95 points. Garcia was especially dominant, as his nearest competitor was Dylan Yurasits of LaSalle with 326.60. 
 
The top eight for the men and women then advanced to the final, where each diver started back with zero points. 
 
Garcia and Cornell each stayed consistent and won their competitions. Garcia scored 394.75 and Cornell stacked up 302.60 points. Other notable performances by Penn State divers included Connor Scanlon in third and Jack Crow in fourth for the men and Christina Crowell in third and Elaina Faerber in fifth for the women. 
 
Garcia emphasized consistency as key to his dominating performance. 
 
“I pretty much hit every one of my dives,” Garcia said after the meet. “This sport is about all six dives and if you can’t hit all your six dives, you’re not gonna make it.” 
 
Head coach Dennis Ceppa saw good signs out of his team with postseason events like the Big Ten Championships that include preliminary and final rounds are on the horizon. 
 
“We’ve been working on trying to figure out as best we can how to compete in a prelims-finals type situation, which is why we’re hosting this event,” he said. “Being that Hector and Mackenzie won their events in prelims and turned around and won in finals, that’s what this sport takes. It takes consistency.” 
 
Ceppa was also happy with how Mackenzie has developed in the lead-up to the postseason. 
 
“Mackenzie has sort of come into her own this year. She’s looking confident, which is something we haven’t seen in a while. Her confidence gives me some confidence that on the women’s side we can maybe expect to do something a little better [in Big Tens] this year.” 
 
The meet will resume tomorrow with the men competing on the three-meter boards and the women in the one-meter.</TEXT>
