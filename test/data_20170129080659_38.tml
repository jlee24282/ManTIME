<TITLE>Norman May's ashes scattered in Sydney</TITLE>
<TEXT>The ashes of sports broadcaster Norman May have been scattered on a Sydney beach in a ceremony attended by family and friends. 
 
May, an Australian Sports Hall of Fame member, died last September aged 88. 
 
He is best remembered for his call of Australia's gold medal in the men's swimming 4x100m medley at the 1980 Moscow Olympics - 'gold, gold for Australia, gold'. 
 
That famous call was blasted over speakers at Freshwater Beach on Sunday as the Surf Lifesaving community formed a guard of honour before his ashes were carried to a surfboat and scattered beyond the break. 
 
Australian Olympic Committee and close friend John Coates as well as Mark Tonelli, a member of the Moscow medley relay team, also attended. 
 
May's broadcasting career began by chance in 1957 when, working as an insurance clerk, he was asked to commentate on a surf lifesaving event in Sydney.
