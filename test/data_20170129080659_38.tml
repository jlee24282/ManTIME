<TEXT type="str">The ashes of sports broadcaster Norman May have been scattered on a Sydney beach in a ceremony attended by family and friends. 
 
May, an Australian Sports Hall of Fame member, died last September aged 88. 
 
He is best remembered for his call of Australia&apos;s gold medal in the men&apos;s swimming 4x100m medley at the 1980 Moscow Olympics - &apos;gold, gold for Australia, gold&apos;. 
 
That famous call was blasted over speakers at Freshwater Beach on Sunday as the Surf Lifesaving community formed a guard of honour before his ashes were carried to a surfboat and scattered beyond the break. 
 
Australian Olympic Committee and close friend John Coates as well as Mark Tonelli, a member of the Moscow medley relay team, also attended. 
 
May&apos;s broadcasting career began by chance in 1957 when, working as an insurance clerk, he was asked to commentate on a surf lifesaving event in Sydney.
