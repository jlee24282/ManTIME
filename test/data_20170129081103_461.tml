<content type="str">PITTSBURGH -- Want to add some sparkle to your life this year? Crystals and gemstones are one way to do it. 
 
These majestic minerals are having a moment in fashion. On the runway, designers Elie Saab, Givenchy and Dries Van Noten dressed up their collections with oversize stone accessories. Seeing them on celebrities -- Adele, Victoria Beckham and Katy Perry -- has only added to their popularity. 
 
A gem dangling from a skinny suede choker or chunky leather wrap bracelets mixed with crystals are some of the ways the trend has been adapted from nighttime glamour to casual chic. 
 
&quot;I&apos;m seeing more of a day crystal,&quot; says Kimberly Coppola, owner of Serendipity, an accessories boutique. &quot;It&apos;s nice to see some wearability.&quot; 
 
Meanwhile, other local shops have seen a surge in interest in not only these stones&apos; alluring looks but also in the ancient beliefs that they help promote self-restoration, protection and prosperity. 
 
In recent seasons, a number of beauty products formulated with crystals have appeared with claims that they can help stimulate the skin. Some are for sale at RadRitual. In particular, soaps and &quot;bath bombs&quot; with crystals inside have been quite popular, owner Chloe Nordlander says. It also carries locally sourced stones and rare finds from around the world, which are incorporated into on-site Tarot readings and Reiki sessions it offers. 
 
At Juju, a large table of stones is a centerpiece inside the store, which specializes in old clothing. 
 
&quot;I think the reason we choose to wear crystals as adornment is it tells other people that we&apos;re tapped into these energies,&quot; owner Leslie McAllister says. &quot;I ask people, &apos;What are you attracted to?&apos; I let them feel that magnetic pull to what they&apos;re needing in their life.&quot; 
 
Want to try crystals and stones? Here are some basics: 
 
Amethyst: Sobering and clarifying 
 
Rose quartz: Self-love and healing 
 
Black tourmaline: Considered the &quot;evil eye of minerals&quot; because it&apos;s believed to repel negativity 
 
Citrine: Wealth and abundance 
 
Rubies and garnets: Vitality and vigor 
 
Clear or smoky quartz: Paired with other stones to amplify their properties 
 
A GEM OF A BOOK 
 
Inspired by the increase of crystals in style and pop culture, Elemental Energy: Crystal and Gemstone Rituals for a Beautiful Life by Kristin Petrovich (HarperElixir, $32.99) is a new coffee-table book that explores the history of these natural beauties and how they&apos;ve come to be incorporated into accessories, decor, beauty products and more. Plus, there&apos;s vibrant photography of stones of all sorts. Petrovich is the co-founder of SJAL, a luxury skin-care line.
