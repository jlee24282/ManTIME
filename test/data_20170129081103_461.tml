<TITLE>Gems, minerals elevate casual look</TITLE>
<TEXT>PITTSBURGH -- Want to add some sparkle to your life this year? Crystals and gemstones are one way to do it. 
 
These majestic minerals are having a moment in fashion. On the runway, designers Elie Saab, Givenchy and Dries Van Noten dressed up their collections with oversize stone accessories. Seeing them on celebrities -- Adele, Victoria Beckham and Katy Perry -- has only added to their popularity. 
 
A gem dangling from a skinny suede choker or chunky leather wrap bracelets mixed with crystals are some of the ways the trend has been adapted from nighttime glamour to casual chic. 
 
"I'm seeing more of a day crystal," says Kimberly Coppola, owner of Serendipity, an accessories boutique. "It's nice to see some wearability." 
 
Meanwhile, other local shops have seen a surge in interest in not only these stones' alluring looks but also in the ancient beliefs that they help promote self-restoration, protection and prosperity. 
 
In recent seasons, a number of beauty products formulated with crystals have appeared with claims that they can help stimulate the skin. Some are for sale at RadRitual. In particular, soaps and "bath bombs" with crystals inside have been quite popular, owner Chloe Nordlander says. It also carries locally sourced stones and rare finds from around the world, which are incorporated into on-site Tarot readings and Reiki sessions it offers. 
 
At Juju, a large table of stones is a centerpiece inside the store, which specializes in old clothing. 
 
"I think the reason we choose to wear crystals as adornment is it tells other people that we're tapped into these energies," owner Leslie McAllister says. "I ask people, 'What are you attracted to?' I let them feel that magnetic pull to what they're needing in their life." 
 
Want to try crystals and stones? Here are some basics: 
 
Amethyst: Sobering and clarifying 
 
Rose quartz: Self-love and healing 
 
Black tourmaline: Considered the "evil eye of minerals" because it's believed to repel negativity 
 
Citrine: Wealth and abundance 
 
Rubies and garnets: Vitality and vigor 
 
Clear or smoky quartz: Paired with other stones to amplify their properties 
 
A GEM OF A BOOK 
 
Inspired by the increase of crystals in style and pop culture, Elemental Energy: Crystal and Gemstone Rituals for a Beautiful Life by Kristin Petrovich (HarperElixir, $32.99) is a new coffee-table book that explores the history of these natural beauties and how they've come to be incorporated into accessories, decor, beauty products and more. Plus, there's vibrant photography of stones of all sorts. Petrovich is the co-founder of SJAL, a luxury skin-care line.
