<TITLE>File FIR against Arvind Kejriwal for remark on bribes: EC to Goa police</TITLE>
<TEXT>New Delhi: The Election Commission (EC) on Sunday ordered the Goa police to file an FIR against Aam Aadmi Party Convener (AAP) and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal for violating the Model Code of Conduct with his comment about bribes, at an election rally held earlier this month in Goa. 
 
The EC directed that necessary legal action should be initiated by filing an FIR against Kejriwal for the statements he made on January 8 in Goa. It sought a compliance report regarding legal action on the Delhi Chief Minister latest by 3 pm on January 31. 
 
The Commission had earlier quoted him as saying at an election rally that Congress and BJP will come to distribute money. People should accept it in new currency and ask for Rs 10,000 instead of Rs 5,000 keeping in mind inflation. However, Kejriwal had said that the people should then vote for AAP. 
 
It said the AAP leader's statement amounts to "abetting and promoting electoral offence of bribery". 
 
It had said if Kejriwal fails to respond by January 19 afternoon, the Commission will take a decision "without any further reference to you".</TEXT>
