<content type="str">Fredo and Keef duet on an experimental R&amp;B ballad.  
When Fredo shared his new mixtape Plugged In , he shrugged off the closing track, &quot;Tell Nobody,&quot; as an R&amp;B record the two made for kicks while they were high. Apparently, it was never supposed to see the light of day, but upon listening, it&apos;s clear that Fredo undersold the record, which is a glossy, fully formed, auto-tune belter that makes for one of the tape&apos;s strongest tracks.  

A synthesized guitar loop plays over some heavily filtered synths, creating some dreamy textures for Keef and Fredo to add their slippery auto-tuned vocals to. They&apos;re certainly holding nothing back as far as their performance is concerned, but their experiments lead to some unconventionally catchy melodies. 

Quotable Lyrics: 

You ain&apos;t gotta tell nobody 
What&apos;s going on 
Between me and you 
Baby girl I fuck with you 
But I can not fuck with you 
Meet me at the airport 
Baby, I&apos;mma fly you out</content>
