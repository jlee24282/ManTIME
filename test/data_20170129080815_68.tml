Invercargill couple Tim and Petrina Frampton&apos;s first step into racehorse ownership has started in remarkable fashion. 
 
With some encouragement from Petrina&apos;s sister-in-law Maria Hickey, who herself owns horses, the Framptons decided to buy a share in a horse. 
 
On Sunday that horse, Hasahalo, flew home with an impressive late sprint to finish second in New Zealand&apos;s richest race, the Karaka Million in Auckland. 
   
Opie Bosson shows his delight at winning the Karaka Million on outsider Melody Belle. 
   
The 2-year-old race was won by $32.40 shot Melody Belle, while Hasaholo paid $1.80 for the place. 
 
  
   
    
 
Felton Road, which is part-owned by former Black Cap and now broadcaster Simon Doull, was third in the race. 
 
Many horse owners can go a lifetime without experiencing the feeling of having their horse impress in such a big race, but the the Invercargill couple have experienced it with their first shot. 
 
Hasahalo is trained by Stephen McKee and ridden by Blake Shinn. 
 
The second place finish from Hasaholo in the 2017 race continued a trend of success for Southland owners in the million dollar race - a race which is for horses bought at the Karaka Sales in Auckland. 
 
The 2013 Karaka Million winner, Ruud Awakening, was part-owned in Southland by Jack Faul, of Invercargill, and Helen Christian, of Bluff. 
   
Last year Southlanders Trevor Tomlins, Peter Finlayson, and Kevin Dixon had a share in the horse Showmeyamoneyhoney which finished second in the Karaka Million. 
 
The trio also had a horse, Dijon Bleu, line up in this year&apos;s race in Auckland on Sunday. 
 
Dijon Bleu was amongst the frontrunners turning into the home straight but was squeezed back to 9th, 5.6 lengths off the winner. </TEXT>
