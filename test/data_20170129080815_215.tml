<TEXT type="str">Frequent contributors to editorial pages remind us that we, and other world constituencies, have developed populistic views that favor nationalism and anti-globalization. What no one asks, however, is whether those views are good for the country, or even if they are good for voters anywhere. 
   
The pundits all say, “Well, that’s what people are thinking.” They then speculate endlessly about how the change will affect policies, institutions and actions that emerged before all these “new” ideas blossomed.

Is it really good to promote “me-only” or “we-only” policies and actions?

However humans have gotten to inhabit this earth, living together favors working in community rather than working as isolates. Hunters and gatherers survived more when groups cooperated in harvesting food. Are we, a far more technologically and socially integrated civilization, any different? Absolutely not. No human is born and survives without the extended help of other caregivers. And no group of humans today survives without the benefit of handed-down traditions regarding food, clothing, housing, medicines, tools, or ultimately without the benefit of viable social institutions like families, schools, employers, networks and even entertainers.
