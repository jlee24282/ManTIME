<TEXT type="str">An anonymous reader writes: During the interview process for a technology job, I was asked to fill out an application which included questions about my compensation history. When I asked why, I was told that it was part of the background check and wouldn&apos;t be used to determine the size of the offer... What is the risk for the employer of not knowing that info? Is this standard procedure or part of a trend at technology companies? The original submission asks if this is ever a legitimate question -- or more to the point, &quot;Is it anything more than an attempt to gain negotiating leverage?&quot; So leave your best answers in the comments. When you&apos;re interviewing for a new IT job, should you tell future employers your salary history?</TEXT>
