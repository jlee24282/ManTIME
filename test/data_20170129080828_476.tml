<content type="str">Promoter Richard Schaefer talked up the prospect of a third fight between Carl Frampton and Leo Santa Cruz after the Mexican won back his WBA Super world featherweight title. 
 
Schaefer was impressed by their rematch at the MGM Grand Garden Arena and says a third fight can be made because both fighters want it. 
 
&quot;They embraced each other and said &apos;let&apos;s get it on&apos;,&quot; said the Ringstar chief. 
 
&quot;If two fighters want to get it on, that&apos;s all it takes. Whether it&apos;s an immediate rematch, we will see. 
 
&quot;They are true gentlemen out of the ring and two true warriors in the ring. If you put them together, 10 times out of 10, you would see that kind of fight.&quot;

Schaefer poured cold water on Frampton&apos;s call to have the third fight in Belfast. 
 
He is unsure if there is a venue which could host the fight, including outdoors at Windsor Park. 
 
Leo Santa Cruz claimed he had talked about quitting to ensure he won.

&quot;I put retirement in my head so that I would have no choice but to win,&quot; he said. 
 
&quot;This is better than I could have hoped for. I&apos;m so happy. 
 
&quot;This is a big relief that I won and I would like a third fight.&quot;
