<TEXT type="str">Cornwall could spend an extra three-quarters of a million pounds to help rough sleepers.

That is how much the Council has recommended is spent on increasing support.

It comes as figures reveal there were almost 100 homeless people in the Duchy last autumn.

That is a significant increase on the 65 reported the previous year, and made Cornwall the third worst place in the country for it.

Now as part of a wider review of the Council&apos;s Strategic Housing Strategy, members recommended that Â£850,000 should be used to fund additional services to help rough sleepers off the streets.

The recommendation to use Cornwall Housing Ltd reserves is subject to formal approval from its Board.

Cornwall Council and its partners are developing a series of proposals as part of a comprehensive action plan to respond to the increase in rough sleeping in Cornwall.

This will be aimed at stemming the flow of people on to the streets as well as providing accommodation/support options for existing rough sleepers and will take in good practice in this field, drawn from local and national examples.

Cornwall Housing Ltd and its voluntary and statutory partners including St Petroc&apos;s Society, Coastline Homelessness Service, Stonham and Shelter and Cornwall Council&apos;s Education, Health, Social Care and the strategic housing teams are continuing to work together with targeted interventions to address the needs of new rough sleepers and more entrenched individuals through closer collaborative working. 

There is a Cornwall Rough Sleeper Operational Group (CRSOG) which brings together agencies (Housing, Health, Criminal Justice, voluntary sector, D&amp;C Police, Drug and Mental Health) around the table to discuss individuals with complex support needs and develop joint solutions for them.

The CRSOG has recently assisted a number of very chaotic individuals off the streets. 

Members of the public who have concerns about a rough sleeper in their area should go to theStreetlink website.

The rough sleeper will be contacted by the Street Outreach Team within 24 hours and offered advice, assistance and support to find accommodation.

Last year, figures from the homeless charity Crisis showed almost 80% of people sleeping rough were attacked or suffered abuse in 2016.

Jon Sparkes, chief executive of the charity, said: &quot;Behind these statistics are thousands of desperate people sleeping in doorways, bin shelters, stations and parks - anywhere they can find to stay safe and escape the elements.

&quot;Rough sleeping ruins lives, leaving people vulnerable to violence and abuse, and taking a dreadful toll on their mental and physical health.&quot;</TEXT>
