Just hours out from arguably the biggest match of his career, Roger Federer gifted Omar Jasika an opportunity the young Aussie will never forget. 
 
Sunday night&apos;s Australian Open final between Federer and Rafael Nadal is being touted as the biggest in the tournament&apos;s 105-year history. 

And as Federer hit the practice court for a final tune-up before the blockbuster match, he asked Jasika to be his hitting partner. 

LIVE SCORES: All the action from the Australian Open 

&quot;Pleasure warming up the king tonight before his final&quot;, Jasika posted on Twitter on Sunday afternoon.

19-year-old Jasika was granted a wildcard for this year&apos;s Australian Open, losing to David Ferrer in the opening round. 

Ranked 290 in the world, Jasika is trying to make the leap from the junior ranks, where he claimed both the US Open singles and boys doubles in 2014. 

He also got the opportunity to practice with World No.2 Novak Djokovic earlier in the week.

Officials have taken the unprecedented step of opening up Margaret Court Arena and telecasting the final on a big screen inside the 7500-seat stadium, with the champion set to speak at the venue after the match. 

Federer, already the men&apos;s all-time grand slam title leader, is attempting to win his 18th major four and a half years after last reigning at one of tennis&apos;s four biggest events. 
 
It&apos;s also the Swiss master&apos;s first tournament back since breaking down at Wimbledon last July with a recurrence of a knee injury he required surgery for five months earlier. 

Nadal, chasing his 15th slam, is hoping to crown his own comeback from an injury-ravaged 2016 season and re-enter the conversation about who is the sport&apos;s greatest modern-day player.
