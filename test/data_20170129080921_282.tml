<TITLE>Commentator blasts Tsvangirai's spokesman</TITLE>
<TEXT>A political commentator Polite Musarurwa has blasted MDC-T leader Morgan Tsvangirai's spokesperson Luke Tamborinyoka accusing him for sleeping on duty and being obsessed with defending his boss every time he gets attacked on social media. 

"Luke Tamborinyoka is sleeping honestly . He is only obsessed wit defending Morgan Tsvangirai only after he is attacked on social media or main media .. Instead of doing publicity work for his boss," he said. 

"He only let the country know that Morgan Tsvangirai was in Matabeleland South after one unknown website lied that Tsvangirai is dead. I know the lie was made by the state machinery for the Bikita by-election." 

He urged him to wake up and stop reacting to what the enemy say about his boss whose programs you are keeping to yourself 

"If people knew what Tsvangirai was doing and where ..they were going to ignore the lie," he said.
