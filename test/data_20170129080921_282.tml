<content type="str">A political commentator Polite Musarurwa has blasted MDC-T leader Morgan Tsvangirai&apos;s spokesperson Luke Tamborinyoka accusing him for sleeping on duty and being obsessed with defending his boss every time he gets attacked on social media. 

&quot;Luke Tamborinyoka is sleeping honestly . He is only obsessed wit defending Morgan Tsvangirai only after he is attacked on social media or main media .. Instead of doing publicity work for his boss,&quot; he said. 

&quot;He only let the country know that Morgan Tsvangirai was in Matabeleland South after one unknown website lied that Tsvangirai is dead. I know the lie was made by the state machinery for the Bikita by-election.&quot; 

He urged him to wake up and stop reacting to what the enemy say about his boss whose programs you are keeping to yourself 

&quot;If people knew what Tsvangirai was doing and where ..they were going to ignore the lie,&quot; he said.
