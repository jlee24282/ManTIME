The body of the woman was found inside a bed in the bedroom while her daughter&apos;s from the adjoining room, the personnel said, adding that the flat was locked from outside and police had to break open the main door. According to police, the bodies were of few days old as it was learnt that the girl had not gone to school for the last two days.
