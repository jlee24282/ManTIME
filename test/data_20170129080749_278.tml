THE BUILDING which is the current home of Scunthorpe&apos;s Honest Lawyer public house and restaurant is used to ringing the changes. 
 
For the site on Oswald Road was once used by a national retail chain to sell and rent out electronic cash registers. 
 
The business, known as Hugin-Sweda, was part of an international conglomerate. 
 

 
Scunthorpe&apos;s Grand Old Buildings - how many family meals did you have at The Buccaneer? 

 
Before that the building was a retail outlet for the former Scunthorpe Co-operative Society. 

 
Cash tills soon led to bigger thrills in Oswald Road and the advent of the 1980s saw the building enter its most exciting era. 
 
First on site was the town&apos;s original Greek restaurant, El Greco, run by an amiable host called Alex and his family. 
 
Further change came when Greco&apos;s was converted into The Grape Escape – yet another first for the steel town. 

 
Owned by the Smith family, the Grape gave many Scunthonians their first taste of a city-style wine bar. 
 
But it was another Smith – Bill, the owner of the nearby Bridge Hotel – and his mates who gave the building its best-known guise. 
 

 
In 1989, Bill, together with local solicitor Andy Pascoe and brewery rep Nick Mead, got the go-ahead to convert the site into The Honest Lawyer, serving real ale and bar-stool legal advice to drinkers! 
 
The Lawyer opened in December that year and soon became the favourite Saturday watering hole for fans en route to Glanford Park. 
 
Under the tenure of its best-known landlord and ex-Durham police sergeant, Alan Edgar, the Lawyer also became the temporary home of the annual British, European and Commonwealth conker championships.

The pub also fielded a side in the local Sunday morning friendly cricket league. 

 

 
In 1981, local businessman Ian Walker bought the freehold of the property. 
 
Last month he also took over the tenancy, appointing Kerryann Loosemore as the general manager. 
 
One of his first moves was drop The Gallows as the name of 34-cover first floor restaurant.
