<TITLE>Beckham: Man Utd humiliated me, but there was no abuse</TITLE>
<TEXT>David Beckham insists none of the horrific child sexual abuse in English football that has come to light in recent months happened during his time at Manchester United. 
 
The heartbreaking truth behind child abuse in the UK 
 
Numerous former players have come out in testimony of their ordeal while coming through the ranks at clubs, kickstarting a storm of controversy surrounding the conduct of coaches. 
 
Police are presently investigating the allegations that began last November , with numerous accounts circulating around convicted paedophile andformer trainer Barry Bennell. 
 
Clubs have agreed to cooperate ininvestigations but, while Beckham admitted he had been humiliated as a "lesson" during his time as a United academy player, there had never been wrongdoing on the part of the club's staff. 
 

 
"It's disgraceful what's gone on and there has to be something done about it," Beckham said on BBC's Desert Island Discs radio show. "But there was never anything at Manchester United. 
 
Sane, Sterling & Jesus hint at bright Man City future 
 
"The closest [thing to abuse] would've been certain professionals. If we'd gone out of line they'd make us do a funny dance in the middle of the changing room in front of our heroes at the time. 
 
"[It was] humiliation, and that was all it was, but that was just to teach us a lesson, there was never any wrongdoing." 
 
"I'd like to believe the FA are doing everything they can to find out about the allegations. The more these ex-professionals voice their opinions, that's when there will be change. 
 
"I would like to think the clubs are all on board with this."</TEXT>
