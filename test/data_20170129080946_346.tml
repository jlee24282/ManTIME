 Dog llistening to music Michale Sevy / Moment /   
Putting together a playlist for your pup? New research could help you fetch some of Fido&apos;s favorite tunes. 
 
In a  recent study  by the University of Glasgow and the Scottish SPCA, researchers found that dogs in kennels were less stressed when they listened to music – especially reggae and soft rock. 
 
&quot;Overall, the response to different genres was mixed, highlighting the possibility that like humans, our canine friends have their own individual music preferences,&quot; said Neil Evans, one of the study&apos;s authors.
