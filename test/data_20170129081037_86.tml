<TITLE>The complainant later sent a legal notice to the Passport</TITLE>
<TEXT>Office and when it was not answered filed the case. 
 
The defendants contested the claim on the ground that the complaint was time barred as it was to be filed within two years from the date of the cause of action that is October 24, 2009 but was instead filed on December 3, 2009. 
 
They further argued that the complainant did not fall under the definition of 'Consumer' under the Consumer Protection Act. 
 
The complainant argued that he had filed the complaint for deficiency in services by the passport office due to overwriting and sufferings he had to undergo during the trip. 
 
The forum noted that the complaint involves several issues like proof of the claims, allegations and documentary evidence which will be possible only after recording of evidences. 
 
It cannot be decided summarily and is being disposed of without any decision, observed the members.
