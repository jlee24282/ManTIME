<TEXT type="str">Over the weekend (Jan. 28), we hopped in the DeLorean, and went back 30 years ago to one of the most awesome decades to grace time with its presence: the 1980s. The iHeart80s Party rocked the SAP Center in San Jose, California with a star-studded lineup of artists including New Kids on the Block , UB40 Featuring Ali Campbell, Astro and Mickey, Colin Hay of   Men At Work , Rick Astley , Starship ,  Eddie Money , and Night Ranger . And it was all hosted by iconic MTV personality Martha Quinn, who hosts the iHeart80s Radio&apos;s weekday morning show.

The night was filled with some RAD moments from all of the performances of the night, amazing fan reactions, special guests, and more. Check out the best moments from the show below: 
 Candace Cameron Bure -- AKA D.J. TANNER -- Helped Kick Off The Night By Introducing New Kids On The Block  
In case you didn’t know, Candace is a huge NKOTB fan, and has been over the last 30 years. The band and Bure united on her show Fuller House , so there was no one better to introduce the band and kick off the show than D.J. Tanner herself. 
   New Kids On The Block Brought All The Right Stuff  
New Kids On The Block are one of the O.G. boybands, and after over 30 years of performing together, the guys still have  the right stuff . NKOTB took the stage to perform hits like “Step By Step,” “You Got It (The Right Stuff),” and more, and brought all of their amazing dance moves with them. And yes, we’re talking about those classic steps you learned from watching their music videos. 
 Also, the NKOTB fans were out in FULL FORCE. Donnie couldn’t resist…  Starship Reminds Us “We are all citizens of the world.”  
At the very end of their performance at the 2017 iHeart80s Party, which also happened to be the day as President Donald Trump’s Immigration Ban which sparked protests across the country, Starship lead singer Mickey Thomas simply told the crowd, “Remember, we are all citizens of the world.”

— iHeartRadio (@iHeartRadio) January 29, 2017  Rick Astley Opened His Set With A Classic Rickroll  
Astley kicked off his set with a classic Rickroll by leading fans to believe he was going to open with “Never Gonna Give You Up” by having his band play the instrumentals, but instead he kicked things off with his Whenever You Need Somebody single “Together Forever.” Also during his set, the ‘80s icon, who turns 50 on February 6th, made jokes about his age and blamed it for his lack of dance numbers and inability to play high-energy songs back-to-back. 
 UB40’s “Red Red Wine” Had Everybody Feeling So Fine  
UB40  Featuring Ali Campbell, Astro and Mickey  took us all back to 1983 with their hit “Red Red Wine.” The crowd went wild during the band’s performance of the beloved tune -- everybody was feeling it.
