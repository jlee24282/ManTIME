<content type="str">JERANTUT, Jan 29 (Bernama) -- The Regent of Pahang, Tengku Abdullah Sultan Ahmad Shah today expressed his disappointment over an incident in which a one-year and 18 month-old girl drowned in Pekan yesterday. 
Tengku Abdullah said he was shocked when informed that Siti Nurdarwisyah Abdul Rahman drowned in Kampung Tanjung Medang Hilir, Pekan. 

&quot;It was a shocking news because I had just returned from visiting her relatives, and prior to that, have on numerous occasions reminded parents to monitor their children&apos;s safety during the floods. 

&quot;However, it has been fated and I hope family members of the victim remain calm,&quot; said the Regent during a visit to the flood evacuation centre at Balai Raya Kampung Simpang Tebing Tinggi here today. 

Accompanying the Regent was Tengku Puan Pahang Tunku Azizah Aminah Maimunah Iskandariah. 

In the incident yesterday, Siti Nurdarwisyah was found missing at about 7.20 pm yesterday by her father, who then sought the assistance of neighbours to look for his only child. 

The girl was found about half an hour later trapped in between the bushes in the flood water not far from her house and was then to Pekan Hospital for treatment, but died at 9.17 pm yesterday. 

In another development, Tengku Abdullah hit out at some youngsters who had no care for their own life by doing dangerous stunts, including climbing and jumping from a signboard into a river where a recording of it went viral recently.
