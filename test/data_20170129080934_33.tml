George Ezra stayed in a cabin without electricity to work on his new album. 
The ‘Budapest’ hitmaker famously went inter-railing around Europe to seek inspiration for his debut LP ‘Wanted On Voyage’ and has been on a variety of other adventures in order to shape his next LP, even though his original ideas were quashed. 
He said: &quot;I spent last January in a cottage in Cornwall, writing. 
&quot;My first plan had been to travel alone on industrial shipping between London and New York but I was talked out of it – ‘The Atlantic, in January’ – so I went to Cornwall instead. 
&quot;Then I did a month in Barcelona. I did Airbnb and deliberately stayed with the owner, who I didn’t know. 
&quot;It was a risk, but she showed me the city. 
&quot;Then I did 10 days in a cabin in Norfolk without any electricity. 
&quot;Everyone went, ‘No, think about what runs on electricity’, but I booked it. 
&quot;The shower was outside. You had to wake up at 6am to get the fire going but there was something amazing about showering in a field.&quot; 
And George believes his experiences cut off from friends and family helped to focus his mind more. 
He explained: &quot;I think something happens to your mind when you’re away for a prolonged amount of time by yourself. 
&quot;You start to see things a little differently. Everything is more intense.&quot; 
As a result of his travels, &quot;turning off&quot; became a big talking point in the 23-year-old star’s new songs. 
He told Q magazine: &quot;One of the main topics on the record is how to get away from everything. 
2I know everyone has said it, but 2016 was a really weird year, so I’ve written songs about turning off. 
&quot;I know as part of my job I have to go on to Twitter, it’s a free way of connecting but… I know full well if it wasn’t part of my job I wouldn’t do it. It’s suffocating.&quot;
