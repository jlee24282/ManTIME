<TITLE>George Ezra wrote new album in cabin</TITLE>
<TEXT>Music News  prev next /January 29, 2017            
George Ezra stayed in a cabin without electricity to work on his new album. 
The Budapest hitmaker famously went inter-railing around Europe to seek inspiration for his debut LP Wanted On Voyage and has been on a variety of other adventures in order to shape his next LP, even though his original ideas were quashed. 
He said: "I spent last January in a cottage in Cornwall, writing. 
"My first plan had been to travel alone on industrial shipping between London and New York but I was talked out of it  The Atlantic, in January  so I went to Cornwall instead. 
"Then I did a month in Barcelona. I did Airbnb and deliberately stayed with the owner, who I didnt know. 
"It was a risk, but she showed me the city. 
"Then I did 10 days in a cabin in Norfolk without any electricity. 
"Everyone went, No, think about what runs on electricity, but I booked it. 
"The shower was outside. You had to wake up at 6am to get the fire going but there was something amazing about showering in a field." 
And George believes his experiences cut off from friends and family helped to focus his mind more. 
He explained: "I think something happens to your mind when youre away for a prolonged amount of time by yourself. 
"You start to see things a little differently. Everything is more intense." 
As a result of his travels, "turning off" became a big talking point in the 23-year-old stars new songs. 
He told Q magazine: "One of the main topics on the record is how to get away from everything. 
2I know everyone has said it, but 2016 was a really weird year, so Ive written songs about turning off. 
"I know as part of my job I have to go on to Twitter, its a free way of connecting but I know full well if it wasnt part of my job I wouldnt do it. Its suffocating."
