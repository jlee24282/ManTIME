<content type="str">Floyd Mayweather says a crossover showdown with UFC superstar Conor McGregor is likely to happen. 
 
Mayweather signed off his professional career with a points win over Andre Berto in September 2015 to take his record to a perfect 49-0. 
 
But the former five-weight world champion, who turns 40 next month, has in recent months been linked with a so-called &apos;super fight&apos; in a crossover encounter against McGregor. 
 
The Irishman insists his next fight will be in a boxing ring and called out Mayweather, branding him &apos;scared&apos;. 
 
Mayweather is keen for the bout to go ahead but has no timescale. 
 
He said on Sky Sports 1: &quot;Most likely the fight between me and Conor McGregor will happen. 
 
&quot;That&apos;s the only fight that will get me back in the ring. He&apos;s going to do a job on his side and we are going to do a job on my side and hopefully all the fans in the UK come over and support me.

&quot;I don&apos;t know (when it will be), I need to communicate with my team, the fight hasn&apos;t been made yet, but it is all about entertainment so hopefully we can make it happen.&quot;
