<TITLE>Odoi: Play Our Game</TITLE>
<TEXT>Having helped knock Hull City out of the UEFA Europa League a couple of years ago, Denis Odoi is hoping for a similar outcome on Sunday. 
 
The full-back was part of the Lokeren side who caused an upset when they sent the Tigers out of the competition at the Play-Off stage in August 2014. 
  
We were a smaller team in Belgium, Odoi recalled. We were the fifth or sixth placed team in Belgium, and obviously the Premier League is a bigger competition than the Belgian competition. 
 
So to come to a Premier League side and be able to play in England in a qualifier for the Europa League was a really nice experience, and especially when we got to beat them. 
 
Its always nice to compete with a Premier League side, its where every player wants to play and a chance to compete on that level to see where you are individually and as a team. 
 
Hull may be a top flight outfit, but the bookmakers have made Fulham favourites for the Fourth Round Emirates FA Cup tie. 
 
That said, Odoi knows that his side face a stern test at the Cottage against a team who beat Manchester United just three days earlier. 
 
We need to respect Hull but just play our game like we always do, Odoi stated. I think they will take confidence from a good performance against Manchester United, it will give them an extra boost. 
 
A team like Hull, their main goal is to survive in the Premier League and a performance like that will give them confidence. 
 
Odoi made his FA Cup debut in the previous round in Cardiff, and hes keen for a good run in a tournament that he knew well prior to his arrival at Fulham. 
 
English competitions have a lot of publicity, he explained. FA Cup matches are shown on Match of the Day which you can see in Belgium. Everybody follows English football in Belgium. 
 
Hopefully we can get a good result out of this game and then maybe get a nice fixture in the next round.</TEXT>
