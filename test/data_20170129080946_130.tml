When writing his regular column for the Daily Star , Gunners legend Paul Merson explained why he does not hold out any hope of his former club winning the Premier League title this season. 
 
Arsene Wenger's men currently sit in second position in the table, eight points adrift of league leaders Chelsea, but they do face the Blues at Stamford Bridge next weekend. 
 
Antonio Conte's men also have to travel to Anfield on Tuesday night to take on Liverpool, whilst Arsenal face the easier challenge of a home game against Watford.

But Merson, who made 429 appearances for the north London outfit, explained why he believes his former club will struggle to mount a sustained challenge for the title this season, when writing his column for the Daily Star : 
 
"Arsenal are second but no-one is really talking about them as title winners, and I cant see them winning it if Im being honest. You watch them and usually there are 12 or 13 times a season when theyre breathtaking. Ive not seen that too many times this season. They are going to the well too many times against sides they should be beating. People say thats showing character but these are teams you should be destroying."

The Gunners ' hopes of Premier League glory suffered a blow this week, as manager Arsene Wenger received a four-game touchline ban for his behaviour in the latter stages of his side's 2-1 win over Burnley on Sunday. 
 
And if Arsenal are to close the gap on Chelsea over the next few weeks, they will have to do so without their influential leader.
