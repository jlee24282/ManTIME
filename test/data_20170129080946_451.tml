...NO THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...
...SUMMARY...
No thunderstorms are expected over the continental U.S. Tuesday.
...Discussion...
No significant change to the synoptic pattern is expected Tuesday
with a low-amplitude trough persisting over the Eastern States,
along with an upstream ridge in the west. Surface winds over the
Gulf will return to southerly. However, owing to recent intrusions
of continental-polar air, moisture return will remain limited.
