Music is her soul-mate in the truest sense. Because when a young Kanika Kapoor found her world in sheer disharmony, it helped her not only heal but also carve an identity that she’s proud of today. Her much enjoyed peppy renditions like Baby doll (Ragini MMS), Lovely and Kamlee (Happy New Year), Chittiyaan kalaiyaan (Roy), Premika (Dilwale) and the recent Da da dasse (Udta Punjab) and Beat pe booty (A Flying Jatt) celebrate her effervescence giving no hint about the turmoil she’s been through. And that only validates her talent. 
 

It was a fairytale life for young Kanika when she married businessman Raj Chandok in 1997 at the age of 18 and moved to London. They went on to have three children. Life was all about diamonds, yacht parties and loads of bitching sessions with rich but bored wives. “I had everything at my disposal - from private planes to yachts to the choicest brands,” she recalls adding, “But I was terribly unhappy. I had diamonds galore but there was no love, no respect. I was miserable in the marriage,” she recalls. Like most women, she didn’t have the guts to walk away from what seemed a secure situation. Above all, she had children. “I was dependant financially on my husband. My biggest fear were the kids – where would I go with them?” she shares. “Women waste a lot of time sulking and in self-pity. They need to get up and get out of that,” says the singer who divorced her husband in 2012. 
As they say it’s darkest before dawn. And Kanika found herself emerging out of the abyss. “There comes a moment in your life where you feel nothing is working out for you, your life is hell,” she says. “Just then someone advised me to take up music once more and that became the turning point,” says the graduate in music, who’s also studied classical music under musician Pandit Ganesh Prasad Mishra from Varanasi.  She went ahead to record a song and released it on internet. “A year later, I got a call from Ekta Kapoor, saying she liked my voice and asking me to fly down to Mumbai and record with Meet Bros Anjjan. The breakthrough seems miraculous…” she traces how Baby doll for Ragini MMS 2 happened.  The number filmed on Sunny Leone even won her the Filmfare Best Playback (Female) Award. And since then the music has not stopped playing in her life.

What few know about is her full-fledged fashion career before she came to India. She’s been close to all the international fashion houses given her brush with hi-society. Recently, she even hosted a dinner for Italian fashion designer Stefano Gabbana. “When in London I was a special customer for all the big brands. They used to invite me for their shows. I even walked the ramp for Alberta Ferretti, Demi Couture at the Milan Fashion Week. After all, I was married to a wealthy man. So all I did was spend, lunch and bitch,” laughs Kanika. Today, she doesn’t miss the lavish lifestyle she once enjoyed. “I’m happy and content. I believe happiness lies within you. You can have the world at your feet and yet be the unhappiest person because of your state of mind,” she declares. “I don’t need a rich husband. I’m ready to live with less. I don’t wear Dolce and Gabbana anymore. I buy Zara and I look okay,” she smiles. 
 

She’s friends with her ex-husband Raj now. In fact, he’s happy for her success. “When he heard my songs, he told me, ‘Well done, I’m always there for you’,” she laughs adding, “I’ve learnt that in good times everyone is your friend. There are few who are by your side duirng hard times. And that support is all that matters in those times.” 
Thankfully, pain has not left her bitter. Rather, it’s made her more compassionate, more sensitive to others. It’s also given her an all-embracing perspective. “I’d never want anyone to experience pain and discomfort because of me. I’d never want to cheat anybody.... I don’t have a feeling of competition or jealousy towards anyone either. You have to be happy in your own skin,” she states. Merely two years into the business but Kanika has made a mark in the music world. Shares she, “I want to do quality work. So far, I’ve been doing songs that are commercial. Now that will change. I want to explore further. It could be with a new filmmaker or even a small- budget film,” she informs. “Thanks to my classical training, I can mould my voice and style. I can sing a song like Baby doll to a Chhil gaye naina (NH10) to a Da da dasse (Udta Punjab),” she says adding, “I love old songs like Jao re jogi tum jaore (Amrapali). There’s beauty in old school music. I want to explore my voice in that realm.” She insists she has poured her experiences in her music. “It comes from my journey. My trauma has made me mature. It’s also made me spiritual. That makes me different from other singers. For instance, Yeh duniya pittal di from Baby doll has a special impact. It has come from my soul,” she explains.

The singer has begun doing independent music though she has been advised otherwise. “My first song ever, Jugni Ji was an independent music video. People recognise internationally because of Jugni Ji, be it Arabs, Moroccans or the Spanish. I’m now doing a French collaboration only because of Jugni Ji. Maybe India knows me with Baby doll but Jugni Ji is the biggest song in the world for me.”  She also enjoys doing stage shows. In fact, her last show in Dallas was a sold out. “Thirty five thousand people were shouting my name in unison. I was feeding on their energy and giving my best. It’s humbling to see people love you so much. It has transformed me as a person,” she says. She confides it’s only through time that she has developed this confidence on stage. “My first performance was with Shah Rukh Khan and Deepika Padukone in Abu Dhabi for an IPL concert. I was trembling on stage; I didn’t know how to perform. And when I came down someone said it on my face, ‘That was a shit performance.’ I just burst out in tears,” she recalls the embarrassing memory. 

She’s not overwhelmed by the glamour world and is aware of the not-so-congenial side as well. “This is not a very welcoming industry be it for an actor or a singer. Initially, people regarded me as a ‘one song wonder.’ I’m not a misfit but I have a set of ethics. But here things are teda-meda. People say something, do something, mean something else... Nothing is black and white,” she rues. She’s not just got a beautiful voice but also a beautiful face. Not surprising then that she’s received acting offers too!  “I don’t want to do some floozy role here and there. Believe me; I could have done five movies in the past year alone. But I respect myself as an artiste. I’ll do a role that suits me. What’s the point of trying to be something that you’re not?” she quips with candour.</content>
