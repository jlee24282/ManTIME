Akshay Kumar&apos;s upcoming film Jolly LLB 2 is releasing in a few weeks on February 10 and the khiladi star is very much needed in the country to promote his film. 
 
Meanwhile, Jolly LLB 2 is caught in a one-of-a-kind legal soup. A practicing sessions court lawyer Ajaykumar Waghmare has filed a petition against Jolly LLB 2 and has urged the filmmakers to drop the word &apos;LLB&apos; from the title as the film is &quot;nothing but an attempt to portray the Indian legal profession and judicial system as a laughing stock to the society at large.&quot;

The petition has been filed against, among others, Akshay Kumar, his co-actor Annu Kapoor and Fox Star Studios, the producers of Jolly LLB 2. It remains to be seen what the case leads to and whether Jolly LLB 2 becomes yet another Rs 100-crore hit.
