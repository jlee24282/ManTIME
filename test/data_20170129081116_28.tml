Transcript: >> jason: all right, from bull riding to riding the range in the "good day, virginia"! happy healthy cooks joining us. how are you? >> great to be here! >> how are you? >> it's going to be cold this weekend and this is a recipe for middle eastern soup. it will warm you up and easy to make and pretty affordable. >> jason: what do you have going on here? >> diced onions cooking up and add 2 stocks of celery and that is a normal sized onion and what is great about soup you don't have to be that specific. if you have a big onion or only half an onion left in the fridge. >> jason: throw it in there! >> don't worry about it. and saute the onion with some garlic and i like to be generous and might be 3 or 4 and that is just the way it goes. >> keep the vampires away. >> a couple of saute these vegetable in red pepper. >> what's it is difference between the red and yellow and orange and green? >> i don't know if it's true but i heard a red pepper and green pepper are the same pepper, it it is just red is more ripe but then you get a yellow one? you need like a gardner for that and i'm not a i can hardly on then it is pepper and we're going to saute and that takes a little longer and once you get those cooking for a couple of minutes and add a can of diced tomatoes. not going to get tomatoes and cut them. canned diced tomatoes. and you can even with the soup cheat and go to the store and get the frozen pre?diced onions. like you don't even have to cut an onion. you can make it that easy. >> i cry cutting onions all the time. >> want to know the trick about that? >> if you do it under water, right? >> but then how do you not burn your hand off? to cut? >> so what's the trick? >> cold. if the onion is cold, it's less likely to spray up the onion fumes and there is that trick of the day. >> learn something new every day. >> and i don't know how to the stove on hotter and and that is going to cook for about a minute and i actually smoke our lentils overnight because you don't have to do that. >> jason: softens them up. >> we only have a few minutes in between the two segments so i wanted to have it ready for this. >> jason: tv magic! >> yes, tv magic. and we'll just add those >> jason: how much is that? two cups? >> two cups after they've been soaked so i just sort of took the half a bag and lentils and dumped some in the bowl with the water left in on the counter last night and glad i did and thought i have to remember to soak those lentils so i remembered and it is the sign of the miracle and salt. use as much ear as little salt. if you, later on, wh waiting for this to cook fresh dill and parsley. if that's not your thing add some cumin and maybe crushed red pepper and maybe a different flavor profile. it's a lemon and something you can make your own and whatever flavors you like. >> all right. >> back in the good with the tasty and healthy dish. >> when we cook in the schools with the kids, the smell of onions and garlic and all the teachers come by. >> and now jason said the only thing you didn't get to touch on was how much water. >> we put 4 cups of water and go flew it real quick and we sauted onion and garlic and peper and carrots and celery with a couple of each and the onion and little bit of garlic. >> people probably have it at home, right? >> yes. and it is stuff that lasts a long time in the fridge. if you have a perper, great, if you don't, put it in. >> kathlynn: if you don't like certain things, leave them out. >> or put them in and cut them really small and that way you may start to learn to develop a like for it but if you have a big chunk of something you don't like, you won't like it. >> kathlynn: let me ask you this. is it something your child is kind of into vegetables but not really. you could convince them to like the peppers? >> it works with the 600 kids we work with in the system with happy healthy cooks. the kids are part of preparing the food so you cut with them. they tear the dill. they tear parsley. take a little taste. you cut the pepper. >> that's the best part. taking taste. >> take a tiny taste of pepper and the more you do that, maybe the first time they're not going to be if you have the pickiest of picky, but the you do that with them, it is an investment of time and it takes longer to cook dinner but food is powerful and it either makes you really sick over a long time or keeps you healthy. >> and that is what all focus on, right? >> exactly. >> kathlynn: and many dishes are tasty and gr >> they're all actually loaded with fruits and vegetables and lintels and black eyed peas and things like that and they make everything in the classroom with the help of volunteers and go cook it in the classroom and eat it. and it is amazing. last week we made african stew with collard greenssinger, corn, tomatoes, all of these things that separately they taste. >> kathlynn: we have 30 seconds ask been letting it ?? and been letting it cool off. and said wait until last second. >> this takes 15 minutes to cook, maybe 20. make sure everything is and tender. and add salt to taste. that's nice especially for the weekend! >> it will be nice and warm and it freezes really well, too, so always, always, always make a double batch. >> kathlynn: sounds great! the recipe online. always good
