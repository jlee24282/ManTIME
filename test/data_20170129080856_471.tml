The Mail on Sunday believes that Manchester United and Arsenal will battle it out for the signing of Atletico Madrid forward Antoine Griezmann .

United are believed to be in pole position given their ability to pay higher wages, and his friendship with Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba . Griezmann would cost around £85 million.

Otherwise this wobble could turn into a slip down the table.
