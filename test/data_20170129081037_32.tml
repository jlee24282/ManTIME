You can find out now at nine weeks, which is really bizarre, he told Jimmy Kimmel at the time, in reference to gender testing. They do a blood test. Its crazy. They test if theres hormones in there. They go, Oh, youve got testosterone. So you either have balls or youre having a baby boy. 

 
When Kimmel, 49, then joked about possible names the couple were trying out to go with Hammer, the Birth of a Nation actor only referenced names for a baby boy. Were thinking Jack, Jack Hammer, he joked. Michael Charles and he can just go by M.C. Suddenly he realized his mistake. I think I just gave away our baby name, Hammer revealed. Im in so much trouble!"
