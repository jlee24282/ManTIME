This week we celebrated the opening of a spacious new medical clinic for the uninsured — a health center that will improve care for Stamford’s most vulnerable. The Americares Free Clinic of Stamford is already bustling with low-income patients who have nowhere else to turn for help treating debilitating, life-threatening health problems. At 2,200-square feet with five exam rooms, the clinic was designed to give us room to grow. But with efforts underway in Washington to repeal the Affordable Care Act without consensus on a replacement, it could get uncomfortably crowded. 
 
As a health-focused relief and development organization working to increase access to care, it is hard to remain silent when health care for the millions who gained coverage under the A.C.A. is at risk. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates 18 million people could lose coverage within a year if the legislation is repealed. At Americares, we are particularly concerned about the lowest-wage earners and whether they will lose coverage in a transition to the yet-to-be decided replacement plan, disrupting their access to physicians, treatment and, ultimately, their ability to provide for their families. 
 
In our 23 years of experience operating free clinics in the state, any reduction in Medicaid benefits brings patients to our doors. Even with the numbers of uninsured dropping to a record low and one of the most successful health care exchanges in the country, demand at our clinics increased over the past three years; patient visits went up 30 percent from 2013 to 2016. Medicaid funding cuts at the federal or state level would cause demand to skyrocket well beyond our current capacity. Our clinics in Stamford, Bridgeport, Danbury and Norwalk would all be affected. 
 
Cuts to Medicaid programs in other states would also lead to a surge in demand for assistance from our partner clinics. Americares U.S. Program supports 1,000 safety net clinics in all 50 states with medicine, supplies, education and training. Demand for these resources is highest in states that did not expand Medicaid. Our U.S. Program shipped nearly $140 million in medical products to clinic partners in non-expansion states last year — more than twice the amount delivered to states that expanded access to Medicaid. 
 
Americares won’t be alone in feeling the strain. Hospitals, local governments and other social service providers will all shoulder the burden of the newly uninsured. The Urban Institute estimates that repeal without replacement would lead to the newly uninsured seeking an additional $1.1 trillion in uncompensated care between 2019 and 2028. There would be fallout in almost every sector: The George Washington University ’s school of public health projects 2.6 million jobs will be lost over the next two years if Medicaid or tax subsidies are cut. 
 
Economics aside, this is an equality issue. There is an abundance of evidence that the poor die younger. A study last year from the Brookings Institution found as much as a 14-year difference in life expectancy between the top 10 percent of wage earners and the bottom 10 percent. 
 
The A.C.A. is far from perfect — the lack of competition in some states and the high deductibles cause real pain for low-income families. We’ve had patients purchase insurance only to return to our free clinics seeking care because they cannot afford the deductibles. The A.C.A. was crafted with provisions intended to address the needs of the poorest among us. As new legislation is introduced, the people with the least means should not be forgotten. 
 
At Americares, we’ve always promised to care for those affected by poverty. We just never imagined the need would continue to increase. When we opened our first clinic in 1994, we hoped one day our services would no longer be needed, and we could close our doors. We don’t want to give up that hope.
