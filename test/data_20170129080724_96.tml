<TITLE>Nicole Paquette: Conditions for circus animals are worse than portrayed</TITLE>
<TEXT>Its not surprising that a constant apologist for various animal use industries is saddened to see the doors shuttered on an era of elephants and other wild animals being carted across the country for days on end, coercively trained, and living in near constant confinement, or tethered to chains (Closing of Ringlings is just the beginning, letters, Jan. 24), 
 
Having worked for nearly two decades to end the mistreatment of elephants and other wild animals in circuses and travelling shows, I cannot express to readers enough just how terrible the long suffering of these animals is. The fear-mongering picture presented by the Center for Consumer Freedom is not accurate. 
 
The Humane Society of the United States is literally working for a more humane society. We were founded in 1954 to focus on the issues facing animals that went beyond the reach of local shelters. Issues such as the mistreatment of farm animals and animals used for testing. 
 
Its time that fringe groups such as the Center for Consumer Freedom accept the facts: Americans want animals to be treated humanely, regardless of whether they are wild, raised for food, or owned as pets, and the announcement from Ringling Brothers is evidence of that. Closing the curtain is the right thing to do and we applaud Ringlings for realizing that. We urge other circus and travelling shows to follow Ringlings lead and put an end to the use of wild animal acts once and for all.
