<content type="str">Jennifer Hudson wants to move to the UK. 
 
The 35-year-old singer - who has four-year-old son David Jr. with fiance David Otunga - is enjoying spending time in Britain while filming talent show &apos;The Voice UK&apos; and would seriously consider relocating for a longer period of time. 
 
Asked if a move to the UK is on the cards, she said: &quot;Yes, I would love that - no, seriously. I love it. It&apos;s so peaceful and everyone is so sweet.&quot; 
 
The &apos;Spotlight&apos; singer has &quot;banned&quot; herself from using Twitter as she thinks it is important to move herself from the negative comments she gets on social media sites. 
 
She told LOOK magazine: &quot;I remember starting out, they used to tell us, &apos;Don&apos;t read this, don&apos;t look at that&apos; and every once in a while I remind myself of that. 
 
&quot;I&apos;ve banned myself from twitter - I don&apos;t even go on there any more. 
 
&quot;You know what to avoid, how to handle yourself.&quot; 
 
Though Jennifer is enjoying working on &apos;The Voice&apos;, she thinks &apos;American Idol&apos; - on which she found fame in 2004 - gave the contestants better preparation for life in the music industry. 
 
She said: &quot;This process [on The Voice] is so much quicker - it leaps from phase to phase so quickly. I used to call it the &apos;American Idol&apos; rollercoaster that I could never get off because it was just going around and around. 
 
&quot;I agree [&apos;The Voice&apos; is more positive] but I feel like what Simon Cowell brings to the table is he&apos;s preparing you for the industry. 
 
&quot;I feel like that could be necessary to have a taste of hat contestants are really trying to get into and that&apos;s when you learn if you have a tough enough skin for it. 
 
&quot;I thought, &apos;It&apos;s either gonna make me or break me.&apos; &quot;</content>
