<TEXT type="str">Designed to maximise privacy. 
  
SITTING in a tree and getting a bird’s eye view of your property is one way to go about planning how you will design your future home. 
 
Or at least that was the trick Doug MacDonald used for 25-27 Forest Ridge , Bonogin . 
 
The prominent builder behind some of the Gold Coast’s most beautiful and unique homes teamed up with his interior-stylist wife Terri-Lee to create his own family home. 
 
The home was designed to maximise privacy while remaining an eye-catching spectacle. 
 
Armed with a specific set of plans and with the help of architect Jared Poole, the director from HA Building built his dream home in 10 months. 
 
“We bought the land six years ago,” Mr MacDonald said. “We had it for a year and constantly mulled over how we would build our dream home. 
 
An eye-catching design. 
  
“I would come up to the block in the afternoons and sit in one of the trees on the property to get a feel for the landscape. 
 
“We ended up building the neighbour’s house which was very fortunate because we could design it so it wouldn’t spoil our privacy and would fit into the style of its surroundings and not just be another average home.” 
 
Poised on an elevated block, the 574sq m concrete and steel residence was inspired by native bushland. 
 
Landscaping was important. 
  
Playing with colours and raw materials as well as taking ideas from indigenous flora and fauna, Mr MacDonald said he wanted the home to become one with the land. 
 
“Terri-Lee and I love acreage so we wanted to make the best use of the space,” he said. 
 
“It is a very industrial design and the materials connect with the bush landscape. 
 
“It is very open and light, and because it is a sloped block the home is on three levels. But it is still quite flat because of the split elevation.” 
 
The frameless glass door entry opens to reveal polished concrete floors, 4.5m ceilings and enormous glass windows that capture ocean and forest views. 
 
“Concrete and timber doesn’t age,” Mr MacDonald said. 
 
“Trends in homes change all the time so we stuck to a style that wouldn’t go out of fashion. 
 
Building materials connect with the bush landscape. 
  
“There are rust-style features which are actually just painted plastic to look authentic. 
 
“It took me three months to paint the rusted iron style feature around the stairs but it is more sustainable and durable that way. We wanted something that would last, especially since we have four children.” 
 
Mr MacDonald said the property overlooked a nice sunset but he described the morning sunrise as magic. 
 
“It is a cracker of a sky,” he said. 
 
The home is listed for offers over $2.35 million, through Nicole Carter and Russel Segal at RE/MAX Regency, Gold Coast</TEXT>
