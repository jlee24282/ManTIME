<content type="str">The Tamworth Blue bowlers stood tall as they defended for a 40 run win on Sunday. 

Tamworth Blue scratched their way to a 40-run MA Connolly Cup win against Quirindi on Sunday thanks to an “exceptional” bowling performance.

After an underwhelming display with the bat, making just 155, the Blues bowled the home side out for 115 to lock in a semi-final berth and knock Gwydir off top spot.

“We didn’t bat well but they bowled well through the middle,” Tamworth skipper Chris Paterson said.

“Matt Parsons and Andrew Cohen bowled really well.”

Toby Whale (49) and Lachie Barton (46) were the shining lights for the Blues as Parsons and Cohen ripped the heart out of their innings.

Jye Paterson (13) was the only other batsmen to reach double figures, and with Whale put on 61 for the first wicket.

The aggressor of the partnership, Whale became the first of Parsons’ six victims 17 runs later. From there the Blues plummeted to 6-126 before being knocked over in the 31st over, the 26 extras Quirindi bowled a welcome contribution.

“Toby and Lachie batted well, but it would have been nice to see one of them go on,” Paterson said.

Parsons, the former Newcastle Knights prop, claimed two wickets in his final over to finish with 6-40 while partner in crime Cohen returned 3-31.

Tamworth then turned it on with the ball.

“Our bowling was exceptional,” Paterson said.

“They really kept it tight.”

Openers Lachlan Davidson and Brad Redshaw embodied that.

Redshaw didn’t concede a run from his first four overs and went for just 13 off his eight, whilst picking up two wickets.

The signs were ominous for Quirindi when Davidson (2-18) struck the second ball of the innings to leave them 1-0.

That became 2-6 when Redshaw bowled Mick Burgess. Heeding his side’s call to arms, skipper Elliot Tourle found a willing ally in Tom Tanner, the two steering Quirindi to 50 before Davidson removed Tanner.

Tourle continued to hold the innings together but when he departed for 52, Quirindi’s hopes effectively departed with him as the Paterson brothers Jye (3-18) and Luke (2-27) finished off what Redshaw and Davidson started.

Gunnedah meanwhile cruised to a comfortable six-wicket win against Glen Innes at Gunnedah.

Glen Innes could only manage 105 after winning the toss. Vinnie Winsor was the pick of the home side&apos;s bowlers, claiming 4-19 in 10 accurate overs.

Fresh from a four-wicket haul on Saturday in the McAdam Cup, Kaleb McIlveen&apos;s golden arm again left an indelible impact.

McIlveen proved a wonderful foil for Winsor, collecting figures of 3-21.

Gunnedah had few problems in the chase against a charitable Glen attack.

Glen Innes conceded 36 extras, highlighted by a stunning total of 33 wides, which proved the top contributor as Gunnedah overhauled the target in 23 overs. 

Armidale needed a further 60 runs with six wickets in hand to win against Moree.</content>
