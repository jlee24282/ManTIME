<TITLE>USA-Chinese New Year/Family Day</TITLE>
<TEXT>The Chinese Lunar New Year Family Day event took place at the Smithsonian's American Art Museum in Washington D.C. on Saturday. 

Chinese Ambassador Cui Tiankai joined Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution David Skorton in the lion dance eye-dotting ceremony at the opening of the event. 

More than 7,500 residents and visitors, mostly parents with young children joined the event. 

Many traditional folk art including Chinese calligraphy, paper-cutting and dough modeling were introduced. 

"It's a pretty cool introduction for our people that might not have chances to know anything about Chinese culture to come and see how you celebrate Spring Festival," said a visitor. 

The event was especially popular among children, as many learned the art of making dough models and coloring pictures of roosters in celebration of the Year of the Rooster. 

"We want to teach them Chinese culture through our skills. If they feel interested, they will be curious about what kind of nation has such interesting arts and therefore have the drive to learn more. Folk art is a bridge to realize cultural communication without borders," said Bai Lin, an inheritor of the Zongren or bristle dolls art. 

The Smithsonian American Art Museum is located in downtown Washington D.C, close to Chinatown. This is the third year the museum has held a "Chinese New Year Family Day" to celebrate Chinese new year. 

"I think it is very important that we learn about each other's cultures, learn about each other's art and science, and get to know each other as people," said David Skorton, secretary of the Smithsonian. 

The Chinese Lunar New Year or Spring Festival fell on Saturday and marks the Year of the Rooster, according to the Chinese zodiac.</TEXT>
