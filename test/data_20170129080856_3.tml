<TEXT type="str">Floyd Mayweather has expressed his belief that a superfight with Conor McGregor WILL happen. 
 
The retired boxer did not confirm where or when, but gave the clearest indication yet that the fight may take place. 
 
Speak at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas ahead of Carl Frampton&apos;s rematch with Leo Santa Cruz, Mayweather said: &quot;Can we make this fight happen? Absolutely. It&apos;s what everyone wants to see. 
 
&quot;The fans want this fight. The fans have been asking for this fight. It&apos;s all about entertainment. He&apos;s very entertaining. He&apos;s very outspoken like myself, so let&apos;s give the fans what they want to see.

I think the fight between me and McGregor will happen. I think I can get my numbers.&quot; 
 
The Irishman has long made his desire to fight Mayweather known, something he repeated on Saturday. 
 
&quot;[The UFC ] tried to fine me $150,000 for throwing a bottle of water,&quot; said McGregor. &quot;I&apos;m going to go to Las Vegas, get my boxing license and then we see where the f*** Floyd&apos;s at.

&quot;I have my eyes on one thing and that&apos;s Floyd Mayweather. It&apos;s the fight I want. I&apos;ve got the reach. I&apos;ve got the youth. You can&apos;t prepare for a style like me. 
 
&quot;That fight is more than just being explored. There&apos;s a lot of steps, but it&apos;s the fight to make. It&apos;s the fight I want. 
 
&quot;I am enjoying the little games we&apos;re playing the back and forth. Let&apos;s give the fans what they want.&quot;
