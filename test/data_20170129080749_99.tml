We&apos;ll watch for earnings from Pfizer, Merck, ExxonMobil, Visa, and others. Plus, releases including consumption data and January&apos;s jobs report. 
  
Jeremy Glaser:  Welcome to The Week Ahead. 
 
More blue-chip tech firms are due to report. We&apos;ll be watching demand for the iPhone 7 from Apple, Amazon&apos;s holiday profitability, and Facebook&apos;s ad growth. 
 
In pharmaceuticals, Pfizer, Merck, Baxter, and Eli Lilly will be eyed. Other earnings releases include Exxon Mobil, Visa, MasterCard, and UPS. 
 
The Fed concludes its meeting on Wednesday, and although another rate hike is not expected, the statement could still provide some hints as to if the central bank is still on track to raise rates several times in 2017. 
 
There&apos;s plenty of high-profile data releases, too. Monday will see the release of consumption data along with its embedded inflation gauge, which is closely watched by the Fed. And then on Friday, January&apos;s jobs report will reveal if 2017 began with the slowing, but steady, growth trend seen last year. 
 
Other data includes the Case-Shiller home price index, ISM Index, productivity, and auto sales. 
 
Stay tuned to Morningstar for our take on these stories.
