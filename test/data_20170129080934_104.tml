<content type="str">Cape Town - The Blitzboks have won the Wellington Sevens, beating Fiji 26-5 in the final with Seabelo Senatla claiming his 180th career try and the SA record in the process.  
 
After a tense opening 3 minutes it was Fiji who opened the scoring with Joeli Lutumailagi out sprinting Senatla to go over in the left-hand corner for an unconverted try.   
 
Fiji then lost Setareki Bituniyata to the sin bin for a dangerous tackle.  
 
The extra man counted with South Africa keeping the ball in hand. They eventually worked space for Senatla to go over under the posts for his record breaking try. 
 
Senatla 180th try in the HSBC Sevens World Series saw him break Fabian Juries&apos; record for South Africa.  
 
Branco du Preez converted for the Blitzboks to lead 7-5 at half-time.  
 
The Blitzboks extended their lead two minutes into the second half with Rosco Specman getting over under the poles for a converted try after more excellent work from Justin Geduld and Senatla.  
 
Ruhan Nel then scored a third to extend the lead to 19-5 after he cut inside two Fijian defenders and then using his strength to get over the line.  
 
Nel put the game beyond doubt after an excellent breakout by the Blitzboks, scoring under the posts without a Fijian defender near him.  
 
After conceding just 4 tries in the whole tournament, the Blitzboks certainly deserve the title in Wellington.</content>
