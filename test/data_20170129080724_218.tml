<content type="str">An impressive 154 dachsunds turned out for this year&apos;s dachshund races at the Bungendore Show on Sunday. Organisers claim this a record number of the little dogs in the one place at the one time. 

Mark Ellis, the organiser of Sunday&apos;s Werriwa Wiener Dash at the Bungendore Show, believes the turnout of 154 dachshunds for the event constitutes a world record for the number of the sausage dogs in one place at one time.

&quot;We had miniatures, long hairs, short hairs, standards and wire hairs,&quot; he said. &quot;They came from all over; some even travelled from Melbourne.

While Mr Ellis wasn&apos;t able to engage the attention of the people from Guinness, who ruled the record being sought was too &quot;specialised&quot; to interest them, he is happy to claim the record with any other contenders needing to prove him wrong.

Although the quirky event, which has captured the imagination of dachshund lovers from across NSW and the ACT, is only in its second year it has already become one of the feature events of the Bungendore Show.

This year&apos;s dash winner was Buddy, owned by Jacqueline Winzenberg of Page in the ACT. Buddy&apos;s award was presented by NSW Deputy Premier and local member John Barilaro.

One hundred and twenty seven dogs turned up for the inaugural event in 2016.

Bungendore Show, which was first held in the 1840s, has gone from strength to strength in recent decades, this year&apos;s showgirl, Hanna Darmody, 22, said.

Ms Darmody, whose family own a Bungendore butchery, said she could recall helping with the catering at the show as a toddler almost 20 years ago.

&quot;I&apos;ve seen the event grow as the town has grown,&quot; she said. &quot;It is a great bridge between country and city; the showgirl competition is a good way to get young people involved and promotes opportunities in agriculture.&quot;

Show organisers said this year&apos;s event, which enjoyed the best weather conditions in three years, was an unqualified success with more than 2000 people passing through the gates before lunch.

In addition to the usual attractions in the show ring and the pavilions and the dachshund dash, the 2017 event offered visitors a chance to get a close look at the Anzac Centennial 18 pounder gun.

The World War I-era weapon, which also saw service during World War II,was restored by the Royal Australian Artillery Company in conjunction with veteran coach builder Jim Frecklington. The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.</content>
