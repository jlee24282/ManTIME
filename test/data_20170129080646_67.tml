Fiji qualified for the medal final after beating Scotland 19‑12 in a closely contested medal semi‑final. 
 
It was not a great start for Fiji as Scotland scored the first try which was converted as they led 7‑0. 
 
Fiji replied straight after as Kalione Nasoko strolled through for the try which was converted as Fiji leveled the scores at 7-all. 
 
Nasoko was sin binned for a high tackle after the restart. 
 
Scotland scored after the half time siren as they led 12‑7. 
 
Coach Gareth Baber told the players to increase the intensity in the second half. 
 
It was a tense second half, as replacement Alivereti Veitokani beat the defense with some great footwork and scored the try as Fiji led 14‑12. 
 
Joeli Lutumailagi scored the final try. 
 
Baber says he is pleased that they have reached the final. 
 
In the other semifinal South Africa defeated Canada 21‑5.
