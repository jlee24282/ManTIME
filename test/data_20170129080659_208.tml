Three others were lightly and moderately wounded in the clashes in the Jenin refugee camp, according to reports. 

                                                                                         
                
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
IDF troops entered the refugee camp overnight to carry out arrests. Dozens of local youths threw stones and firebombs at the soldiers, who responded by firing tear gas, rubber bullets and live bullets. 

                                                                                         
                
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
A local resident, Mohammed Mahmoud Abu Khalifa, was wounded by a live bullet to his back and died shortly afterwards at a Jenin hospital, according to reports. 

                                                                                         
                
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
The IDF responded that pipe bombs were thrown at soldiers during their operation in the refugee camp. As a result, it said, the soldiers responded by firing at the residents, some of whom were hit.   

                                                                                         
                
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
About two weeks ago, a 17-year-old Palestinian was killed by Border Patrol fire during clashes near the Palestinian town of Tuqu near Bethlehem. Last week, the Israel Police and the Justice Ministry’s department for the investigation of police officers opened an investigation into the death of the youth , Qusai al-Amour, who was documented being dragged away from the scene by the security forces.  </content>
