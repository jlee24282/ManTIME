Screen Actors Guild Awards 
TBS andTNT, 8 ET/5 PT 
 
By all rights, the Screen Actors Guild Awards should be a bigger deal, seeing as theyre given toactors by actors  who should know a thing or two about acting. Yet it has always existed deep in the shadow of the Oscars, Emmys and, Lord help us, the completely preposterous Golden Globes. Sundays editionmay be worth watching for the Life Achievement Award recipient alone: Lily Tomlin, who will collect her prize from 9 to 5 co-stars Jane Fonda and Dolly Parton.

Elementary 
CBS, 10 ET/PT

Showtime/ABC, 10 ET/PT

Odds are good it wont, but in an era when dead shows routinely spring back to life, you never know.
