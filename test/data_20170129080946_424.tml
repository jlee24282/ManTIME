Screen Actors Guild Awards 
TBS and TNT, 8 ET/5 PT 
 
By all rights, the Screen Actors Guild Awards should be a bigger deal, seeing as they’re given to actors by actors — who should know a thing or two about acting.

Sunday’s edition may be worth watching for the Life Achievement Award recipient alone: Lily Tomlin, who will collect her prize from 9 to 5 co-stars Jane Fonda and Dolly Parton.

CBS, 10 ET/PT

That’s Joan’s fate this week, as she’s one of a group of hostages seized by a man who threatens to kill them unless Sherlock finds the person who killed his son. Tony winner Shuler Hensley is among the guest stars. 
 

The Affair/Conviction 
Showtime/ABC, 10 ET/PT

Odds are good it won’t, but in an era when dead shows routinely spring back to life, you never know.
