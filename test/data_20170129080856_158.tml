<content type="str">CADIZ — It wasn’t pretty and definitely wasn’t easy. 
 
But, Bellaire and head coach John Farrier will sure take it, regardless. 
 
The Big Reds needed overtime before they were able to pull away from North Division champion Beaver Local for a 82-76 victory in the third annual Buckeye 8 Girls Basketball Championship Game held in the John W. Stephenson Center at Harrison Central High School. 
 
“We had girls step up and make big shots and big plays,” Farrier said. “We all made mistakes, but we made plays when we needed them and came out with a victory.” 
 
The game was physical from the outset. No fewer than 62 personal fouls were called and 85 free throws were attempted. The game also featured 58 turnovers. 
 
“This was kind of like playing a mirror image of ourselves,” Farrier said. “We have to learn to play without fouling.” 
 
The Big Reds, who are now 18-1 and will close out the pre-OVAC portion of the regular season Monday at Shadyside, fell behind immediately, but then led by as many as 13 early in the second half before Beaver Local got going. 
 
“I never didn’t believe,” Farrier said. “I am confident in these girls and we try to be a confident team. I believe in them and some of the girls were struggling, but we told them to just keep going and going.” 
 
Beaver Local got the game to overtime by outscoring Bellaire, 27-19 in the fourth. From there, however, it was all Big Reds. And that happened despite three Big Reds’ starters — Katrina Davis, Cierra Davis and De’Asia Burney having been disqualified due to fouls. 
 
“We only usually play seven girls and having three on the bench, I was concerned, but I didn’t quit believing,” Farrier said. 
 
Sophomore Maci Crozier got the Big Reds going in the extra session, connecting on two foul shots. She then stretched it to a four-point game with a short jumper. Beaver responded with a bucket, but athletic sophomore Michaela Flaherty tallied going down the lane to begin to ice the game away. 
 
Crozier led the Big Reds with 18 points, while Flaherty came off the bench to tally 17. Sophomore Natalie Stoner added 17, including a trio of big 3-pointers during regulation. 
 
The Sisters Davis — Katrina and Cierra — finished with 12 and 11, respectively. 
 
Crozier had a big game on the glass, snagging 17 rebounds, which was a game high. Katrina Davis also had a double-double with 10 boards, while Flaherty came up a rebound shy of a double-double. 
 
Kierra Taylor led the Beavers with 17.
