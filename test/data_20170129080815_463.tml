<TEXT type="str">Rochester Community and Technical College&apos;s comeback fell just short in women&apos;s basketball on Saturday with a 76-74 loss to Anoka-Ramsey at the UCR Regional Sports Center.

Both teams entered the game ranked in the top 10 of the nation among Division III junior college teams. No. 9 Anoka-Ramsey led by 15 points in the second half before No. 8 RCTC (10-9, 3-2 Southern Division) rallied to tie the game and force overtime.

But A-R got to the line with just a half a second left in overtime and made two free throws to snap a 74-74 tie to collect the win.

&quot;The kids played hard the second half,&quot; RCTC coach Steve Hucke said.

&quot;It was a good effort,&quot; he added, &quot;we just missed too many bunnies down the stretch.&quot;

A big key was at the line where A-R outscored RCTC 18-8. RCTC made just 8 of 16 free throws.

Nautika Kotero paced RCTC with 19 points, seven rebounds and five assists. She was 4-for-5 at the line.

Reed Klunder scored 16 points for the Yellowjackets and was 4-for-8 from 3-point range. Nathalie Ratliff had 13 points, five assists and 5 steals. Victoria Asplund chipped in with nine points and had some key buckets down the stretch.

RCTC shot 37 percent from the field (29-for-78) and was 8-for-25 on 3-pointers. Both teams had 16 turnovers.

The Yellowjackts play at Minnesota West at 5:45 p.m. Wednesday.</TEXT>
