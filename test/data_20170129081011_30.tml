<TEXT type="str">Justin Wilson scored two power-play goals and Carson Bolduc’s empty-netter ended hopes of a late-game comeback for the Prince George Spruce Kings Saturday night in Salmon Arm. 
 
Despite a sparking 36-save performance from goalie Tavin Grant, the Kings fell 3-1 to the Silverbacks and in the process fell further behind the Langley Rivermen in the B.C. Hockey League standings. 
 
The teams were scoreless 15 minutes into the second period when Wilson cashed in a Silverbacks’ power-play chance with Kings defenceman Adam Burnett off for cross-checking. 
 
The Kings evened the count 17:59 into the second, an even-strength goal from captain Brett Mennear, his team-leading 22 nd of the season. But with 7:56 gone in the third period Wilson hooked up with Josh Latta for the gamewinner. 
 
Grant got to the bench with 70 seconds left but Bolduc, the former Prince George Cougar, ended the suspense at 19:17 with his 14 th goal of the season. 
 
The Silverbacks outshot the Kings 38-20. Nic Tallarico improved his record to 7-4-2-0 in goal for Salmon Arm. 
 
The Spruce Kings, who won 3-1 Friday inn Merritt, move on to Vernon, where they face the Vipers Sunday at 2 p.m. With 12 games left in the season, Prince George (20-21-3-2, fourth in the Mainland Division) is now 12 points behind the third-place Rivermen (25-15-5-2), who beat Coquitlam 5-1 Saturday in Langley.   
 
Also on Saturday, the Vipers scored three goals in the third period to defeat the visiting Nanaimo Clippers 3-0. That moved Vernon (25-15-4-4) within eight points of the Interior Division-leading Penticton Vees, who lost 6-3 in Trail.
