Recently I read an article about how the F-35 fighter jet is invaluable to the continuation of our military branches. In fact, our Navy leaders say the F-35 is “on a completely different level” from the F/A-18 Super Hornet. It is such a breath of fresh air to hear that from those in charge. Everyone in Arizona knows how hard our elected officials have worked to get the F-35 to Arizona, and with the new administration out to shake things up in the military, it&apos;s a relief that we can continue to count on Sen. McCain and other military leaders to keep the F-35 plugging along. We need it as a state and a country.
