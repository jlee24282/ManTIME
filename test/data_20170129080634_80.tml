  The first barrel was found at Bear Brook State Park in Allenstown in 1985 containing victim number 1, an unidentified woman age 23 to 33, and a female child age 5 to 11, who were related.(NH State Police)   Photos of Bob Evans and Denise Beaudin, pregnant with her daughter, Dawn, in Manchester, circa 1981.(Allenstown Police Department)   Photos of Bob Evans and Denise Beaudin, pregnant with her daughter, Dawn, in Manchester, circa 1981.(Allenstown Police Department) 
A killer's aliases The man who was Denise Beaudin's boyfriend when she disappeared in 1981 went by many different names in different places, authorities say: 
Robert T. Evans: New Hampshire,1977-1981 

Curtis Mayo Kimball: Los Alamitos and Cypress, Calif., 1984-1986 

Gordon Curtis Jenson: Santa Cruz County, Calif.,1986 

Gerald E. Mockerman: Franklin County, Idaho, and San Luis Obispo, Calif., 1987 

Lawrence William Vanner: Richmond, Calif., 2001-2002 

Evans died of natural causes in prison in California in 2010. 
 

Four victims, three of them little girls, thrown away like garbage, their bodies wrapped in plastic trash bags, bound with electrical wiring and stuffed in barrels. 

Four people with no one to mourn them. 

Last week, authorities moved closer to solving a mystery that had confounded them for decades. They now believe a man who killed a California woman in 2002 was responsible for the Allenstown murders - and the likely murder of Denise Beaudin, a 23-year-old Goffstown woman missing since 1981. 

Still, so many questions remain unanswered. 

 What happened to Denise? She left Manchester with her 6-month-old baby Dawn and a man calling himself Bob Evans - the man police now believe was a serial killer.  Where did Evans go between 1981 and 1984, when he showed up in California with Beaudin's daughter, calling her Lisa?  Where was Evans - aka Curtis Kimball, Gordon Jenson (or Jensen), Larry Vanner and Gerald Mockerman - between 1990, when he fled parole in California, and 2002, when he reappeared in the Golden State and went to prison for murdering his girlfriend?  Who - and where - is the mother of his child? The remains of a little girl, believed to be 2-to-4 years old, were found with those of a younger girl in a barrel in Allenstown in 2000. DNA testing proved Evans was her father. Officials fear her mother may be one of his victims too.  Who is the father of the other two children found in Allenstown?  How many victims are there - and where?  
Senior Assistant Attorney General Jeffery Strelzin last week said police usually start with a victim and look for the murderer. Here, police believe they have their man but the identity of his victims remains illusive. 
Authorities said they hope to learn more about Evans' whereabouts and activities during that 12-year gap between 1990 and 2002. They know he stole a car in Idaho in 1988, and have cited 11 other states and Quebec, Canada, as other places Evans may have been in the 1970s and 1980s. 

But Detective Sgt. Michael Kokoski of the New Hampshire State Police cold case unit said he's also concerned about where Evans was - and what he did - before he arrived in Manchester in the late 1970s. 

Evans would have been in his early to mid-30s back then, and Kokoski said those years are when killers are most likely to commit their crimes. "The bottom line is, with somebody who has potentially traveled this extensively, really nothing is off the table in terms of the possibilities of where he's been or what he's done." 

Kokoski said it's gratifying to have at least some answers in a case that has vexed officials for decades. But he said there's a lot of work yet to be done, to really solve the case. 

Carol Schweitzer of the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children said she's more optimistic than ever that the Allenstown victims will be identified, with the public's help. "It's just a matter of time," she said. 

No bit of information is too minor to report. "The smallest thing could really help blow this thing wide open." 

Someone out there knew this woman, these children, Schweitzer said. The girls had fathers; the adult woman had parents, other relatives. 

They must have gone to doctors, dentists, school. "I think there are people who remember her, that miss them," she said. "I think we just haven't found them yet. They haven't been able to connect this story to their circumstances and what could have happened to their missing loved ones." 

Kokoski said state police have received about two dozen tips since last Thursday's news conference. 

For those who have worked on the Allenstown case for years, justice means finding the identity of the victims. 

Shaun Mulholland is town manager in Allenstown; until 2013, he was the town's police chief. He said the inability to identify the woman and children whose bodies were disposed of in barrels has been an "immense frustration" all these years. 

"Finding out the identities of the victims is critical," Mulholland said. 

Schweitzer agreed. "You had an offender that killed four people, put them in barrels, put them in the woods, hoping that they were never going to be found," she said. "Well, they were. 

"They were found; they were not forgotten." 

And Kokoski vowed, "This case will not be closed until we know who these victims are and until we're confident we don't have any others out there."
