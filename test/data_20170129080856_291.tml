<TEXT type="str">Alescon Comets opener Keiron Joseph scored a century (106) on the opening day of the Premiership yesterday, when he notched 106 against Tableland United at Pierre Road in Charlieville. 
 
Comets, playing hosts to the South Eastern team, got off to a good start but they were pegged back by Al Small 3/29 and Bryan Pagus 3/59, as they fell for 284. Tableland would begin their reply next Saturday, when the match resumes at the same venue. 
 
At Santa Cruz, off-spinner Aneil Kanhai gave Merryboys the upper hand against PowerGen. The former national player grabbed 5/64 to bowl out PowerGen for 208. Jerron Maniram 37, Cephas Cooper 35 and Vikash Sookhai 33 all got starts but could not convert them into big scores. At the close, Merryboys were replying strongly on 135 for three after a hard hitting 57 from opener Mario Belcon and an unbeaten 24 from Isiah Rajah and 24 from Ranga Latchana. 
 
Down South, West Indies batsman Darren Bravo scored 55 as Queen’s Park finished the first day against Victoria United at Barrackpore on 286/6. Presented with a heavy outfield, the Queen’s Park batsmen could not get real value for shots. Left-handed opener Jeremy Solozano was the top scorer with 79 and when play resumes next Saturday, Marlon Barclay with continue on 37 and Tion Webster 45. 
 
Across at Wilson Road, wickets were the order of the day, as the home team Clarke Road United was skittled for 127. Kerry Holness 42 and Jyd Goolie 22 showed some resistance but Kissoondath Magram 3/13 and Stephen Shaddick 3/26 were almost unplayable. Central Sports in reply was bowled out for 159, with Navin Stewart slamming 40 and Jahron Alfred 32. Pacer Ray Jordan troubled the Central outfit and finished with 5/32. Batting a second time Clarke Road reached six without loss. 
 
Today, the teams will shift focus to the Sunday League 50 overs tournament. Merryboys will play PowerGen, Queen’s Park battle Victoria, Central Sports face Clarke Road and Comets challenge Tableland.
