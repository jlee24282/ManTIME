Rainwater Harvesting is a simple technique of catching and holding rainwater where its falls. Either, we can store it in tanks or we can use it to recharge groundwater depending upon the situation.  3. Why • To conserve &amp; augment the storage of ground water • To reduce water table depletion • To improve the quality of ground water • To arrest sea water intrusion in coastal areas • To avoid flood &amp; water stagnation in urban areas  4. How? The concept is simple  Collect  Store and use  Recharge  5. There are two main techniques of rain water harvestings. • Storage of rainwater on surface for future use. • Recharge to ground water.  6. Rainwater harvesting today Collection (Catchment) Flat / sloping roofs Leaf and grit filter, First flush device Transportation: Downtake pipes Storage in tanks Recharge into open wells / borewells / percolation pits / trenches  7. Rain Water in India • Total annual rainfall in India: 400 million hectare-meters (area x height) • The Highest Average rainfall in India is at GOA which measures 3005mm per annum. • The Lowest Average rainfall in India is at WEST -RAJASTHAN which measures 313mm per annum.  8. Components of Rainwater Harvesting System: 1. Catchments area/roof 2. Gutters and downspouts 3. Leaf screens and roof washers 4. Storage tanks 5. Conveying 6. Water treatment  9. 1. Catchments area/roof: The surface upon which the rain falls; the roof has to be appropriately sloped preferably towards the direction of storage and recharge. 2. Gutters and downspouts: The transport channels from catchments surface to storage; these have to be designed depending on site, rainfall characteristics and roof characteristics.  10. 3. Leaf screens and roof washers: The systems that remove contaminants and debris; a first rain separator has to be put in place to divert and manage the first 2.5 mm of rain. 4. Storage tanks: Sumps, tanks etc. where collected rain-water is safely stored or recharging the ground water through open wells, bore wells or percolation pits etc.  11. 5. Conveying: The delivery system for the treated rainwater, either by gravity or pump; 6. Water treatment: Filters to remove solids and organic material and equipment, and additives to settle, filter, and disinfect  12. Materials for Rainwater Tanks  Plastic  Plastic Liner  Polyethylene  Metal  13. Screening Methods Location Results Strainers and Leaf Screens Gutters and Leaders Prevent leaves and other debris from Settling Sedimentation Within Tank Settles particulate matter Tank Treatment Techniques  14. Rainwater Harvesting was done compulsory in the Indian states of Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh and Tamil Nadu etc.  15. Rainwater Harvesting System at SIEL Chemical Complex  16.
