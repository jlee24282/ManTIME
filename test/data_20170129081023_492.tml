Stay on topic - This helps keep the thread focused on the discussion at hand. If you would like to discuss another topic, look for a relevant article. 
 
Share with Us - We&apos;d love to hear eyewitness accounts, the history behind an article, and smart, constructive criticism. 
 
Be Civil - It&apos;s OK to have a difference in opinion but there&apos;s no need to be a jerk. We reserve the right to delete any comments that we feel are spammy, off-topic, or reckless to the community. 
 
Be proactive - Use the &apos;Flag as Inappropriate&apos; link at the upper right corner of each comment to let us know of abusive posts.
