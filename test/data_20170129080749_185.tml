<content type="str">The world just didn&apos;t know how much was still ahead of them. 
 
In an enthralling contest, Federer won the opening two sets before Wawrinka clawed back to take the semi-final into a fifth , only for Federer to prevail with a service break in the sixth game. 
 
Once they were the Magic and Bird of men&apos;s tennis, but then had to think that rivalry was gone for good, in this time when the last time either one of them won a Grand Slam final was when Rafa won the French in 2014. 
 
Nadal had just thrashed Federer for the loss of just four games in the French Open final and now he would beat the Swiss in his own citadel at Wimbledon. 
 
When he and Federer met in late autumn to dedicate Nadal&apos;s new tennis academy on Mallorca, neither was fit enough to play even a light exhibition. 
 
Mirza and Ivan Dodig reached the final after ending the hopes of local pair Sam Groth and Samantha Stosur 6-4, 2-6, 10-5 in Friday&apos;s semifinals on Rod Laver Arena. 
 
&quot;That&apos;s kind of the things I meant with it&quot;. This may be the old line about how if you didn&apos;t know how old you were, how old would you think you were? 
 
Venus Williams, 36, and her sister Serena, 35, will fight it out for the women&apos;s title on Saturday, in an exact replica of the finals bill at Wimbledon nine years ago. 
 
It&apos;s hard to regard him and Nadal as underdogs, given all they&apos;ve achieved in the game, but that&apos;s what they are now. But here is Federer with his own chance at 18, continuing a career of awesome grace, once again playing as handsome a game of tennis as any man or woman has ever played. 
 
After the fourth set, Federer took a cue from his countryman and did something odd for a guy who notoriously speeds matches along: He took a medical timeout to treat an adductor muscle injury in his leg. Tape around the knee. Back he comes, on the court and into the match . But the facilities are one thing, quality is another. the work must be better and more efficient. Federer, for his part, turned a little more tentative, only making six net approaches in the third set and five in the fourth . 
 
&quot;I just think he&apos;s an incredible tennis player&quot;, Federer said. 
 
Whoever wins, the match is sure to be memorable. 
 
&quot;We have not been there in that situation for a while, so that makes the match different&quot;. 
 
&quot;Jimmy has what we all want. But I understand the magnitude of the match against Nadal, no doubt about it&quot;. While Serena has won five Grand Slams in the past four years, her older sibling, with whom she shares a home in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, last advanced to a final in 2009, when she was 29. Nadal his 15th. Federer already has the mark for the most in history. 
 
Nadal could not convert his first two match points, having no answer to Dimitrov forehands, but it was third time lucky for the Spaniard, an errant backhand from his opponent ending a match that ebbed and flowed in all the right places. [It] is exciting for me and for both of us that we [are] still there and we [are] still fighting for important events. 
 
&quot;I worked a lot during this month and a half at home and I never ever dreamed to be back in a final of the Australian Open, in the second tournament of the year after a lot of months without competing, but here I am and I feel lucky and very happy&quot;. They have 29 majors between them. In short, Federer has handled Nadal&apos;s serve far poorer than he used to in his pomp. As John McEnroe once said, you can not be serious. 
 
Ganguly, however, remained confident about Federer&apos;s chances of lifting his fifth Australian Open title, while adding that age was just a number. 
 
The &quot;big four&quot; had quickly become the &quot;big two&quot;, as Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic separated themselves from the pack.</content>
