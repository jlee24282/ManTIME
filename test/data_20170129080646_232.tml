<content type="str">The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said in a statement late on Saturday it would &quot;comply with judicial orders&quot; but that President Donald Trump&apos;s executive action restricting entry into the country from seven Muslim-majority nations remains in place. 
 
The statement was issued hours after a federal judge in New York blocked the deportation of dozens of travelers and refugees from those countries who were stranded at U.S. airports. 
 
&quot;These individuals went through enhanced security screenings and are being processed for entry to the United States, consistent with our immigration laws and judicial orders,&quot; the Homeland Security statement said.
