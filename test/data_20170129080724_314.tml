MONROE, LA - COURTESY ULM SPORTS INFORMATION 

The ULM menâ€™s basketball team could not overcome a second half onslaught from beyond the arc from visiting Arkansas State in route to the Warhawks&apos; eighth straight Sun Belt Conference loss, 73-63 on Saturday afternoon. 

After taking a one-point lead into halftime, the Warhawks could not hold back Arkansas State and its red hot shooting from deep in the second half. The Red Wolves went 8-of-14 from three-point range in the second half to help them to the road victory. 

Senior guard Nick Coppola led the Warhawks with 19 points on 6-of-12 shooting. Coppola also matched a career-high with five three pointers made. He previously knocked down five three pointers back on February 21, 2015, also against Arkansas State.</TEXT>
