<TEXT type="str">Trump signs executive orders 
 
New York&apos;s top elected office holders last night welcomed a stay by a federal judge that blocked some deportations based on President Donald Trump&apos;s so-called Muslim ban executive order. 
 
The U.S. District Court Judge Ann Donnelly, ruled in favor of a petition filed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) who are representing two Iraqi men detained Friday at John F. Kennedy International Airport on Friday. 
 
Judge Donnelly ruled that &quot;there is imminent danger that, absent the stay of removal, there will be substantial and irreparable injury to refugees, visa-holders, and other individuals from nations subject...&quot; 
 
Trump&apos;s executive order blocks Syrian refugees as well as resettlement of all refugees for four months until his new administration enacts a new &quot;vetting&quot; scheme. Entry is also denied for three months to people from Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Iraq, Iran,  Libya and Yemen. 
 
&quot;I applaud the stay ordered by Judge Donnelly of the Eastern District of New York regarding President Trump&apos;s dangerous and discriminatory executive action,&quot; said Eric T. Schneiderman, the New York State attorney general. &quot;Let me be clear: President Trump&apos;s executive action is unconstitutional and in clear violation of federal law, including both the Establishment Clause and the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965. I will do everything within my power to help lead the fight to permanently strike it down. 
 
&quot;I will not allow voiceless refugees, and all those targeted by this reckless action, to be victimized by an unlawful, unconstitutional, and fundamentally un-American decree from the President.&quot; 
 
“Score one for the resistance. Tonight’s ruling is an important step towards victory for civil rights, for justice, and for the democratic principles our country was founded on,&quot; said Letitia James, the New York City public advodate. &quot;Let this be a strong message to President Trump. We will fight against any policy that is founded on hate and exclusion and the law is on our side. We will never give in, we will never give up, and we will fight xenophobia and discrimination with justice.&quot; 
 
The New York City Comptroller Scott M. Stringer said: &quot;This Executive Order, signed by President Trump just a week into office, will forever be a stain on this White House. From the beginning of its tenure, this administration has placed itself on the wrong side of history. 
 
&quot;This ruling is a victory for not just the rule of law, or for checks and balances in government. It&apos;s a win for morality. It&apos;s a step in the right direction for those trying to become Americans. 
 
&quot;This should be the beginning — not the end — of our fight against this backwards Executive Order. We must continue to fight for American values, and stand up for those who need us most.&quot;</TEXT>
