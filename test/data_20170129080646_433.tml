DENVER  UFC President Dana White issued a warning to Conor McGregor while also dismissing the lightweight champions outburst on social media. 
 
After McGregor said his next fight would be in a boxing ring against retired champ Floyd Mayweather, White indicatedhe wouldnt abide the demand. 
 
Ive always shown Conor nothing but respect, and if he wants to go down that road with us, let me tell you, it will be an epic fall, White told MMAjunkie at the post-event press conference for UFC on FOX 23 at Pepsi Center in Denver. 
 
Asked whether he thought McGregor would travel that road, he said, I dont know. Its not up to me. 
 
A few hours earlier, McGregor (21-3 MMA, 9-1 UFC) issued perhaps his biggest swipe at the UFC, boasting hed outdrawn the promotion after counter-programming the FOX-televised event with a sit-down interview streamed via online pay-per-view. 
 
On Instagram, he wrote, Im so made! Heading to do a Q and A in front of 5000 fans! You read that right. Thats more than UFC attendance tonight. (Expletive) the UFC. (Expletive) Floyd. (Expletive) boxing. (Expletive) the WWE. (Expletive) Hollywood. And (expletive) you too pay me. 
   
Although he admitted he hadnt heard all of McGregors words, Whites pointed response was the most serious counter to the lightweight champs brash form of self-promotion, which has frequently targeted the UFC as hes grown into one of its biggest stars. The executive didnt entirely take the bait, however, linking McGregors statement to efforts to push an online product. 
 
I didnt hear all that, White said. Hey, listen, when youre about to do a pay-per-view that youre charging people five bucks to listen to you talk, Im sure youve got to say some pretty crazy (expletive). 
 
As the crazy idea of ever seeing Mayweather and McGregor in a ring, White shot that down, too. 
 
Heres what I think the chances are: About the same as me being the backup quarterback for (Tom) Brady on (Super Bowl) Sunday, he said. 
 
White previously made headlines when he offered Mayweather and McGregor $25 million each and a cut of pay-per-view profits to step into the squared circle. Mayweather dismissed the offer outright. 
 
Since that exchange, White said thered been no talks with the Mayweather camp and added his offer didnt signal a renewed interest in the bout. 
 
(I made an offer) because (Mayweather) was full of (expletive), White said. He said he had made an offer, which wasnt true. So I made a real offer. 
 
Is there a chance, though, all the talk is just a prelude to a blockbuster? 
 
Ill be suiting up Sunday, White deadpanned.
