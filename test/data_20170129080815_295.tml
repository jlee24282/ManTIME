<content type="str">Owing to its humungous worldwide reception, &apos;Raees&apos; is all set to celebrate the love and appreciation that has come its way from the audiences for the film.

To celebrate the occasion, the whole team, along with Shah Rukh Khan, is to call in the success on January 30 in Mumbai. While celebrations are often kick started in high spirits, they are taking a different route by letting their hair down minus alcohol.

Producer Ritesh Sidhwani said, &quot;The entire team is very happy with the critical acclaim and audience&apos;s reaction to the film. It has been a perfect combination. It seems that all efforts have come to fruition and hence we want to celebrate this occasion with everyone who has been a part of this journey. &quot;

It is ironic that the film, which is set against the backdrop of liquor prohibition, will have its success celebrations without alcohol.
