<TEXT type="str">If I had to sum up M. Night Shyamalan’s “Split” in one sentence, I would say it has personality. Lots of personality. 
 
The psychological thriller is about Casey, Claire and Marcia (Anya Taylor-Joy, Haley Lu Richardson and Jessica Sula), three high school girls who are kidnapped. Their assailant is Kevin Crumb, a man with dissociative identity disorder, resulting in 23 separate identities in one body. 
 
James McAvoy, who plays Kevin — and Dennis, Patricia and the rest of Kevin’s “alters” — shows off his extensive acting abilities as he plays multiple characters mostly through voice and body language alone. The switches in demeanor are almost reminiscent of a theater-character exercise, they are so quickly and drastically portrayed. 
 
The dissociative personality disorder isn’t the twist of “Split,” though; revealed from the start, it is not one of the many surprises that await. 
 
Kevin’s therapist Dr. Fletcher (Betty Buckley) sprinkles exposition by the handful throughout the movie, but also provides another layer of character that the film sorely needed. Out of the three kidnapped girls. Casey is the most fleshed out, her backstory being revealed through tasteful flashbacks.

For the first half of the movie, tension was evenly balanced, the creeping confusion of the unknown perfectly interspersed with laughable moments. The second half was where it fell flat. “Split” felt choppy and hurriedly borrowed from common horror movies. 
 
The movie is rated PG-13, yet presented its main actresses unnecessarily half-dressed for a good portion of the feature. I had high hopes for great character development, but whether it was too tight of a script or just bad writing, there was simply no room for growth. 
 
Yet the near absence of gore was a refreshing breath of air in the otherwise blood-soaked horror industry. An appropriately balanced score added to the atmosphere of “Split,” and good cinematography brought the tone of the movie to a suspenseful simmer. 
 
Overall, I would say that “Split” is a film best for watching at home with friends and cheap pizza. The movie wasn’t bad by any means, but as I watched the end credits roll, I felt unsatisfied. 
 
The only explanation I can think of is that the hype surrounding “Split” was just too great, and I had mistakenly expected more from the film.
