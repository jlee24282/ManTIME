<content type="str">Living pop legend Eddie Money did more than just take fans home Saturday night -- he brought spectators back to the &apos;80s (and even the &apos;70s for a cool four minutes) during his 25 minute-long set fueled by nostalgia and collection of greatest hits. 
 
In his signature black suit, Money made a grand entrance by ripping the sunglasses off his face and launching his set with &quot; Baby Hold On ,&quot; which he adorned with casual dance moves as he traveled the stage. Money -- accompanied by his daughter Jesse who provided the backup vocals -- kept the party going with a high-energy performance of classic hits including &quot; Walk On Water ,&quot; Think I&apos;m In Love ,&quot; and &quot; Shakin&apos; &quot; before inspiring a sing along to his massive single &quot; Take Me Home Tonight &quot; from his album Can&apos;t Hold Back .

For his final performance, Money took his blazer off and brought things way back into time with the &apos;70s single, &quot; Two Tickets To Paradise ,&quot; from his self-titled album. 
 
Money released his last studio set Wanna Go Back in 2007, a 12-track collection featuring his cover versions of popular songs from the 1960s including Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell &apos;s &quot;Ain&apos;t No Mountain High,&quot; Jackie Wilson &apos;s &quot;(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and Higher,&quot; The Foundations &apos; &quot;Build Me Up Buttercup,&quot; and many more.  
 
The iHeart80s Party, held at the SAP Center in San Jose, California, also saw performances by by New Kids On The Block ,  UB40 , Men at Work&apos;s  Colin Hay ,  Starship ,  Night Ranger , and headliner  Rick Astley .
