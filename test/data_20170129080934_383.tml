<TEXT type="str">As full-featured laptops keep getting slimmer and lighter, their chargers typically remain bulky galumphs that heavily hog space wherever we roam with them. But the people at FINsix Electronics have liberated the masses from the massive (chargers) with the diminutive new Dart Laptop Charger. Compatible with most PC laptops and notebooks, thanks to the nine included interchangeable power port tips that connect to the detachable six-foot cable, the charger is a mere 2.75 inches long by 1.5-inches wide and 1-inch thick. Using something called high-frequency switching technology, the developers managed to shrink the innards of the typical mid-cable brick while retaining the standard 65-watt output power. While they were at it, they added an in-line 5-volt, 2.1-amp USB port, so you can charge your cellphone or other device while powering up your laptop. The charger also has a two-prong plug, (no more need for a three-prong outlet). And the Dart&apos;s versatile 100-240VAC input means you won&apos;t need a voltage converter anywhere in the world (just the right-shape plug adapter). The Dart doesn&apos;t work with those cutting-edge USB type-C laptops (such as the new MacBooks, Chromebooks, and similar tech-forward models). But FINsix is about to roll out the Dart-C so you, too, can take a load off. (Whatever laptop you&apos;re toting, be sure to check the company website compatibility guide to make sure your model isn&apos;t among the unfortunate 5 percent that just can&apos;t get along with a Dart.) 

FINsix Dart Laptop Charger in blue, magenta, gunmetal, orange, or silver is $99.99; Dart-C, available soon, will also cost $99.99; optional USB type-C cable for standard Dart charger will be $34.99; at www.finsix.com .</TEXT>
