<content type="str">India Under-19 cricket team trainer Rajesh Sawant was found dead in his hotel room in Mumbai on Sunday morning, a day ahead of India Under-19’s first ODI against England. 
 
“What I have gathered so far is he did not report for team activities in the morning, so people started looking for him and eventually he was found to have been passed away in his room,” Amitabh Choudhary, BCCI joint secretary, told The Hindu . 
 
“I have asked Prof. Shetty (Ratnakar Shetty, general manager – game development) to visit the site and keep me updated,” he added. 
 
Mr. Sawant was considered to be one of the most professional trainers in domestic cricket. Besides working with age-group teams at the National Cricket Academy, Bengaluru, he has also served as Afghanistan team trainer. 
 
Earlier this month, he had worked with India A team for the two warm-up ties against England and with the Rest of India squad for the Irani Cup tie against Ranji Trophy champions Gujarat.</content>
