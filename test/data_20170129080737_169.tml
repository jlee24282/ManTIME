<TITLE>2017 Top 100 prospects go on Twitter</TITLE>
<TEXT>Baseball fans were treated to a glimpse of the future Saturday as MLBPipeline.com unveiled its Top 100 Prospects list for 2017 during a live show on MLB Network. 

The list features a collection of rising stars among the Minor League ranks, many knocking at the door to becoming regulars in the big leagues. 

Throughout the night, several of the players on the list flexed their social media skills by live tweeting the show, using the hashtag Top100Prospects. 

It offered insight into the prospects' personalities as they engaged with fans and each other. 

Many, like No. 3 prospect Gleyber Torres, expressed their pride at making the list. 

Great night too many promises on the way, proud to represent my country Venezuela 55356;56827;55356;56810; in this list and my Team!! Top100Prospects https://t.co/CRlr3Fgtad

As the names were announced, it became clear there's plenty of mutual admiration among the game's top prospects. Most of the tweets sent Saturday evening featured praise from one prospect to another. 

The Rays' Willy Adames (No. 21) expressed envy for No. 31 Brett Honeywell, while the Brewers' Corey Ray (No. 30) touted a player further down the list in Zack Collins, who clocked in at No. 81 for the White Sox. 

Tyler O';Neil oh god 55357;56490;55356;57340;55357;56613; I like that guy Top100Prospects 2Strongtho

My boy @zackcollins0 slots in at 81, one of the most disciplined hitters I';ve ever played against Top100Prospects

The Marlins' Braxton Garrett, No. 43, voiced his desire to match up against the college game's most elite hitters, like Ray and Kyle Lewis (No. 29), a wish that may someday be granted if these talented prospects can break through to the Majors. 

I';ve always wanted to face top college bats like Kyle Lewis and Corey Ray Top100Prospects

The No. 6 prospect, Alex Reyes, also received some love from his peers, including fellow Cardinals Minor Leaguer and battery mate Carson Kelly, who made the list at No. 39. 

Love having the best view in the house when @AlexReyes_67 pitches. Stuff is electric Top100Prospects 

- Carson Kelly (@carskelly) January 29, 2017 

In many cases, the prospects got into some competitive, yet playful, banter with one another. Yankees prospect Blake Rutherford -- rated No. 37 -- nudged Garrett for a particularly nasty 3-2 curveball, vowing revenge: "3-2 curveball was so mean @BraxGarrett.... I am gonna get you next time though hahaha." 

55357;56834; you';re crazy to think I';d give you a FB... looking forward to it brotha!!!! Top100Prospects https://t.co/Xk5eIO0We3 

- Braxton Garrett (@BraxGarrett) January 29, 2017 

To which Garrett responded, "you're crazy to think I'd give you a [fastball]... looking forward to it brotha!!!" 

Garrett also got into it with last year's top Draft selection Mickey Moniak (No. 19) for a hit that still may be a sore subject: "Won't ever forgive you for the ripped single off me on national television @MickeyMoniak still love you tho hitmachine." Moniak took the opportunity to remind Garrett it wasn't only a "ripped single". 

"Don't forget the stolen bases," he tweeted. "Love you bruh." 

Don';t forget the stolen bases 55357;56841; love you bruh Top100Prospects https://t.co/Ug3htjoSaH

Afghanistan's Defense Ministry says it wants to raise the number of women serving in the Afghan National Army to a level where women comprise 10 percent of the force. 

Defense Ministry spokesman Mohammad Radmanesh said on January 27 that the government had set several measures, including a special salary scale for female recruits, to encourage more women to join up. 

'At this stage, we have 1,575 Afghan women in our army ranks, it is a mere 3 to 4 percent -- which is nothing,' Radmanesh said. 'We are aiming to raise this percentage to 10 percent.' 

Radmanesh said there currently were about 400 Afghan women recruits training at Defense Ministry facilities. 

Women serving in the military is a controversial topic in conservative Afghanistan.
