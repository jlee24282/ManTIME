The 19-year-old model, who is the eldest daughter of Real Housewives of Atlanta alum Kim Zolciak , shared a Snapchat video as she watched an episode of The Real , where the talk show&apos;s cohosts questioned Biermann&apos;s curvaceous derri√®re and asked the audience if they&apos;d let their teen daughters go under the knife.

&quot;I&apos;m almost 20!!!&quot; Biermann captioned the clip, in which she can be heard crying out in frustration. &quot;Even if I wanted plastic surgery I could go get it done MYSELF w OUT my moms permission! This ass is all real.&quot;

The Real cohosts&apos; segment came nearly a week after the teenager showed off her backside in a black high-cut swimsuit on Snapchat. The posts almost immediately caused a stir online as fans began to wonder if Biermann had surgery, prompting Zolciak, 44, to come to her daughter&apos;s defense.

The Bravo star told TMZ on Monday, January 23, that &quot;there isn&apos;t an ounce of fat&quot; on Biermann&apos;s body &quot;to use for butt implants.&quot; She also noted that Biermann works out at the gym a lot, hence her fit rear.

Zolciak also showed support for her daughter last year after Biermann publicly admitted that she got lip injections . &quot;She bothered me for five years about her lips,&quot; Zolciak exclusively told Us Weekly in May 2016. &quot;She was like, &apos;I hate my lips, I hate my lips.&apos; So I&apos;m like, then go fix them! You only go around this planet once. If it makes her happy, so be it.&quot;
