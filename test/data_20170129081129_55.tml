<TEXT type="str">LISBON — A 48-year-old Kensington man’s meth-related drug offenses landed him in prison for two years on Friday.

Daryl W. Kibler, 48, Mardis Road, was in Columbiana County Common Pleas Court for sentencing after pleading guilty in November to illegal assembly or possession of chemicals for the manufacture of drugs, possession of drugs and trafficking in drugs.

Judge Scott Washam recounted the two previous drug possession cases regarding Kibler in 1998 and in 2006.

“In reviewing your (file), it struck me we all make mistakes,” 

In both cases, Kibler did not serve prison time, according to Washam. However, by 2015 Kibler’s charges were not just for possessing drugs, but related to selling drugs.

“You said, ‘I’m all out of cocaine, but I can sell you some meth,’” 

Less than a week later, Kibler was found to have meth in a metal cylinder in his driveway and a laboratory for producing meth.

Kibler’s defense attorney Derek Lowry said at the time of these crimes Kibler was addicted to meth himself. Since the charges, Lowry said Kibler has managed to find a way to stay off of drugs and secure steady employment as a supervisor for a flooring company. Lowry suggested Kibler has found a way to rehabilitate himself and become a productive member of society once again.

As part of the plea agreement, Chief Assistant County Prosecutor John Gamble said he had agreed not to make any recommendations for sentencing in the case. Likewise Kibler chose not to make any statements prior to sentencing.

Washam pointed out that methamphetamines is “a poison”
