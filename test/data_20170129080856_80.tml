<content type="str">New Delhi [India], Jan. 29 (ANI): Welcoming U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s ban on Muslim immigrants and refugees, the Janata Dal (United) on said that building up barriers could help in countering terrorism, while asserting that Pakistan is the epicentre of terrorism and the decision can successfully put pressure on Islamabad. 

&quot;I think this building up of barriers may have an impact on terrorism and act as pressure point on these countries. It can also shrink the globe in somewhat good manner,&quot; JD (U) leader Pawan Varma told ANI, adding the United States is the only country that can influence Pakistan to severe its nexus to the support and nurturing of terrorism. 

Meanwhile, the Congress Party disapproved Trump&apos;s ban, saying scrutiny should take place if there is any doubt on somebody. 

Congress leader Shakeel Ahmed said: &quot;But stating that all citizens of a country are dangerous it is not right. It is an international issue and the foreign delegation should look into it.&quot; 

Trump yesterday signed an executive order to suspend refugee arrivals and impose tough new controls on travellers from seven Muslim countries. 

Fulfilling a 2016 campaign promises, Trump suspended the entire U.S. refugee resettlement programme for at least 120 days while tough new vetting rules are established. 

He said that the executive order is aimed at ensuring the security and welfare of the United States. 

It has also been announced that no visas will be issued for 90 days to migrants or visitors from seven Muslim dominant countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. 

However, exceptions will be made for &quot;religious minorities&quot;, which would imply favourable treatment for Christians. (ANI)</content>
