<TITLE>Harriet Harman: I dont want to be not-liked. Its just that nobody did for nearly 20 years</TITLE>
<TEXT>The Labour MP has endured an a lot of abuse in almost 35 years in parliament. As she publishes her memoirs, the staunch loyalist explains why shell keep fighting I always totally denounced people who wrote their memoirs, says Harriet Harman, who has just written her memoir. There is a copy of A Womans Work in front of us. A hardback whopper of nearly 400 pages with all kinds of enticing entries in the index: Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers, 18; Association of Metropolitan Authorities, 106; Mothers in Manufacturing Report, 219, 235. One thing I learn about Harriet Harman: shes not one to shy away from the boring detail.

During her time on the frontbench, she says, people would sit in cabinet meetings and literally be writing their diaries in front of her. "And I used to think, Weve got a country to run! I was very moral high ground about it, all the time denouncing them as male vanity projects."

So, this is what? A female vanity project?

"Yes!" she says. "Its a self-consciously female vanity project. When all my colleagues autobiographies came out, the first thing you do is to look at the photos and it would all be men. Maybe thered be their wife and someone who worked for them. And possibly Hillary Clinton and thats it. And its like, where were the 100 women who swept into parliament? Where was the transformation reflected in our politics and the change in womens lives? You remember Sheila Rowbothams Hidden from History? Her thing about unless its written about, its invisible and then it hasnt happened?

"Well, funnily enough, even though I was in the cabinet at the time, I dont seem to be in these memoirs either. You might find one reference, Harman, sacking of. And I thought, Well, stuff that. So I found it very easy to do my U-turn." Oh, its raining men in the Labour party From someone else, this would be hypocritical self-aggrandisement. But this is Harriet Harman, AKA Harriet Harperson. Her conversation is littered with references to "the cause", "the struggle", "the mission"  her whole adult life, and her entire career at Westminster, has been in single-minded pursuit of equal rights. And its fair to say that A Womans Work is in some ways more about the changing political representation of women than it is about her. Its just that she defines and embodies that change.

Were in the kitchen of her house in her south London constituency, a warm, comfortable, family home with various piles of clutter and a prowling cat, the kind of fantasy dwelling that would make a millennials heart bleed, and shes telling me how they bought it in 1987 when the area "was all social workers and FE lecturers". And now? "Now its bankers and corporate lawyers."

When Harman first became an MP, at a byelection in 1982, London was a Tory stronghold, a family home was an achievable goal and she was one of only 11 women Labour MPs. And the only one who was pregnant. She was a completely new sight in British politics: a young, pregnant, feminist MP. The photos in the book show her campaigning with a babe in arms and then a toddler and they culminate in the still-record-breaking sight of the 101 Labour women elected during the 1997 landslide: Blairs Babes. Though shes still cross about that. The photo. Tutting when I bring it up.

Because there they all are, "Folletted" up in jackets all the colours of the rainbow, the prescribed style decreed by the Labour partys fashion arbiter, the then member for Stevenage, Barbara Follett, massed around a grinning Tony Blair. "It was supposed to be the sisterhood!" says Harman. "It was supposed to be us, the women, doing it for ourselves. Not as the backing group for the great leader." Even more galling was the fact that it had been her idea. Shed arranged it all, when suddenly at the last minute someone added Blair to the line-up. "It was a complete failure to understand that this was a moment for women." On the other hand, she says, at least people remember it. Though she backtracks almost immediately. "Though I think they would anyway." On the campaign trail in 1982, when she entered parliament. Photograph: Rex And a lot of it, of them, was down to her. Campaigning and networking and inspiring and ultimately helping to get the highly unpopular but effective all-women shortlists through, a struggle, documented at length, in the book. Alan Clarkes Diaries this is not, though she does recall how, as Robin Cooks deputy on the shadow frontbench, she had promised to take her son to the Bromley Odeon and, despite frantic calls to deliver a response to striking ambulance workers, she took him to the Bromley Odeon. Cook was furious. And since she couldnt think of an excuse, she simply told him: "I was not available." Cook responded with "conspiratorial glee", she says. He assumed she was having an affair.

But then, having an affair was a valid excuse to go missing in action in Westminster. Having children was not. And Harman had three "badly timed babies". Pregnant in her first byelection, campaigning for her first general election with a four-month-old baby, pregnant for the second time when she joined the frontbench, and with another four-month-old baby at the time of her second general election in 1987.

She didnt have time to write a diary, she says, "but because I was so on the defensive all the time, because I thought that people were thinking, Pregnant, baby, pregnant, baby, pregnant, baby, shes not going to be doing her job properly. I had to prove myself all the time."

And she fishes out childrens scrapbooks filled with her old cuttings and a file of reports she gave to her local party. "Look at this one," she says. "You see. I report Ive had a baby but then Im immediately on to politics. Theyve axed the physio in the maternity ward! And I wrote that report on the 7th of December."

When did you have the baby?

"November 20th. I just never thought I could be a normal MP. I always had to prove myself."

"Shes always been fantastically dogged in pursuit of what she went into politics to achieve," one political editor tells me. "Its just always been about the cause of women. And asserting herself as a woman in politics. I remember when she first starting stepping in at PMQs. On the one hand, she was leaden and heavy handed, but on the other, she was so relentless and unembarrassed that you came out just thinking, Good for her.

"She has been an extraordinary phenomenon in British politics. Just this totally driven political animal. Always nice. Always pleasant. Impeccably turned out. Incredibly professional. Fantastically loyal to the Labour party. But there are not many jokes or signs of life outside politics. It has always been about women and womens interests."

And yet it was a Tory who became Britains second female prime minister. How did you feel about that? And she grimaces. Its a subject that is still raw. "Its bad enough that the first one was. Imagine what that was like, if youre a feminist and in the womens movement, fighting against the Tories uphill and the first woman prime minister is a flipping Tory. It was torture."

And now theyve gone and done it again. While the Labour party "Oh, its raining men in the Labour party." Its pretty bad that the Tories have got a strong, competent woman in charge... "Its terrible. Its bad. And this is the second time. But then theres a lot of things now, which are painful echoes of those years. It was bad enough first time around, but second time " It strikes me that in some way youre the Labour equivalent of Theresa May, I say. "You mean Theresa May is the Tory equivalent of me?" she says. And then shudders. "I hope not!" Youre both senior, opinionated women, I point out, who dont care about being liked

"Please dont compare me to her. And I have no idea whether Theresa May wants to be liked. I dont want to be not-liked. Its just that nobody did for nearly 20 years. It was horrible and lonely and painful and I did it despite not being liked. I very nearly opted to leave. Its very difficult to be with people when they are meant to be your colleagues and they are being actively hostile.

"What kept me there was the womens movement. I was liked by them. I was one of them. We all liked each other. Theresa May and I are both female politicians but thats all."

It comes out in a heartfelt rush, this. Because, its true, for a long time, Harman wasnt liked. Not by male-dominated Westminster and not by the male-dominated Westminster press. She was a humourless feminazi before the term was even invented. Harriet Harperson. Harridan Harman. In a column that is vile and misogynistic even by his own standards, Rod Liddle once wondered whether you "would do" Harriet Harman, if drunk enough, and decided on balance that you wouldnt. With husband Jack Dromey, now also an MP, in 1982. Photograph: PA It took 30 years of frontline politics before she gained even grudging acceptance. When she stepped down as deputy leader, the Daily Telegraph ran a leader with the headline: "Hats off to Harriet Harman  like or loathe her  shes tough as old boots" and noted that she endured more abuse than any other modern Labour politician bar Tony Blair.

Harmans father was a doctor and her mother had trained as a lawyer  one of the first to graduate in the subject from Oxford  though she never practised. Harman says she and her three highly competitive sisters were brought up with "mixed messages"  the expectation that they would be educated, independent, accomplished in their own right and marry well. The aim, she says, was "to be intelligent but not too clever".

It was partly due to her background, suggests Yvonne Roberts, the Observers former leader writer and a fellow member of the womens movement of that era, that she was enabled to rise above the resistance and hostility she encountered. Her parents sent her to St Pauls, the London public school that Harman describes as "stiflingly elitist". Roberts describes her as "supportive and warm-hearted and quite posh. I think her background helped. I dont think anyone else but her could have carved their way through in the way she did. She was surprised if anyone challenged her. She had that same sense of entitlement that upper-class men have: Why shouldnt I be doing this?

"I think its quite hard to knock her confidence. Though there have been times. But in her generation, our generation, its kind of what you expected. You had to be ready for it. No one thought it was going to be an easy ride." At the University of York, her tutor suggested shed get a 2.1 if she slept with him, a 2.2 if she didnt. A few pages later, she writes about how the partner of the law firm where she was an articled clerk groped her. And she names them both. Are they dead? I ask her. Is that a bit problematic accusing people no longer around to defend themselves? She shrugs. "They shouldnt have done what they did."

It was a burgeoning sense of injustice that led her to volunteer after work at the Fulham Legal Advice Centre, which, she says, is where she found her calling and became involved in the spectrum of 1970s radical causes: leftwing politics, the womens movement and consciousness-raising groups. Though there was too much talk about sex and not enough about equal pay for her taste. We were in the wilderness for so long, and the price was paid by people who were unemployed and had no decent services "I just wasnt into group discussions about sex. There were also a lot of men on the left who felt it was the duty of women on the left to have lots of sex with them. Anyway, I didnt want to be discussing my own consciousness. I wanted to be discussing womens rights."

By this time, shed met Jack Dromey, then a trade unionist, now an MP, and her future husband, though they would never have done anything as bourgeois as go on a date. Did your eyes meet across a burning brazier?

"Something like that. Or a courtroom. Im not sure anyone went on dates in our world because we literally were full on with the cause. It was our lives. We didnt do chilling around and relaxing and being cheerful with Margaret Thatcher as prime minister. No. There was a job to be done."

I get the distinct impression that Dromey is not the type to run around the house with a vacuum, though she wont be drawn on details. "Youve got to remember that this is still a work in progress about men having an equal share in the home," she says.

She wont say either if she brought up her two sons (she has a daughter too) to be good feminists around the house, though one, Joe, has followed his parents into politics  hes a Labour councillor in south London. But one of the most affecting bits is where she talks briefly about her marriage. How, during her campaign to become deputy leader, Dromey would drive through the night so she could make a meeting. And how at the last minute, the party decided to release the full membership lists and her campaign manager, Joan Ruddock, said that to have a chance, they needed to leaflet them all and that would cost 40,000. Which they didnt have. She came around to the house to tell her and Dromey immediately said that they would find it: they would remortgage the house.

"I was absolutely astonished by that. Really astonished. Because its a big, big sum of money. And Jack comes from a very poor background with no money at all. But hes always been so committed. So if Id come back from work exhausted and say I just couldnt face going to some meeting, some husbands would say, Just put your feet up and tell them you cant come. Whereas Jack would say, Just put your head round the door for five minutes. Weve got a shared belief system but in a way thats why we got together. We didnt come from the same backgrounds at all. We had shared goals."

A week after I interview her, after the supreme court ruling, I ring to find out how shes going to vote on Brexit and she bangs on about how "the moment of decision has passed" and her constituents were telling her on Saturday that "they thought it had already happened". Eventually she says: "I will vote with the whip." So, how did Peckham and Camberwell vote? "Oh, very strongly Remain." So, youre not actually representing them at all, I say. You went on and on about how you shouldnt be in politics if its not all about representing your constituents and yet here you are not representing them. From there on in, we get into what I can only call a slightly bad-tempered row. This is the other Harman, the dogged party loyalist, who has never, ever not toed the party line. She refuses to pass comment on Corbyn though its obvious that she hates everything he stands for. And when I say, how deeply disappointing it is that Labour is just not providing any sort of opposition, she agrees, before listing the reasons why shes backing Corbyn and not providing any sort of opposition.

Though if anyone knows about the political wilderness, its Harman. Her first 15 years in parliament were spent in opposition. "We lost four general elections: 79, 83, 87, 92. Four! The press used to say, Labours absolutely useless. Theres no opposition. We werent even effective in opposition, let alone looking like a credible government."

So exactly what it feels like now? "Exactly. Different circumstances. But that sense of being off the pitch, that were irrelevant. That we cant do our basic job of representing our constituents. That absolutely frustrating thing. I just felt like, Come on!" With Gordon Brown at the Labour party conference in 2008. Photograph: Martin Argles for the Guardian In her memoir, she rails against her neighbouring MP Stuart Holland, who threw in the towel to take some plum job. "It was shocking to me that an MP would give up his seat this way and thereby run the risk of Labour losing the byelection," she writes.

"I wrote that before I knew about Jamie and Tristram," she points out. Jamie Reed and Tristram Hunt have both stood down as Labour MPs, triggering byelections. "Tony Blair used to say it too. I dont know why Im doing this. I should go back to being a barrister. And I used to say, If we all did that, where would we be."

But then, I say, isnt that what happens when you parachute careerist high-flyers into constituencies they have no connection to? Isnt this New Labours chickens coming home to roost?

"All I can say is how I did it and what I said to Tony Blair. If youve made a promise to your voters that you will stand up for them, you need to stand up for them. Nobody makes you stand as a Labour MP. You fight for that position. If Id just seen this as a career, I never would have done it. It was because it was a cause. And the cause is when youre opposition as well as government."

There was a moment in her career, though, when she could have stood up and been counted, and if shed done that it is conceivable that well, it depends how counterfactual you want to be, but Gordon Brown would have been deposed, a new, less paranoid leader elected, the Tories would not have got in, the referendum would not have been called and Brexit would have been averted It was in 2009, when James Purnell resigned, telling Brown he should quit and was followed by half the shadow cabinet, culminating in Caroline Flint accusing Brown of using women as "window dressing" when she stood down as Europe minister.

Despite being deputy leader, Brown had refused to make Harman deputy prime minister, an act that she found humiliating and depressing, not just for herself, and I believe her on this, but for all Labour women. And shes right: it was important. And then in the middle of the crisis, she discovered that he planned to make Peter Mandelson deputy instead.

In the memoir, she recounts her fury. "Over my dead body!" she tells him. And then points out that shes about to go out and defend him against accusations that he treats women as window dressing. He backs down and agrees not to make Mandelson deputy prime minister. "I was pleased but suspicious," she writes. "And as I left my parting shot was, OK, but youd better not be going to double-cross me and do it by the back door." Harman with her three children in 1988. Photograph: Rex Later that afternoon, Brown made Mandelson "first secretary of state" or as Number 10 briefed the media, "deputy prime minister in all but name". It still smarts. Shes still furious. But you wouldnt have known any of this at the time. Shes shown dogged loyalty in the face of betrayal, knifings in the back, rank incompetence on the part of her colleagues, no-hopers as leaders. Youll never get her to bitch and whine. "Shes fantastically loyal to the Labour party," one political editor tells me. "When she was fired by Blair very early on, she could have become a carping anti-Blairite but she just got on with it and eventually resurfaced as solicitor general and made a very good job of it."

Shes no longer sees Brown or Blair, but she still refuses to be a carping anti-Blairite; when I point out that Iraq only occupies a page and a half of the entire book, she refuses to apologise for it. "Wed lost four elections. If youd been in opposition since 1982 with your constituents dying on hospital waiting lists, and Im not saying that people didnt die in Iraq. Obviously, they did in huge numbers, but Im not going to say bad things about him. We were in the wilderness for so long and the price that was paid was by people who were unemployed and had no decent public services; Tony was part of moving things forward."

This wasnt her first view of him. Shed been friends with Cherie through their work in the law and thought she was "a dynamo". Tony, on the other hand "I thought thats it, the Labour party has gone to the dogs. I was amazed he got selected for Sedgefield. Couldnt imagine what had happened to everyone elses nominations."

But he was a winner. And, in the Harriet Harman playbook, thats what matters. Winning. Making laws. Changing things. "Its not very fashionable, but Ive not got a bad word to say about Tony Blair in the book and Im not going to say a bad word afterwards because actually, he led us to three victories. Three victories where we could do things and I think the things we did were incredibly important. We did civil partnerships, we abolished Clause 28. The Human Rights Act "

Yvonne Roberts says what Harman and that cohort of women Labour MPs achieved for women during those years shouldnt be underestimated. "On childcare and working rights and domestic violence. There was a lot of stuff going behind the scenes. I suspect she did more than she even takes credit for."

There is something bracing about talking to Harriet Harperson. I leave her kitchen feeling slightly more cheerful than when I arrived. Its so dark right now. "But I remember feeling very dark and despondent when we had Reagan and Thatcher," she says. "People talked about emigrating. But nobody went anywhere. We fought our way through. We kept the faith. We kept the course. We got into government. And thats what well do again." Shes 66. It would be cheering to think there will finally be a female Labour prime minister in her lifetime. Or any Labour prime minister.
