At lease January is ending on the right note for the Oklahoma Wesleyan University men’s basketball team 
 
The Eagles (9-13, 6-9) rallied Saturday in the final five minutes to level the Southwestern (Kan.) Moundbuilders, 79-76, in a fierce battle at the Mueller Sports Center. 
 
With less than 300 seconds left, Eagle veteran Breiman Alexander burst down the left lane for a layup that bumped OKWU into the lead, 72-71. 
 
After Southwestern knotted the score, 72-72, the Eagles missed two shots on one possession. 
 
But, Southwestern also failed to score, which opened the door for OKWU to retake the lead, 75-72, on Shaq Martin’s net-popping three-pointer, off a pass from Elbert Lawrence, on a secondary fast break. 
 
After the Moundbuilders failed to connect on a layup, OKWU brought the ball down and went up by five, 77-72, on another Martin basket, this one off an assist from Jake Feickert. Southwestern answered on a 4-0 run in the final 90 seconds, including a pair of free throws by reserve center Greg McCoy, with 11. 8 ticks showing. 
 
But, still trailing by one points, 77-76, Southwestern had to foul. 
 
Alexander went to the free throw stripe and —with 10.5 seconds showing — sank two free throws to make it a three-point game, 79-76. 
 
The Moundbuilders managed to get off a three-point shot, which only drew iron. 
 
While the ball was being batted up in the air, on a mad melee for the rebound, the final buzzer whined. 
 
With the victory, OKWU improved to 2-1 in its last three games and 2-5 in January —a month which saw the Eagles open with four-straight defeats. 
 
Next up, OKWU will be on the road Thursday at Bethany (Kan.), and be back home Feb. 4 to face Kansas Wesleyan. 
 
The Eagles enjoyed a balanced scoring sheet against Southwestern. 
 
Alexander dropped in 17 points, followed by A.j. Jack with 15. 
 
Martin finished just shy of a double-double (12 points, nine boards). 
 
Lawrence added 12 points. 
 
D.J. Wallace canned 24 points for Southwestern followed by Cameron Hunt with 17. 
 
OKWU dominated on the board, 44-35, and also overcame a big deficit on the free throw line — 18-of-25 for the Moundbuilders and 8-of-12 for the Eagles. 
 
Southwestern surged to an early lead, 5-2, but OKWU snapped back with a 7-2 run, highlighted by field goals by three different players. 
 
But, the Eagles just couldn’t shake the determined Moundbuilders. 
 
With 13:28 remaining in the score was tied, 17-17.

Lady Eagles fall 
 
Shooting woes dogged the Oklahoma Wesleyan University Lady Eagles — and extended their January sorrows — during a women’s basketball clash Saturday in Bartlesville. 
 
OKWU (10-13, 6-9) collided with a red-hot Southwestern College squad that hit 57 percent of its shots — including an incredible display from behind the three-point arc — and cruised to a 79-57 victory at the Mueller Sports Center. 
 
In the iconic Christmas classic, Charles Dickens describes how only a handkerchief held the bottom of the face of Marley’s Ghost in place. But, Marley’s jaw would have dropped to his hips had he look at the three-point line for Southwestern — 14-of-21. 
 
Southwestern also hit 14-of-28 from two-point territory. 
 
OKWU just couldn’t generate compensatory firepower. The Lady Eagles shot less than 30 percent (20-of-68) from the field. 
 
Shelbie Kirby canned 14 points to lead the Lady Eagles’ offensive thrust, followed by Tiffany Rieger with 10. The other three OKWU starters combined for just seven points. 
 
For Southwestern, Jordyn Miller netted 32 points — including 12-of-18 on her field goals, with 4-of-4 from the three-point arc — followed by Maddie Rogers with 16 points — all on treys. 
 
But, OKWU still scrapped nearly evenly in three of the four quarters. 
 
The big magilla turned out to be the second period — during which Southwestern outpointed OKWU, 27-12. 
 
In the other three stanzas, Southwestern owned just a 52-45 advantage. 
 
OKWU head coach Jason Jeschke went to his bench liberally trying to turn the tide. 
 
Ten different Lady Eagles played more than 11 minutes, and none stayed on the court longer than 26:21. 
 
OKWU fell to 2-5 in January and to 2-7 since Christmas. 
 
The Lady Eagles are likely happy to see on the horizon the glow of February. 
 
Their next game is Thursday (Feb. 2), when they travel to Bethany (Kan.).
