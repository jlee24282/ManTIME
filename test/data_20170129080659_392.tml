<TEXT type="str">Hongkongers are being warned they could face rain tonight as they watch almost 24,000 firework shells explode over Victoria Harbour on Sunday to mark the Year of the Rooster. 
 
Crowds are expected to gather in Tsim Sha Tsui, Mid-levels, Central, Wan Chai, Causeway Bay and Hung Hom bypass to watch the annual Lunar New Year display, which will this year consist of eight scenes, lasting 23 minutes in total.

The Hong Kong Observatory said visitors could endure drizzly spells in the evening, although it should remain relatively warm at about 20 degrees Celsius. 
 
A spokesman for the city’s official weather forecaster said cloudy periods could also limit visibility in some areas.

“It will be mainly cloudy with one or two light rain patches,” he said. “Visibility will be relatively low in some areas. There will be sunny intervals in the afternoon and moderate to fresh easterly winds, occasionally strong offshore and on high ground at first.” 
 
In the ambitious pyrotechnic display, 23,888 firework shells are to be deployed over the harbour from three barges. 
 

 
The display, which will be broadcast live on the Post ’s Facebook page, is estimated to cost HK$8 million. The production is sponsored by Unique Timepieces by Halewinner, a luxury watch company chaired by Karson Choi Ka-tsan, a son of billionaire toy maker Francis Choi. 
 
The display’s first scene is to feature a time tunnel image incorporating the pattern of the figure “20” to mark the 20th anniversary of Hong Kong’s establishment as a special administrative region of China, a Halewinner spokesman said.

The festive auspicious sign of the figure “8” – which in Chinese rhymes with the character for prosperity – and a Chinese character for auspiciousness are to be shown in scenes two and four. 
 
Other major fireworks displays in Hong Kong take place on July 1 – this year to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the city’s handover from UK to Chinese authorities – and October 1 for National Day. Another event is held on December 31. 
 
The Lunar New Year show comes a day after the city’s annual parade through Tsim Sha Tsui. Thousands of people lined the streets on Saturday night to watch nearly 3,000 performers from some 25 international and local performing groups.</TEXT>
