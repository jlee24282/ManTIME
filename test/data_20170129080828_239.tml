<TEXT type="str">NEW DELHI: A Bollywood director has been assaulted on set by a group protesting his new movie Padmavati, which they claim distorts historical facts about their clan. 
 
Video shows protesters from a group called the Rajput Karni Sena slapping director Sanjay Leela Bhansali and pulling his hair as filming was taking place at a fort in Jaipur on Friday (Jan 27). 
 
The protesters, who also vandalised the set, accuse Bhansali of twisting historical facts by romantically linking a Rajput queen and a Muslim ruler in the movie, according to local media. 
 
The Rajputs were a Hindu warrior clan that historically ruled over kingdoms in Western India. 
 
The actress playing the Rajput queen, Deepika Padukone, defended the movie on Saturday. 
 
&quot;I can assure you that there is absolutely no distortion of history,&quot; she tweeted. 
 
&quot;Our only endeavour is &amp; has always been to share with the world the story of this courageous &amp; powerful woman in the purest form there is.&quot; 
 
Narayan Singh, who claims to be the local leader of Karni Sena, told the Press Trust of India that the group had warned the filmmaker against presenting &quot;wrong facts&quot;, but he stopped short of claiming responsibility for the attack. 
 
&quot;We gathered there and protested,&quot; he said, adding there were also others watching the filming. 
 
&quot;Someone from the mob slapped him and pulled his hair,&quot; he added. 
 
Local police said five men were initially detained over the incident but had been released. - AFP</TEXT>
