Be sure to savor that homemade guacamole on Super Bowl Sunday. Avocados could be a lot more expensive next year, if President Trump gets his way. 

Press Secretary Sean Spicer last week threw out a half-baked plan to impose a 20 percent tariff on all goods imported from Mexico to the United States to help pay for a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border. 

Spicer was just spit-balling with the press about ways the Trump administration could follow through on his empty campaign promise to &quot;make Mexico pay&quot; for the wall. That&apos;s a reckless way to make policy, and the 20 percent tariff should never make it to Congress, much less into law. 

Such a ludicrous idea would in fact make Americans pay for the wall, in several ways. 

Trump does not practice the &quot;Buy American&quot; ideas he touted in his inaugural, outsourcing production of his signature clothing line and importing foreign workers to staff his swanky resorts. 

But even if he weren&apos;t a hypocrite, he would still be wrong. 

Trump&apos;s outdated ideas of trade were debunked centuries ago by Adam Smith, and countless economists since. Trade barriers don&apos;t just protect domestic industries from foreign competition. They protect them from the choices of American consumers, millions of individuals making billions of decisions to buy better, cheaper products. 

The USDA reports that nearly half of the fruits and vegetables imported into the U.S. come from Mexico. With a high tariff, some consumers would pay more for Mexican produce. Some agricultural production could shift back to the U.S., again at higher prices. And some would move to other foreign countries. 

We could be gobbling Guatemalan guacamole next year as we watch Tom Brady play in his eighth Super Bowl. 

Punitive tariffs like the one Spicer suggested are a terrible idea. They punish American consumers, distort the free market, and imperil millions of American jobs that rely on trade.
