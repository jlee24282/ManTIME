<TITLE>No one couldve predicted what Jimmy did</TITLE>
<TEXT>THE brother of the man accused of killing five people in the tragic CBD massacre 10 days ago has expressed his remorse to the families affected.

Angelo Gargasoulas wrote on Facebook his thoughts were with everyone involved in the January 20 tragedy and said no one could have seen it coming.

To all the families of the victims involved in last Fridays tragedy, my heart goes out to you and for all those still fighting in hospital, my thoughts are with you and your recovery, Mr Gargasoulas wrote earlier today.

No one couldve predicted what Jimmy did or that hed do that, that morning. Im fortunate enough to still have my life and the support I have received is unheard of!!! I thank everyone involved in making this an easier time for everyone else involved, and my family.

As for me, I still got some recovery time to do, and its all looking good ...

Still in disbelief, the realism of it all has yet to fully sink in, stay strong Melbourne!

Dimitrious Jimmy Gargasoulas allegedly knifed younger brother Angelo, who is gay, in the early hours of Friday morning before setting off on a 12-hour rampage through Melbourne.More: Thalia Hakins sweet, haunting note

The siblings were with their mother Emily in her public housing apartment in Windsor.

The alleged attack was labelled a homophobic incident after Gargasoulas posted a series of unhinged posts on Facebook describing himself as god himself in a human bodily form and denouncing gay people.

It comes as Victoria Police announced a $2 billion recruitment drive for 3135 police recruits over the next five years.

Matthew Si, 33, Jess Mudie 22, and 10-year-old Thalia Hakin were all killed on Bourke St when a car ploughed along the footpath on January, hitting scores of victims.

The lives of three-month-old Zachary Bryant and a 25-year-old Japanese man were also claimed.

Dimitrious Gargasoulas, 26, of Windsor has been charged with five counts of murder.

Gargasoulas will reappear in Melbourne Magistrates Court in August.
