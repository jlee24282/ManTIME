Pic: Mega A tiger caused mass panic today after it escaped from a travelling circus – and wandered into the busy streets of Sicily in Italy. 
 
Locals couldn’t believed their eyes as the white feline, called Oscar, perched outside of a block of flats in a town near Palermo. 
 
Even Mayor Piero Capizzi said he thought someone was joking when he was told a tiger was on the loose in Monreale. 
 
But, sure enough, the enough predator managed to give its captors the slip and enter a town, home to 38,000 people. 
 
Oscar was eventually recaptured – and nobody was hurt.

Traffic was blocked for a few hours along the nearby highway as authorities struggled to contain the enormous tiger. 
 
But eventually he was re-captured after being coaxed to go inside a series of increasingly smaller cages. 
 
He was then taken back to the circus – where he will be made to perform on Monday. 
 
The mayor said it is not known how the tiger escaped from the circus, which is currently performing in the Monreale area.
