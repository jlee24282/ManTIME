<content type="str">Trainer Kelly Doughty is at a loss to explain why jockey Geoff Goold doesn&apos;t get more opportunities. 
 
Doughty and her Group One winning ex-jockey husband Gary are huge fans of Goold and he rides many of their horses. 
 
They combined to win with comeback horse Arki at the Sunshine Coast on Saturday. 
 
Arki missed two years of racing with first a tendon problems and then a pedal bone injury. 
 
&quot;It gives us a special thrill every time he wins because so much work has gone into getting him back to the track,&quot; Doughty said. 
 
Gary Doughty bred Arki after he got a free service to Aussie Rules for his mare Natural Glamour. 
 
&quot;Arki is a lovely big horse with a beautiful nature. His sister bites and kicks so it is lucky Arki is a gentleman because he is so big he could do some real damage,&quot; Doughty said. 
 
Goold has been aboard Arki for three of his four comeback wins and only gave up the other winning ride to Michael Rodd because it was in a State of Origin race. 
 
The Doughtys have tried to get Goold to move full time to the Gold Coast but he is not keen to uproot his family.
