Jeffrey Wright has been arrested for a DWI in NYC 

According to the report, Wright was pulled over for an &apos;unknown traffic violation&apos;, and that was when the cops could smell the alcohol on his breath. Of course, he ended up failing the field sobriety test, and got booked for a DWI [Driving While Intoxicated]. 

This has been a week full of celebrity DUIs, as Reese Witherspoon and her husband were also arrested in Atlanta for driving while drunk. However, the backlash is likely to be much less in Wright&apos;s case because he&apos;s not as well known and his image, unlike Reese&apos;s, is not that of America&apos;s sweetheart.
