The Road to WrestleMania officially begins today with the WWE’s “Royal Rumble” pay-per-view event, which will be at the Alamodome in San Antonio. 
 
Like the “WrestleMania,” “SummerSlam” and “Survivor Series” pay-per-views, today’s coverage is a six-hour extravaganza with the kickoff show beginning at 4 p.m., followed by the main pay-per-view at 6 p.m. on the WWE Network. 
 
As of press time, 22 superstars are scheduled to be part of the Royal Rumble match. 
 
Those performers are Brock Lesnar, Bill Goldberg, Kofi Kingston, Xavier Woods, Big E, United States Champion Chris Jericho, Braun Strowman, Dolph Ziggler, Baron Corbin, The Undertaker, The Miz, Intercontinental champion Dean Ambrose, RAW tag team champion Cesaro, RAW tag team champion Sheamus, Bray Wyatt, Randy Orton, Luke Harper, Big Show, Sami Zayn, Big Cass, Rusev and Mojo Rawley. 
 
Marquee title matches include AJ Styles (c) vs. John Cena for the WWE championship; Kevin Owens (c) vs. Roman Reigns for the universal title in a no-disqualification match (also, Jericho will be hanging above the ring inside a shark cage); Charlotte Flair (c) vs. Bayley for the RAW women’s championship; and Rich Swann (c) vs. Neville for the WWE cruiserweight championship. 
 
There will be three matches on the preshow: 
 
Nikki Bella, Naomi and Becky Lynch vs. Mickie James, Natalya and SmackDown women’s champion Alexa Bliss; Sasha Banks vs. Nia Jax; and Cesaro and Sheamus (c) vs. Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson for the RAW tag team titles (there will be two referees for that match). 
 
Piledriver  podcast: Check out the current podcast at the link below for “Royal Rumble” predictions. 
 
Nikki Bella to work behind the scenes on ‘Total Divas’: The midseason finale of Season 6 of the E! reality show, “Total Divas,” aired this past Wednesday. 
 
WWE announced Friday that WWE SmackDown Live! performer Nikki Bella will serve as an executive producer of the show. The series returns April 5. 
 
Ring of Honor 15th  anniversary show: Independent promotion Ring of Honor’s 15th anniversary pay-per-view event takes place at 8 p.m. March 10 at Sam’s Town Live in Las Vegas. 
 
Recently, longtime independent star and former Total Nonstop Action performer Christopher Daniels won a tournament to earn a world title match, which will take place at the anniversary show. 
 
The current ROH champion is Adam Cole. 
 
30 for 30 on XFL airs Thursday: On Super Bowl week, ESPN’s next 30 for 30 documentary, “This was the XFL,” debuts at 8 p.m. Thursday. 
 
The documentary chronicles the quick rise and fall of the XFL, which was launched by WWE chairman Vince McMahon and former NBC Sports chairman Dick Ebersol. 
 
Ebersol is now a senior adviser for NBC Universal Sports &amp; Olympics, and Ebersol’s son, Charlie, directed the piece. 
 
The league only lasted one season, during the winter and spring of 2001. 
 
One of the eight teams in the league was the Birmingham Thunderbolts. Two notable players on that team was former Alabama quarterback Jay Barker and former Auburn player James Bostic. 
 
Other notable names who played in the league were Los Angeles’ Tommy Maddox, San Francisco’s Mike Pawlawski and Memphis’ Jim Druckenmiller and Rashaan Salaam. 
 
I just hope that the documentary includes an interview from the XFL’s most recognized player, running back/kick returner Rod Smart, a.k.a., “He Hate Me.”
