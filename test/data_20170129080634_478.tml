<TEXT type="str">YAHYA SARKI, in this piece, writes that the former ruling party in Kebbi State has not just become a shadow of itself but also is on the verge of extinctionIt has become trite in politics that there are neither permanent friends nor no permanent enemies, but permanent interests.As such, current political happenings in Kebbi State, North-west of Nigeria shows a drift of politicians from the former ruling party, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the party in charge of the state, All Progressives Congress (APC).For watchers of Kebbi politics, movements are becoming so much sparking concerns that it might become a one party state.Like many other states, Kebbi became an APC state after the 2015 general election. The state used to be the hub of PDP in the North-west, with key stalwarts of the party at the national level from the state such as the National treasurer of the party, Alhaji Halidu Bala and Dr. Bello Haliru, an elder of the party former BoT chairman and former Acting national chairman of the party.But despite assuming the natural status of largest opposition party after the 2015 polls, PDP is gradually being emasculated by the ruling APC following incidences of decamping and cross carpeting of PDP members into APC.Reduced to the proverbial dog that does not bite some notable figures and stalwarts who have defected to APC include those who led the PDP campaign machinery in the 2015 gubernatorial election such as Alhaji Malami Abdulkadir , the Chairman of the PDP guber candidate campaign team, Alhaji Lawal Shuwa, the campaign Coordinator of PDP guber candidate , General Sarkin Yaki Bello .Other notable figures who left the PDP to APC were Alhaji Mansur Shehu, former State PDP chairman, Alhaji Nurudeen Usman Kangiwa, former SSG to the immediate past government of PDP under Governor Saidu Nasamu Dakingari and a host of others.PDPs shrinking profile in the state was also spelt out in the large number of decampees received by APC at the various local government areas visited by the APC committees to receive decampees from PDP.In an exclusive interview with LEADERSHIP Sunday, the Kebbi State APC chairman of elders committee, Alhaji Sani Hukuma Zauro hinted that apart from receiving decampees from various local government areas in the state, the party leadership was in consultation with the immediate former Governor of the state, Alhaji Saidu Nasamu Dakingari and the state chairman of PDP, Alhaji Musa Dan Illela, to forget the past and join APC.According to him Yes, I led a delegation to the state chairman of PDP; he organised an unprecedented dinner to welcome us in his residence in Birnin Kebbi.We are still consulting the former Gov. Alhaji Saidu Dakingari to join our fold in order to move the state forward; as soon as the consultation is over, there will be no opposition in Kebbi.He addedthe present Governor, Alhaji Atiku Bagudu, supported the former governor, Dakingari during his two terms of office. Some hypocrites, who were hell bent on seeing disunity in the state caused the misunderstanding between them through hypocritical mongering.But the PDP has remained the architect of its misfortunes in the state. The prevailing political leadership tussle of the PDP both at the national level and within the state where Alhaji Musa Dan Illela and Alhaji Ali Bagudo both claim leadership of the party has greatly contributed to the partys woes.Investigations carried out by LEADERSHIP Sunday revealed that most of the decampees left PDP in Kebbi because for them the party has lost focus, sense of direction while its followers are in disarray as to who their real leader is.An example was when a by election was to be conducted following demise of the member of the state house of assembly from Arewa local government, Abdullahi Yeldu, who was of the APC.There was utter confusion during the electioneering campaign when Alhaji Ali Bagudo and Alhaji Musa Dan Illela, visited Arewa local government both laying claim to the chairmanship of the PDP and campaigning for Alhaji Suleiman Yeldu against the APC candidate, Alhaji Salihu Biu.The APC candidate took advantage of the chaotic situation and won the election.Clearly PDP in Kebbi just like at the national, has not recovered from the devastating defeat at the 2015 guber election.The PDP lost almost all its political seats to the APC in both the State and Federal House of Assembly except that of Suru, Shanga and Bagudo local government areas.The lingering leadership tussle in the party, the chaotic ward and local government congresses in the state further aggravated the wounds of the PDP.Several reconciliation meetings from within the state and at the national level to bring the two warring factions of the PDP together proved abortive as they have all gone to court to seek for redress of the matter.In a response to the wave of notable PDP figures decamping to APC, the Publicity Relation Officer of the PDP, Ibrahim Umar Ummai, neither denied no confirmed the issue.He however acknowledged that the APC leadership visited the PDP top echelon including the Chairman, Alhaji Musa Dan Illela in his residence for consultation.Yes they were in the PDP chairman, Dan Illelas residence but I did not go with them and Dan Illela confirmed it to me too. I will not be surprised if the APC are now after our former Governor, Dakingari to lure him because of his record of achievements in the state over the years. The PDP chairman, Dan Illela too has large followership. I think they want to use the two figures to attract PDP members to decamp to APC.However, the two leaders did not categorically say they have decamped to APC, but if it is true that they decided to decamp to APC, then its unfortunate. They should realize that we are not happy and their ambition in no small measure represent a set back to democracy of the state.They should understand that God gives power to whom he wishes and takes away power when he likes. Alliance to the ruling party does not mean integrity, what makes integrity is for a politician to have principle and remain as a genuine and credible opposition.When asked if they are ready to decamp to APC should the former governor, Dakingari and PDP Chairman of the state, Musa Dan Illela decide to dump PDP, he replied I joined PDP since 1998 when PDP was first established, even before governor Dakingari joined PDP, he met me in the party, so simply because they decamp to APC will not make me dump PDP. But my advise to them is they should have a second thought before they finally decamp to APC and as for the so called mass decampees from local government areas, I still do not agree because the APC did not categorically specify the exact number that decamped or at least a breakdown from each local government area of the decampees.A stalwart of the PDP who recently decamped to APC from PDP is the former Chairman of Bunza Local Government Area, Alhaji Sambo Sarkin Yaki Zogirma. He confirmed to LEADERSHIP Sunday in a telephone conversation that it is true that he dumped the PDP to APC with all the ward exco members of the local government.Although he said nobody influenced his decision to decamp or gave any condition before he left the party to APC, he identified the current leadership crises facing the party in both the state and at national level as reasons for his decamping.Yes I have decamped to APC with all the ward members, my decision to join APC is purely personal. However, I must confess to you that the current impasse in PDP in the state and at the top was disturbing to me and other members. Peace is prerequisite in stabilizing the party but it is lacking in PDP. The two factions in the state instead of harmonising to become one are at loggerheads with each other hampering the unity of the party , he said.As the political scenario of Kebbi is now favouring the ruling APC, how will the party deal with the influx of decampees. Already there there is are complains from some founding members of the party that since the inception of the APC in the state, they have nothing or very little to show as dividends of democracy.You know nothing goes for nothing, 90% of us are into politics for personal gains before talking of developing the state or country. Personal gain in politics is primary to us and development for the state/country is secondary, if anyone decides to decamp, he is on his own, he or she should not expect any quick change or booty, Bello Jekada, a staunch APC supporter said.
