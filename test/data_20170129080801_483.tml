<TITLE>RAMON PRESSON: A Source of Comfort in the Terrible Night</TITLE>
<TEXT>Corky French 
By Ramon Presson 
 
Corky French is a big man with broad shoulders, which is a good thingbecause he helps carry the burden for many traumatized and grieving peoplein Williamson County. 
 
Since 2003 Corky has been making house calls  thekind youd never want to make and the kind you hope to never get. 
 
A former pastor and the head of Community Outreach Ministries, Corky is oncall 24-hours a day to respond to emergencies. He responds regularly toaccidents, suicides, shootings, domestic struggles, and various other incidentswhere the police officers and citizens involved can benefit from a caringpresence and compassionate support. Corky is regularly tasked withdelivering the life-altering news of the death of a loved one and with providingcritical support at that most painful moment. 
 
Our local men and women in law enforcement also know Corky French as a dearfriend, a listening ear, an arm to lean on, and sometimes a shoulder to cry on. 
 
Hes also been my friend for over a decade. I thought it was time for you to getto know him too. 
 
Corky, weve seen in TV shows and movies where a policeman or amilitary officer appears at the door of a home to deliver tragicnews to a family. Typically we see a spouse or parents suddenrealization of why the man in uniform is present. We see the shockand instant grief  and then the scene changes. For you the scenedoes not cut away, it follows you into the house and into the livingroom. What can you tell us about happens in that room? What isthat experience like for you? 
 
The scene is generally horrific. I have just given them information that willchange their life forever. The responses range from stoic, shock, denial, anger,rage, physical violence, and even passing out. I have been physically attacked. 
 
I have picked people up off the floor. One person would not quit holding ontomy face because they did not believe that I was real, that the news and themoment was real. 
 
After dealing with the initial reaction, I move to allowing them to absorb thenews. When they have settled in a little, I begin to try and surround them withfamily, friends, and their pastor if they have one. Actually, few seem to have apastor or have one they feel they can call, so I often fill that role too. Ifrequently make the calls to family or friends due to the persons emotionalcondition. I generally do not leave until they have some supportive peoplethere around them. 
 
I, or the officer that accompanies me, try to answer the numerous questionsthat they might have about what happened. Eventually, I go over with themwhat will happen next and what they will need to do (few people know whathappens after someone dies and the processes that must be gone through). The not knowing what is next is very difficult, and I try to relieve them ofthat uncertainty. 
 
Throughout the entire process, I try to be as compassionate, patient,understanding, supportive and loving as I possibly can. If they are people offaith, I point to their faith as a source of strength, and often at that point intheir lives, survival. When possible and appropriate, I spend some timepraying with them before I leave. I might spend anywhere from 30 minutes tofive hours with a family after delivering this news. When appropriate andfeasible, I try to follow up a few days later to check on them. 
 
Most of us cannot fathom doing even once what you do on a regularbasis. Why do you do it? 
 
Simply put, it is an opportunity to bring light into a very, very, dark place. Godhas something to offer, even, or maybe especially, to this kind of devastatingmoment. The information has to be delivered. I want to do it in a way, and dealwith it in a way that brings God to the moment through me. I want to do morethan just deliver information. I want to bring something to the moment. Themission of our ministry is to bring help, hope, and healing to the broken, bruised,wounded and often invisible or forgotten of our community. You dont get muchmore broken, bruised and wounded than when receiving this type of news. 
 
What are the hardest visits to make? 
 
They areallhard. You are delivering the worst news possible. There is pain,regardless of the situation. But, the calls that involve children or young peopletend to be the worst. Our community has been hit hard recently by several deadlyvehicle accidents involving teenagers. I have been involved in some of those. Theywere extremely tough. 
 
You also get called to the tragic scene itself on occasion. Whats yourrole there? 
 
First, at the scene I want to make sure that my law enforcement officers are OK.Theyre human. This stuff is hard for them as well. They have families. They havefeelings. No one should have to see and do the things that they must do. But theystand in the gap and do whatever needs to be done. I provide any support andhelp that I can at the scene. I also gather all the appropriate information that Ineed to effectively deliver the notification. 
 
How does this work not take its toll on you? 
 
For me personally, its excruciating work. I have seen unspeakable physicaltrauma in my ministry. But dealing with the emotional devastation of thefamilies is the most difficult part for me. The immediate trauma for them isoverwhelming. Ive learned, and have been trained in, how to deal with thismyself. I know there are certain things I have to do to take care of myself when Ideal with such stressors. I am blessed to be surrounded by a strong support groupand a great family. These things, and moreover my faith, allow me to deal withthese things regularly and stay healthy. But, this kind of trauma is cumulative,and after 17 years I know that it has affected me. 
 
You are a chaplain to police officers. What difficulties do people inlaw enforcement deal with that the general public doesnt see andunderstand?  
 
Law enforcement is one of the top-threemost stressful professions in the world. A lotof factors play in to that. Never has it been more so than now. The culturalenvironment, lack of support from national leaders, fake news, social mediaand other factors have made their jobs even more difficult. They deal with theworst of the worst. They work in difficult environments. As I said before, theyhave to see and deal with things that no one should have to. They have to makesplit-second decisions. Everything that they do is scrutinized to the nth degree. 
 
Inthe big picture theyre just human like me and you. Most see what they do in lawenforcement as a calling. Most go into law enforcement to try and make adifference. They are overworked and underpaid. Most work a second job, andmany a third, just to get by. They are sons, daughters, husbands, wives, parents,and have families and lives just like us. At the end of their shifts, they just want togo home safe to their families. Just like us.
