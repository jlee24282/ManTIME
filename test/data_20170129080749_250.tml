Other mealtime options: the bayed breakfast nook and the formal dining room with plenty of windows. 
 
Head back to the private master suite, complete with porch access and a large walk-in closet. Two additional bedrooms sit near the front. 
 
For more room, take advantage of the huge bonus space upstairs.
