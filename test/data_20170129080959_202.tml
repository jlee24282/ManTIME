<TITLE>Trumps visa ban to affect more than a million people in the UAE</TITLE>
<TEXT>Trumps visa ban is likely to affect many of the people around you (in fact, itll affect more than a million people in the UAE)  
In an extraordinary first week as 45th President of the United States, Donald Trump made many controversial rulings, but the order thats going to affect people in the UAE most immediately is his decision to halt all refugee admissions and temporarily bar people from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the US. 
 
What are the banned countries? They are Syria, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen (and even people from these countries who hold dual citizenship with any other country apart from the US will be banned). 
 
Im establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America. Dont want them here, Trump saidover the weekend. His move has caused protests at US airports, with thousands showing support for the refugees and visitors banned from the seven countries. 
 MORE THAN A MILLION IN THE UAE  
And while even though the UAE isnt on the list, many of the people living in the UAE will be affected. 
 
Its unclear exactly how many people from these seven countries are living in the UAE because not many official statistics that list the population by nationality are released in the UAE, but its likely that there are around 1.1 million people from these countries living here. 
 
Its estimated that there are around  240,000 Syrians living in the UAE ,  around 150,000 Iraqis ,  500,000 Iranians ,  90,000 Yemenis ,  80,000 Sudanese , 50,000 Somalis and a few thousand Libyans.

What we do know for sure is that thereare currently more than five million Arabic speakers living in the UAE  and only around one million of those are Emirati.So its safe to say that the United Arab Emirates resident population is a diverse picture of the Arabic-speaking world. 
 
When Trumpannounced the rulingit was effective immediately, meaning those en route to the States with valid visas were detained on arrival or stopped at international airports. However, US Judge Ann Donnelly, made an emergency ruling preventing the removal of people already in the US at the time as she deemed there was a risk of substantial and irreparable injury to them. Her ruling will only affect those who landed at US airports Friday evening and Saturday, after Trump signed the order, and have valid visas. 
 WHAT ABOUT THOSE ON GCC PASSPORTS?  
Well, while no GCC countries are on the banned list  Donald Trump did say vetting will be extreme in all cases. 
 
In an interview with ABC News on Wednesday, Trump was asked, Let me ask you about some of the countries that wont be on the list, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia. Why are we going to allow people to come into this country. 
 
To this, Trump replied, Youre going to see  youre going to see. Were going to have extreme vetting in all cases. And I mean extreme. And were not letting people in if we think theres even a little chance of some problem.

For other countries were gonna have extreme vetting. Its going to be very hard to come in. Right now its very easy to come in. Its gonna be very, very hard. I dont want terror in this country. You look at what happened in San Bernardino. You look at what happened all over. You look at what happened in the World Trade Center. Okay, I mean, take that as an example.
