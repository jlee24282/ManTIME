United States 
   &quot;Rooftop solar demand was already fairly weak in 2016, leading to all rooftop solar companies to cut back on installation growth projections. At this point, it&apos;s unlikely there will be much installation growth at all in late 2016 and early 2017. That&apos;s why any pressure on demand will be a negative, even if it starts in states like Indiana and Wyoming, which have very little solar.&quot; 
To Mr Know it all aka Solarman: this proves your an A-hole. How many times did you say the Residential Market is not 
Down ? Read my lips Mr Know It all: 
&quot; Rooftop Solar Demand is Weak &quot;. Repeat it ten times and mark it on your Tin hat with a Magic Marker !!!! Your so caught up in your BS you can&apos;t see a Mack Truck if it was in your face !!!!</TEXT>
