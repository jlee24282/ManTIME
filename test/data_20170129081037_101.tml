<content type="str">If you are appalled as I am about the state of the upcoming Moline mayoral election, please join me in doing something about it. 
 
Apparently, Mayor Scott Raes thinks he can ambush the process and hold us all hostage. 
 
However, due to some very clever maneuvering, several players have now forced a primary to take place on Feb. 28. My compliments and thanks to all involved. 
 
This allows Moliners to once again have a voice in the election by saying who we want on the ballot, in spite of this attempt to thwart the process. 
 
Typically, these primaries have a very poor voter turnout. As a lifelong resident, I ask all to get involved and come to the primary to write-in your favorite candidate. A large turnout would send a strong message that we disagree with this draconian obstructionism. 
 
My write-in candidate, to be added to the April ballot, will be Stephanie Acri. I spell it out to emphasize the fact that if your write-in is misspelled or the circle is not fully colored, that may void your vote, not unlike the page numbering fiasco. 
 
Please take the time on the 28th to be counted and show your disapproval of this unsportsmanlike behavior. Use your voice! 
 
John R. Williams,
