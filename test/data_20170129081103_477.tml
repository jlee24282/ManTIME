<TITLE>Georgia Tech stuns No. 14 Notre Dame at buzzer</TITLE>
<TEXT>ATLANTA (TNS)  Georgia Tech is not to be trifled with. 
   
The Yellow Jackets took down their third top-25 team Saturday, dropping No. 14 Notre Dame by a 62-60 score at McCamish Pavilion. 
   
In a taut matchup in which neither team led by more than 10 points, the outcome was decided in the final minute. Guard Josh Okogie, whose playing time was limited to 18 minutes because of foul trouble, scored the game-winning basket on a layup as time expired, eliciting a full-throated roar from the Tech crowd. With the scored tied at 60, Okogie had missed two free throws with 35.8 seconds remaining, giving Notre Dame a chance to take the lead. 
   
However, guard Matt Farrell missed a tough jumper, which was rebounded by guard Tadric Jackson, who dribbled upcourt before finding Okogie. 
   
Okogie raced in from the wing, barely beating the buzzer. 
   
Before a full house that included Tech legends Bobby Cremins and Jarrett Jack, Tech built on their Wednesday upset of No. 6 Florida State with another exemplary defensive performance. Notre Dame, which came into the game shooting 46.9 percent from the field, was held to 40.4 percent on 23-for-57 shooting. 
   
Tech (13-8 overall, 5-4 ACC) has beaten three AP top-25 teams: North Carolina, Florida State and Notre Dame, all at McCamish. Notre Dame (17-5, 6-3) was held to its second lowest point total of the season. 
   
Jackson led the Jackets with a career-high 25 points, scoring on drives, post-ups and from the perimeter. Center Ben Lammers went all 40 minutes for the first time in his career and added 15 points with 10 rebounds, three assists and five blocks. It was his 11th double-double of the season. Guard Josh Heath handed out eight assists and came up with five steals, a career high. 
   
Notre Dame led 19-9 at the 11:47 mark of the first half, but the Jackets began to assert themselves defensively. Tech gained the lead for first time at 26-25 with 4:54 left in the half. 
   
Miami 77, N. Carolina 62 
   
CORAL GABLES, Fla. (TNS)  North Carolina has often played with the kind of offensive brilliance this season that has left school officials flipping through the record book, searching for perspective. There was some searching again on Saturday  but only to see where the Tar Heels first-half misery might have ranked. 
   
One of the worst first halves in recent UNC history doomed the Tar Heels to a 77-62 defeat at Miami. The loss, which replaced the one at Georgia Tech as UNCs ugliest of the season, brought an end to the Tar Heels seven-game winning streak. 
   
UNC played without Theo Pinson, the 6-foot-6 junior who watched from the bench while he wore a protective boot over his right foot. Pinson, the Tar Heels versatile forward who often provides energy, was undoubtedly missed against Miami. 
   
So, too, was the Tar Heels shot-making ability and offensive rhythm. UNC (19-4, 7-2 ACC) entered the Watsco Center as one of the best offensive teams in the country, averaging nearly 90 points per game. After taking an early 11-2 lead, though, the Tar Heels had no answers for Miamis 2-3 zone. 
   
The Hurricanes (14-6, 4-4), led by freshman Bruce Brown and his 30 points, needed less than four minutes to erase their early nine-point deficit. Once Miami seized that lead it grew quickly, thanks in large part to a defensive performance that was every bit as good as UNCs offense was bad. 
   
Duke 85, Wake Forest 83 
   
WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (TNS)  In desperate need of a win and a team leader, No. 17 Duke got both Saturday thanks to Luke Kennard. 
   
The sophomore scored 34 points and hit the game-winning shot with 6.6 seconds left giving Duke an 85-83 comeback win over Wake Forest at Joel Coliseum. 
   
Kennard scored 30 points in the second half, and scored 11 points in the final 3:40 as Duke (16-5, 4-4) overcame Wake Forests 81-71 lead. 
   
Duke shot 63 percent in the second half. 
   
Duke trailed by 10 points at halftime and the lead remained that margin as the Deacons held an 81-71 lead with 4:01 to play. 
   
But Kennard wouldnt allow Duke to go down. He hit a 3-pointer and, after a Wake Forest offensive foul, drilled a deep two to cut the deficit in half. 
   
Keyshawn Woods nailed a 16-foot jump shot for Wake Forest but Kennard answered with a 3-pointer at 1:49 to slice Wakes lead to 83-79. 
   
Duke forced the Demon Deacons into a shot clock violation after Woods airballed a 3-pointer. 
   
The Blue Devils worked to find an open shot, with Grayson Allen draining a 3-pointer with 52.5 seconds left leaving Wake Forest up 83-82. 
   
Wood misfired on a contested 3-pointer with 23 seconds left, setting the stage for Kennards 3-pointer with 6.6 left that gave Duke an 85-83 lead.</TEXT>
