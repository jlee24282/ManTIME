<content type="str">ARIES (March 21-April 4) -- Now is the time for you to present that unusual idea to friends or family. You can allay any fears by demonstrating your preparedness. (April 5-April 19) -- Others are likely to come to your aid as a matter of course, but take care you are not drowning in help! 
 
TAURUS (April 20-May 5) -- You usually know just what to do when you are facing a certain key situation, but this week you may feel that you have to wing it. (May 6-May 20) -- A loved one tests your ability to improvise -- and, perhaps, compromise. Both of you want the same thing: mutual enjoyment! 
 
GEMINI (May 21-June 6) -- You have been looking for just the right tools for a tricky job that must be done solo -- and they can be yours, for a price.

(Aug. 8-Aug. 22) -- You may be feeling the pressure when someone else&apos;s pleasure depends on your ability to deliver the goods. You&apos;ll have more than one chance. 
 
VIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 7) -- You may choose to work at odd hours -- partially out of desire, and partially because your biological clock is out of whack! (Sept. 8-Sept. 22) -- Keeping yourself out of trouble is as easy as steering clear of those who are not telling you what&apos;s going on. Information provides safety. 
 
LIBRA (Sept. 23-Oct. 7) -- You can do what many cannot simply because you are more receptive to the kinds of input that experts are willing to give. (Oct. 8-Oct. 22) -- You want to do something impressive, but more because you need to feel good about yourself than because others require it. 
 
SCORPIO (Oct. 23-Nov. 7) -- You mustn&apos;t deceive yourself about your motives. You know why you&apos;re doing something, and that must be good enough.

(March 6-March 20) -- The quality of your work should win you praise, even from those who have been critical in the past. It&apos;s a good week!
