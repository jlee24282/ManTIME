A bracelet might have kept Tomas Anderson Beauford alive. 
 
Despite mental and behavioral illnesses that meant the 24-year-old functioned more like a 6-year-old, Beauford had mastered the use of the magnetic bracelet that combatted his epilepsy. 
 
But on April 16, 2014, Beauford didnt have his bracelet. It had been confiscated by deputies at the Mesa County Jail. 
 
Taking his prescribed medications also might have kept Beauford alive. But in jail without family and caretakers who often cajoled him with promises of Starbursts and Sprite, Beauford hadnt taken his meds regularly in six weeks when he died. 
 
In the hours before his death, Beaufords jailers saw him suffering what they would later realize were several violent seizures in his cell. Attorneys representing Beaufords mother wrote that if deputies had reacted correctly, he might never have died. 
 
Alone in his cell, Mr. Beauford ultimately had a series of seizures, fell off his bed and died with his head jammed underneath his desk, the attorneys wrote in a civil lawsuit naming Mesa County and the jail health care providers as defendants last spring. Mr. Beaufords demise could have undoubtedly been prevented had defendants provided him with prompt and appropriate medical attention and treatment. 
 
An autopsy determined Beaufords death was natural and caused by a seizure. Jail workers who dealt with him were cleared of wrongdoing after an internal investigation thats referenced in the civil suit, but which the county refused to release, saying it was subject to the governmental deliberative process privilege, according to Assistant County Attorney John Rhoads. Mesa County sheriffs spokeswoman Megan Terlecky wouldnt answer questions about whether any jail policies have changed in the years since Beaufords death, citing the ongoing lawsuit. 
 
Correct Care Solutions, the Tennessee-based company that employed the jails nursing staff, still holds the contract to provide health care in the jail. Mesa County commissioners are expected to vote on that contract soon. 
 
Beaufords mother, Tiffany Marsh of Aurora, said her sons death is evidence that jail guards and nursing staff arent properly trained on handling mental illness. 
 
Do they not understand what disability means? Do they not understand? Marsh said. Hes just a mentally ill kid who needed help, not to die in jail. 
 
STRUGGLED AS YOUTH 
 
Beaufords challenges in life started early. 
 
Marsh, then a teenage mother, said she was in denial about the issues her family and friends saw in her newborn son. 
 
Beauford was diagnosed early on with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder at school. But a doctor later said when teachers thought his attention was drifting, Tomas had probably been suffering from multiple small-scale seizures. 
 
Beaufords emotional and behavioral issues worsened during the next several years. Hallucinations began at age 8 after he was injured by a falling windowpane. 
 
He was 12 when he had his first grand mal seizure. He was later diagnosed with epilepsy, a condition that never subsided. 
 
Despite Beaufords health problems, Marsh said he was fun-loving and kind. Generous to a fault, he held a job as a groundskeeper at the Aurora Mental Health Center, but often gave his pay away. When he was little, he liked to invent board games that he made his family play. 
 
That boy wasnt just loved, Marsh said. He was adored, and he was cherished. 
 
Marshs goal was always to keep Beauford at home. But the single mother of four had an increasingly hard time keeping track of him. At 17, he went missing for 10 days. Marsh found him at an adult care facility; he was taken there when he couldnt remember who he was. 
 
Thats when his memory started going, Marsh said. 
 
Beauford eventually was placed in a psychiatric hospital at Fort Logan, where he was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. Later he was sent to another facility in Pueblo, where doctors realized how badly he had deteriorated since his epilepsy diagnosis. 
 
They finally did the IQ test and realized he had lost 20 points on the IQ test, Marsh said. Its like watching a person with Alzheimers, except he was younger. 
 
Beaufords condition briefly improved after doctors changed his medications, but he eventually started to decline again and his seizures became more violent. 
 
When he was about 19, Marsh, initially resistant to brain surgery, eventually agreed that he should receive an implant to help assuage his seizures. The implant  a vagal nerve stimulator  cycled on and off throughout the day. He was fitted with a magnetic bracelet and taught to hold the magnet near his body when he felt a seizure coming. The device wouldnt necessarily stop seizures, but it would prevent them from snowballing into dangerous back-to-back episodes, Marsh said. 
 
Beauford, a young adult whose mental state was still in decline, spent a year living at Wheat Ridge Regional Center west of Denver in 2012. It was convenient for Marsh, but eventually Beauford started to wander again. 
 
Once, caretakers called to tell Marsh her son had wandered away and was found having a seizure on the railroad tracks. Staffers didnt think it was safe for him to stay in Wheat Ridge and suggested he transfer to the Grand Junction Regional Center, which was able to lock down residents for security. 
 
Marsh, who looked forward to a date with her son every Thursday  shopping, movies and other outings with just the two of them  reluctantly agreed. 
 
I didnt want him to go to Grand Junction because its so far from me, she said. But I didnt want him to die either. 
 
ARRESTED FOR VIOLENT BEHAVIOR 
 
Beaufords time on the Western Slope, far from his family, didnt go smoothly. He was arrested Nov. 30 after staff at the Grand Junction Regional Center reported that he was breaking facility windows by throwing chairs against them, an affidavit said. Beaufords magnetic bracelet was confiscated when he was booked at the Mesa County Jail, despite a document from the Regional Center describing the implant, the civil suit said. 
 
Beauford suffered more than one seizure during a weekend in the jail holding cell. The lawsuit suggested jail staff unsuccessfully tried to get Beauford to take his medication but never moved him from the cell. 
 
Beauford was released on bond Dec. 2 and Regional Center staff later told prosecutors not to press charges. 
 
Beauford was arrested again March 1. During this altercation, Beauford threw punches, kicks and a steel chair at other people, an affidavit for his arrest said. The report said Beauford had grabbed the buttocks of people trying to restrain him. 
 
(One victim) received no physical injuries but wanted to report the unwanted sexual contact by Tomas, who has a history of sexual assaults, the report said. Beauford was arrested on assault charges as well as a misdemeanor count of unlawful sexual contact. 
 
This time Beauford wasnt released after a weekend. He was ordered held on a $10,000 cash or surety bond, and stayed in jail. 
 
MENTAL STATE DETERIORATED 
 
Beaufords condition was poor from the day he was arrested. 
 
Jail records cited in the civil suit described him having multiple seizures during the booking process. 
 
Despite the jails past experience with Beauford and a document from the Grand Junction Regional Center describing in detail his medical needs, a deputy wrote on an intake form that Beauford had no special medical or mental health needs. 
 
His magnetic bracelet was confiscated again and Beauford again stopped taking his meds. 
 
Grand Junction defense attorney JR Davis, who took over Beaufords case two weeks after his arrest, said the 24-year-old was incoherent the first time they met in court March 17. 
 
Davis also visited Beauford in jail March 27 for 45 minutes. 
 
I tried to ask him questions about his case, Davis said. I tried to ask him questions about himself and he just maintained his downward gaze. He had spit coming out of his mouth. 
 
Davis, who filed a motion for a court-ordered mental competency evaluation the next day, said he doesnt believe anyone could have mistaken Beauford for a fully functioning adult. 
 
Marsh didnt visit her son at the jail until April 4. She noticed then that he wasnt wearing his magnetic bracelet. Beauford told her it had been taken. 
 
A staffer from the Regional Center had told Marsh earlier that two magnetic bracelets had been brought to the jail  one for Beauford and one usually worn by his caretaker. 
 
Marsh said a jail nurse she spoke to by phone after the visit assured her Beauford would get it back. 
 
According to the civil filing, though, he never did. 
 
DEATH PRECEDED BY MULTIPLE SEIZURES 
 
Beaufords medical condition rapidly deteriorated in the hours before his death April 16, 2014, the suit said. The filing described multiple instances when jail staff and nurses noted seeing Beauford having a seizure and didnt provide medication or transport him. One deputy is described seeing Beauford having a seizure on his bed and neither opening his cell door nor contacting him through the intercom. 
 
Rather than providing him with the medical attention and treatment he so desperately needed, Mr. Beauford was actively ignored, the complaint said. 
 
A deputy spotted Beauford lying on the ground in his cell with his head inside the bottom shelf of his desk at about 11:55 p.m. April 15. 
 
(The deputy) elected not to enter Mr. Beaufords cell to check on him, knock on Mr. Beaufords door, or to utilize the intercom to check on him, even though he knew that Mr. Beauford had suffered multiple seizures earlier in the night, the filing said. 
 
Twenty minutes later, the same deputy returned to Beaufords cell to check on him. When Beauford didnt move or respond to knocking or calls through the intercom, the guard asked for a nurse using a code that the filing describes as meaning the situation to which they are being called is not urgent, the civil suit said. 
 
The nurse immediately recognized that Beauford wasnt breathing and a deputy began CPR. The nurse attempted to use an automated external defibrillator on him, but Beauford was already dead. 
 
A case report filed by the Mesa County Sheriffs Office  which includes accounts from the nurse that night, Renee Workman, and two night shift deputies on duty when Beauford died, Peter Dalrymple and Richard Perkinson  confirms much of the detail from the civil suit. 
 
Its notable that the magnetic bracelet, key to the plaintiffs lawsuit, isnt mentioned once in the Sheriffs Office case report. 
 
Deputy Perkinsons account in the report is particularly significant. He recounts how at one point, while checking Beauford in his cell, he dismisses shaking and grunting under a blanket by Beauford as masturbation. 
 
An investigator later in the report reminds, Deputy Perkinson confirmed he was aware of Mr. Beaufords seizures, as he was present when Beauford was first booked, and experiencing seizures during the process. 
 
SEEKING REFORMS 
 
Marsh said she has been trying to put her life back together since her sons death. She planned to speak Jan. 21 about her son at the Womens March on Washington. 
 
In April 2016, Marsh filed a lawsuit naming as defendants Mesa County, former Mesa County Sheriff Stan Hilkey, Correct Care Solutions and a number of deputies and nurses who had contact with Beauford. The suit alleges that county and medical staff violated his 14th Amendment rights by failing to provide medical care and treatments and by depriving Beauford of his life without due process. It also claims they violated the federal Americans with Disabilities Act by discriminating against Beauford based on his disabilities. 
 
The suit, which is seeking unspecified damages, is ongoing and parties are next due in federal court in Grand Junction Feb. 9. 
 
Marsh said she doesnt understand why, after being told about the importance of his magnetic bracelet, jail staff didnt return it to Beauford. 
 
That was a matter of life and death, and it proved to be so, she said. 
 
Marsh said Mesa County needs to reform the way it treats mentally ill people who are crossways with the law. She said the jail nurses shouldnt have taken no for an answer with giving her son medication. 
 
She said arrestees with severe disabilities should be brought before a judge more quickly for a mental status hearing. 
 
You cant keep people like that in jail, she said. A lot of these people are too fragile to be incarcerated.</TEXT>
