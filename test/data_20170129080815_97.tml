<content type="str">Gerindra Party chairman Prabowo Subianto is scheduled to attend the first mass campaign event of Jakarta gubernatorial candidate pair Anies Baswedan and Sandiaga Uno at Soemantri Brodjonegoro Sports Stadium on Jl. HR Rasuna Said, South Jakarta, on Sunday. 
 
Hundreds of Anies-Sandiaga supporters have flocked to the stadium since early morning. It will be the first Anies-Sandiaga campaign event attended by Prabowo, whose party Gerindra, together with the Justice and Prosperous Party (PKS), have endorsed the pair. 
 
PKS chairman Muhammad Shohibul Iman is also scheduled to be at the event in which it is estimated 15,000 supporters will attend. 
 
“ Pak Prabowo, Pak Shohibul Iman and other PKS executive members will be present,” Jakarta chapter PKS chairman Syakir Purnomo told reporters. 
 
Anies and Sandiaga are scheduled to campaign in five different places on Sunday but the main event will be at the stadium. 
 
Syakir said only Sandiaga would attend the event at Soemantri stadium because Anies would be campaigning in other places. 
 
Anies and Sandiaga would appear together in the next mass campaign event scheduled for Feb. 5, 10 days before voting day on Feb. 15, he added. (ebf)
