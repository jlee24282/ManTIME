<content type="str">WORCESTER - Winning every game was probably not among the original set of plans Missy Traversi established upon taking over the women&apos;s basketball program at Adelphi University.

Coming close, though? It&apos;s every coach&apos;s dream, and at least through Saturday&apos;s game, Traversi was living it.

&quot;We have all the keys to be successful - our support staff, our athletes, our academic advising, we have every piece of the puzzle to be successful,&quot; the former Bishop Feehan High School standout said Saturday. &quot;In that respect I&apos;m not surprised because of everything around me, but how well the girls have taken to my coaching and their collective buy-in has been a pleasant surprise.&quot;

There are always pitfalls along the way, and Traversi&apos;s team hit one of them Saturday at Assumption College in Worcester, losing a 63-58 decision in overtime. Heading in, the Panthers had won 14 straight games, were 18-2 overall and had a five-game lead atop the Northeast-10 Conference&apos;s Southwest Division.

Indeed, in just her first year of coaching at the NCAA Division II level, the Attleboro native had her team ranked 14th nationally before hitting the speed bump put down by the 14-5 Greyhounds at the Laska Gymnasium.

&quot;Today, unfortunately, we took a step back,&quot; Traversi said, &quot;but I think we can learn a lot from this game. And moving forward, I expect big things from this team.&quot;

Now 34, Traversi is long removed from her playing days at Feehan, as well as at the University of Maine and in the Swedish professional league. Her coaching has also matured along the path she took from the high school ranks at Brookline, Dover-Sherborn and Attleboro and then Wheelock College.

The first thing noticed as Saturday&apos;s game begun was that Traversi is much more vocal and more animated on the sidelines than she was as the coach at Attleboro High. Not that she was a Shrinking Violet when she was coaching the Bombardiers, but coaching in the college allows a coach to be more demonstrative in barking instructions to her players, and to deliver them in a tone for the moment that&apos;s unmistakable in its intent.

Or maybe it&apos;s just because there are bigger crowds at the college level.

&quot;It&apos;s so loud out there, I have to be louder,&quot; she said.

The game did not start well for the Panthers. The guard play was sloppy, outside shots weren&apos;t falling, and Assumption&apos;s taller and more physical frontcourt was dominating the offensive rebounding. There were too many one-shot possessions to suit Traversi, who slammed her foot into the hardcourt in exasperation several times over what she perceived to be a lack of execution.

In the second quarter, things didn&apos;t get much better - and when Assumption senior guard Morgan O&apos;Brien hit two quick 3-pointers to create a 16-point lead late in the quarter, one got the sense that Adelphi&apos;s 14-game winning streak was definitely in jeopardy.

But the Panthers managed to drop in a couple of baskets in the waning minutes of the first half to trail 32-21 at the break. That was a good sign, and they carried the momentum into the third quarter with a 7-2 run over the first six minutes.

That expanded to 14-2, resulting in a brief 35-34 lead, as the Panthers&apos; defense and rebounding responded to Traversi&apos;s expectations and created a host of transition scoring opportunities. But a technical foul against senior forward Calli Balfour broke the momentum, and Assumption closed the quarter with a 6-0 run to lead 40-35 at the last stop.

The deficit was 48-43 with seven minutes left when Adelphi started playing its best basketball of the day. Defense and rebounding created offensive opportunities, and the Panthers started attacking the basket instead of passively setting up in the halfcourt.

Three straight drive-penetration jumpers by sophomore guard Niajah Morgan (game-high 16 points) put Adelphi up 49-48 with 3:10 left, and the run reached 9-0 (for a 52-48 lead) on a baseline drive by senior Sierra Clark with 1:42 to go.

But Assumption came back to tie the game twice - first on a cross-lane drive by Shayla Hubbard with 33.4 seconds left, then following Morgan&apos;s drive for a 54-52 Adelphi lead with 9.3 seconds left, on a jumper by Kelly Carey with 7.2 ticks left to force the extra session.

Adelphi led once in overtime, on a foul-line jumper by Morgan with 4:40 left. But Assumption&apos;s Hubbard answered in the paint with 3:17 to go, and a 3-pointer by Carey with 1:47 left put the home team in front to stay.

The loss notwithstanding, Traversi&apos;s players respond to her as if they&apos;ve played for her for years - impressive, in that only one, former Bishop Feehan standout and starting forward Sierra Schrader of Hopedale, is on the roster and knew who she was.

&quot;We have a pretty fantastic chemistry going on right now,&quot; Traversi said. &quot;We understand that anything that comes out of my mouth is for the betterment of the team. We&apos;re all trying to do the same thing, which is to win.

&quot;And today, we did our very, very best,&quot; she added. &quot;Assumption, they came out and they responded. We had our moments, and they had theirs, and that&apos;s what&apos;s great about this game.&quot;

Traversi hasn&apos;t entirely lost touch with her roots as she builds a successful program on Long Island; next year, local hoop stars Julia Strachan of Attleboro and Emily Miccile of Bishop Feehan will be joining the Panthers&apos; ranks.

But that&apos;s long way away. For any college basketball coach, the here and now is the most important thing.

&quot;Since we started the season, it&apos;s been very much about a climb, and being on that mountain together, taking it one possession at a time and one game at a time,&quot; Traversi said. &quot;And that hasn&apos;t changed. Right now it&apos;s about Pace (University, Wednesday at Adelphi), and after Pace, it&apos;s going to be about the next opponent. We just need to continue to get better and learn from games like this.&quot;
