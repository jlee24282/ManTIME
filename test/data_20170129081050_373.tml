Opie Bosson has steered Melody Belle to an upset win in the $1 million Karaka Million at Ellerslie, New Zealand&apos;s richest race for two-year-olds. 

Although she was paying upwards of $30 on the tote, Melody Belle had the 1200m-race in her control from the top of the straight and held off equal favourite Hasahalo, ridden by Sydney&apos;s Blake Shinn, by 1-1/4 lengths. 

Raced by Te Akau Racing and Fortuna Bloodstock, Melody Belle had been stakes placed at her second start but finished eighth in her lead-up race won by Felton Road who finished third on Sunday. 

&quot;It was a lovely ride by Opie but illustrates in these big races just how important a good draw (3) can be,&quot; Jamie Richards, who trains in partnership with Stephen Autridge said. 

&quot;Last time she drew the outside and we got taken off the track. The blinkers went on this time and she galloped beautifully on Tuesday so we were really happy.&quot; 

The other equal favourite Padraig, ridden by Hugh Bowman, finished sixth after getting a long way back early. 

The day was still a success for the leading Sydney jockey who rode two winners on the program.</TEXT>
