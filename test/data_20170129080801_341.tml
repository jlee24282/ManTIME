<TITLE>Local health officials discuss possible Affordable Care Act repeal</TITLE>
<TEXT>Tens of thousands of Humboldt County residents face losing health care coverage while millions of dollars could be lost to North Coast care providers if the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, is repealed without an adequate replacement, according to health and policy officials. 
 
Who stands to lose? Lots of people, whether they know it or not, Nadereh Pourat, research director for the UCLA Center for Health Policy, said. 
 
At least 6,200 Humboldt County residents could lose their government-subsidized insurance policies under Covered California with another 18,400 residents potentially losing low-income health care coverage under the acts expanded Medi-Cal program, according to the Humboldt County Department of Health & Human Services. 
 
The loss of these Medi-Cal patients would result in significant reductions in government reimbursements for the clinics, hospitals and providers that serve them. 
 
We potentially have thousands of people that have coverage under this expansion that could potentially lose it, North Coast Clinics Network Executive Director Tim Rine said. Those individuals would now become uninsured, and our mission at our health centers is we see people regardless of their ability to pay. On the business side that means we wouldnt get reimbursed for those services. People arent going to stop getting sick if they lose their insurance. 
 
The scope of this impact locally would be far-reaching, officials stated, affecting mental health treatment, drug addiction services, the criminal justice system and access to health care not only for low-income patients, but also for those with private and employee-based insurance plans. 
 
DHHS Legislative and Policy Manager Nancy Starck said Humboldt County would have to bear the brunt of costs for treating uninsured individuals as it is the health care provider of last resort under state law. 
 
Starck said the reduction in Medi-Cal reimbursements would likely cut funds for preventative care programs and lead to an increase in reactive care treatment in emergency rooms and the countys mental health hospital Sempervirens. 
 
That is a much more expensive form of health care than doing the preventative work, Starck said. ... A lot of our services are geared to the most vulnerable people in our community and the most low-income who do not stand to benefit from repeal. 
 Repeal and replace?  
President Donald Trump has called for a replacement plan to be implemented immediately after the repeal of the Affordable Care Act takes place to prevent an estimated 20 million people from losing their insurance. But details on this plan have been scant as Congressional Republicans work to craft a plan that could accomplish Trumps goal of insurance for everybody. 
 
 
Within hours of taking the oath of office, Trump signed an executive order calling for the prompt repeal of the 2010 health care law. 
 
The order gives federal agencies the ability cease issuing regulations to expand the laws reach and allows them to grant waivers, delays or exemptions to provisions of the law that would impose costs to states or individual people. This would include the nearly $700 fee that is imposed on people who do not carry insurance as is required under the act. 
 
According to the Associated Press, this order will likely not have any impact this year due to government rules for this year having already been placed into contracts with insurance companies. 
 
Trump stated in an interview with The Washington Post earlier this month that the replacement plan would provide insurance for everybody. 
 
In an effort to reduce federal spending, Trumps advisers have stated the proposed replacement plan would alter the national health care program Medicaid for low-income individuals. 
 
Currently, the federal government pays states an agreed upon percentage of the states Medicaid costs. Trumps plan would instead send states a fixed amount of money each year in the form of block grants  an idea advocated by congressional Republicans in past years. 
 
Eureka-based Dr. Michael Fratkin of Resolution Care said this change would cause providers to restrict how they can spend their reimbursements, which he said will mostly affect the most vulnerable, the most sick and the most poor people. 
 
That will severely constrain our ability to pay for peoples health care, he said. So people will be hurt. Poor people will be excluded from high value, high class interventions. Rich people will get what they want. 
 
Trump also stated he wants the plan to retain other protections, such as requiring insurers to cover individuals with pre-existing conditions. Two Republican senators introduced what is expected to be one of many replacement plan proposals, which they said would allow states like California to keep the Affordable Care Act provisions if they choose or take part in a new program with reduced coverage. 
 
If states decide against keeping Obamas statute, the senators proposal would let them adopt a program that charges consumers a high deductible and helps cover some basic medical services like emergency care and prescriptions. 
 
Insurers would not be allowed to refuse coverage to people with pre-existing medical conditions, and money states would get under existing law would instead go to patients in the form of a tax-advantaged health savings account theyd use to pay for care. 
 Local impacts  
Of all the proposed changes to Obamacare, the potential elimination of the acts Medicaid expansion would have the largest impact locally. 
 
The expansion allowed nearly 1.5 million more Californians to become eligible for the states Medicaid program, known as Medi-Cal, by eliminating age and disability qualifications and basing coverage eligibility solely on income, according to Starck. 
 
Currently, more than 52,600 county residents are covered under Medi-Cal, with 18,400 or nearly 39 percent of them becoming eligible after the Medi-Cal expansion, Starck said. 
 
Fratkin works to provide quality of life care for patients with serious or sometimes terminal illnesses. The majority of his patients are covered under Medi-Cal, the Medicare health care program for seniors, or an insurance policy from Covered California  the states health insurance exchange. 
 
Having insurance coverage that gives them access to available resources, particularly for cancer care, saves lives and extends lives, Fratkin said. In the absence of that, theyll get to decide whether to buy their medicine or to buy their food. 
 
The three clinic corporations in Humboldt, Del Norte and Trinity counties in North Coast Clinics Network  which includes Open Door Community Health  stand to lose millions of dollars due to the potential loss of Medi-Cal reimbursements, according to Rine. 
 
While the actual cost is still being worked out, Rine said these losses could impact services for all of their patients of whom only 43 percent are covered under Medi-Cal. 
 
If you remove one of the funding streams, you destabilize the infrastructure and access for all of us, he said. Its not about this population but the destabilization of access to everyone. 
 
North Coast Assemblyman and Assembly Health Committee Chairman Jim Wood (D-Healdsburg) said the state faces losing anywhere from $0 to $21 billion depending on how the repeal and replacement proceeds. 
 
Honestly, at this point, it appears that the federal government holds the fate of the Affordable Care Act in California in their hands, Wood said. ... Were obviously very concerned. 
 
The Medi-Cal expansion particularly benefitted single adults, which is a profile that applies to many criminal offenders, according to county Chief Probation Officer Bill Damiano. He said the expansion has allowed these offenders to access critical drug addiction treatment, mental health services and general health care services that werent available prior to the Affordable Care Act. 
 
Obviously if a repeal happened, we could potentially lose that, which would be a shame because those kinds of services are helping to stabilize our criminal offenders in the community, Damiano said. If the federal dollars arent paying for us to provide these services, the county will be paying for it. The burden will fall somewhere. I sure hope the Legislature thinks about the potential impacts because they could be quite extreme and have lots of unintended consequences. 
 
Local hospitals would also have to bear significant costs if Medicaid payments are reduced or eliminated due to them having to absorb the cost of uncompensated care associated with these newly uninsured individuals who need and receive hospital care, according to a December 2016 study submitted to the Federation of American Hospitals and the American Hospital Association. 
 
The studys model found that between 2018 and 2026, loss of Medicaid coverage would result in hospitals losing $165.8 billion with another $289.5 billion being lost if Medicare reductions are implemented. 
 
Even with the Affordable Care Act in place, Providence St. Joseph Health Communications and Marketing Coordinator Arianne Aryanpur said the organization still spends hundreds of millions of dollars each year caring for uninsured or underinsured patients. 
 
We hope that as Congress considers changes to the ACA, it will protect the newly insured and prevent disruptions in patient care, she wrote in an email to the Times-Standard. Our health system intends to have an active role in these conversations and to be a voice for those we serve, especially the poor and vulnerable. 
 Who benefits?  
The Affordable Care Act has placed financial strain on some businesses due to insurance premiums increasing at an average rate of about 15 percent each year since it took effect, according to Jeff Pauli, owner and general manager of Pauli-Harbour Insurance Inc. and Anderson Robinson Starkey Insurance Agency. 
 
Employers with 50 or more full-time employee equivalents are required under the Affordable Care Act to provide an affordable health plan, which means the employees insurance premium cannot exceed about 10 percent of their gross income, Pauli said. 
 
Pauli said these plans are common locally despite there being few large employers. 
 
There are so many fees and taxes and mandates in a health insurance plan that drive the rates up and its on the backs of the employer to provide coverage, Pauli said, explaining the impacts on businesses. Even if youre a small employer, you have to offer benefits to be competitive which most do and its very expensive. 
 
Pauli said there is also a family glitch in the Affordable Care Act in which an employees dependents  who are not children  are unable to sign up for government subsidized health insurance through Covered California if the employee is signed on to their employers affordable insurance plan. 
 
Pauli said this leaves dependents out to dry as their only options are to either purchase private insurance or to sign on to the employees group insurance plan, for which they would be required to pay 100 percent of their premium. 
 
They are driving employers and employees to go on a plan that would cost them more money than they could get otherwise, Pauli said. 
 
Still, others state that the impacts of repealing the Affordable Care Act far outweigh the benefits. 
 
Its important that people understand what they stand to lose, UCLA Center for Health Policys Nadereh Pourat said. People think that Its not going to impact me. But it could really impact everyone.
