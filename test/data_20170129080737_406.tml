<TITLE>Thanks to all who helped me</TITLE>
<TEXT>I POPPED into Knowles to get a cooked chicken last Thursday, 12 January at 6.30pm. As it had been so hot that day, I left my window open about six inches as I stopped at the Crompton Street robot.

I thought I was being vigilant as I watched in my side-view mirror, ready to wind my window up should anyone approach me. I was hit so fast by three apparent Whonga addicts that I did not see them coming from the Post Office area.

They immediately whipped my car keys out turning off my ignition.

One had his hands at my throat demanding my cellphone and grabbing at the precious ring on my chain from my late husband. Another grabbed my left hand and tried to forcefully remove my wedding ring.

At that moment I called on the name of my Lord and Saviour, Jesus, to help me. I was impressed to wind the window up as high as possible although the hands were still at my throat.

Glancing behind me I saw the road had been kept clear for me and that there was an incline. I released my hand brake and put the car in neutral, which caused it to begin rolling backwards and I was saved.

To the young detective from Pinetown murder and robbery squad who rushed to assist me on his way home from gym, and chased after the addicts under the railway bridge  my deepest thanks for your kindness and care towards me.

To the Christian Indian woman who stopped to pray with me and found my precious ring, May God bless you.

To the young man who came to help me move my car, your mom raised you so well.

Thanks to all from a blessed granny.</TEXT>
