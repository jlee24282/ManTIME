&quot;What I have gathered so far is he did not report for team activities in the morning, so people started looking for him and eventually he was found to have been passed away in his room,&quot; Amitabh Choudhary, joint secretary of the Board of Control for Cricket in India, told Sportstar. &quot;I have asked Professor Shetty (Ratnakar Shetty) to visit the site and keep me updated.&quot; 
 
Sawant had worked with the Afghanistan cricket team before joining the National Cricket Academy in Bangalore. His most recent assignments were with the India A team, which is coached by Rahul Dravid . Sawant worked with the team during their two warm-up matches against England and with the Rest of India squad for the Irani Cup tie against Ranji Trophy champions Gujarat.
