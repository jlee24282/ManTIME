<TITLE>Fiji Fights Gallantly Despite Losing To South Africa</TITLE>
<TEXT>The Vodafone Fijian 7s fought gallantly despite losing 26-5 to South Africa in the Wellington 7s final tonight . 
 
The Vodafone Fijian started well when winger Joeli Lutumailagi sped past Seabelo Senatla to score in the corner with Osea Kolinisau missing the conversion. 
 
Strong Fijian defence saw forward Setareki Bituniyata being shown the yellow card for a dangerous tackle. 
 
With a man down, South Africa took advantage of the situation with a try to Senatla, which was converted for a 7-5 lead. 
 
In the second half it was all South Africa as they ran in tries to extend their lead.
