<content type="str">Our new president gave one of the shortest inaugural speeches in American history. I’d say that’s not a bad start. Nobody paid much attention to the content of his message, so lost we all got in the endless back-and-forth about the size of his audience. Well, enough already. If you can’t say what you want to say in 15 minutes, you might just as well sum it up in a Tweet, which would be shorter by at least seven words and take only a twelfth of the time to read off the teleprompter. 
 
It’s a pretty well known fact that our first president, George Washington, orated for precisely two minutes on his, and they named the whole city after him. Poor William Henry Harrison went on for an hour and three quarters. He spoke in a raging snowstorm, and died of pneumonia a month later. I see no record that the media of his day second-guessed either the length of his speech or his choices of outdoor clothing. 
 
I always liked the story about Woodrow Wilson. One member of his cabinet, perhaps kissing up to the big boss, congratulated him on the brevity of his addresses, and asked how long it took him to write them. “It depends,” the president told him, “If I’m to speak for 10 minutes, I need a week for preparation; if 15 minutes, three days; if half an hour, two days; if an hour, I’m ready now.” 
 
The words people seem to listen for most are, “I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the office of the President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.” When 
 
Richard Nixon heard the address by John Kennedy, the man who had just defeated him, he remarked to one of JFK’s aides, “I wish I had said some of those things.“ 
 
The aide asked, “What part? The part about ‘ask not what your country can do for you’?&quot; 
 
“No,” Nixon, not noted for his humor said, “The part that starts, “I do solemnly swear ... ” 
 
President Trump showed himself to be nothing if not consistent. As always, he repeated sentences he personally liked. Are they up there on the teleprompter, I wonder, or is he able to remember them for the two seconds they remain on the screen? 
 
Some critics (the ones who were able to tear themselves away from the prolonged discussions about the crowd size) suggested the address lacked poetry and didn’t soar in the manner of many of his predecessors. 
 
That put me in mind of an experiment by Mike Royko, the late great columnist for the Chicago Trib. He fed Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address into a computer programmed to critique writing by analyzing “stylistic errors.” To Abe’s opening line, “Fourscore and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal,” the unimpressed robot sniffed, “Long sentences can be difficult to read and understand. Consider revising so that no more than one complete thought is expressed in each sentence.” In other words, “Where’s the window dressing, you hack?” 
 
I could see the president was itching to put the speech behind him and get on with making America great again. Making America great again. (He says almost everything twice just in case you missed it the first time. If you took away those repetitions, I guess he may have spoken only seven and a half minutes.) Anyway, the man has been busy. His aides get calls in the middle of the night. Rumor has it they sleep in their suits. I doubt the report that his staffers all have serious cases of the bends and are being treated in a hyperbaric facility somewhere in Georgetown.
