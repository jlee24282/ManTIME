<content type="str">I am in full support of stationing lifeguards at Kua Bay and as the senior pool lifeguard at Kohala pool, an avid spear fisherman and bodysurfer, I understand the need for safety at our island beaches. 
 
Over the past 10 years as a certified LGI instructor, I have had the opportunity to train numerous people to obtain their lifeguard, first aid, CPR and AED certification through a program conducted by the County of Hawaii Aquatics Division. Every County of Hawaii senior pool lifeguard conducts these classes at least once or twice a year. 
 
Most recently, a past student and USA swim coach, Michelle Weyrick, was able to save the life of a young man at Pololu Valley beach using one of the rescue tubes that was placed on the beach by a local USA swim team, Liquid Aloha Aquatics, and a foundation. 
 
What makes Pololu so dangerous is not only its deceptive rip-current but it is only assessable by a switch back trail that takes 10 to 15 minutes to hike down. But still, if someone could go down faster, it would take precious time for EMT’s to drive from Kapaau to Pololu and respond to any kind of a rescue attempt of a distressed swimmer or active drowning victim. The victim’s only hope is to save themselves, be helped by a surfer in the vicinity or in the above case have someone lifeguard trained to save their lives. This situation has been happening for years and not something just recently. 
 
As of now, the official concern is how and where to create more parking spaces for visitors. Pololu Valley has quietly been claiming victims over the years and that will only increase with the influx of more and more visitors to the popular tourist destination point. Though noble in intent, placement of rescue tubes at isolated beaches is a good idea only if you have trained people to used them. 
 
A lifeguard stationed at Pololu Valley beach is a no-brainer. As it’s been said, “if you build it they will come,” and that’s the dilemma as more and more people will frequent a dangerous beach that has been taking lives over the years. We need a lifeguard first before a parking lot.
