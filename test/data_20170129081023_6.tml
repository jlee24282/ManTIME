During their high-octane performance of &quot; Remix ,&quot; Donnie Wahlberg deviated from the group&apos;s synchronized dance number and went into the photo pit where he danced with a few lucky fans in the front row. 
 
The group -- comprised of brothers Jordan and Jonathan Knight , Joey McIntyre ,   Wahlberg, and Danny Wood -- were introduced by actress Candace Cameron Bure , whose 30-year dream came true when NKOTB appeared on the Netflix revival, Fuller House , for a collaborative sing and dance performance of &quot; You Got It (The Right Stuff) .&quot;  
   
Ahead of their performance, NKOTB did a Facebook Live with iHeartRadio during which they played with the world&apos;s largest etch-a-sketch, remembered &apos;80s dance moves over a Simon game, signed Connect Four pieces, and talked about dating in the &apos;80s versus dating in the social media age.  
 
When Jonathan was asked to compare his past relationship with &apos;80s icon Tiffany during a time when social media was nonexistent, to Selena Gomez and The Weeknd &apos;s romance that is being chronicled 24/7 on Twitter and Instagram, he said:  &quot;I think everything back in the &apos;80s was so much easier. I mean now everywhere you go, you&apos;re being filmed, you&apos;re being watched ... Everything&apos;s on a phone and you just pull it out.&quot; 
  
NKOTB are set to headline their Total Package tour this summer featuring musical guests Boyz II Men and Paula Abdul , who will hit the road for the first time in 25 years. The trek launches on May 12 with a show at the Schottenstein Center in Columbus, Ohio and will run through July 16 with a concert at Hard Rock Live in Hollywood, Florida. 
 
The iHeart80s bill also featured Reagan-era acts including UB40 , Men at Work&apos;s Colin Hay , Starship , Eddie Money , Night Ranger , and headliner Rick Astley .
