<TITLE>Sifting through breakage from Trump's first week</TITLE>
<TEXT>Our new presidents first working week might be likened to a bull blundering into a china shop. Fragile things are at hazard and some breakage already is evident. One worries just how much damage may ensue. 
 
The executive orders are coming at a rapid, if scattershot, rate. The Affordable Care Act was up first with nothing definite, but enough to shake the insurance industry with prospects of changes presaging a steep rise in rates for less coverage. 
 
Torture and black site prisons are once again available to the CIA and the Defense Department, if they choose to use them. And Guantanamo will remain as a stain on the national conscience. President Trump also wants a congressional investigation into his fantasy of millions of illegal immigrants voting for Hillary Clinton. 
 
It was no great surprise that the oil pipeline destined one day to pollute the Midwest was given approval. What was a tad unexpected was his order to cut off all funding for cities that offer immigrants safe haven. To their great credit, dozens of mayors and Californias Gov. Jerry Brown refused to back down. 
 
Very little that the president is proposing can be affected without the cooperation of Congress. House Speaker Paul Ryan agrees with building a great wall, a beautiful wall, on our southern border at taxpayers expense. Apparently, we trust that Mexico will reimburse us with pinatas, if not in cash. 
 
I think its obvious that the Republican leadership happily will approve the wall with money they can find by eliminating Great Society and New Deal programs. The plans for that already afoot. 
 
What worries me most is that we could lose the ability to know exactly what is happening to us and the world. One can discern the outline of a grand strategy making shape in some discreet changes which recently came to light. 
 
We are told that certain agencies are to cease contact with the public; no exchange of information or press releases. Its uncertain whether or not this is a blanket order or concentrated on the EPA and other departments which some of Trumps allies find bothersome. 
 
Coupled with this is an alarming change in the Voice of America, the international radio network set up after World War II to connect with other nations in their own language. About a year ago, it finally was made available to American listeners. 
 
In the omnibus bill which Obama had to sign to keep the government going, there was a provision which changed the structure of the VOA. It had been managed by an independent board of broadcast specialists. That board was eliminated in favor of a CEO appointed by the president. 
 
The obvious fear is that what has served as an independent source of information could very well become an instrument of propaganda for the television personality who would love to have his own broadcast system. 
 
I have not tried to delve deeply into this stuff as I am distracted just now by other concerns and, frankly, I am past any real involvement in political action. Age and its attendant inconveniences have a way of asserting themselves when the spirit suggests donning armor and re-entering the fray. 
 
A friend who took part in one of the many womens marches wrote of her experience: It was gratifying to be among the women, men, children, whole families, white-haired grannies, people in wheelchairs and walkers, various colors and shades, Christians, Muslims, Jews, all in solidarity against No. 45 and his ilk. All sentient people need to put their angry wigs on over their thinking caps and save America. 
 
Well, I could use a wig, but marching is not an option these days, so I read, watch and wonder.
