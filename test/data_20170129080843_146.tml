<content type="str">These tasty tarts take less than an hour to make from start to finish, with 40 minutes of that time being in the baking. This means you can pop them in the oven, pour yourself a glass of wine and sit back and relax while the flaky pastry bakes to perfection. 
 
INGREDIENTS 
 
Makes 4 tarts 
 4 ripe peaches, quartered  2/3 cup balsamic vinegar  1 tablespoon honey  2 sheets frozen puff pastry, thawed  1/2 cup + 2 tablespoons basil pesto  220g boneless, skinless chicken tenders (omit to make vegetarian)  85g prosciutto (omit to make vegetarian)  115g gorgonzola cheese, crumbled  2 cups fresh arugula  225g buffalo mozzarella or mozzarella, torn  1/2 cup pumpkin seeds, toasted  fresh basil, for serving  balsamic glaze for serving  
INSTRUCTIONS 
 
Preheat the oven to 200 degrees C. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. 
 
Place the peaches on one of the prepared baking sheet and toss with the balsamic and honey. Place in the oven and begin roasting. The peaches need about 40 minutes in the oven and are done when they are soft and caramelized. 
 
Lay the puff pastry flat on the remaining baking sheet and cut each piece in half. Spread about 1/2 cup of pesto on to the 4 pieces of pastry. 
 
Slice the chicken tenders in half and then toss with the remaining 2 tablespoons pesto. Evenly place the chicken and torn prosciutto over the puff pastry. If desired, sprinkle a little gorgonzola cheese overtop the pastries. Place in the oven with the peaches and bake for 25-30 minutes or until the pastry is puffed and the chicken cooked through. Remove both the peaches and tarts from the oven. 
 
Divide the peaches among the tarts. Top with fresh arugula, mozzarella and toasted pumpkin seeds. Drizzle with the balsamic glaze and a basil leaf. Eat warm!
