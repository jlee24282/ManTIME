Dyslexia is a common language-based disorder which is affecting a large number of people around the globe, making the process of reading, writing, and spelling almost unbearable . 
In Kuwait, the issue is far greater especially with the lack of awareness about Dyslexia . 
For Kuwaiti citizen Mohammad Al-Qatami Dyslexia is very personal issue due to the fact that his son suffered from this disorder . 
Traveling far and wide, Al-Qatami - also Vice Chairman of Kuwait Dyslexia Association - made it his mission to inform the populace about the problems he faced with his son &apos; s disorder, affirming that not all hope was lost . 
Speaking to KUNA, Al-Qatami revealed that the association conducted a survey in 650 schools which pointed out that some 30,000 students in Kuwait showcased some symptoms of the disorder . 
This is an alarming number, said the official who added that &quot; the survey gave us a clear idea of how to deal with Dyslexia in cooperation with various government and private bodies .&quot; Due to the enormous challenge facing Kuwait, the Association had worked effortlessly to promote the issue on the local level, said Al-Qatami who indicated that in 2005, his organization and the Ministry of Education had launched a Dyslexia-awareness program in 22 schools to enable these facilities to deal with the disorder in a friendly manner . 
Al-Qatami said that discussions with Minister of Education and Minister of Higher Education Dr. Mohammad Al-Fars will be held soon to expand the campaign to include more schools . 
On their parts, the Association official Theiya Al-Rasheed and Health Ministry pediatric consultant Dr. Nahed Abdulrazzak both affirmed that there were various ways to diagnose whether a person was suffering from the disorder . 
They also said it was paramount to treat Dyslexia in a professional manner, otherwise, the situation might get further complicated.
