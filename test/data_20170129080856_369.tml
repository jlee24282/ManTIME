<TEXT type="str">CRICKET: There&apos;s only one road connecting Rolleston to Springsure. 

The Dawson Highway, 45 minutes of bitumen linking two close town rivals. 

While the two Central mining towns share fond memories with one another, on the sporting field it&apos;s forgotten about. 

The weekend&apos;s Country Carnival in Rockhampton came down to the Rolleston Roosters and Springsure Ringers, perhaps more aptly named the Dawson Highway derby. 

Springsure might have taken the favouritism given their Central Highlands standings, but it was the Roosters who crowed the loudest. 

The side, lead by Rohan MacDonald and coached by , were ecstatic in victory. 

&quot;It is the most cricket we have played in a long time and the competition was very good,” MacDonald said at stumps on Saturday. 

&quot;We don&apos;t get to play too many other sides other than the ones in our local comp so it is a challenge to come here and go up against some new faces. 

&quot;You don&apos;t know what they will bring to the table and it&apos;s all good fun. 

&quot;There is a big rivalry with Springsure back home. A little brother type relationship, you don&apos;t want to see them lose but you definitely don&apos;t want to see them win. 

&quot;So to get up over them and beat them to the finish line is good.” 

MacDonald said the performance was a collective effort of outstanding individuals. 

&quot;It really was a range of individual efforts all weekend, no one achiever as we all chipped in at the right times,” he said. 

&quot;Boyd Schwartz scored runs, Grant Wells the same, Isaac Jones had a screamer at the top order, got us off to a flyer most innings. 

&quot;Young Darcy Hagan bowled well, Larry Farquhar and Blake Wells all stood up. And Clarry Eiles in just his second season was terrific. 

&quot;We don&apos;t head home till Monday so we will celebrate this one.” 

Carnival organiser Graham Lentell said while numbers where down, the high standard remained. 

&quot;It was just as good, the quality stayed the same and we saw some spectacular displays,” Lentell said. 

&quot;Springsure&apos;s Tom Linklater scored 115 on turf and Todd Toby from Mount Morgan made 153 on concrete. There were a few centuries across all grades. 

&quot;Hayden Busk bagged 6-9 with the ball including a hat-trick and Springsure&apos;s Duncan Geddes got 5-20 on turf. 

&quot;We have had a great three days of play.”</TEXT>
