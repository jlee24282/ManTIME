<TITLE>New recordings reveal who was really behind the ANCs war room: report</TITLE>
<TEXT>reveal that several top ANC officials had allegedly giventhe proposed war room smear campaign the go-ahead, according to a report by TheCity Press. 
 
The war room was first brought to light by public relations expert Sihle Bolani, who claims she was owed R2.2 million for work done as part of the campaign. It was specifically tasked with discrediting opposition parties, and pushing pro-ANC propaganda. 
 
While the war room would have no official links to Luthuli House, it would establish a publication (The New South African) and talk shows featuring stories of ANC successes, while using so-called influencers online to shift public discourse. 
 
In response, both the ANC and activist Shaka Sisulu, the other alleged war room architect, tried to distance the party from the campaign. 
 
Their activities were not sanctioned by the ANC.We distance ourselves [from] any insinuation that any such campaign was known to or approved by the ANC, the party said. 
 
However, recordings of the meeting on November 25, as well as two other meetings at Luthuli House, suggest that the ANC had lied about the extent of its involvement in the creation of the war room. The recordings were taken by Bolani using her smartphone unbeknownst to the other members of the meeting. 
 
The recordings show: 
 The war room was set up specifically to dig at the ANCs opponents. the EFF and DA would be the two main targets of the War room.  It had been set up to address the problemthat the public discourse (in South Africa) was run by white capital.  The initial R50 million budget was correct and not as Sisulu had claimed, a figment of someones imagination.  The recordings implicate minister in the presidency Jeff Radebe as the main orchestrator of the War room.All War room reports were reportedly handed over directly to him.  The recordings also point to the direct involvement of two senior ANC officials  Joseph Nkadimeng and Ingnatius Jacobs who both heard speaking in the recordings.  Jacobs (who chaired the meeting) was well aware of the War roombut concerned that money from ANC donors may have been misspent.  Jacobs held meetings with War room members during the campaign to get feedback, but became frustrated when he did not see the desired results.  
Jacobs has subsequently denied all allegations of impropriety against him his attorney, Mfana Gwala, said in a letter to City Press. In addition he had instructed them to pursue a case of defamation against Bolani. Our client has also written to the ANC leadership and indicated to them that he is prepared to subject himself to an investigation and disciplinary process. 
 
The following report can be found in the 29 January 2017 edition of the City Press.
