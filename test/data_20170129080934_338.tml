<TEXT type="str">A Chinese New Year horoscope has predicted a &quot;favourable&quot; year for Labour leader Andrew Little, particularly in his career. 
   The left-leaning parties are determined to change the government later this year.

As the election approaches he told supporters at today&apos;s state of the nation speech in Auckland that he hopes it, and a prediction that Prime Minister Bill English&apos;s luck will decline in September, are correct. 
   
The speech was the first time Labour and the Green Party have joined forces for a state of the nation, a move both parties say is reaffirming their commitment to work together to change the government. 
   
Unsurprisingly the housing crisis dominated Mr Little&apos;s speech. 
   
&quot;We&apos;ve solved housing crises before. Labour has built houses before. We&apos;ve done it before and we&apos;ll do it again,&quot; Mr Little said to rousing cheers from a room full of party faithful. 
   
He also committed to reversing health cuts, protecting the environment and creating a better future for the next generation for Kiwis through improved wages and an end to poverty. 
   
&quot;We are ready to win, we are ready to go. We are ready to build that better New Zealand. Today we are ready to lead the next government of New Zealand,&quot; he said. 
   
Mr Little said anyone who had climbed the ladder of opportunity had to keep it there for those who follow. 
   
&quot;That&apos;s the Kiwi way. That&apos;s what we do,&quot; he said. 
   
&quot;That means giving a damn every time.&quot; 
   
Those were sentiments shared by Green Party co-leader Metiria Turei who revealed she was inspired by &quot;mana wahine, fierce women, women who stand up for what they believe in&quot;. 
   
She honoured activists Helen Kelly and Jeanette Fitzsimons who pursued meaningful change when the odds were against them. 
   
&quot;The Green Party will do what&apos;s right, even when it&apos;s not easy,&quot; Ms Turei vowed. 
   
&quot;We have the skills, knowledge and values to help shape Aotearoa; to make our great little country even better.&quot;

Ms Turei said she would draw inspiration from women who were activists, solo and working mothers, women who protect their whanau from violence and &quot;the women who raised me and who I have raised&quot;. 
   
Mr Little will also draw from his personal life, including his battle with prostate cancer. 
   
&quot;It made me think about seizing opportunities, about making the best of this life,&quot; he said. 
   
&quot;I&apos;ve faced tough fights before and this is simply one tough fight we have to win,&quot; he later added. 
   
Both also took moments to criticise Mr English. 
   
Ms Turei described him as the &quot;architect of the housing crisis&quot;, while Mr Little took aim at his decision not to attend Waitangi Day commemorations at Te Tii Marae next week. 
   
He claimed while New Zealand got a new prime minister last year the nation was still without a leader. 
   
Labour and the Green Party signed a memorandum of understanding last year, committing to work together in the lead up to this year&apos;s election. 
   
No date has been set but it&apos;s expected to be in the latter half of the year, with September 23 thrown up as a possible date. 
   
Mr English is expected to announce the date as early as next week.</TEXT>
