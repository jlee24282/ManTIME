<content type="str">Yui Kamiji won her first Australian Open women&apos;s wheelchair singles title on Jan. 28, bouncing back after losing the first set to defeat top seed Jiske Griffioen of the Netherlands in three sets. 
 
The 22-year-old Kamiji has won the women&apos;s wheelchair doubles title in all four Grand Slam events, but she had never won the singles crown at the Australian Open. She also has won the singles crown at the French Open and the U.S. Open. 
 
&quot;I finally got it,&quot; she said of her Australian Open triumph. &quot;I played with the feeling that if I don&apos;t take it now, there was no telling when I could win it.&quot; 
 
Kamiji dropped the first set in a tiebreak to Griffioen, who took the gold at the Rio Paralympics in the women&apos;s wheelchair singles. 
 
However, Kamiji never gave up hope, feeling that she was playing well. 
 
After taking the second set, 6-3, Kamiji stormed back in the deciding set down 1-3 to win the next five games and close out the match. 
 
Kamiji is now working on a new serve and shot she hopes will be key weapons as she sets her sights on the Tokyo Paralympics in three years. 
 
&quot;Although I have won the title here, there are still many things I have to do,&quot; she said. &quot;I want to practice more after returning home so I can become a player who continues to win.&quot; 
 
In the short term, Kamiji is seeking to regain the world&apos;s No. 1 ranking, which she first held in 2014.
