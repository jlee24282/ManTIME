<TEXT type="str">The Lawton-Fort Sill Art Council will kick off its Free Children&apos;s Workshops for 2017 with a Valentine&apos;s Day Bash Saturday at The Art Center, 1701 NW Ferris. 
 
The council did not host a workshop in January in order to get its bearings, according to President D&apos;esirae Schneider. It will bring back the monthly workshops starting Saturday, and children will be able to create homemade Valentine&apos;s Day cards and gifts along with Valentine&apos;s Day themed crafts. 
 
The workshops are for those who are old enough to hold a paintbrush, according to Schneider. Parents are asked to stay with their children for the duration of the workshop, which lasts from 10 a.m. to noon the first Saturday of each month. Schneider believes the workshop is a good time for parents to take a break from their busy lives, slow down and spend time with their children. 
 
&quot;It&apos;s two hours  come in, away from the hustle and bustle,&quot; Schneider said. &quot;Forget you have laundry. Forget you have to go grocery shopping or work on the car. Lose yourself in your kids and their imagination. It&apos;s so cool to watch their little minds work.&quot; 
 
She also believes the workshops are a moment for children to get back to using their imaginations. 
 
&quot;They&apos;re kind of told what to do everyday, and it&apos;s nice for them to come and paint a tree blue and the sky purple,&quot; Schneider said. &quot;The workshop lets them use their creativity and imagination, and I think that&apos;s so important; it lets them go back to their roots and get dirty and get clay and paint on them. There&apos;s something kind of primal about it.&quot; 
 
Schneider does need volunteers for the monthly children&apos;s workshop. She asks volunteers to come 30 minutes before each workshop to help set up and to stay afterwards to help clean up. She also asks parents attending the workshop with their children to help clean around their children during the workshop.  
 
Schneider, Treasurer April Weber and the council have hosted the event for four years now, and they&apos;re happy to be able to provide an outlet for children and a way for families to spend quality time together. 
 
&quot;I&apos;ve watched these kids grow up,&quot; Schneider said. &quot;They walked in when they were 1 and now they&apos;re turning 4. It&apos;s really cool to see moms pregnant with babies and now their babies are coming in. It&apos;s a lot of fun. Sometimes the parents can&apos;t afford the supplies that we have, so it&apos;s nice to be able to provide that for them.&quot;</TEXT>
