 Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav and Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi are holding a joint press conference in Lucknow today ahead of the high stakes assembly elections that will be held in the state in seven phases starting February 11. Both the leaders have come together for the first time since the Congress and the Samajwadi Party reached a conclusion on their pre-poll alliance with an aim to bag over 300 of the state&apos;s 403 Assembly seats. Dimple Yadav, wife of the Chief Minister and a Samajwadi Party lawmaker, is expected to attend the press conference.
