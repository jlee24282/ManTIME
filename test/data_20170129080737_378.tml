BOSTON, Mass. – The New Balance Indoor Grand Prix presented a rare opportunity Saturday for Samantha Watson : a race she was not expected to win.  
 
At the Reggie Lewis Track and Athletic Center, the Rush-Henrietta NY senior mixed it up with the pros in the women&apos;s 800-meter race, capturing fourth place in 2 minutes, 3.94 seconds. Charlene Lipsey of the United States won in 2:02.01. 
 
“The plan was to get out and stay out,” Watson said. “It was fun, I was really excited, because I wasn&apos;t expected to win. It was more relaxed and I wasn&apos;t going for a record or anything, just looking for an indoor personal record, and I got one.” 
 
Watson&apos;s 800 time is No. 3 in U.S. prep history. Watson set a national high school indoor record Jan. 21 in the 600 (1:28.67) at the Section 5 vs. Section 6  –  Battle of the West Invitational at Houghton College.  
 
“That helped with my mindset,” Watson said of the 600. “I think my fitness is at a good spot right now. I&apos;m happy how my training is going.” 
 
Watson, who has yet to decide on a college, said she&apos;s making two more visits.The thought of turning professional for the senior isn&apos;t a thought quite yet. 
 
“Not yet,” Watson said. “I want to at least win an NCAA title or break 2:00 (first).” 
 
In the junior boys mile, Josh Hoey of Bishop Shanahan PA, overtook favorite DJ Principe of La Salle Academy RI to win in 4:09.26.  
 
“Just wanted to stay within reaching distance of the leader throughout the race, about two to three seconds behind, and then with 250-300 meters to go, try and challenge for the lead, and I was able to do that,” Hoey said. 
 
Principe entered Saturday&apos;s mile after posting a personal-best 4:00.97 at the New Balance Games at The Armory in New York competing Jan. 21 against professionals. The recovery, mixed in with illness, has made for a tougher-than-normal week, resulting in him running 4:12.34.  
 
“Certainly never pushed myself to that extreme,” Principe said.  
 
Principe will race in the second heat of the NYRR Millrose Games mile Feb. 11 at The Armory.  
 
“I think that was a really big confidence booster,” Principe said of getting so close to breaking 4:00. 
 
“I was hesitant to get up toward the front of the group at the race last week, and looking back at it now, I wonder what would have happened if I had been a little more aggressive in the first two laps.” 
 
In the girls junior mile, Jackie Gaughan of Exeter NH won in 4:52.57. 
 
Gaughan, a junior, is coming off a breakout cross country season that saw her finish runner-up at the Foot Locker Northeast Regional and 11th at the Foot Locker National Championships.  
 
“The atmosphere here is a lot like some of the championship meets, I think that helped,” Gaughan said.  
 
Known more for long-distance performances, the mile was a bit of uncharted territory for Gaughan.   
 
“Yeah, the last lap I was like, &apos;Oh my gosh, I&apos;m in first.&apos; And I was just trying to stay where I was,” she said.</content>
