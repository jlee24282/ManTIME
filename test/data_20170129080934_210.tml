<content type="str">Just days after praising his relationship with Democrats, Republican Gov. Charlie Baker backed them into a corner and gave their opponents a powerful election issue by vetoing pay raises for legislative leaders.

Democrats in the Legislature dutifully approved the $18 million pay raises in near record time last week, despite budget woes that have resulted in cuts to services such as those for opiate addiction.

Baker had said in advance he would not take a raise for himself, but legislative leaders badly wanted them.

The governor was largely quiet on whether he would approve raises as they were sailing through the House and Senate, but then announced Thursday night he would veto them.

Of course, the veto will be overturned because rank-and-file Democrats - at least most of them - would never dare buck their leadership.

But, Baker&apos;s action brings more attention to the issue and means the Democrats have to take one more uncomfortable vote on the override.

The move helps Baker shore up support from the right wing of his party, which often complains he is too squishy on issues important to them.

It also gives any Republican running for state Legislature next year against a Democrat an axe handle to pummel his or her opponent with.

The Democrats will be left trying to explain why their leaders deserve a 40- percent raise.

Of course, state Rep. Paul Heroux, D-Attleboro, who tends to be a bit of a maverick on Beacon Hill, was one of the few Democrats who voted against the raises.

His move could be seen as a vote of conscience, or an attempt to booster his re-election credentials.

But, there is also the very real possibility that he felt free to tick off his leadership one more time before he runs for mayor and no longer has to worry about what they think.

Elsewhere in politics

* Newton Mayor Setti Warren, a possible Democratic candidate for governor, saw the trouble with the legislative pay raises passed this week.

First he urged Baker to veto them. Then he called on Democrats to sustain the veto.

* U.S. Rep. Joseph Kennedy III, D-Brookline, looks like he is trying to raise his profile across the state. He made four appearances last week rallying support to save Obamacare. Three of them were outside his congressional district.

* Most of the opposition to Gov. Charlie Baker&apos;s proposal to tax businesses that do not provide enough health care to their employees came for groups that are usually solidly in his corner, such as Associated Industries of Massachusetts and National Federation of Independent Businesses.

Of course, it was equally unusual for the pro-business governor to ask his allies to pony up more to fund MassHealth, the state&apos;s subsidized health care program.
