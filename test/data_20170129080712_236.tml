<TEXT type="str">Bollywood stars are all about working really hard and then having some fun. While for most of then, fun means partying, chilling and boozing with friends, for few of our B’town stars, fun is devoid of any alcohol. 
 
The glamour and film industry is perceived one where its stars are thought to be indulgent and living in excesses. While this could be true, there are a handful of Bollywood stars who self-admittedly live a &quot;clean&quot; life and stay away from alcohol and other vices. 
 
The first name that comes in our mind, when we talk of this, is Deepika Padukone. The actress, who is currently basking in the success of her first Hollywood venture, keeps alcohol at bay, and believes in unwinding, without getting drunk. The fitness freak rather prefers travelling or spending time with family, when on a break.
