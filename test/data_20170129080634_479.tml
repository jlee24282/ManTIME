<TEXT type="str">CLASSICO MANUFACTURE

Dubai, UAE, January 29, 2017: At this year&apos;s prestigious Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie in Geneva, Switzerland, Ulysse Nardin is highlighting its unique savoir-faire in the fine craft of enameling. As part of a closer look at this lost decorative art, Ulysse Nardin will launch a new edition Classico Manufacture with a blue &apos;Grand Feu&apos; enamel dial.

The timepiece upholds the three fundamentals upon which Ulysse Nardin has built its reputation as a mechanical watchmaker: independent manufacturing, rare craftsmanship and an unceasing quest for innovation.

This Classico Manufacture is powered by the self-winding UN-320 caliber, a movement entirely designed and produced in-house by the Swiss manufacture. It incorporates the celebrated silicium hairspring and anchor es-capement, also designed and manufactured in-house. In fact, Ulysse Nardin pioneered the use of silicium parts in mechanical watchmaking, being the first to identify the advanced material&apos;s potential for improved precision and durability before others followed suit.

The second pillar of Ulysse Nardin&apos;s unique savoir-faire is evident in the artistry of the &apos;Grand Feu&apos; enamel dial. Created by the Ulysse Nardin company, Donzé Cadrans, specialists in the fine art of enameling, this &apos;Grand Feu&apos; enamel dial is a stunning blue. Only a handful of craftsmen have the necessary skill to master this 17th-century technique, and the blue dial of the Classico Manufacture &apos;Grand Feu&apos;, with its delicately translucid quality, is a fi-ne example of this challenging art.

The UN-320 movement and &apos;Grand Feu&apos; enamel dial are set in a chic 40 mm stainless-steel case with a leather strap. The overall effect is one of streamlined simplicity: the hour and minute hands point to classic roman numer-al indexes, completed with a small seconds counter at 6 o&apos;clock. Within lies a round date window: the wearer can easily set the date forwards or backwards, an incredible achievement for a mechanical watch.

With a competitive price point, the latest edition Classico Manufacture &apos;Grand Feu&apos; is a more accessible expression of Ulysse Nardin&apos;s DNA: craftsmanship rooted in tradition, and savoir-faire anchored in innovation.
