Lorin O’Rear was crowned 2017 Miss Walker County Outstanding Teen on Saturday. 
 
Six contestants participated in the pageant at Bevill State Community College’s Rowland Hall. 
 
O’Rear is a student at Walker/ Jasper High School and is the daughter of Griff O’Rear and Melissa O’Rear. 
 
“I wasn’t expecting to win my first pageant,” O’Rear said backstage after receiving her crown. “I was just taking the time to have fun with it — a new experience.” 
 
As part of the pageant’s talent competition, O’Rear did a vocal performance of “Don’t Rain on My Parade,” in the style of broadway, receiving loud applause from the crowd. “I sing every day. I’ll sing wherever, really. I’ve just been singing since I was a kid, and I’ve had vocal training,” O’Rear said. 
 
O’Rear is a member of the Walker High School band and Walker High School swim team, and she hopes to one day pursue a career in theatre and education. 
 
Her pageant platform is Grab the Mic. 
 
“Grab the Mic is basically implementing confidence in kids at a young age, and I think I would love to go to elementary schools ... and just talk to kids in a classroom atmosphere and definitely implement the things that I was told as a kid by my teachers, that you are great and your best is always good enough,” she said. 
 
Faith Smith of Hamilton was named People’s Choice and Natalie Robertson of Hamilton was named first runner-up. 
 
The Pilot Club of Jasper presented the pageant, which was themed “Magic Carpet Ride.” 
 
Last year’s winner, Gracey Baker, crowned O’Rear on Saturday. Miss Walker County Outstanding Teen is a preliminary for Miss Alabama and Miss America. 
 
Ansley Baker, Emma Goodwin and Morgan Trull also participated in the pageant, and Miss Walker County 2009 Caitlin Guffin Eiland served as Mistress of Ceremonies. 
 
“It is such a great program,” O’Rear said. “I’ve been watching my sister do it since I was 4, so I definitely think it’s a positive outcome and that you’re investing in your future when you do this.”</TEXT>
