<TITLE>Locals march in solidarity at the top of the world</TITLE>
<TEXT>Braving temperatures that dipped deep into the negatives and a brisk wind chill to match, residents of both Utqiavik and Kotzebue took to the streets on Saturday in solidarity with the Women's March on Washington happening more than 3,000 miles away. 
 
"I wanted to feel part of the global community of women's marchers," said Utqiavik march organizer Leslie Pierce. "For me, the march is about equality and equal rights for all. There are good reasons to be worried at this time and I need to stand up and voice my concerns as a citizen participating in the democratic process. It's my right but also my responsibility." 
 
The marches were held the day after the inauguration of President Donald Trump. While the parent event was the Women's March on Washington, there were sister events held across the country and internationally  as far north as Arctic Slope and as far south as Antarctica. 
 
In the U.S. alone, more than 3.3 million people marched in more than 500 cities. 
 
"This was about people, about everybody," said Diana Solenberger, who attended the northernmost march with her boyfriend, John Bergman. "If you're a white person, you have to stand up for the people who may not have their voices heard. This is not just about women. This is about men, women, the LGBTQ community, people of color. I think that was what made me happiest about the march. It was a very diverse group of people." 
 
Just as the people who marched came from a variety of backgrounds, the issues they were marching for ranged from the environment to women's rights to Standing Rock. 
 
"I think a lot of people have different motivations. My mom, for example, wanted only to stay positive and show support for the greater movement," said Utqiagvik marcher Sara Thomas, who is Pierce's daughter. "I wanted to show support for those now at risk of deportation, at risk of being added to a registry, at risk of losing access to basic healthcare, being more susceptible to hate crimes, but I also absolutely marched in protest of the inauguration of a man who I do not think should have ever made it to this point. Each person has their own take." 
 
The national event was officially nonpartisan and was meant to reflect the diverse identities of all who participated. Solenberger and Bergman, for example, both say this march was a break from what they would typically do. 
 
"I don't have a lot of faith in politics but [it was important] just to be a part of a group of like-minded people that share the view that we could do better for our country," Bergman said. "It felt good to be part of a movement, saying we are people, we are here, we exist." 
 
They don't consider themselves political, but saw this march encompassing much more than any kind of partisanship. 
 
"By marching with your feet and showing up and standing up, you can demonstrate that there are a lot of people who are nervous," Solenberger added. "I've never, ever gone to a protest before, but these are human rights issues, these are not political issues, these are people's issues." 
 
Many of the marchers in both Utqiavik and Kotzebue carried signs they had made at home the night before. Generations often walked together, with grandparents and grandchildren hand in hand. As the processions made their way down the street, drivers honked and shouted as they drove past. 
 
"It was an incredible and very moving event to take part in," said Griffin Hagle, one of the handful of men who marched in Utqiavik. "I was lucky enough to attend the presidential inauguration in 2009, but before yesterday, I never thought of myself as the protest type. I participated with my partner and others in the event here because I strongly believe women's problems are men's problems, especially in Alaska where the rate of rape is 250 percent the national average, and, more generally, to send a clear message that elections are never the last word in a healthy democracy. I think braving a minus 31-degree wind chill is as good a way as any to show the leaders of our government we will be watching them." 
 
In what is being called a historic turnout for a national movement, people across the country bridged the vast distances between states and communities and ideologies to walk in partnership with one another for one day. In the far reaches of the Arctic, many participants said they felt more connected to the rest of the country for a day. 
 
"It was bitter cold, but I felt warmed by the sense of solidarity and I am grateful to those who organized it," said local Utqiavik author Debby Dahl Edwardson, for whom the march was deeply rooted in current events. "I marched because I stand for love in the face of racism, sexism and intolerance. These were among the sentiments I heard voiced repeatedly by our president-elect and I do not support them, can never support them. I am proud that as an American I still have the right to stand up and voice my dissent. I pray we do not lose this right in this oppressive political climate." 
 
Over in Kotzebue, local residents came out in similarly chilling temperatures to walk along the shore. For Lucy McConnell, like Edwardson, it was the current political climate that drew her and her family out to the street. 
 
"The temperature was minus 21, or minus 51 with wind chill, and we had a good crowd show up," McConnell said. "I marched because I am a woman, I have three daughters, and I believe we are strong, resilient, and deserving of respect. When I replay the statements made by our current president in my mind, I imagine them said against me, my mother, my grandmother, my aunties, my nieces, my sisters, and my beautiful daughters. I want to march because that kind of behavior and demeaning speech is unacceptable by anyone." 
 
Regardless of the differences of beliefs, ideas, ages, or backgrounds of those who marched in both towns on Jan. 21, one sentiment seemed to tie them together. This was something they felt they just needed to do. 
 
"It was fantastic," said Solenberger. "It was one of those things. Before, yeah it was cold, yeah it was windy, but you know, if I don't go, there will come a day when I have children and they'll ask, 'Were you part of this?' And I'll say, 'Yes, yes I was.' This is going to go down in history."</TEXT>
