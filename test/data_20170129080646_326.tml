Salon 1 in Jamestown has provided the door prize for the Sassy Baggs & Beyond Blingo event. 
  
Those looking to enjoy a fun night out while supporting people with disabilities should plan to attend the Sassy Baggs & Beyond Blingo fundraiser Thursday, Feb. 2. 
 
The event will be held at The Resource Centers administrative offices at 200 Dunham Avenue in Celoron. Doors will open at 6 p.m., with the Blingo games starting at 7 p.m. Those planning to attend should park in the rear lot and use the far left entrance at the back of the building. 
 
The evening will feature 10 games of bingo, with handbags from designers such as Betsy Johnson, Guess and Nine West as prizes. In between the Blingo games, there will be raffles for additional prizes. 
 
This is our first time hosting this event, and we are very excited about it, said Victoria Trass Bardo, development and events manager. The concept is to play our version of bingo, calling it Blingo, where sassy handbags are the prize. And in between the games, we will raffle off other goodies, such as unique experiences, salon and spa services. 
 
Tickets are $30 each. Included in the cost of admission are the Blingo games and light refreshments. 
 
The event is being put on by The Filling the Gap, Inc., which works with The Resource Center to improve the lives of people with disabilities in Chautauqua County. Money raised through Sassy Baggs & Beyond Blingo will benefit the Look Good Fund. The fund was established by former area resident and Resource Center board member Margaret Look, who wanted people with disabilities to be able to obtain money for things such as a haircut or new work clothes. 
 
All proceeds from this event will directly benefit the Look Good Fund, which is put in place to assist ladies and gentlemen with a disability to have the ability to afford the luxury of a professional salon service and professional attire to go on job interviews, all in line with the importance of personal appearance and community integration, Bardo said.
