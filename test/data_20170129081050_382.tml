PALM SPRINGS, Calif. - Wet &apos;N&apos; Wild Palm Springs is two months away from re-opening for the 2017 season, but before they open the park gates, they&apos;re hiring more than 300 employees.  
 
Saturday morning the water park hosted a job fair.  
 
Dennis Campbell Jr. is one of many applicants who&apos;s hoping to get hired.  
 
&quot;I always wanted to take care of my family financial needs and I always wanted to have a job just to feel good about myself, and I think this is the place I want to do that,&quot; Campbell said.  
 
Wet &apos;N&apos; Wild operations manager, Corion Wynn, said a willing and positive attitude are qualities he looks for in a candidate.   
 
The park is hoping to fill positions in at least 10 different departments.  
 
&quot;For the lifeguards you need to be able to swim 200 yards none-stop. You need to be able to tread water and retrieve a brick. For slide attendants it&apos;s a lot easier. You just need to be able to safely dispatch people and get them down the slide safely. EMT and security guards have a little more additional training they need before hand,&quot; Wynn explained. 
 
The park will continue to accept applications into the Summer months. You must be at least 16 years of age to apply for most positions.  </TEXT>
