<TITLE>Commentary: Trump says Syrian refugees arent vetted. We are. Heres what we went through.</TITLE>
<TEXT>By Linda J. / Special to The Washington Post 
   
President Trump says that it is not safe to accept certain kinds of refugees without extreme vetting that he has yet to detail. So he has now banned people from seven countries, including Syria, which I fled with my family in 2014. But we were thoroughly vetted before we came here, just like other refugees  exhaustively, endlessly vetted. We are not terrorists. And if wed been stopped from coming here, we would be suffering horribly right now. 
 
When our 7-day-old son died while receiving treatment for jaundice in a Damascus hospital, my husband and I decided to flee the country with our daughters. We ended up in a cramped apartment in Tripoli, Lebanon, where we soon spent our savings; we were living hand-to-mouth. 
 
After a year, I received a call from the United Nations asking if my family would like to resettle somewhere else. Based on our documents, stories and circumstances  our large family, five girls, my husbands potential as a healthy worker  we had been deemed eligible to apply for refugee status. 
 
We could not return home to Syria. We could not continue living on the brink of starvation in Lebanon. A safe option was available: We began the application process to come to the United States. 
 
The process started with a series of meetings with U.S. government representatives  at least five in-person interviews with each of us and countless phone conversations. The questions were very detailed: about my family, my friends, how I spent my time. The interviewers often knew the answers to the questions before they asked them. They asked about my life going back to the day I was born; they even knew the location of the hospital. My story is my story, so I knew that the details would match their information. But I was stunned by the level of scrutiny and the length of the process. 
 
Each member of the family told their story, and those stories had to be consistent with interviews given by other people who knew us. If our answers didnt match information U.S. officials already had, or if they couldnt validate our information, we didnt progress to the next step. 
 
Finally, more than a year after we began applying and more than two years after we fled Damascus, we were cleared in December 2014 to resettle in Baltimore. We had $30 for the journey. During an airport layover in Germany, I bought a drink and, without realizing it, spent a third of our savings on a $10 bottle of water. My husband joked that now we were really finished and should just turn back. 
 
We, too, have been appalled by the Islamic States terrorist attacks around the world, and we condemn them wholeheartedly. My family and I lived through horrific acts like these. I believe the screening we underwent was so intense, so thorough and so long that it would be impossible for militants to come here. 
 
Trump says he wants to fight terrorism, but instead hes fighting the victims of terrorism. I want to ask him: If America is based on diverse people from different cultures and countries, what right do you have to tell suffering Muslims that they are unwelcome. Even your wife is an immigrant! Is it because shes not from a Muslim country? 
 
With Trumps policy, we are telling people who are dying: We cant help you. Stay where you are, and die there. 
 
 Linda J. and her family are Syrian refugees who made their way from Damascus to Lebanon and then to Baltimore. She worked with a caseworker and a translator from the International Rescue Committee, the nonprofit that helped them resettle here, to tell her story.</TEXT>
