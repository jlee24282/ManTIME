The actor picked up the rookie award, but he still thought he and Shin Hye Sun should&apos;ve won best couple. Sung Hoon expressed on &apos; Entertainment Relay &apos;, &quot;I don&apos;t know if I should say this, but everyone around me said I won the rookie award at an old age.&quot; 

He added, &quot;I didn&apos;t think about winning the rookie award, but I did kind of want to win the best couple award and was looking forward to it. I was surprised.&quot; 

Do you remember the Sung Hoon-Shin Hye Sun couple?</TEXT>
