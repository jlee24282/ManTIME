<TEXT type="str">Moscow [Russia], Jan. 29 : Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has steered clear of the hijab debate stating that the government would not like to become a party to the ongoing issue.

&quot;The Kremlin would like to refrain from becoming a party of discussion on wearing hijabs at schools, which is currently ongoing in the country,&quot; Sputnik quoted Peskov as saying on earlier this week.

He further said that there were judicial as well as non judicial methods to solve the problem of hijab wearing.

Peskov&apos;s comment came against the backdrop of Russian Minister of Education and Science Olga Vasilyeva statements who has opposed wearing hijabs in schools.

The comments from the minister later drew criticism by Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov. (ANI)
