<TITLE>Gonzaga practices at Jordan Mathews high school gym</TITLE>
<TEXT>Gonzaga practiced on Friday at Santa Monica High, the alma mater of senior guard Jordan Mathews. That was nice, going back there and seeing everything, Mathews said. It was like a throwback. 
 
Mathews attended Santa Monicas game Friday night. James Hecht, his prep coach, came to the Gonzaga-Pepperdine game. 
 
Earlier this year, Mathews returned to War Memorial Gym as Gonzaga beat San Francisco 95-80 . Mathews practically grew up in the gym. His father, Phil, coached at USF from 1995-2</TEXT>
