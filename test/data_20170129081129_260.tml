<TITLE>Dodgers' bullpen seems settled, but it doesn't mean team isn't still looking</TITLE>
<TEXT>LOS ANGELES >> The heavy lifting was done in December when the Dodgers were able to re-sign in-house free agents Kenley Jansen, Justin Turner and Rich Hill. Just this past week, the Dodgers front office concluded their winter-long search for a second baseman when they traded for Logan Forsythe. 
 
That just leaves one thing to worry about  and its the same thing Dodgers president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman says always worries him. 
 
I dont think you ever get to a place with the bullpen where you feel like youre done, Friedman said Saturday at Dodger Stadium. Its something that every year, heading into the season, it scares me. ... Its obviously a very tricky part of roster construction. 
 
Friedman joked that the seasons when he was most worried about the bullpen usually turned out to be the years when his bullpen performed best  and vice versa. 
 
Even if an under construction sign remains permanently fixed to any bullpen in Friedmans mind, the Dodgers current relief corps looks to be largely settled with spring training just over two weeks away. 
 
General manager Farhan Zaidi offered that there are some interesting guys still out there on the free agent market. But the relievers in that group  veterans like Joe Smith, Fernando Salas and Sergio Romo  appear to hold little interest for the Dodgers. Veteran Joe Blanton (who surprisingly emerged as the Dodgers most reliable setup man last season) remains unsigned as well and its not lost on us what a significant part of our bullpen he was last season, Friedman said. 
 
But that successful 2016 (a 2.48 ERA and 1.01 WHIP in a team-high 75 appearances) might have pushed the 36-year-old Blantons market beyond what the Dodgers are willing to pay after extending themselves farther than expected (a combined $192 million) to re-sign Jansen, Turner and Hill. The same financial restraint has probably kept the Dodgers from bidding aggressively for other bullpen options. 
 
Obviously we committed significant resources (to re-signing their in-house free agents), Friedman said. I think it impacts everywhere, just how you allocate. It obviously has trickle-down effects. 
 
Zaidi pointed out that the Dodgers bullpen performed at the top of baseball last year and can look forward to full seasons from players like Josh Fields and Grant Dayton who emerged as key pieces late in the year. The only additions to last years group figure to be of the type already signed  former Tampa Bay Ray Steve Geltz and former San Diego Padre Brandon Morrow both of whom signed minor-league contracts with non-roster invitations to spring training. 
 
I think the arms are there, said Dodgers manager Dave Roberts who made a major-league record 606 pitching changes in 2016. Its more of a situation where somebodys gotta emerge, sort of what Joe Blanton did for us last year. 
 
 
Weve got a lot of options. Its more about whos going to step up and pitch those innings. 
 Weighty matters  
Outfielder Yasiel Puig lifted his shirt onstage to show the crowd at Dodger Stadium for Saturdays FanFest how well he is doing in satisfying the Dodgers request for him to get leaner in 2017. Puig has hired a nutritionist and a chef, Roberts said  though they didnt appear to be part of the entourage throwing YP logo hats to the crowd as Puig made his FanFest appearance. 
 
Catcher Yasmani Grandal, meanwhile, has cut meat from his diet this winter and expects to report to spring training 10 pounds below his usual playing weight and 20 pounds lower than he normally starts spring training. Grandal said he is a little worried about being too light and will probably add meat back into his diet this spring. 
 
Fitness and diet arent the only issues for Puig this season as he tries to bounce back from a disappointing 2016 that included a month-long demotion to Triple-A and serial attempts by the Dodgers to trade him. 
 
It was not a good experience going to Triple-A, Puig said, conducting his interview in English. But that was my fault  coming in late, not going to meetings on time with my teammates and coaches. That was the reason. 
 
Roberts said he has spoken with Puig multiple times during the winter and hes in a great state of mind right now. 
 Notes  
Utilityman Kik Hernandez plans to play for Puerto Rico in the World Baseball Classic. Outfielder Joc Pederson, however, said he turned down an invitation to play for Team Israel. As a minor leaguer four years ago, Pederson was the youngest player on Team Israel during the qualifying rounds for the WBC. ... Roberts said 20-year-old left-hander Julio Urias will definitely have an innings limit in 2017  he is still a young man. Roberts has mentioned the possibility that Urias will stay behind in Arizona for extended spring training after the Dodgers break camp as a way to save those innings for later in the year. Its a team decision, Urias said through an interpreter. Im just going to get ready and wait for their decision. Ill respect it whatever it is.  Friedman said he is cautiously optimistic about reports that Hyun-Jin Ryu has already been throwing off a mound. If Ryu can make a comeback from shoulder and elbow surgeries that limited him to one start in the past two years it would be a real boon to us, Friedman said.</TEXT>
