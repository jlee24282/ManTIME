The monument of Prunes is in downtown Fairplay on the west side of Front Street near the Hand Hotel. The coordinates are 39 degrees 13.406 minutes north and 106 degrees 0.108 minutes west.

Halfway up Fairplay&apos;s Front Street stands a curious monument made of dull gray cement adorned with ore samples from many of the mines in the Fairplay-Alma area. 

Etched in the cement is the following expression of respect to one particular burro called Prunes. 

It reads, &quot;Prunes — a burro — 1867 — 1930. Fairplay, Alma — All Mines In This District.&quot; Expressed in this simple inscription is the heartfelt praise to this shaggy little servant of Colorado. 

Ripley in his &quot;Ripley&apos;s Believe-It-Or-Not&quot; syndicated cartoon made Prunes and his monument famous. Prunes was featured in 1943 on the radio version of &quot;Death Valley Days.&quot;

The last mine where Prunes worked was at the Hock Hocking mine in Mosquito Gulch. 

Prunes became the miners&apos; pet, shuffling back and forth with ore cars in the dark, damp passages. Superintendent Harry Radford maintained that Prunes was his top jackass. 

When Prunes became too old, his owner Rupe Sherwood freed the jack from its collar and traces. He set it free to roam in the sunlight at will.

After Sherwood &quot;pensioned&quot; his faithful jack, the animal spent its final years making the rounds of Alma&apos;s back doors begging for food.Residents eagerly gave the old jack food. Flapjacks fried in sowbelly grease made old Prunes hee-haw with delight. As the animal approached his 60s, his health began to fail. An examination of his mouth revealed that Prunes was losing his teeth along with his ability to eat.

A blizzard struck Alma in 1930, and the snow drifted deep. The temperature plunged below zero, and Prunes took refuge in an old shed. During the blizzard, the door blew shut, and a snowdrift prevented the old burro from pushing the door open. 

This relief is a tribute to Prunes, a burro that was said to have worked all of the mines in the Fairplay-Alma area. (Kenneth Jessen / For the Reporter-Herald) Residents noticed that the burro was not making his usual rounds. After searching, they found Prunes half starved in the shed, weak in the legs and unable to walk. He was showered with food and affection, but he did not recover from his exposure to the blizzard.

The miners met in May 1930 in Alma to decide what to do about the suffering animal. It was a difficult decision, and the miners elected to put an end to the suffering of their little long-eared friend. Prunes was shot as some of the old-timers, including Sherwood, wept. His little gray carcass was discarded in a local garbage dump.

A Fairplay cafe owner, with the help of other willing admirers, dug a grave on Fairplay&apos;s main street, and here they deposited the remains of Prunes. 

Over the grave, the miners in the area erected the unique cement monument studded with ore samples from the mines Prunes had worked. Never before had an animal been so honored by a Colorado mining town.

A year later on Aug. 23, 1931, at the age of 82, Rupe Sherwood died in the Fairplay hospital. 

On his deathbed, he realized he was on his last trail and asked to be cremated. He requested that his ashes buried behind the monument under which the bones of his faithful burro were buried. The funeral was attended by about 500 people. A bronze plaque was added to the top of the monument.
