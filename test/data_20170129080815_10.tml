<TEXT type="str">After a dry Northeast Monsoon, rains have finally showed up in both the states of Tamil Nadu and Kerala in the last couple of days thereby eliminating the prolonged dry spell. So much so that many parts of the states have ended up recording heavy rains as well. 
 
In a span of 24 hours from 08:30 am on Saturday, Pamban witnessed a whopping of 131 mm of rainfall, followed by Coonoor that recorded 80 mm. Likewise, Coimbatore witnessed 16 mm, Kodaikanal 14 mm, Periakulum 14 mm, Alapuzha 21 mm and Kottayam 17 mm of rainfall. 
 
The reason for these good showers can be credited to a trough of low which is extending from Gulf of Mannar up to North Tamil Nadu. Another trough is seen from Konkan and Goa region up to Comorin area in lower levels. Moreover, the easterly winds are also moderate in nature along the coast thus fuelling the system, paving way for rain and thundershowers across the states. 
 
According to Skymet Weather, in the next 24 hours this rain activity is likely to reduce over northern and interior parts of Tamil Nadu. However, light rains are expected to continue over rest of the state, Kerala and South Coastal Karnataka . 
 
The weather is expected to remain pleasant over all these areas. This can be labelled as the last rainy spell in the month of January for both the states.
