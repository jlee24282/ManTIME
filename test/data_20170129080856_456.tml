<content type="str">Mischa Barton is home and opening up about her recent hospitalization. 

The 31-year-old actress was hospitalized at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles on Thursday, the morning after she celebrated her birthday with friends -- and says that the erratic behavior she exhibited that day was a result of Ghb, commonly known as the &quot;date rape drug.&quot; 

&quot;On the evening of the 25th, I went out with a group of friends to celebrate my birthday. While having drinks, I realized that something was not right as my behavior was becoming erratic and continued to intensify over the next several hours,&quot; Barton said in a statement obtained by People. 

&quot;I voluntarily went to get professional help, and I was informed by their staff that I had been given Ghb. After an overnight stay, I am home and doing well. I would like to extend a big thanks of gratitude Â»</content>
