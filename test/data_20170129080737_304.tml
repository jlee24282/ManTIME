<content type="str">US President Donald Trump has signed a controversial executive order tightening America&apos;s borders, but New Zealand tourists travelling to the US are unlikely to be impacted. 
 
Australians, New Zealanders and citizens of 35 other countries allied with the US will still have the simple option of going online and applying for entry to the US if their travel is for business or pleasure and less than 90 days.
