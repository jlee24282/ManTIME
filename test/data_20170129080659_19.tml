Carlo Ancelotti admitted Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich looked &quot;anxious and worried&quot; during Saturday&apos;s 2-1 win at relegation-threatened Werder Bremen. 
 
&quot;That was an important win in a difficult game,&quot; said the Bayern coach after his side survived Werder&apos;s second-half onslaught to remain three points clear. 
 
&quot;After conceding the goal, we lost our shape and we were a bit anxious and worried, I have to admit that. But by the end, we had the game under control. 
 
&quot;There are always difficulties during a season.&quot; 
 
This was Bayern&apos;s seventh league win in a row – and a record 13th straight victory against Bremen – thanks to Arjen Robben and David Alaba&apos;s first-half goals. 
 
But, worryingly for Ancelotti, the league leaders lost their shape and composure after Germany striker Max Kruse pulled a goal back for Bremen on 53 minutes. 
 
With Arsenal looming in the Champions League last 16 in just over a fortnight, Bayern must improve, says captain Philipp Lahm, especially following last weekend&apos;s comeback league win at Freiburg. 
 
&quot;The most important thing is that we are winning,&quot; said Lahm. 
 
&apos;MUST PLAY BETTER&apos; 
 
&quot;But it is also clear that we can – and must – play better. 
 
&quot;We have some busy weeks coming up, with some real hurdles and we have to act better than we did in our last two games.&quot; 
 
Bayern&apos;s goal-scorer Robben was equally unimpressed 
 
&quot;When you go 2-0 up, it should all be over,&quot; said the Dutch veteran. 
 
&quot;They put us under more pressure in the second-half when it should have been easier at the back with more room. 
 
&quot;If we do better, it&apos;ll be three or four nil – there are a few things to improve.&quot; 
 
Bremen striker Kruse said Werder took a leaf out of Freiburg&apos;s book when they put Bayern under pressure before Robert Lewandowski&apos;s goals rescued Munich last week. 
 
&quot;Freiburg showed that you can play against Bayern and when you trust yourselves, as we did in the second-half, things are possible,&quot; said Kruse, whose Bremen are 15th in the table. 
 
&quot;If you want to take points off Bayern, you have to play well for 90 minutes. We put in a good performance, but still took no points.&quot; 
 
Meanwhile 400km away at the Red Bull Arena, RB Leipzig ended 10-man Hoffenheim&apos;s unbeaten run this season with a 2-1 comeback home win. 
 
RB remained just three points adrift of Bayern. 
 
Hoffenheim were the last undefeated team left in Europe&apos;s top leagues before RB midfielder Marcel Sabitzer&apos;s 77th-minute winner dealt them their first loss of the campaign following striker Sandro Wagner&apos;s dismissal. 
 
RB&apos;S &apos;BIG POINT&apos; 
 
&quot;I was impressed by the way we didn&apos;t lose our way after going behind,&quot; said RB coach Ralph Hasenhuettl. 
 
&quot;That was a big point against a very good opponent. We were very clever, very flexible, in the way we acted.&quot; 
 
With Germany coach Joachim Loew watching, Hoffenheim took the lead when midfielder Sebastian Rudy, who will join Bayern next season, counter-attacked from his own box before Nadiem Amiri tapped-in. 
 
Leipzig equalised when Timo Werner netted his 11th goal this season. 
 
The game turned when Hoffenheim had Wagner sent off for the last 30 minutes for a clumsy tackle before Austria international Sabitzer hit Leipzig&apos;s winner from 22 metres out. 
 
&quot;We were the weaker of two good Bundesliga teams, so we deserved to lose,&quot; said Hoffenheim&apos;s 29-year-old coach Julian Nagelsmann. 
 
&quot;I&apos;m not happy because we gave them too much time alone on the ball.&quot;</content>
