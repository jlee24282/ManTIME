<TITLE>10 cool Android games you can play without internet</TITLE>
<TEXT>Many of us likes to play games in our free time. And it's easy today, as most modern smartphones are powerful enough to double up as really good handheld gaming devices. But there are times when we are stuck with poor internet connectivity and are unable to access our favourite games. In these situations, offline Android games are the way to go. 
We have handpicked some of our favourite offline Android games. These are guaranteed to keep you engrossed, even when there's no network connectivity. 

Temple Run 
The original Temple Run is one of the first titles that took the smartphone gaming world by storm. The game involves running endlessly while trying to avoid falling off a cliff or getting killed by traps and demons. Players can also collect coins and other items along the way. Given how popular it is, we may see a Temple Run-themed movie in the near future as well. 

Subway Surfers 
 
 
Similar to Temple Run, the Kiloo-developed Subway Surfers is an endless runner and one of the most downloaded games on Android. Players have to keep running without getting caught by the cop who's chasing you. Along the way, they can also collect coins and unlock goodies like jetpacks and gifts. 
Badland 


 
Badland is a side scrolling action adventure game set in a dark forest. The forest appears beautiful, but there is something wrong with it. The player has to control a creature and find out what's going wrong. There are numerous traps and obstacles, and the game also offers a multiplayer mode with support for up to four players. It has 23 levels and offers an immersive gaming experience. 
Fruit Ninja 
Want a good workout routine for your fingers? Look no further than Fruit Ninja. You need to slice all the fruits that appear on the screen by quickly running your finger across them. But you also have to be careful and avoid slicing the explosives that appear along with the fruits 
Asphalt 8: Airborne 
No list of best offline mobile games can be considered complete without Asphalt 8: Airborne. Among the best racing games available on Android (and other platforms), Airborne's game play is similar to that of its predecessor. You are given four control options - Tilt to steer, Tilt and icons, On-screen controls and Tap to steer. However, the game consumes a lot of storage space and its frequent updates are equally big as well. 

Limbo 
Limbo is an interesting 2D puzzle game that can played offline. Players just need to use elements of the environment to solve the puzzles and move forward. Limbo has silhouetted and monochrome graphics that give it a sort of a creepy feel. Along with this, players also have to take care of things like electricity, bullets and water. 

Minecraft: Pocket Edition 
Minecraft: Pocket Edition offers a huge open world for creation and survival. The players can create new worlds and play in them offline. The creative or survival mode allows them to build and mine stuff, kill the bad guys and do lots of other cool things. The mobile version is not as immersive as the desktop one, but it's still enough to keep one glued even without internet connectivity. 

 
Alto's Adventure  
This is a side scrolling adventure game set against the backdrop of beautiful snowy mountains. The game is about the journey of Alto and his friends on a snowboard. On the way, they have to rescue and collect llamas, perform stunts, all while avoiding getting crashed. 
World of Goo   
World of Goo is another puzzle game. Players just need to make bridges using bits of goo in order to make it to the end. The main challenge is that they must use the goo to its fullest potential to get across and earn a 3-star rating. The game offers a freestyle mode where players can build the tallest tower, with the results being stacked up against other players from across the world. 
Smash hit  
Smash Hit is a first person running game where players have to throw balls to break obstacles in their way. The game has 50 different rooms and 11 styles. The catch is that the number of balls in the inventory also equate to total lives. The game requires focus, concentration and timing to not only travel as far as possible, but also break glass objects that stand in the way.</TEXT>
