<content type="str">Sultan bin Saeed Al Mansoori, UAE Minister of Economy (MOE), has affirmed that the economic relations between the UAE and New Zealand continue to grow and are expected to develop further as the two countries aspire to strengthen cooperation in a number of economic sectors of common interest and prioritized within their respective development plans. The announcement came during a meeting between the UAE Minister of Economy and Todd McClay, New Zealand Minister of Trade, and his accompanying delegation at the MOEâ€™s Dubai headquarters. 

Both parties explored the potential of increasing trade and strengthening cooperation in a number of areas, most notably agriculture and food, renewable energy, innovation, civil aviation, and tourism. The officials also discussed the current status of the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between the GCC and New Zealand. They touched on major issues that could be raised at the next meeting of the Joint Economic Committee which is set to take place this year in New Zealand.

Total foreign trade between the UAE and New Zealand reached $1.6 billion in 2016, and is expected to increase dramatically in the coming years as both countries continue to push bilateral trade and economic cooperation initiatives.</content>
