<TITLE>The McLean Group Advises Metis on its Recapitalization</TITLE>
<TEXT>Metis Solutions (Metis), headquartered in Arlington, VA, completed a recapitalization during which management and employees took a controlling position in the business, generated liquidity for the Founder, and provided additional capital to further fuel the companys significant growth. The McLean Group's Aerospace, Defense & Government Services (ADG) practice served as the exclusive transaction advisor to Metis. The terms of the transaction were not disclosed. 
 
Metis provides services to U.S. government agencies in the national security, Special Operations and Intelligence communities, with a particular capability in counter-threat finance analysis. Metis directly supports the missions of its customers, providing intelligence and operations support and strategy and policy insights, as well as training and capacity building services, both domestically and internationally. 
 
Metis management-led recapitalization highlights several emerging trends in the defense and government services market, including: 

 There is an increasingly broad and diverse set of financing alternatives for well positioned government services businesses that want to realize liquidity, fuel growth or do both. Over the past 12 months, The McLean Group has closed a wide range of transactions including sell-side M&A transactions, ESOP formations, debt recapitalizations, and equity recapitalizations.  High priority markets, including SOCOM, intelligence agencies, and select elements within the DOD continue to generate strong interest from various buyer and investor categories.  Companies that demonstrate clear strategic vision, possess an experienced and committed management team, and operate in higher-growth markets can overcome many of the investment concerns that can impact smaller businesses.
