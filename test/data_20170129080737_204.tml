DES MOINES, Iowa (KCRG-TV9) - The University of Northern Iowa men&apos;s basketball team evened its Missouri Valley Conference mark at 5-5 following a 71-63 victory at Drake on Saturday in the Knapp Center. 
  
The Panthers (10-11 overall, 5-5 MVC) had three players in double-figuring scoring behind Klint Carlson (17 points), Bennett Koch (16 points) and Jeremy Morgan (16 points). Drake (7-15 overall, 5-5 MVC) was led in scoring by Ore Arogundade with 15 points. Drake&apos;s leading scorer Reed Timmer (16.9 ppg) was limited to 10 points was only 3-of-8 from the field vs. the Panther defense. 
 
UNI jumped out to a 14-2 lead less than seven minutes into the game as the Panthers made seven of their first 10 shots from the floor. Drake crept back into the contest when UNI failed to score a point in the final 6:58 of the first half. UNI held a 25-22 lead at the break. 
 
Drake made its first four shots of the second half and took its first lead of the game at 33-31 with 15:10 left in the game. UNI used an 8-0 run, that included a five-point spurt from redshirt freshman Luke McDonnell, to take a 44-37 lead with 10:45 remaining in the game. A Carlson three-pointer from the top of the key gave the Panthers a 56-47 lead with 4:13 remaining. UNI extended the lead to 11 at 58-47 after a pair of free throws from senior Jordan Ashton. UNI would push the lead to 13 points at 67-54 with :45 left in the game. 
 
NOTES: UNI becomes only the third team in the history of the MVC to lose its first five games and then win its next five games (Washburn in 1936 and Iowa State in 1915 were the previous two) ... UNI has won six straight matchups vs. the Bulldogs ... UNI has won 11 of its last 12 games vs. the Bulldogs.</TEXT>
