<content type="str">Walking around Sandy Point State Park on Saturday afternoon, a crowd of colorful carousers interspersed with families from all over the region are busy exchanging horror stories of the chilly waters of the Chesapeake Bay. 
 
It&apos;s the last day of the 21st annual Maryland State Police Polar Bear Plunge, where it&apos;s a sort of general admittance to jump into the chilly waters as part of an effort to benefit the Special Olympics . 
 
At first glance, it resembles more of a large fair. A man wins a costume contest for his outfit resembling the villain from &quot;Aladdin,&quot; Jafar. Women on stilts, wearing wardrobes encompassing nearly the entire color spectrum, jaunt around the crowd as bands play familiar music both outside and in tents. 
 
But the main draw is the quick dash into the bay, all to raise money and awareness for the cause. 
 
With Jim Schmutz, CEO of Special Olympics Maryland, declaring that the water temperature &quot;is a balmy 41 degrees&quot; Fahrenheit at 3 p.m., it&apos;s not as bad as years past when the bay froze, requiring officials to chip away at the ice for the event to move forward, according to Kent Island native Taz Whitley. 
  
&quot;People&apos;s legs were bleeding when they were coming out of the bay because they were getting cut up by the ice,&quot; Whitley said of the last time he participated. 
 
Now living in Arlington, Virginia, the 38-year-old said that while 41 degrees is certainly better than the previous two times he participated, the frantic run through the water still isn&apos;t easy. 
 
&quot;I don&apos;t think you do prepare for it. You kind of just have to do it,&quot; Whitley said. 
 
&quot;The first time, it just numbs you for the first 60 seconds,&quot; Pasadena resident Sam Schnieder said. &quot;But then it&apos;s just cold.&quot; 
  
The 46-year-old is also participating in the plunge for his third time along with his son Daniel, who had a biting description of what it&apos;s like to first step onto the beach. 
 
&quot;The sand feels like needles when you&apos;re getting out,&quot; he said. 
 
Zak Thomas, from Deep Creek, said he tried to take the brunt of the cold as quickly as he could. 
 
&quot;I sprinted in and just dove in. They said no diving, but I kind of skimmed it,&quot; Thomas said. 
 
It being his first time, he said the afternoon sun beaming down on the beach helped to ease some of the cool winter air. 
 
For all the bravado exhumed prior to the plunge and the inevitable expletive-laden descriptions of pain that follow, the end goal is one everyone in attendance can support. 
 
Organizers said that as of the last plunge at 3 p.m., the plunge raised $2.4 million to go toward the Special Olympics, coming up just shy of the goal of $2.5 million but surpassing 2016&apos;s $2.25 million. 
 
&quot;The really cool thing about this is … some people raise money in the summer and over six months raise money,&quot; Schmutz said. 
 
He said that of the three plunges on Saturday — one in the morning for families and two in the afternoon for anyone and everyone — upward of 6,000 people tested their will against the bay. 
 
&quot;Again, it just shows the spirit of Marylanders. As cold as it was, and it really warmed up this afternoon with the sun coming out, wind was blowing earlier, but the energy of this event is really demonstrative of the passion that people have for committing themselves to a bigger cause than themselves,&quot; Schmutz said. 
 
The money raised will go toward supporting 7,211 athletes who participate in 27 different sports, Schmutz said. 
 
Susie Brashler, a 22-year-old case manager from Baltimore who works with adults with intellectual disabilities, said she wanted to participate in the plunge for the first time this year. 
 
She said it&apos;s important to create an environment that supports those with developmental disabilities. Special Olympics athletes walk among the crowd at the event and become a part of the plunge&apos;s DNA in both spirit and participation. 
 
For Brashler, her participating in the plunge itself &quot;wasn&apos;t as bad as I thought it was going to be.&quot; 
 
But when asked about the importance of having thousands of people pledge a weekend down at a frigid beach to raise money for the community she supports, she said it&apos;s crucial to get more people to participate and contribute. 
 
&quot;We can&apos;t really put on the programs we do without the funds that come from events like this,&quot; she said.</content>
