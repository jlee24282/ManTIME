Board certification is reserved only for those professionals who demonstrate expertise in handling a diversity of circumstances related to their chosen area of practice. 

BriefingWire.com, 1/29/2017 -   Nunneley Family Law’s founder talks about her colleague’s record-breaking accomplishment. 

Hurst, TX, – Nunneley Family Law is pleased to announce that associate Sonya Carrillo has earned board certification in family law. This prestigious credential requires an invitation by the Texas Board of Legal Specialization and successful completion of a rigorous family law examination to earn. 

“The invitation to take the exam so early in her career was a tremendous honor,” says Barbara D. Nunneley, the founder of Nunneley Family Law. “Sonya’s accomplishments don’t come as a surprise to those of us who have watched her develop her knowledge and skills over the years. She launched her career with a laser focus on attaining this coveted credential so that she could serve clients better. She hasspent the past five years practicing family law predominately in Tarrant County while attaining the experience and expertise required for certification.” 

In her time in practice so far, Carrillo has litigated bench trials, jury trials and appeals. She’s helped clients navigate divorces, modifications and enforcements, as well as learning all other areas of family practice. 

“Sonya’s successful attainment of the requirements demanded by the Texas Board of Legal Specialization have made her the youngest board-certified family lawyer in the state of Texas today,” says Nunneley. “This achievement speaks volumes about her dedication to the profession and the clients she serves.” 

Carrillo grew up in West Texas with stops in Abilene and Sweetwater along the way. Her upbringing grounded her in solid Texas values while providing her with the skills necessary to become a successful, pragmatic litigator, Nunneley says. 

Board certification is reserved only for those professionals who demonstrate expertise in handling a diversity of circumstances related to their chosen area of practice. Board certified family lawyers must demonstrate extensive experience in legal matters pertaining to marriage, child custody and protective orders, among others before even earning an invitation to sit for the exam. They must also have participated in civil jury trials, appeals and mediations. 

“It has been an honor to work alongside Sonya over the past five years, watching her hone and develop skills and knowledge that benefit our clients each and every day,” says Nunneley.
