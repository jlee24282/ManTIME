<TEXT type="str">PAS today challenged DAP to proceed with legal actions against party president Abdul Hadi Awang, claiming that hundreds of thousands Muslims and non-Muslims who respects Islam will rise to act as his &quot;defence lawyers&quot;. 

&quot;DAP wants to try.....Please do!,&quot; said PAS information chief Nasruddin Hassan in a statement. 

He also claimed to have evidence of statements and actions by DAP leaders which exposes their true colours as reiterated by Abdul Hadi. 

&quot;I have evidence of statements and actions by DAP leaders who made fun of Islamic laws and at the same time exposing their anti-Islam stance to the public. 

&quot;InsyaAllah, if DAP sues the PAS president, then hundreds of thousands or millions of Muslims and non-Muslims who respects Islam will rise to be &apos;defence lawyers&apos; for the leader of an Islamic movement,&quot; said the Temerloh MP.
