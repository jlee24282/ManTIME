It seems that first-date desserts are real things that real people fret over, so our friends to the south have decided to classify frozen yogurt as their universal first date selection. 

Many a date has been saved since introducing the Frogurt as the perfect way to cap off that first meal. Nevermore will Americans go wanting, because the perfect dessert formula has been discovered. 

Not so in Canada. We still have real people fretting over real dessert menus, fruitlessly searching for the Holy Grail of first-date desserts. These hopeless lovers need a hand, so why not try some kind of cheesecake? There is plenty of variety so you&apos;ll never run out of fresh desserts on all those first dates you&apos;ll be having. 

There is, of course, one big glaring problem suggesting a cheesecake to someone you&apos;ve only really had about 75 minutes to get to know. At first glance it may seem risky suggesting a dessert that could potentially harm someone who requires a lactose-free snack. Luckily there are vegan cheesecakes, completely void of dairy, so hopefully one of these is on the menu. 

Many cheesecakes are incredibly rich, so it balances out nicely with a post-dinner coffee, assuming you drink your coffee without tainting it with cream or sugar. There is enough cream and sugar in the cheesecake. 

Also, according to the Food Network, cheesecake is a classic dessert served to athletes in the first Olympic Games. Not the first modern Games, but the ancient Games, back in 776 B.C. If it&apos;s good enough for Olympians, it must be a great choice for a first date. 

They even point out that it&apos;s considered bad luck by somebody, somewhere to serve cheesecake at weddings, so using it as a first date taste test is a great way to say, &quot;Let&apos;s see where this goes, but let&apos;s not get carried away here.&quot;

In the U.S., the first-date dessert is frozen yogurt, according to a study I read somewhere online a while ago. Having recently been introduced to Tutti Frutti Frozen Yogurt, I fully understand the charm. It&apos;s delicious, comes in a variety of flavours and offers a buffet of suitable and unsuitable toppings. For example, last Monday when I was watching The Bachelor on TV (I&apos;m in love), I was noshing on a yogurt combo of chocolate and salted caramel, topped with brownie chunks, toasted coconut, butterscotch and chocolate sauce. 

It was fantastic, and somehow made up for Sean&apos;s decision to send home Leslie M. 

Here in Canada, while we do love our frozen treats, I think there&apos;s one dessert-like national treasure that has captured the nation. This is especially true in Estevan, where this is actually one of the few avenues open for a casual first date: Tim Hortons. I know, coffee isn&apos;t a dessert, but a doughnut, muffin or box of TimBits definitely qualifies. 

Consider: you&apos;re picking up a girl from math class to go watch a hockey game together. You&apos;ve texted non-stop for more than two weeks, so you know it&apos;s definitely serious. Before the game, you grab a coffee/tea for each of you and sit together using the cups to keep your hands warm because you&apos;re too scared to reach over and hold her hand. 

After the hockey game, it&apos;s only 9 p.m. Mom and Dad said you didn&apos;t have to be home until 11 p.m. Your friends are heading home, but that&apos;s all right, because you two are going to find something to do. 

Tim Hortons for another beverage? Hollywood has told you that coffee shops are the perfect date setting; plus, you aren&apos;t old enough to go to the bar. Coffee it is, and this time you both grab a doughnut, so there&apos;s a reason to spend even more time out together. 

Man, I should write commercials for Tim Hortons, Canada&apos;s first-date dessert centre. 

Also, 11 p.m. is an unreasonable curfew.</TEXT>
