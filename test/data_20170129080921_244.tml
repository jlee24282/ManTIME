An Academy spokesperson has criticised President Donald Trump&apos;s travel ban which could prevent Iranian filmmaker Asghar Farhadi, who is nominated for an Oscar, from attending next month&apos;s ceremony is Los Angeles. 
 
&quot;The Academy celebrates achievement in the art of filmmaking, which seeks to transcend borders and speak to audiences around the world, regardless of national, ethnic, or religious differences,&quot; the statement said.

US tech leaders alarmed over immigration 
 
The leaders of US technology companies have expressed alarm at President Donald Trump&apos;s sudden executive order on immigration. 
    
&quot;As supporters of filmmakers - and the human rights of all people - around the globe, we find it extremely troubling that Asghar Farhadi, the director of the Oscar-winning film &apos;A Separatio&apos;n, along with the cast and crew of this year&apos;s Oscar-nominated film &apos;The Salesman&apos;, could be barred from entering the country because of their religion or country of origin.&quot; 
 
Trump signed the executive order on Friday to suspend entry of refugees to the US for 120 days, and imposed an indefinite ban on refugees from Syria. 
 
A 90-day ban was also placed on citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. 
 
The 2017 Oscars will take place on February 26.
