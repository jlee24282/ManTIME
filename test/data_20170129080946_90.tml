<TEXT>French President Franois Hollande | Dan Kitwood/ 

British prime minister says we do not agree with this kind of approach.

President Donald Trumps order to bar refugees and citizens fromcertain Muslim countries from the U.S. attracted criticism fromaid organisations and French and British leaders. 

French PresidentFranois Hollande said he intended tohave a firm discussion with Trump. At a summit of southern European countries in Lisbon on Saturday, Hollande said that he was concerned by Trumps callfor more countries to leave the EU, following in the footsteps of the U.K.,and that EU countries had to respond to his rhetoric, according to Agence France Presse. Hollande spoke byphone with Trump later on Saturday. 

Shortly after meeting U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May on Friday, Trump signed an executive order canceling the arrival of refugees and asylum seekers for four months, and banning citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from arriving in the country. Syrian refugees are also indefinitely restricted from coming to the country. 

During her stop over in Ankara on the way back from a visit to the U.S., British Prime Minister Theresa May refused to condemn Trumps Muslim ban after being asked about it three times at apress conference with the Turkish prime minister on Saturday. The United States is responsible for the United States policy on refugees, she said. The United Kingdom is responsible for the United Kingdoms policy on refugees. 

But soon after midnightin London, Maysspokesman put out a statement that we do not agree with this kind of approach and it is not one we will be taking. 

We are studying this new executive order to see what it means and what the legal effects are, and in particular what the consequences are for U.K. nationals, the statement added. If there is any impact on U.K. nationals then clearly we will make representations to the U.S. government about that. 

The French were the most outspoken from the start. 

This can only worry us, Jean-Marc Ayrault, the French foreign minister, said at a press conference in Paris on Saturday, according to Reuters. Ayrault added that heand Germanys ViceChancellor Sigmar Gabriel discussed their concerns over Trumps move. Welcoming refugees who flee war and oppression is part of our duty, Ayrault said. 

The United Nations refugee agency, UNHCR, and the International Organization for Migration also called on Trump to reconsider his decision, according to Reuters. 

The two U.N. agenciessaid they hoped that the U.S. will continue its strong leadership role and long tradition of protecting those who are fleeing conflict and persecution. 

Meanwhile, Google toldtraveling staff to come back to the U.S. out of fear they wouldnt be granted re-entry into the country. At least 187 Google employees could be affected by Trumps order, said the companys CEO Sundar Pichai in a memo to the company, according to the Wall Street Journal.

This is from a country that bans certain womens clothing on beaches? And they have the gall to talk about rights? 

You couldnt make it up. 

And when exactly are you going to talk to the Donald? Youll be out of office before the next G8 meeting.

Guess a firm discussion with a soon to be ex president with a popularity rating somewhere around the usual +/- margin of error in opinion polls is really going to shake things</TEXT>
