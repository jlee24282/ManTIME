President Rodrigo Duterte has been invited to attend the 65th Miss Universe beauty pageant but is yet to confirm his attendance, tourism secretary Wanda Corazon Teo said. 
 
“In-invite namin, binigay na ang ticket pero walang advice. Alam mo naman si presidente, last minute eh kung magdecide,” said Teo in an interview on radio DZMM on Sunday, January 29.

With or without the president’s presence, the National Capital Region Police Office has beefed up security for the coronation rites by deploying at least 1,858 police officers to the venue. 
 
PNP director general Ronald dela Rosa has also ordered a gun ban in Pasay and Parañaque starting midnight of Sunday until Monday, January 30. 
 
During this period, the permit to carry firearms outside residence is suspended and only policemen, soldiers and other law enforcers will be allowed to carry firearms, said NCRPO spokesperson Chief Insp. Kimberly Molitas. 
 
Checkpoints will also be set up in strategic areas in some areas in Metro Manila, especially in Pasay and Parañaque, Molitas said. 
 
NCRPO director Oscar Albayalde said the authorities are striving to achieve zero incidents during the Miss Universe coronation. 
 
While there is no direct threat towards the staging of Miss Universe, Albayalde assured that the police will not be “complacent.” 
 
“I have directed all police officers to be alert at all times in all places of engagements,” said Albayalde. 
 
The NCRPO chief also asked for the public’s cooperation in maintaining peace, order and safety during the event. 
 
The 65th Miss Universe beauty pageant will be held at the SM Mall of Asia Arena on Monday, January 30, starting at 8:00 a.m., with 86 women vying for the title and crown.
