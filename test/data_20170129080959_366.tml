<content type="str">The story is about an over-active imagination little girl, called Monkey, who celebrates her birthday weekend with her grandparents. ‘There is no magical world, unified rings, or announcements of royal blood lines and treasure hunts,’ says author, Celeste Beckerling. 
 
‘This is just a good, old-fashion, laugh out-loud story, aimed at children who have a good sense of humour. ’The story follows Monkey as she goes on outings with her rather loud, robust, and ridiculous family. Her Grandmother manages to get strangers doing warm-ups with her Cecilia Forest, her Granddad tells her how he lost his finger by digging in his noise and her brother insists on doing terrible magic. 
 
‘These are things that really happened in my childhood!’ Celeste laughs. ‘I have added a lot of poetic license and mixed it up a little, but the truth is my Granddad really did tell me his finger got stuck in his noise and they had to chop it off!
