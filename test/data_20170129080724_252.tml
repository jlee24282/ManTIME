<content type="str">U.S. Rep. Rod Blum, R-Iowa, last week spoke with the Telegraph Herald about actions taken by new U.S. President Donald J. Trump during his first few days in office. 
 
Blum said the U.S. would see “immediate payback” from a wall separating the U.S. and Mexico, a campaign promise Trump supported through an executive order this month. 
 
Savings would come in the form of decreased spending on law enforcement, welfare, social service and education dollars spent on the estimated 11 million to 12 million unauthorized immigrants living in the U.S., Blum said. 
 
However, undocumented immigrants contribute more in payroll taxes than they will consume in public benefits, according to several state and federal studies. 
 
According to the Social Security Administration, unauthorized immigrants — who are not eligible to receive Social Security benefits — paid $13 billion in payroll taxes in 2010. They received only about $1 billion in benefit payments, attributable to unauthorized work. 
 
The principal category of unauthorized immigrants who draw Social Security benefits include those who have overstayed visas or obtained Social Security numbers illegally. 
 
Undocumented immigrants also are not eligible for federal benefits such as Social Security, Supplemental Security Income, Medicaid, Medicare and food stamps. Most of these programs require proof of legal immigration status under the 1996 federal welfare law. Even legal immigrants cannot receive these benefits until they have been in the U.S. more than five years. 
 
However, undocumented immigrants are eligible for schooling and emergency medical care. Native-born, U.S.-citizen children of immigrants are eligible for public benefits programs. 
 
A 2013 Heritage Foundation report found that, on average, households headed by undocumented immigrants in 2010 received about $24,721 in government services, such as public education, police and fire protection. 
 
But in its 2013 “Immigration Myths and Facts” report, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said most economists see providing these benefits as an investment in the future, when these children will become workers and taxpayers. 
 
A 2013 Congressional Budget Office analysis of a failed bipartisan immigration reform bill found increasing legal immigration would generate more income and payroll tax revenue than would be spent on Medicaid, health insurance subsidies and other federal benefits. 
 
The CBO estimated the 2013 bill would decrease the budget deficit by $180 billion over 10 years and by $990 billion over 20 years. 
 
Yet, Blum argued, “what we’re going to save on welfare program and social services programs and law enforcement will more than pay for” the estimated $12 billion to $15 billion needed to build the wall.
