<content type="str">Northern State&apos;s highest shooting percent of the season led to its greatest offensive output as the women&apos;s basketball team dominated Southwest Minnesota State for a 90-65 Northern Sun Intercollegiate Conference win on the road.

Northern (15-5, 11-5) made 60.7 percent of its shots from the floor, including a 4-for-7 effect from 3-point range. The team nearly matched the R/F Facility record of 63 percent from the floor. The Wolves, who didn&apos;t miss a free throw until late in the game, were 12-for-15 from the line.

Northern coach Curt Fredrickson said the high shooting percentage on Saturday makes up for a few years of struggles.

&quot;If you take that shooting percentage and divide it by three, that&apos;s about what we&apos;ve shot the last three times here,&quot; he said. &quot;So this gym owed us one.&quot;

Northern led from start to finish was a Miranda Ristau layup 10 seconds into the game began the scoring. Ristau finished with 12 points, despite playing just 18 minutes.

Jill Conrad finished with her fourth double-double of the season. She missed just one shot in the game to finish with a team-high 16 points to go along with 10 assists. As a team Northern had a season-high 23 assists.

Fredrickson said Conrad is a great weapon against a zone defense.

&quot;Jill Conrad against the zone is the best forward in the league at the free-throw line,&quot; Fredrickson said. &quot;I don&apos;t know that there is anybody better. That is what makes things go for us against the zone defense. You put Conrad at the free-throw line and now that forces somebody to guard her.&quot;

That movement leaves Ristau at the low post with just one defender to beat. The simple play opened up a few baskets for the Northern center.

Fredrickson said the Mustang defense was also confused by some of the cuts made by Northern players.

&quot;We got a lot of easy baskets, particularly in the first half of this game,&quot; he said. &quot;But we can&apos;t play any better. We shot the eyes out of it (Saturday). We were up against the zone defense all night and only shot seven 3s.&quot;

With a large lead most of the game, the Wolves rotated players frequently. All 12 players saw at least 9 minutes on the court. Eleven of them scored. Brianna Kusler, the only Northern player not to score, made up for it with a team-high seven rebounds.

&quot;Everybody got a nice chance to play,&quot; Fredrickson said. &quot;Jaycie Gerding came in a popped a couple in just like nothing. That was good to see. Brianna didn&apos;t get a lot of shots out front. Gabby (Laimer) got a couple 3s, but they ran things pretty well and took care of the basketball.&quot;

Northern used a 12-0 run in the middle of the first quarter to grow an 8-5 lead to 20-5 over a 5 minute period.

Midway through the second quarter, Gerding would give the Wolves a 42-20 lead when she hit a 3-pointer. The 20-point margin would remain through the first half with the Wolves up 52-24 at the break.

Southwest Minnesota played its best quarter in the third and was able to cut the lead to as few as 27 points, but it was never really a game in the second half.

Up next for Northern State is a two-weekend homestand. The Wolves will first host Upper Iowa and Winona State. Friday&apos;s game will tip off at 6 p.m. with a 4 p.m. started planned for Saturday.

&quot;Hopefully this game gives us some good momentum heading into next weekend,&quot; Fredrickson said. &quot;Those are two big games for us next weekend. We&apos;ve won four in a row now — two at home and two on the road.&quot;
