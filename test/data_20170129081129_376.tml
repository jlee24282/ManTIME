<TITLE>Negotiate with Trudeau for refugee resettlement, says advocate</TITLE>
<TEXT>A leading refugee advocate has called on the Turnbull government tobegin negotiations to resettle people held on Manus Island and Nauru in Canada, capitalising on Justin Trudeau'srecord in welcoming nearly 40,000 Syrians in two years. 
 
Melbourne community organiser Anne Horrigan-Dixon said the announcement that US President Donald Trump would honour a deal signed with the Obama administration last year to resettle some refugeesraised a series of questions, includinghow many people being held by Australia would move to the US and how long the process would take.

MrTrump's controversial executive order on Saturday suspended entry to the US for refugees for 120 days andbarredSyrians indefinitely. It will also block entry for citizens ofIran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. 
 
Though the crackdown was expected, US Homeland Security officials continuedinterviews of refugees held by Australiaon Nauru as late as Friday.

Ms Horrigan-Dixonreceived the medal of theOrder of Australia in last week's Australia Day honours, recognition for more than 30 years of work to support waves of refugees arriving in Australia, including from Europe, China, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos and Thailand. 
 
She said Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull should immediately explain how many people would go to the US. 
 
   
"Australia needs to start thinking about how we can work with local groups in Canada," she said. 
 
"The major problem remains the 1500-oddpeople being held on Manus Island and in Papua New Guinea, because no other country will accept them. 
 
"Justin Trudeauand his government have welcomed people. Maybe we need a delegation over there, and Australia could take people Canada would have otherwise taken to get people off these islands."  
 
An adviser to theSt Mary's House of Welcome project in Fitzroy and founder of a series of local engagement and English-languageprograms, Ms Horrigan-Dixon said the Coalition and Labor had denied thousands of people the chance to build successful lives in Australia's cities and towns. 
 
She said the reinstatement of temporary protection visas by the Abbott government in 2013 meant many asylum seekers living in the community were in limbo, while those given permanent resettlement were thriving. 
 
"They want to be here and they want to work and settle. The thing they say they love the most is our democracy, ourstable system of government and the inclusion and safety of Australia," Ms Horrigan-Dixonsaid. 
 
"What we set out to do is think how would we treat these people if they were our own children? 
 
"Everything has been teamwork, because we've had a common cause." 
 
Canadahas accepted39,671 Syrianssince November 2015. 
 
"After these poor people have suffered for years on Manus and Nauru, they need to be somewhere welcoming and Justin Trudeau has shown he's prepared to provide that," she said.
