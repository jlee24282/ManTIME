<TITLE>WatchAnas Gallagher's Karaoke Song Choice Might Surprise You...Noel Gallagher's daughter certainly has a sense of humour!</TITLE>
<TEXT>Noel Gallagher's daughter, Anas , has revealed what song she'd sing at karaoke... and it's not Oasis . 
 
When asked by  NME what her go-to song would be, the 17-year-old repliedBlur's Parklife, saying: "I'm not a karaoke person, but if I had to pick something I'd probably pick this- just for the irony."

As for which song she can't stand to listen to anymore? Only Wonderwall- the Oasis song penned by her father himself. 
 
She explained: Growing up, kids at school would tease me and shout Wonderwall lyrics in my face. Its still something adults like to do after theyve had a few drinks. 
 
I was back in Manchester in the summer with my mates. Some guys in the pub recognised me and subsequently serenaded me with Wonderwall.

The model and student - who Noel Gallagher shares with ex-wife Meg Matthews - also revealed that David Bowie's Life On Mars? was the first song she first fell in love with, and it changed her attitude to music completely. 
 
"Growing up in a family where music is the epicentre of life, I kind of felt the opposite," Anas admitted. 
 
"I never really got the big deal about music. I specifically remember being sat at a family friend's house when I was six or seven. They were fussing over what to put on next. 
 
"I was rolling my eyes thinking, 'Is it really that important? It's just a bloody song.' 
 
"Then someone put on a vinyl copy of this (Life On Mars?). I remember thinking, 'Fucking hell. This is why music is important.'"
