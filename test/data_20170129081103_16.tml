<content type="str">Noel Gallagher&apos;s daughter, Anaïs , has revealed what song she&apos;d sing at karaoke... and it&apos;s not Oasis . 
 
When asked by   NME  what her go-to song would be, the 17-year-old replied Blur&apos;s Parklife, saying: &quot;I&apos;m not a karaoke person, but if I had to pick something I&apos;d probably pick this- just for the irony.&quot;

As for which song she can&apos;t stand to listen to anymore? Only Wonderwall- the Oasis song penned by her father himself. 
 
She explained: “Growing up, kids at school would tease me and shout Wonderwall lyrics in my face. It’s still something adults like to do after they’ve had a few drinks. 
 
“I was back in Manchester in the summer with my mates. Some guys in the pub recognised me and subsequently serenaded me with Wonderwall.”

The model and student - who Noel Gallagher shares with ex-wife Meg Matthews - also revealed that David Bowie&apos;s Life On Mars? was the first song she first fell in love with, and it changed her attitude to music completely. 
 
&quot;Growing up in a family where music is the epicentre of life, I kind of felt the opposite,&quot; Anaïs  admitted. 
 
&quot;I never really got the big deal about music. I specifically remember being sat at a family friend&apos;s house when I was six or seven. They were fussing over what to put on next. 
 
&quot;I was rolling my eyes thinking, &apos;Is it really that important? It&apos;s just a bloody song.&apos; 
 
&quot;Then someone put on a vinyl copy of this (Life On Mars?). I remember thinking, &apos;Fucking hell. This is why music is important.&apos;&quot;
