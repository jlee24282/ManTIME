<TEXT type="str">The seventh annual Midwest March for Life is slated for Saturday in Jefferson City. 
 
Activities will commence at 8 a.m. with LIFE Runners meeting at the steps of the Missouri Capitol for a walk/run, according to the event&apos;s website . 
 
Also at 8 a.m., the Selinger Exhibit Hall at 216 Broadway St. will open. The hall will be open to the public until 2 p.m. and will feature &quot;life-affirming booths and vendors.&quot; There will also be light refreshments available for a nominal fee. 
 
Members of the Knights of Columbus Precious Blood Council 4454 are planned to arrive at 9 a.m at Selinger, and at 9:30 a.m., the pre-march rally with speakers will begin. 
 
This year&apos;s speakers are Ryan Bomberger and Dr. Vansen Wong. 
 
Bomberger co-founded the Radiance Foundation with his wife, Bethany. 
 
He describes himself as a broadcast media designer, producer, columnist and author. Beyond media production and appearances, the Radiance Foundation&apos;s website said Bomberger travels the country as a pro-life activist and fundraiser. 
 
Wong is an OB-GYN from Roseville, California. He used to perform abortions as part of his practice in Sacramento but quit offering the procedure after seven years to become a pro-life advocate. 
 
He is affiliated with the Kaiser Permanente Medical Group, is a medical director of the Alternatives Pregnancy Center in Sacramento, and has testified in favor of pro-life legislation in the California Legislature, according to the March for Life website. 
 
The march to the Capitol is scheduled to begin at 10 a.m. at St. Peter Church. It will proceed north — past the Governor&apos;s Mansion — to Madison Street, then onto High Street toward the Capitol. The route is approximately three-quarters of a mile. 
 
The rally inside the Capitol Rotunda on the first floor is set to begin at 10:30 a.m. During the rally, the &quot;Patriot and Statesman for Life&quot; award will be presented by Team P.L.A.Y. 
 
Lunch is scheduled to follow at noon at Selinger Hall. Chili and hot dogs will be prepared by the Knights of Columbus for a nominal fee to help cover event expenses. 
 
At 2 p.m., a Mass for Life will be at St. Peter Church. Bishop John Gaydos of the Catholic Diocese of Jefferson City will be the principal celebrant. 
 
The collection at the Mass will go toward covering expenses of the march. 
 
Other guests are listed as Mark Serafino; Bridget Van Means of ThriVe Express Women&apos;s Healthcare; Reagan Barklage of Students for Life of America; Steve Rupp, president of Missouri Right to Life; Zina Hackworth of This Race Will Self-Destruct; and Chuck and Linda Raymond of Silent No More. 
 
The website lists the municipal garage at 200 Madison St. as a parking site for the march. 
 
Marchers are encouraged to wear red clothing to represent the pro-life movement. 
 
A flyer for the event states ThriVe Express Women&apos;s Healthcare will have a mobile medical unit available for &quot;ongoing tours.&quot; 
 
ThriVe is based in the St. Louis area, and its branches offer services including pregnancy tests, limited obstetrical ultrasounds to confirm pregnancies (if a pregnancy test is positive and medical assessment criteria are met), verification for Medicaid and WIC applications, information on adoption, adoption agency referrals and resources, and community referrals to help parents solve practical and material needs, according to its website.
