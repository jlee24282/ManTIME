<content type="str">WINSTON-SALEM — There was no doubt for Harry Giles when he readied to set the screen that helped free Luke Kennard on Duke’s final possession, as a Saturday teeming with difficulty and a week riling with turmoil arrived at its frenetic climax. 
 
“It was going in, all day,” Giles said. “No question, I knew if I could get him open, it was going in.” 
 
That’s just what happened, Kennard running from the opposite corner to the wing and burying the game-winning 3-pointer with 6.6 seconds remaining to deliver the 17th-ranked Blue Devils’ 85-83 escape of Wake Forest in Atlantic Coast Conference basketball at sold-out Joel Coliseum. 
 
It was a dagger of exceedingly clutch proportions — especially considering the disarray of recent days — that Duke vaulted from down by one to ahead by two and completed Kennard’s second half of cold-blooded perfection, 30 of his 34 points poured in on 10-for-10 shooting from the field. 
 
The lefty sophomore guard supplied 11 points during the game’s last 3:40, burning Demon Deacons guard Mitchell Wilbekin at times while digging Duke out of an 81-71 hole, a veritable crunch time rescue mission with the Blue Devils (16-5 overall, 4-4 ACC) teetering toward what would’ve been another depressing loss to an in-state rival. 
 
Wake Forest (12-9, 3-6) had to traverse the length of the court after Kennard’s decisive 3, his sixth of the afternoon and fifth of the second half. Bryant Crawford, pushing his dribble out of the backcourt and driving on Duke guard Frank Jackson, floated up a runner that didn’t reach the rim with 0.3 seconds left. 
 
With that, with a relieved smile forming across interim coach Jeff Capel’s face and Kennard then spiking the ball in celebration at the final horn, Duke had survived. After the foul trouble that ensnared its big men, after the dustup that of course centered Grayson Allen, the Blue Devils closed on a 14-2 run and could exhale. 
 
“We let out,” Kennard said. “We were free.” 
 
The week started with Dennis Smith’s masterpiece that fueled North Carolina State’s stunning victory at Duke’s Cameron Indoor Stadium and went on to include Capel’s revelation of his father’s ALS diagnosis and the ESPN report of coach Mike Krzyzewski, recovering from back surgery, barring the Blue Devils from wearing Duke-related gear and entering their own locker room. 
 
It ended with whoops and hollers spilling into the hallway outside the closed door to the visiting locker room here. 
 
“It’s been hell,” guard Matt Jones said. “It’s been so tough, not only physically but mentally. But for the guys to really show resiliency and to come out and fight hard like we did and overcome so much and get this win, we took a big step in the right direction.” 
 
Grayson Allen added 19 points and six rebounds. He drained five 3s, the last of which, the result of by brisk ball movement, chopped Wake Forest’s shrinking lead to 83-82 with 57.5 seconds remaining. 
 
About 4½ minutes earlier, Allen tangled with Crawford chasing a loose ball into the corner. Crawford already had taken issue with contact from Allen. This time, bodies from both teams shoved together in front of the Duke bench. Wake Forest guard Brandon Childress received a technical foul when he pushed his way into the fray. 
 
By that juncture, Duke’s Jayson Tatum had fouled out and forwards Amile Jefferson and Giles had been saddled with four fouls for some time. The Blue Devils, with no other recourse, turned to seldom-used Antonio Vrankovic and Jack White as subs in the post. 
 
“I think we did a good job of just continuing to play,” Allen said. 
 
Crawford’s 26 points and Collins’ 20 points and eight rebounds topped the contributions for Wake Forest. 
 
The Demon Deacons, in control for so long — they led for more than 30 minutes of game time — struggled to get preferred looks out of their offense during crunch time. In the final 79 seconds, as Wake Forest tried to withstand Duke’s rally, Wilbekin air-balled a 3-pointer late in the shot clock and Keyshawn Woods forced up and missed a 3 under pressure. 
 
Then, out of a timeout with 15.5 seconds left, Frank Jackson dribbled out high as Kennard lost Wilbekin with a hesitation move while running the baseline and curling around Giles’ screen. 
 
“We drew up a play and we executed it the way it was drawn up,” Kennard said. “Just setting my man up, created a little space and Harry did a great job of getting me open.” 
 
Kennard let it go and ... bang. 
 
“Guys just followed his lead,” Jones said. “Luke’s a competitor, he wants to win. And when you want to win badly enough and when you’re desperate enough, you do things that are spectacular, and he did that.” 
 
The Demon Deacons led 42-32 at halftime, largely without Collins, their top scorer and rebounder. He left 4½ minutes into the game, parked on the bench by two early fouls. 
 
Duke connected on just two field goals — both of them Allen 3s — in the last six minutes before halftime, stumbling into intermission shooting 35.5 percent. 
 
Kennard and Tatum, the Blue Devils’ best scorers on the season, were non-factors in the first half. They combined for six points. Fouls reduced Kennard. He picked up his second foul in the opening 2½ minutes. 
 
Meanwhile, Crawford and Woods found their attacking gear and pumped in 16 of Wake Forest’s final 18 points of the first half, as the lead grew from 24-22 to 42-32 in a matter of 6</content>
