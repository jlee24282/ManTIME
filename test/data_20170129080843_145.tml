 History program  
More than 100 years ago, August Fruehauf, a Detroit blacksmith and wagon builder, was asked to come up with a way to move a lumber dealers sailboat up north  but not using the traditional team of horses that would take days to make the journey. His idea was to create a two-wheeled wagon to hold the boat. To pull the boat, he removed the back seat of the lumbermans speedy Model T and attached the wagon. It worked. They called the contraption a trailer. The rest, as they say, is history.
