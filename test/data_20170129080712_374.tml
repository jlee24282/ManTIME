<TEXT type="str">Ben Hulbert, 17, of Minooka, is a junior at Joliet Catholic Academy. 
   
He’s involved in clubs that interest him – Habitat for Humanity and photography – and feels JCA shines in academics. 
 
But Hulbert, who attended Immaculate Conception School in Morris from second to eighth grade and felt he received a good education, believes one lesson taught in those schools tops the rest. 
 
“I’m made for more than what the world offers,” Hulbert said. “God gives my life meaning and values, and I’m meant to live with him forever. That’s what Catholic school inspired in me.” 
 
According to the National Catholic Educational Association website , National Catholic Schools Week began in 1974 and starts each year on the last Sunday in January. To celebrate, schools might hold special Masses and open houses, as well as family-centered activities. 
 
Despite rising tuition, lower enrollment in some cases and occasional school closings, Catholic education is still viable in the 21st century and possibly even more relevant than in the past, said the Rev. John Belmonte, superintendent of Catholic schools for the Diocese of Joliet. 
 
“Catholic schools are a good antidote for what ails us in society,” Belmonte said. “We need strong leadership as a society and as a culture, and Catholic schools produce strong leaders who are well-educated, leaders who are ethical, leaders who are faithful. That’s what Catholic schools have been doing for over 500 years in every metropolitan area around the world. And good leadership is always relevant.” 
 
The Diocese of Joliet has 60 schools, and while it’s true the number of schools has decreased over the years, the current total is holding steady, Belmonte said. The last two schools to close were both in Joliet – St. Joseph’s (eight years ago) and St. Patrick’s (seven years ago). 
 
People may assume a school closes because of lack of enrollment, but it’s more likely because of a demographic area having fewer families and fewer children. Also, schools can occasionally have financial difficulties that lead to closure, Belmonte said. 
 
“We’ve got some enrollment declines in general,” Belmonte said, “but the schools in the diocese are very well-managed.” 
 
Increased tuition is challenging, but scholarships and assistance on the parish level help make Catholic education affordable, Belmonte said. 
 
“Choosing a Catholic school is a good way to invest in your child and in your child’s future,” Belmonte said. “No doubt families, especially those who have more economic challenges, find tuition a challenge for them. But most of our families, I believe, when they see what the school is doing for their children, and how it is a support to them, know that’s money well spent.” 
    
Nevertheless, a family may spend a substantial amount on tuition – and that’s before the cost of uniforms, at schools still using them. Immaculate Conception is not one of them, although it does have a dress code, which mandates dressier clothes on Fridays for all-school Masses, said Kim DesLauriers, principal for 37 years . 
 
The good old days 
 
DesLauriers said tuition at Immaculate Conception was $175 per family in 1980 – with a book fee of $25 for the year. Today, the cost is $3,600 for one student and the book fee is $250, DesLauriers said. The fourth – or more – child in a family attends for free, he added. 
 
That’s small comfort for financially struggling families. 
 
“People are paying three, four, five hundred dollars a month,” DesLauriers said. “It’s a large payment, a big sacrifice. We don’t want to turn our backs on people who want it and can’t afford it, so we’ve got to make allowances for them. Catholic schools were created years ago for, basically, the immigrant families, the people new to this country, and it was pretty much free. It’s not just a school for the rich.” 
 
Financial help is available at the diocesan level through the Catholic Education Foundation and on the parish level through scholarship money raised by members of Immaculate Conception Parish, DesLauriers said. 
 
But even providing this last option is daunting as church collections have “pretty much flat-lined,” DesLauriers said. In addition, schools have fewer sisters from congregations teaching than in the past – Immaculate Conception has one, he said – but hiring lay teachers also means paying salary and benefits, whereas the sisters were frequently financially supported by the congregation. 
 
Also, Immaculate Conception Parish used to pay a greater percentage of the school budget – close to 75 percent, DesLauriers said. Today, it’s around 25 percent, he added. 
 
“The increase is picked up by charging families for it,” DesLauriers said. “But if we can meet the needs of the child and the family sincerely wants to go here, we’ll figure something out.” 
 
One hidden cost of increased tuition is the advance of technology and its role in education. Purchasing equipment and updating buildings to handle it – Immaculate Conception was built in 1972 – all costs money, DesLauriers said. 
 
“When this building was built, there was electrical outlets in front of the room and in back of the room,” DesLauriers said, “and that was to plug in the overhead projector.” 
   
Pros and cons 
 
Yet skimping on technology and specialty services also comes at a cost. Amy Sheehan of Joliet started her children in a Catholic school, but when her son Aidan Sheehan, now 14, developed a processing disorder, the school didn’t have the resources to adequately address it, although it tried, Amy said. 
 
“He had one wonderful teacher who would just read to him and she did it on her own time,” Amy said. 
 
So Amy transferred Aidan to Troy School District 30-C, where he blossomed academically, Amy said, as did his siblings – Grace Sheehan, now 12, and Meghan Sheehan, now 9. Amy felt this was due to “wonderful teachers” and a program that met his needs. 
 
But Amy felt Aidan’s moral values declined at Troy. A friend recommended St. Jude Catholic School in Joliet to Amy. Its Catholic environment, where classrooms are named for saints and sisters exemplify religious vocations, reinforced the Catholic standards in the Sheehan home, so Amy transferred all three children to St. Jude. 
 
Furthermore, the small class size allowed teachers extra time to work with Aidan, but it wasn’t as ideal as a structured program, Amy said. 
 
“[Catholic schools] need somebody, or a team of people, whose full-time job is to sit with these kids who are not honor students and who need that extra push and that extra help along the way,” Amy said. “The classroom teachers are fabulous and tried their very best, but they are classroom teachers and they have other students with needs to be met.” 
 
Amy wants to send Aidan to Joliet Catholic Academy but she and her husband, Tim Sheehan, can’t afford its tuition – even if they should get financial assistance – and that’s with both parents working. The tuition page on the JCA website listed tuition as $11,295 for the first student. 
 
“It breaks my heart,” Amy said. “You have good families that truly want Catholic education – like our family – and it’s completely out of their means.” 
 
But Ann Hulbert, Ben’s mother, said Ben received scholarships that helped tremendously with tuition costs. Ben said applying for them was “a lot of work.” He had to write essays and his parents had to submit financial forms. 
 
“It was worth it,” Ben said. “It helped me</TEXT>
