2017 VW Golf GTI (for representation purpose) 

Volkswagen is set to introduce a mild-hybrid powertrain to its next-generation Golf GTI. With the new powertrain, the carmaker promises to boost performance and refinement while reducing fuel consumption and emissions when compared with the current model. 

The adoption of an advanced 48V electrical system and integrated starter motor on the new hot hatchback is part of a powertrain overhaul that will be reflected across the whole Mk8 Golf line-up. The changes are also set to make the new model the most powerful series-production Golf GTI yet. 

Although the new Golf GTI is still three years away from its introduction in international markets, sources close to Volkswagen research and development boss, Frank Welsch, have revealed to our sister publication Autocar UK that the initial performance targets point to a power output similar to the 265hp of the limited-edition Golf GTI Clubsport. 

The new Gold GTI will continue to use an internal combustion engine – Volkswagen’s familiar turbocharged 2.0-litre petrol unit. However, the introduction of the 48V electric system will allow the four-cylinder engine to receive comprehensive modifications. It’s likely that the exhaust gas turbocharger of today’s model will make way for an electrically-operated compressor that offers improved low-end response and a broader plateau of torque for added flexibility. 

Additionally, the integrated starter motor will allow Volkswagen to provide the front-wheel-drive Golf GTI with a so-called boost function in which an electric motor, mounted in the front section of its standard-fit seven-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox, supplements the combustion engine in Performance mode. 

Late last year, Michael Mayer, director, Volkswagen Passenger Cars India, had hinted to us in an exclusive interview that the carmaker could get the Golf GTI to India as the country’s hot hatch market matures.
