<TEXT type="str">New York, Jan 29 (IANS) Indian-American actor Kal Penn has started a fund raiser for Syrian refugees after a Twitter user said he doesn&apos;t belong in the US. 

Penn, who has been playing pivotal roles in the American entertainment industry for over a decade now, originally set the fund raising amount at $2,500, but has raised over $128,000, reports dailymail.co.uk. 

His tweet read: &quot;To the dude who said I don&apos;t belong in America, I started a fund raising page for Syrian refugees in your name.&quot; 

The Twitter user had commented on one of Penn&apos;s photos, saying &quot;because you don&apos;t belong in this country you f***ing joke.&quot; 

According to dailymail.co.uk, Penn&apos;s CrowdRise page mentions that the money will go to the International Rescue Committee. 

As a message to people visiting the page, Penn wrote: &quot;We are better than the hateful people who tell us we don&apos;t belong in our own country, that America can&apos;t be a beacon of freedom and hope for refugees from around the world. We will turn their bigotry, along with the President&apos;s, into love.&quot; 

His remarks came just a day after President Donald Trump signed a restriction on people from Muslim countries entering the United States, regardless of if they have Green Cards or refugee status. 

Penn, 39, is a US citizen, born to Gujarati immigrant parents in Montclair, New Jersey. The actor has starred in various TV shows and films such as &quot;Harold &amp; Kumar&quot; and &quot;House&quot;. 

Additionally, he served as an associate director of the White House&apos;s office of public engagement under President Barack Obama&apos;s administration. He also worked as a White House speech writer under the former president.
