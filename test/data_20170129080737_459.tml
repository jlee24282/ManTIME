<TEXT type="str">[India], Jan. 29(ANI): Giving a message of encouragement to the students who are set to appear in the upcoming board examinations, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday gave them a &apos;smile more, score more&apos; mantra to elevate their stress. 
 
Addressing the nation in the 28th edition of his &apos;Mann ki Baat&apos; programme, Prime Minister Modi said how examinations must be taken as &quot;a pleasure&quot; and not &quot;a pressure&quot;. 
 
&quot;I will tell all students smile more and score more. Why should exam time be a time of stress or sadness? Want to talk about exams and what so many people have written to me. Do not think about exams as pressure; they should be celebrated as festivals,&quot; he said. 
  
The Prime Minister advised the students that during examinations there should be an environment of festivity as it will turn &apos;P&apos; for pressure into &apos;P&apos; for pleasure, adding that when students are relaxed the recall value increases. 
 
&quot;Relaxation is the best tonic for memory. A happy mind is the secret of a good mark sheet,&quot; he added. 
 
Prime Minister Modi tried to encourage the students by saying that the examinations are test of this year&apos;s preparation and not of a lifetime. 
 
&quot;We sometimes do not see exams in the right perspective; Exams are not a benchmark of your success in life. If your mission and ambition are in sync, marks will follow,&quot; he added. 
 
With concluding remarks, Prime Minister Modi urged the students to compete with themselves to see how they can improve their performance. (ANI)</TEXT>
