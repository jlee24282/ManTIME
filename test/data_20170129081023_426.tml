<TEXT>New Incubus Album Is 'Coming Soon' (Week in Review)  
 

. 
  
New Incubus Album Is 'Coming Soon' was a Top 3 story on Thursday: (Radio.com) It's been five years since Incubus released their last album, If Not Now, When? It's the longest span the band has gone between full-length albums. But with new tweets posted on Wed (Jan 25), new tunes appear to be on the horizon. 
 
It's no secret that Incubus has been in the studio since late last year cooking up new jams, but what the Malibu band wouldn't say is when this new album would see the light of day. 
 
Well, according to Mike Einziger, they're close, very close. The guitarist posted two messages today, both indicating the album release is immanent. ""Are you guys ready!!?!?!????? #newINCUBUSalbum coming soooooooon. Mwah-hah-hah-hah," he posted. 
 
And what's more, he says "This new album is not mellow." Read more - here.
