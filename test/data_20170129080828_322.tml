<TEXT type="str">While reading Baseball Prospectus’s top prospects list for the St. Louis Cardinals , they noted that there has never been a major-leaguer named “Harrison” before. But Cardinals prospect Harrison Bader could be the first. That is, if Rockies prospect Harrison Musgrave doesn’t beat him to it. (There’s another fun thing about Harrison Musgrave’s name that you can read about in the Baseball Prospectus Annual 2017 .) 
 
Baseball names are fun! Not only might we see two Harrisons for the first time in major-league history this season, but Harrisons Bader and Musgrave could also soon be eligible for an all-time presidential team lineup.
