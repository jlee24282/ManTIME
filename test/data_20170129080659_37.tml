Venus also spoke with reporters about her sister’s triumphant win, and couldn’t hold back her pride. “Serena Williams, that’s my little sister, guys,” she said, according to NBC News. “Congratulations, Serena, on number 23. I’ve been right there with you, some of them I’ve lost with you. Your win has always been my win, you know that. I’m enormously proud of you. You mean the world to me.”
