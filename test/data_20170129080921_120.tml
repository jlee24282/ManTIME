Nineveh (Iraqinews.com) Unknown individuals have stabbed to death Islamic State’s chief decapitator west of Nineveh, according to a security source. 
 
“An unknown armed group killed on Sunday the Islamic State’s most famous decapitator, the so-nicknamed ‘Abu Sayyaf’”, the source said. “The armed group ambushed him at al-Dawasa region, in the western side of the city, and stabbed him several times. He died immediately,” he added. 
 
Abu Sayyaf was the leading decapitator in the group’s so-called “Nineveh State”, according to the source. “He had beheaded 100 of violators of the group’s rule, and had used to dump the heads at a well-known hole in al-Khasafa region. 
 
Several assassinations and kidnappings of Islamic State leaderships have been reported since the Iraqi government launched a major offensive in October to retake the city of Mosul, the extremist group’s biggest stronghold in Iraq. 
 
Security operations, backed by a US.-led coalition and popular militias, managed to drive the militants out of the eastern side of the city on January 24th, with at least 3300 members killed, and forces are preparing to invade the group-held west. 
 
Islamic State has been notorious for heinous executions of its opponents and violators of its extreme religious views, and proudly posted videos of those executions occasionally.</TEXT>
