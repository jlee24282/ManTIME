<TITLE>Hart's return sparks Wapato's second-half comeback over Prosser</TITLE>
<TEXT>WAPATO  While rehabbing from a torn left ACL, Tarryn Hart remained part of a highly-successful Wapato girls team. She came to practices and even provided an extra set of eyes from the bench for coach Joe Blodgett. 
   
Saturday night, in the third-ranked Wolves biggest game of the season, the 5-foot-8 junior did what she does best. 
   
Playing for the first time since her injury last March, Hart made a bundle of big-time plays in addition to scoring 18 points, and Wapato surged past No. 4 Prosser 63-49 on the Wolfpacks floor to gain sole possession of the CWAC lead. 
   
Make big plays? Tarryn always does, Blodgett said after his team overcame a seven-point second-half deficit and closed on a 13-0 run. 
   
The victory, on Wapatos senior night, improved the Wolves to 14-1 in league play and 14-2 overall. Prosser, which had won its previous seven games, slipped to 13-2 and 14-3. 
   
Jade Garza scored 15 points, Janealle Sutterlict had 13 and Chehalis Aleck 10 for Wapato, which trailed 36-31 at halftime and 42-35 with 4:52 left in the third quarter. 
   
But as per Blodgetts instructions, the Wolves ramped up their defensive pressure to limit Prosser to just one more point in the period and seven for the game. 
   
Though Wapato was outrebounded 37-26 and outscored from the foul line 15-10, the Wolves forced 32 turnovers  19 of which came in the second half. 
   
I told the girls at halftime, Blodgett said, that we were being out-worked. Prosser was getting all the loose balls as well as beating us on the boards. Those are extra possessions, and when you give extra possessions to a team that talented, you make it tough on yourself. 
   
Yet as Wapato had done in the teams previous meeting at Prosser, a post-intermission revival proved pivotal. 
   
Our defense, Sutterlict said, is where we get our intensity. 
   
The Wolves outscored the Mustangs 40-23 during the second half of a 59-53 win in that game, and rolled 32-13 over the final two quarters of this one. 
   
A Hart 3-pointer with 6:40 to play gave Wapato its first lead of the second half, and after the Mustangs went back in front 47-46, the Wolves embarked on their game-closing run. 
   
Hart scored five more points and brought the home fans to their feet with a behind-the-back pass to Sutterlict for a fast-break layup and a 57-49 cushion with a minute to play. 
   
We actually worked on that in shootaround today, Hart said. Its great to be playing again, but I did learn a lot from watching from the bench. It gave me a whole new perspective. 
   
Marissa Cortes, a 5-4 sophomore point guard, scored 16 points to lead Prosser before leaving in the final seconds with an injury. 
   
Ali Cox, the Mustangs lone senior, came off the bench for 10 points and 10 rebounds and 5-11 junior Brooke Wheeler totaled seven points and 11 boards for coach Kyler Bachofner. 
   
Were trying to put together a whole game, Blodgett said, and hopefully having Tarryn back will help us do that. Were getting her back at just the right time. 
   
And thats not just for this season. 
   
Wapato, too, has only one senior.
