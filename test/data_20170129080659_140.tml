A New Brighton school was vandalised during a burglary on Friday and the thieves even made off with a stove. 

Thieves gained entry to Sophakama Secondary School by lifting out roofing material, cutting wires connected to an alarm and making a hole in the ceiling. 

The principals and secretarys office was then ransacked. The stove had been kept there. 

This was the second burglary in weeks at the school. It had also been targeted last Monday. 

Sophakama Secondary principal Charles Mti said he could not explain why his school was being targeted. 

Its very disturbing. They stole groceries and a stove. 

The pupils did not have their meals [on Friday] and most come from poor homes and are dependent on the schools nutrition programme, he said. 

In previous burglaries, including last year, a photocopying machine, tablets, circuit breakers, fluorescent lights, a lawnmower and school stationery were stolen. 

An Eastern Cape Education Department spokesman urged residents to help the school find the culprits. 

We cannot allow the school to be ripped apart by people who are also living in the same community. It is a shame and if the school is not protected we will only be left with bricks, he said. 

Police spokesman Constable Mncedi Mbombo confirmed the burglary had happened but said Mti had yet to open a case.
