SCUNTHORPE United picked up a big three points as they twice came from behind to beat Port Vale 3-2. 
 
Tyler Walker and JJ Hooper had twice given the Valiants the lead which sandwiched a Josh Morris penalty at the beginning of the second half. 
 
But United showed great character to come back into the game again and Ivan Toney brought them level before Tom Hopper came off the bench to seal the victory. 
 
It was a fitting end to the game on the day when the Iron paid tribute to vice-president Graham Taylor, whose family attended the game. 
 
The victory United back to the top of League One, a point clear of Sheffield United, with a game in hand. 
 
The Telegraph&apos;s Paul Crute gives his reaction to the game in his video verdict below.
