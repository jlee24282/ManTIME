<TEXT type="str">Name: Outbound - The Best Local Outdoor Adventures. 

What it does: The app directs you to places and tour providers that cater to outdoor interests, such as backpacking, camping, hiking, kayaking, fishing, kite boarding, mountain biking, running, skiing, stand-up paddle boarding, surfing, yoga, photography, and more. 

Available: In the App Store, requires iOS 8.0 or later. Compatible with iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch. 

Cost: Free 

What&apos;s hot: I tested the app while on a trip to Charleston, S.C., and although I&apos;ve been to that city more than 10 times in as many years, I was impressed that it turned me on to activities and destinations I never knew about, such as a day trip to Congaree National Park. There are a lot of ways to use the app; for far-reaching inspiration, go to the home page and &quot;Search by Activity&quot; - click on an interest, such as swimming, but instead of a specific location, click on &quot;Anywhere&quot; and see where the app takes you. The results took me to La Laguna, Nicaragua; Slide Lake in Wyoming; and a blue hole in Grahamsville, N.Y. - places I might never have known about or considered when researching a summer adventure. Yes, you can sort by season, too. 

What&apos;s not: The app sometimes crashed when I clicked into deeper pages. That didn&apos;t bother me too much because the quality of the content was so high. I was testing it on an iPhone 6 Plus Version 1</TEXT>
