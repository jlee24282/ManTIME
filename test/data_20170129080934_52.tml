<TITLE>Guyana thump CCC, Barbados romp past ICC Americas</TITLE>
<TEXT>Guyana won their first game in three tries by knocking off the previously unbeaten Combined Campuses Colleges by eight wickets at Kensington Oval on Saturday afternoon. CCC were bowled out for 129 after choosing to bat as left-arm spinner Veerasammy Permaul took 3 for 19 to decimate the CCC middle order. 
Opening batsman Amir Jangoo entered the game having made a pair of half-centuries in CCC's two wins to open up Group B, but he fell for a duck in the third over of the match to Ronsford Beaton and CCC continued to struggle throughout their innings before being bowled out in 44.5 overs. Guyana were disciplined with the ball, conceding a total of just four extras and took wickets at regular intervals as only two partnerships went beyond 20 runs. 
 
Guyana overcame the early loss of Assad Fudadin for 8 as Rajendra Chandrika and Raymon Reifer added 117 for the second wicket to take their side within one shot of victory. Reifer finished with a run a ball 67 to be named Man of the Match while ended unbeaten on 43 off 76 balls to secure victory with 23.3 overs to spare. 
 
Earlier in the day, Barbados recorded an eight-wicket win over ICC Americas at Three Ws Oval. Spin did the damage for Barbados as Ashley Nurse took 4 for 26 and Sulieman Benn 3 for 19 to bowl out ICC Americas for 103 in 34.2 overs. 
 
The North American combined side got off to a promising start after batting first, reaching 57 for 2 after 18 overs, but Nurse sparked a slide of 8 for 46 with the wicket of captain Nitish Kumar to begin the 19th. Only one batsman outside the top three reached double-figures.
