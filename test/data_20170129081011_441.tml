<TEXT type="str">Lawyers litigants and judges in Owerri Imo State capital will not forget Friday January 27 2017 in a hurry It is a day to remember after dare devil hoodlums stormed the High Court premises in the town and rescued one of their own Henry Chibueze alias Vampire Moreso Governor Rochas Okorocha had offered N5 million bounty to anybody that could give credible information capable of leading to the re-arrest of the fleeing Vampire

Vampire described as a native of Nwangele local council area of Imo State had been on the wanted list of the police and the Department of State Security DSS before he was apprehended

He was wanted for crimes including armed robbery and kidnapping The state heaved a sigh of relief when the DSS announced his capture in far away Ohafia Abia State and paraded him before journalists After concluding their investigation the police arraigned him in court and he was remanded in prison custody

When contacted the state Commissioner of Police Mr Taiwo Lakanu confirmed the incident but explained that it was the headache of the state Prison Command

The Public Relations Officer PRO of the Imo State Command of the NPS Mr James Maduba equally confirmed the attack

Maduba also confirmed that Vampire &quot;has escaped from lawful custody&quot; while six people were critically wounded during the ugly operation&quot;

The PRO said the Command had received a call earlier in the day that some armed men were seen in the High Court premises

&quot;We thought that they were operatives of the DSS As we were conveying over 50 inmates to the court the gunmen attacked our men and some of the inmates&quot; Maduba said

The prisons image maker also disclosed that the critically wounded officials and inmates had been taken to hospital for treatment

&quot;My Comptroller and other security chiefs in the state are on top of the situation&quot; Maduba assured
