<TEXT type="str">The new hassle-free &apos;maintenance menu&apos; follows the launch of Hyundai Sense Service Plans last autumn, and brings similar benefits to owners whose cars exceed the five-year warranty period.

Owners can choose from three eSENSEtials servicing tiers: Base, Interim and Full, all of which include the same core benefits.

All work will be undertaken by trained Hyundai technicians, plus all applicable engine management software updates, and a two-year Hyundai warranty on all parts fitted during the service.

In addition, owners receive an official Hyundai stamp in the vehicle&apos;s service book and have the car&apos;s Digital Work Record updated.

One of the most significant benefits is the inclusion of 12 months free AA Roadside Assistance, offering year-round cover for breakdowns that occur more than 0.25 miles from home.</TEXT>
