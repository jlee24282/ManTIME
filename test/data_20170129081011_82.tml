<TITLE>A Note on Opera:  A German in Paris: Giacomo Meyerbeer and Grand Opra</TITLE>
<TEXT>Join the Goethe-Zentrum for their latest lecture in our A Note on Opera series as we look at A German in Paris: Giacomo Meyerbeer and Grand Opra. 
Giacomo Meyerbeer, born Jakob Liebmann Beer in Berlin in 1791, was a Jewish expatriate who immigrated to France, eventually becoming the dominant musical presence in the French capital for much of the 19th-century. He developed the genre of grand opra to its full scope, with its epic tone, sweeping historical narrative, huge casts, ballet, and special effects  including ice-skating on stage! 
 
His works have never completely gone into obscurity and are now slowly being revived. Regardless of how one finds this Andrew Lloyd Webber of French opera, his influence is palpable in works by later composers as diverse as Richard Wagner, Giuseppe Verdi, and Modest Mussorgsky. 
 
Theyll be looking at Meyerbeers life as a Jewish composer living in early 19th-century Germany and then his later life as the Toast of Paris, defining exactly what is grand opra and how it evolved by examining bits of Meyerbeers Les Huguenots and Le prophte. Meyerbeers influence on other opera traditions will also be illustrated. 
 
Course to be taught in English by David Kerr. No pre-existing knowledge of music required. 
 
Admission: $15.00 for members, $25.00 non-members.
