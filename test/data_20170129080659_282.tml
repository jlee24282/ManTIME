<TITLE>Letter to the editor: Internet use tax collection tough on small businesses</TITLE>
<TEXT>While I agree with Norman McNickles basic concept of collecting internet use tax, his article was clearly one-sided and he has apparently never had the experience of being involved in online sales ("State law to collect internet use tax is toothless," Jan. 19).

As a small-business owner I am involved in both local sales and online sales. I have no problem with collecting and remitting Oklahoma state sales tax. There is a handy online application that I use and it takes me about an hour to total up the monthly sales and remit the tax.
