<TEXT type="str">They built this city on the Rock and Roll -- of course we are talking about iHeart80s Party performers Starship . The band brought rock and roll to the SAP Center in San Jose this weekend (Jan. 28) where they had fans rocking out to some of their biggest hits.

Starship took the stage to perform &quot;Jane,&quot; &quot;Nothing&apos;s Gonna Stop Us Now,&quot; &quot;Sara,&quot; and &quot;Find Your Way Back.&quot; And it would not have been a proper Starship performance without their 1985 hit &quot;We Built this City,&quot; which hit No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. The group closed out the show with the catchy song.

At the very end of their performance, before the band walked off stage, lead singer Mickey Thomas said to the crowd, &quot;Remember, we are all citizens of this world.&quot; A sentiment certainly felt by many on the same day in particular following President Donald Trump&apos;s Immigration Ban, which sparked protest at airports across the country.
