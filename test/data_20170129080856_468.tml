<TITLE>Jefferson City residents arrested for drugs in Columbia</TITLE>
<TEXT>Two people from Jefferson City face possible drug charges in Boone County after they were arrested in Columbia early Saturday. 
 
Boone County Sheriff's Department deputies reportedly observed a traffic and license plate violation by Alohn Griffin, 36, around 3 a.m. as he was driving in the 900 block of Vandiver Drive. After making contact with him, they became suspicious he might have illegal drugs in the vehicle, which they searched and allegedly found several controlled substances, drug paraphernalia and a firearm. 
 
Deputies report Griffin had a prior felony conviction prohibiting him from having a gun. They also allegedly found additional controlled substances on him after taking him to the Boone County Jail. 
 
The sheriff's department is seeking charges against Griffin of trafficking drugs, delivery of a controlled substance, unlawful use of drug paraphernalia, unlawful use of a weapon, driving while revoked and failure to register a motor vehicle. 
 
Zora Reeves, 35, of Jefferson City, who was a passenger in Griffin's car, also was arrested on suspicion of trafficking and delivery of controlled substances and possessing drug paraphernalia and a weapon. 
 
Both remained in jail Saturday afternoon pending a judge setting bond in the cases.</TEXT>
