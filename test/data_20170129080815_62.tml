Durant added 23 points and Klay Thompson scored 16 to give Golden State its eighth straight win over its Southern California rival. 
 
Blake Griffin scored 20 points for the struggling Clippers, who have lost four of five since star point guard Chris Paul went down with a torn ligament in his left thumb.
