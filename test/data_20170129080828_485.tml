Madonna found herself in the familiar territory of controversy last weekend when her Women&apos;s March speech , which was about how anger is not the answer, drew criticism for its fiery rhetoric. In it, Madonna dropped a lot of profanity and said, &quot;Yes, I have thought an awful thought about blowing up the White House.&quot; 
 
Now, Cyndi Lauper is joining those who didn&apos;t care for Madonna&apos;s way of expressing herself, saying, &quot;I don&apos;t think it served our purpose.&quot; 
 
The singer appeared on Watch What Happens Live on Wednesday, arguing, &quot;Anger is not better than clarity and humanity. That is what opens people&apos;s minds.&quot; 
 
Lauper then made Madonna the ugly step-sister to Scarlett Johansson&apos;s Cinderella , continuing, &quot;When you want to change people&apos;s minds, you have to share your real story like Scarlett Johansson. She shared her story. It was clear. It was eloquent. Yelling doesn&apos;t. It just jacks people up.&quot; 
 
Okay, but &quot;girls just wanna have fundamental rights advocated for them with due restraint&quot; is going to be hard to fit on a t-shirt.

Angry giraffes fight over female 
 
THESE super heavyweights bring a new meaning to the term ‘head banger’ after they were filmed fighting by an eagle eyed game ranger. The fully grown male giraffes were snapped by field guide and YouTuber, Rob Vamplew, 39, during a safari at Idube Game Reserve, South Africa. The young males battled it out to exert dominance which would guarantee them mating rights in the area. A male giraffe can weigh up to 3000lbs and reach a dizzying height of 18 feet, and fights between males often end in death.
