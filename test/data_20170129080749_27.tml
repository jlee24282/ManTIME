BURLINGTON, Vt. 
 
Former Boston Red Sox Pitcher Bronson Arroyo and Oakland's outfielder Sam Fuld teamed with the Vermont Lake Monsters in support of SLAMT1D, a Vermont based nonprofit with a mission to help those fighting type 1 diabetes. 
 
The Snowballs and Baseballs event at the Hilton Burlington served as a platform for Fuld, who has been battling type 1 diabetes since he was 10, to provide words of encouragement to youth fighting alongside him.</TEXT>
