<TEXT type="str">Nearly 30 vehicles rammed into each other causing a pile up on the Jaipur-Agra highway on Sunday morning, leaving one dead and 28 others injured. 
 
The incident occurred due to poor visibility as heavy fog enveloped the highway. Of the injured, five are reportedly in critical condition. 
 
“The accident happened in the morning when almost 30 cars crashed into each other on Jaipur- Agra Highway due to fog,” ANI quoted Jaipur’s additional commissioner of police as saying. 
 
The injured were taken to hospitals, police said, adding all steps were being taken to provide medical treatment to the victims.
