<content type="str">BEND, Ore. - Bend police and fire medics used a new method of CPR to save the life of an 87-year-old man who was choking at a downtown restaurant Saturday evening, officials said. 
 
Officers and medics were dispatched around 6:40 p.m. to the Jackalope Grill at 750 Northwest Lava Road regarding a patron who was choking, said police Sgt. Adam Juhnke. 
 
Three police officers were already in the downtown area on foot patrol when the call came out, Juhnke said. They arrived within two minutes and immediately began high-performance CPR. 
 
The new method of CPR emphasizes deep, consistent compressions for up to an hour. The officers also effectively utilized an Automated External Defibrillator from one of their patrol vehicles. 

The officers continued high-performance CPR until Bend Fire medics arrived a short time later and continued to administer life-saving efforts, Juhnke said. 
 
The man had a positive response to the life-saving efforts after medics were able to remove the food obstruction. He regained consciousness on the scene and was transported to St. Charles Bend, where he was reported to be in stable condition and able to speak to police and medics. 

Bend police and fire worked together to save the man&apos;s life, Juhnke said. Police also thanked the patrons of the Jackalope Grill who helped try to remove the obstruction before officers arrived.</content>
