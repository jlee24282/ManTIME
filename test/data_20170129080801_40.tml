<TEXT type="str">Pep Guardiola has hailed Gabriel Jesus as &quot;the future of Manchester City&quot; following their 3-0 win over Crystal Palace in the Emirates FA Cup on Saturday

The 19-year-old was signed from Palmeiras last summer but only linked up with City this month

Jesus played all 90 minutes at Selhurst Park and set up Raheem Sterling for the first goal of the fourth round clash

After the game Guardiola sang the praises of the Brazilian teenager

&quot;He helped us a lot he is so aggressive even though he’s not a tall guy&quot; he said

&quot;It’s his first game and it’s not easy for him to communicate because he does not speak English so we need time but he makes a lot of movement the first pass the first goal his assist was outstanding&quot;

There are doubts over Sergio Aguero’s fitness ahead of their Premier League game with West Ham on Wednesday and Jesus is favourite to start with Kelechi Iheanacho left out of the squad for two matches in a row now</TEXT>
