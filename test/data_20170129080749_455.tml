<TEXT type="str">Dubai World Cup winner California Chrome ended his storied career on a disappointing note on Saturday as Arrogate celebrated his new status as the world’s best racehorse with a narrow victory at the $12 million (Dh44m) Pegasus World Cup in Florida.

Hall of Fame jockey Mike Smith piloted four-year-old colt Arrogate into the lead with a dominant run around the final turn and he pulled away down the straight to win by three-and-a-half lengths.

Arrogate covered the 1810 metres distance at Gulfstream Park in an unofficial time of 1 minute, 47.61 seconds to secure the $7m first prize.

Shaman Ghost finished second, with Neolithic battling home third.

California Chrome, meanwhile, faded down the stretch in the final race of a standout career that included victories at the 2014 Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes and the 2016 Dubai World Cup.

It was a disappointing climax to a much anticipated repeat showdown between Arrogate and Chrome, who had placed one-two after a thrilling finish to the Breeders’ Cup Classic three months ago at Santa Anita in California.

&quot;Another incredible performance,&quot; Smith told NBC Sports about Arrogate, who started from the one hole as favourite.

&quot;I was able to use the first turn to our advantage, stayed on the rail ... it was just a matter of getting the trip.

&quot;I looked halfway down the backside and I saw (jockey) Victor (Espinoza) having the nudge on Chrome a little. He had me right where he wanted me but Chrome just didn’t fire his race today at all.

&quot;Believe me, that’s not the California Chrome I know. He would have been on top of me. I was able to tip out and he (Arrogate) was gone after that. I don’t mean any disrespect to the other good horses, but he got to gear down the last 100 yards.&quot;

In a blow to racing fans in the UAE, trainer Bob Baffert has already ruled Arrogate out of competing at the Dubai World Cup.

&quot;I wouldn’t take him to Dubai,&quot; he said. &quot;We bought him for American racing, and with his pedigree we want him to stay in America.&quot;

Chrome, North America’s all-time leading money earner and the Horse of the Year in 2014 and 2016, ended his stellar career placed ninth in a 12-runner field, his worst ever finish in his 27th race.
