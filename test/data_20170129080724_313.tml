Why? 
 
To celebrate Grambling&apos;s Celebration Bowl victory over North Carolina Central from December. 
 
Players and coaches were greeted with performances from the legendary band and in return provided beads and candy to everyone waiting in the chilly temperatures.Â  
 
&quot;This is huge,&quot; says Tigers head football coach Broderick Fobbs. &quot;This community has meant so much to Grambling State University. And, it&apos;s just good to get out here and celebrate with each and everyone of the people from the Grambling community. These kids and this coaching staff and everyone at the university worked so hard to being this thing to pass and we&apos;re just excited to be the 2016 National Champions.&quot;</content>
