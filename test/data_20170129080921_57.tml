<TEXT type="str">NEW YORK: Snap Inc, the secretive technology company that owns the popular messaging service Snapchat, is due to reveal its financials within a week as it moves toward its eagerly awaited initial public offering (IPO), sources familiar with the situation said on Friday. 
 
The Venice, California-based company will publish the registration document it secretly filed with U.S regulators last autumn, containing a dossier of tightly held finances and its plans for operating as a public company. 
 
The sources, who cautioned that Snapchat&apos;s plans may still change, asked not to be named because the information is private. A spokeswoman for Snap Inc declined to comment. 
 
Snap Inc expects to go public as soon as March and could be valued at $20 billion to $25 billion, based on reports of its latest round of funding, which would make it the largest U.S. technology IPO since Facebook Inc&apos;s in 2012. 
 
Snapchat has already confidentially filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission under the U.S. Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act. 
 
Under that law, companies with less than $1 billion in revenue can secretly file for an IPO, allowing them to quietly test investor appetite. 
 
A company must make its initial IPO prospectus filing, officially known as an S-1, public at least 15 days before beginning its so-called &quot;road show,&quot; in which it markets the IPO to investors. was posted in Business of TheNews International - https://www.thenews.com.pk on January 29, 2017 and was last updated on January 29, 2017.
