<TITLE>H.S. HOCKOMOCK HOCKEY: Attleboro rallies on ice, but can't finish off Taunton</TITLE>
<TEXT>TAUNTON - Despite numerous trips into the attacking zone and putting the puck on net, the Attleboro High hockey team came up short Saturday in a 3-2 loss to Taunton High in a Hockomock League game.

"We're getting offensive opportunities, but just not finishing," said AHS coach Mark Homer, whose Bombardiers had a 32-21 advantage in shots, but were blanked in the first period, along with a pair of power-play chances and never led.

Attleboro (5-7-1) rallied from a 2-0 deficit after the first period of play. Freshman goalie Derek Rivet (18 saves) blanked the Tigers in the second period, but AHS surrendered the game-winning goal to Taunton on a power play with four minutes left.

C.J. Elliott tied the game for AHS at 2-2 for the Bombardiers in the seventh minute of the third period with Cam Littig assisting. AHS got on the scoreboard in the second period with Jake Parker scoring off of a Kyle McCabe pass.

The Bombardiers lace up their skates again Sunday at the New England Sports Village for a 3 p.m. faceoff against Foxboro.
