<TEXT type="str">The wonderful &quot;As I See it&quot; exposition (Jan. 10) by Paul S. Ropp, professor of History at Clark, was welcome and cogent. There is so much being written that is either a polemic or a criticism of the recent and current political scene that it is refreshing to read something so very reasonable and well written. 
 
I also would like to say that my husband and I appreciate Dianne Williamson&apos;s witty and engaging columns. It is true that we agree with her point of view, however, even if we didn&apos;t we would have to appreciate her fun way of expressing herself. Thanks, Dianne, for your efforts to enlighten as well as amuse us.
