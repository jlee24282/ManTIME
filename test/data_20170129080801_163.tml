Kalua Pork with Shiitake Sauce: almost paradise using ingredients from Almost Heaven. 
   
Some may argue there is no comparison between West Virginia, our nation’s 35th state, and Hawaii, our 50th state, but I noted many similarities on a recent trip to Oahu that coincided with the 75 th anniversary of Pearl Harbor, the Honolulu Marathon and a series of Garth Brooks concerts. 
 
This was not my first trip to Hawaii, nor my husband’s. During his final years as an archaeologist with the Army Corps of Engineers, he headed two MIA recovery missions —one to Vietnam and one to Laos — both based out of Hickam Air Force Base. Honolulu became his second home during that time. There is no better traveling companion than an anthropologist who is familiar with a place, its people and culture. 
 
Both states would probably tie when asked which has the friendliest people or the most breathtaking scenery. As West Virginia develops our tourism industry, we could take a few tips from Hawaii, since tourism is now the major source of state income, drawing billions of dollars a year in visitor expenditures. Tourism-related industries like hotels, transportation, retail shops and restaurants have grown to provide more than 150,000 jobs for the state economy. 
 
Tourism has gradually replaced traditional agriculture as the primary income provider. Last year, after 180 years, the sugar industry shut down in Hawaii. Acreage once used for sugar production is now being converted to smaller crops and a variety of agricultural uses including community garden parks where residents can grow their own food. 
 
Agriculture still remains important to the economy of Hawaii and West Virginia, but it has become more diversified. We often think about crops like sugarcane, pineapple, macadamia nuts and coffee when we think about Hawaii. However, Hawaii now concentrates on specialized crops, which include ginger, onions, sweet potatoes and lettuce. 
 
To promote agricultural diversification, the West Virginia Department of Agriculture and West Virginia State University Extension have been researching and reviving many of the plant and animal industries that were once a part of our state’s rich and booming agricultural history, including white potatoes, sweet potatoes, hops and apples. 
 
West Virginia’s departments of Commerce and Agriculture are now promoting the state’s agritourism industry. We could learn a thing or two from Hawaii, which hosted the first international AgriTourism Symposium at the College of Hawaiian Language: Ka Haka ‘Ulu O Ke’eliko Lani, in Hilo, this year. 
 
Industry experts shared forecasts, trends and tips on competing on a global stage. Visitors from many regions of the world shared their experiences and perspectives on how they have expanded agricultural operations in innovative ways to increase profitability. 
 
Farmers in West Virginia and Hawaii have opportunities to connect agriculture with travel and tourism that impact many businesses beyond lodging and restaurants. Agritourism gives farmers, small producers and home-based businesses a chance to be creative and enlarge their own operations. 
 
Farmers are recognizing the financial benefits of adding an agritourism component to their marketing plan, because visitors are looking for different experiences that connect them to food sources. Small farms become profitable and sustainable as a result. 
 
Many chefs in West Virginia and Hawaii showcase regional cuisine, capitalizing on fresh, local and culturally inspired dishes. They support and source ingredients from small farms and identify the growers. Both states have farmers market associations that promote a rural lifestyle and agricultural products. 
 
Peter Merriman is considered the big kahuna of farm-driven restaurants in Hawaii. He started a restaurant in Waimea and now has five eateries on three Hawaiian Islands. When he started 25 years ago, he had trouble finding fresh local fruits and vegetables. 
 
He had to encourage growers to plant the items he needed. Farmers complied and grew niche crops, many items never grown before. As tourism increased, farmers and restaurateurs realized a profit since there was a market for higher-quality foods. 
 
West Virginia chef Dale Hawkins is most often accredited with building enthusiasm for the state’s regional cuisine. While executive chef at Stonewall Resort, he innovatively combined provincial fare with ethnically inspired dishes, creating a new Appalachian cuisine, putting West Virginia on the epicurean map. 
 
During a cooking demonstration at the Feast of Seven Fishes, in Fairmont, another farm-to-table crusader, Chef Marion Ohlinger, of Morgantown’s Hill and Hollow Restaurant, spoke about the immigrants who came to West Virginia to work in the steel and mining industries. Unable to find the ingredients for the recipes they brought from their home countries, newcomers improvised using local ingredients. 
 
Fresh water fish were substituted for baccala and Bloody Butcher cornmeal was used to make polenta. He noted there were many occasions when local ingredients were used to create global flavors. 
 
The same was true with immigrants in Hawaii. Ethnic cuisine was adapted to use fruits and vegetables from backyard gardens. Un-ripe mangos were combined with coconut milk to make chutney. As a result, a cosmopolitan/fusion cuisine evolved. 
 
Today, Hawaii and West Virginia are witnessing culinary innovations started by pioneering chefs. They looked at classic cuisine for inspiration to create imaginative, exhilarating new dining experiences. 
 
Home cooks can learn a lot from these pioneers. It is important to support local producers and the state’s economy by using more fresh ingredients. And don’t be afraid to improvise when a particular ingredient is not available.
