Victoria is bracing itself for an extremely hot and dry day on Monday, with conditions that are feared could lead to serious fires. 
 
A total fire ban has been issued for the entire state, the first time this summer, with temperatures expected to reach the high 30s and low 40s across the state. 
 
CFA deputy chief officer Alen Slijepcevic says dry conditions, a strong northwesterly wind, &quot;cured&quot; grassfields and an unstable atmosphere mean serious fires are &quot;quite likely&quot;. 
 
He reminded residents not to light any fires in the open air, such as barbecues or campfires. 
 
&quot;It all depends on the conditions. If lightning doesn&apos;t occur and people do the right things, we might not have any issues,&quot; he told AAP. 
 
However, he says the CFA is ready for any potential disasters, with 72 aircraft ready to go, including helicopters and fixed-wing craft carrying water, foam and flame retardants. 
 
The CFA says conditions on Monday are expected to be their worst so far this summer, with an extreme fire danger rating northeast and severe across much of the rest of the state. 
 
CFA Chief Officer Steve Warrington said in a statement that any fire that breaks out on Monday could be difficult to control. 
 
He says grasslands around Melbourne and Geelong are of particular concern, along with Gippsland and the northeast foothills, and the Goldfields and Wimmera regions. 
 
Melbourne can expect a top of 34C with a late cool change and a 40 per cent chance of rain.
