&quot;I&apos;ll go to jail if I have to,&quot; said Griswold, speaking on the hypothetical situation that federal agents come to her congregation doors while housing immigrants. 
 
The pastor at Parkside Community Church, United Church of Christ, in the Land Park area of Sacramento, says her congregation will be discussing joining other congregations in Sacramento when it comes to becoming a sanctuary if need be. 
 
&quot;As silly as it sounds, one of the reasons why we might not be able to do it is because we don&apos;t have the shower facility, so it&apos;s logistics,&quot; Griswold said. 
 
Of the 50 congregations that belong to Sacramento Area Congregations Together, about half have already pledged some kind of services to immigrants in case a federal raid is brought forth by President Trump.</TEXT>
