<content type="str">Haskell Arthur Moore, 83, went to be with the Lord on Jan. 22, 2017, two days after celebrating 39 years of happy marriage to his wife, Patricia Sheppard Moore. Haskell is survived by his wife, Patricia Moore; his stepchildren, Kenneth and wife Mary Steger, Christopher and wife Carey Steger, and Kathryn P. Brisart; and stepgrandchildren, Jennifer, Stacey, James and Campbell. He is also survived by siblings, Geraldine Reeder, Robbie and husband Larry Terry, Elaine and husband Frank Bell and Ron Moore, as well as numerous nieces and nephews. He was preceded in death by his parents, Robbie and Arthur Moore; siblings, Harold Moore, Sally Douglas, Aline Adcock and Ruth Moore; and stepgranddaughter, Kristen Steger. 
 
A native of eastern Oklahoma, Haskell (lovingly referred to as &quot;Hack&quot;) graduated from Spiro High School in 1951, and attended Northeastern State University in Tahlequah. He left college to play baseball in Modesto, Calif., eventually joining a farm team for the Cincinnati Reds. Following a two year stint in semi-pro baseball, Haskell joined the United States Navy, where he served honorably for six years. During his time in the Navy, he continued to play baseball and taught English in addition to his other duties. Following military service, Haskell engaged in various business pursuits, eventually relocating to Houston, Texas, where he stayed for 21 years. It was during that time that he met and married his wife of 39 years, Patricia. 
 
In 1996, Haskell and Patricia retired to Waveland, Miss., to live near the beach. They enjoyed nine wonderful years there and viewed it as one of the happiest times of their lives. Their retirement was interrupted in 2005 when Hurricane Katrina demolished their home. Having experienced one hurricane too many, they relocated to Fort Smith. 
 
Haskell was known to all as a kind and gracious man, quick with a joke and generous with his laughter. For a time, he parlayed these traits into a part-time job as an auctioneer — something he enjoyed immensely. He had a gentle spirit, and would pull his car over to rescue a lost animal or stop on the sidewalk to help a stranger. Love and kindness are the qualities that most epitomized his life. The world is a poorer place without his generous spirit. 
 
Haskell&apos;s family expresses special appreciation to the skilled professionals of Peachtree Hospice who provided loving care to Haskell as he transitioned from this life to the next. 
 
To honor Haskell&apos;s wishes, a private memorial service is planned for the spring in Waveland, Miss. 
 
Arrangements are under the direction of Edwards Funeral Home.</content>
