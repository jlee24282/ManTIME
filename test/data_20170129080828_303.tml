<TEXT type="str">YAKIMA, Wash. -- The Yakima City Council is toying with the concept of creating a multicultural center that would highlight Latino influence on local culture and the economy. 
   
Because the idea is in its conceptual stage, there’s no firm sense of cost, location or even exactly what might be featured at a center. 
   
“We still have to work on the issue and determine where funding might come from, but it’s gratifying that there’s been a convergence of community and council interest,” said City Manager Cliff Moore. 
   
Mayor Kathy Coffey said a center would help explain Latino history and its importance to the Valley. 
   
“We really just wanted to zero in on a place that would look at the Hispanic culture in Yakima so that we could show the art and the culture and have some place that our young people could go and have a point of pride and serve as a gathering place,” she said. 
   
Well over 40 percent of the city’s residents are Latino, many who came to work in the agricultural sector. With that, they have brought art, music, food and holidays, which have melded into the culture of the region over time. 
   
Moore said some ideas for the center, intended to attract tourists and educate visitors about Yakima’s cultural history, include a museum that explains the Latino influence in the city or a mercado-like facility that actually drives economic activity. 
   
City economic development director Sean Hawkins said the organizations involved in the creation include the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, Rural Community Development Resources Board and the city. They will have to work to define the scope of the project and what it could look like, he said. 
   
“There’s kind of some gray area around it. If you tell me what a business incubator looks like, I can visualize it, but I think people are all over the board with what this will look like,” Hawkins said. “But having the lead on this being the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and then seeing how the city and RCDR can work with this group, we can really develop a home place for Yakima’s cultural history.” 
   
In talking with residents, Coffey said, she has seen a lot of community support for including the center in the city’s economic development plan. 
   
The council is expected to vote on a city economic development plan, which includes the multicultural center concept, at their Feb. 7 meeting. Including the center in the plan would merely add it to a list of economic priority goals. It would not set aside funding nor designate a timeline for development.</TEXT>
