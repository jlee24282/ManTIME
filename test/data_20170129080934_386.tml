<content type="str">I am more pleased to have a Republican Congress than I am to have a &quot;third-party&quot; president. With Congress, we can be virtually assured that we will have a federal judiciary populated by constitutionalist judges whose rulings will positively influence the direction of this country for years to come. While I wish the new administration all possible success, I do not believe that President Trump can deliver on his promise to &quot;Make America Great Again.&quot; 

The greatness of a society is determined by the character of its people. Character is built on the foundation of individual responsibility, self-discipline, and firm moral beliefs. These are values that can only be nurtured in the home, by a society&apos;s families. Yet, America&apos;s families have been under siege for decades. Unless we find a way to restore, revive, and rebuild the American family, no initiatives developed by the Trump administration can hope to achieve the renewed greatness he has promised. 

Trump&apos;s egotism was revealed when, in his inaugural address, he failed to call on the American people to take on the responsibility to &quot;Make America Great Again.&quot; A civilization&apos;s greatness percolates up through society. It cannot be bestowed on us from above.

Kellyanne Conway, the former N.J. Blueberry Princess and now White House chief apologist for the besieged Trump administration, has the George Orwell readers grinning from ear to ear. Straight out of the &quot;Ministry of Truth,&quot; Conway has given birth to the infamous &quot;alternative facts&quot; description of the manipulation of factual events that do not agree with the controlled version that the Trump handlers wish to cloud the minds of the populace (&quot;A new matter of fact,&quot; Monday). 

With their attempted coercion of the White House press corps and disdain for the free press in general, look for Trump&apos;s propaganda minister (press secretary Sean Spicer) and Conway to spin legitimate questions and opposing views into a dark abyss where the light of reality is extinguished. First Amendment - who needs it? Our new leaders will tell us what we need to know.

How refreshing. We have a president who, since his inauguration, has worked diligently to fulfill promises he made during his campaign. Thank you, President Trump.

As a constituent concerned about public education in Pennsylvania, I&apos;ve been trying to contact Sen. Pat Toomey&apos;s office for weeks to discuss his position on Betsy DeVos for education secretary. I&apos;ve left countless messages at his offices all over Pennsylvania and in Washington. On the rare occasion that I speak with someone, he or she knows nothing, has no comment, and can&apos;t point me in a direction to get the answers I&apos;m seeking. Toomey is my voice on the Senate floor, and I can&apos;t even reach him to find out how he&apos;ll be voting on my daughter&apos;s future.

January is National Mentoring Month. As the principal of Potter-Thomas Promise Academy in Philadelphia, I am privileged to witness the impact that mentoring has on my students, thanks to the &quot;Beyond School Walls&quot; program. 

Twice a month, 60 students, grades 4 through 8, engage in one-on-one mentoring sessions with their Big Brothers and Big Sisters at the Comcast Center. Our students see their &quot;Bigs&quot; at work in an office environment, helping to develop emotional, social, and academic skills that many students lack. 

Emotionally, Bigs serve as an outlet and a confidante, allowing their &quot;littles&quot; to open up. Interacting with Bigs from various walks of life vastly improves students&apos; social and communication skills. Academically, Bigs serve as accountability partners, ensuring that their mentees remain focused and determined to succeed. 

We are grateful to Big Brothers Big Sisters and Comcast. Think of the impact we could have on Philadelphia students if more companies participated in such a program.
