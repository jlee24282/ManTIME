<content type="str">Indian TV channels Star Jalsha, Zee Bangla and Star Plus can be broadcast in Bangladesh as the High Court has rejected a petition seeking ban on them. The bench of justices Moyeenul Islam Chowdhury and JBM Hassan gave the order on Sunday after concluding the hearing on a previous rule issued on the matter.

Star Jalsha and Star Plus were represented by Abdul Matin Khashru while Samsul Hasan stood for Zee Bangla.

Deputy Attorney General Motahar Hossain Saju argued for the State.

&quot;The verdict means there&apos;s no more legal barriers for airing of the three Indian channels in Bangladesh,&quot; Saju told the media.

The petitioner&apos;s counsel, however, said they will challenge the verdict. 

&quot;We will appeal in the higher court and hope to get justice,&quot; said lawyer Ekhlas Uddin. 

In August 2014, Supreme Court lawyer Shahin Ara Laily filed the petition seeking a rule asking why broadcast of those channels should not be banned.

On Oct 19 the same year, a High Court bench heard the matter and issued a rule.

Secretaries to the information and home ministries, BTRC chairman, BTV director general were among those ordered to come up with explanations.

After four days of hearing on the rule between Jan 8 and 11 this year, the High Court gave its decision on Sunday.</content>
