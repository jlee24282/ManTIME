<content type="str">Pepperdine’s Lamond Murray , the leading scorer in the WCC at nearly 21 points per game, scored just four points in the first half. He finished with 12 points on 5-of-14 shooting. 
 
Nigel Williams-Goss drew the starting on assignment on Murray, but Jordan Mathews and Silas Melson also saw extended time on the talented 6-foot-5 wing. 
 
“He’s a guy that’s going to make some money at this game next year,” Few said. “Our bigs did a really nice job of hedging on screens and pindowns. He’s a handful.” 
 
Murray didn’t score until midway through the first half. He had three baskets early in the second half but Gonzaga was already pulling away. 
 
“Just staying in front and contest his shots at the top,” Mathews said. 
 
Murray had 19 points in the December loss to the Zags.</content>
