<content type="str">Gwynne Dyer’s assertion that automation is the cause of unemployment in America is blatant nonsense ( Jan. 22 Forum). If that were true, why would it be necessary to move jobs overseas only to have automation perform these jobs? They just as easily could have kept them here in America.

Further, are these factories transferred overseas automated? I don’t think so. They give employment to the inhabitants of those countries. The leaders of those countries would not be so stupid as to have automated factories, with no real benefit to them.

The underlying premise of offshoring is to have economic power of such magnitude in those countries in order to be able to influence their political leadership. That way, Wall Street, the City of London and the Council on Foreign Relations could be in a strong position to influence or even control the policies of these countries. It is a subtle form of economic imperialism. Gunboat diplomacy is not viable, certainly not as a first resort; it would be too obvious.

Lower prices for American consumers as well as lower production costs for companies are a secondary consideration.
