Alaska State Troopers have said Dillingham police found a woman who allegedly imported drugs and alcohol into Togiak. 
 
In an online dispatch, Alaska State Troopers wrote that Togiak Tribal police identified Shaina Clark, 22, as a suspect in drug and alcohol importation in mid-January. 
 
On January 17, Dillingham Police contacted Clark regarding a separate investigation, and found five bottles of alcohol while executing a search warrant into the suitcase she had with her in Togiak.</TEXT>
