<content type="str">Jesse Lingard has paid tribute to Wigan Athletic manager Warren Joyce ahead of Manchester United’s clash against the Latics in the fourth round of the FA Cup at Old Trafford on Sunday afternoon.  
The Red Devils will hope to make a swift return to winning ways this weekend after a surprise 2-1 loss to Premier League strugglers Hull City in the second leg of EFL Cup semi-final at KCOM Stadium. 
 
While Manchester United still progressed to the League Cup final thanks to their 3-2 aggregate win, Jose Mourinho’s players saw their 17-game unbeaten run come to an end. 
 
Lingard played under Joyce during the Wigan manager’s nine-year spell coach for Manchester United’s Reserves team, which allowed the England midfielder to establish himself as a promising talent. 
 
Speaking to Manchester United website about the influence that Joyce had on his career, Lingard said: 
 
“It was always going to take a bit of time for Joycey but Wigan have had good results in their last few games. It will be another tough game for us. Anything can happen in the cups so we’ve got to play our game on the day. 
 
“Joycey was great for me. He gave me my chance in the Reserves and I respect him as a manager and I still keep in touch with him now. 
 
“I think he will succeed at Wigan. I’ve worked under him and I’ve seen the coaching he did and the reserve-league titles he won here. He always communicated well with the lads. As soon as I went out on loan he was calling me and coming to watch me at games. I think communication is vital for a player when you go away from a club – he always looked after the young lads.”
