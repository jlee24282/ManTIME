<TEXT type="str">Allardyce stated in his pre-match press conference that he would &quot;..rotate the squad&quot; with the imminence of the Bournemouth match in mind. He then puts out a midfield with at least four &apos;dead men walking&apos; to somewhat prove his point yet plays our best full backs, risking both to injury. Lo and behold, Schlupp picks up an injury! Genius.</TEXT>
