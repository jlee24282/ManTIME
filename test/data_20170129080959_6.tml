A draw seems the most likely outcome when play resumes on the fourth and final day of the Sunfoil Series match between the Multiply Titans and the BuildNat Cape Cobras in Centurion on Sunday. 
 
Live Scoring: Titans v Cobras

Openers Aiden Markram and Heino Kuhn will pick up their knocks on 6 and 14 respectively.
