<content type="str">Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp admits it is not possible to get any lower after a second cup exit in the space of three days. 
  
A 2-1 home FA Cup fourth round loss to 18th-placed Championship side Wolves after a defeat to Southampton in an EFL Cup semi-final came on the back of a first home Premier League reverse in a year against Swansea, which saw the Reds also fall behind in the title race. 
Klopp accepted full responsibility for the latest upset and refused to sugar-coat the situation he now finds himself in having lost three successive matches for the first time since taking over in October 2015. 

 
However, he believes it has to form the basis to spark a rejuvenation of a side which has won just once - against League Two Plymouth - in 2017. 
&quot;If someone asks if this is the lowest point of my Liverpool time until now, I don&apos;t know,&quot; he said. &quot;But if it is it is a perfect moment to turn because it is not possible to go lower. 
&quot;I don&apos;t think it is the right time to talk about being positive or optimistic. In this moment we feel really bad. It is absolutely right that it feels bad and we have to use it in this moment.&quot;</content>
