<content type="str">FLORENCE, S.C. – Two Florence County sheriff’s deputies have received the Medal of Valor from the South Carolina Sheriff’s Association. 
   
The two were honored during a special ceremony Thursday evening in Columbia. 
   
This is the second Medal of Valor that Cpl. William Odom and Deputy Tyler Urquhart will have received since September when the pair saved a woman’s life after her vehicle collided with a tractor-trailer and began burning. 
   
On Sunday, Sept. 25, Urquhart and Odom were parked in their patrol vehicles near the Interstate 95 and U.S. 52 interchange. It was around 11:30 p.m. when the men heard a call about a collision on northbound I-95 involving a passenger vehicle that had rear-ended an 18-wheeler. 
   
“We just happened to be two and a half three minutes out,” Urquhart said. “When we came up the hill on I-95, that’s when you could see it. The car was wedged underneath the trailer and was starting to catch on fire.” 
   
Urquhart was in the southbound lanes when he saw the crash scene and knew he didn’t have time to double back, so he parked his patrol car and ran across the median. Odom arrived at the same time as Urquhart and both saw the driver was still trapped in the burning vehicle. 
   
Odom grabbed a fire extinguisher from the driver of the tractor-trailer while Urquhart searched for a way inside the burning vehicle. As Urquhart broke the rear driver-side window, Odom fought the flames, trying to keep them away from the driver, who was struggling to free herself. 
   
“The driver’s door was pinned so we couldn’t get it open,” Urquhart said. “We had to bust the back glass out and then I reached in there and open the door. I reached in to lower her seat. Everything slowed down at that point.” 
   
“The fire was coming into the driver’s compartment. I just kept knocking it down, trying to keep it down,” Odom said. “Then we had the 18-wheeler tire that was on fire and I said, “If one of them blows it’s going to throw fire all over us.’ It was a mess.” 
   
The deputies were able to free the woman just moments before both her vehicle and the tractor-trailer were engulfed in flames. 
   
“All I could think was two more minutes,” Odom said. “Let’s say we weren’t at 95 and 52 or if we would’ve went down and doubled back, there’s no way she’d have made it.” 
   
The woman survived but suffered serious injuries during the crash. She was taken to a hospital, where she was treated and released. Neither of the men knows what the ultimate cause of the wreck was. 
   
The deputies haven’t heard from the victim herself since the crash, but said they have been contacted by her family members, who praised them for their bravery and expressed their unending gratitude for their life-saving actions. 
   
“Her daughter sent me a message on Facebook and thanked me,” Odom said. “It means a lot. It feels good to be appreciated. It keeps you motivated to get out here and keep working hard.” 
   
“I’ve spoken to both her daughters,” Urquhart said. “That was the most encouraging part of all of it, the family reaching out. That’s when things start to sink in that you really made a difference.” 
   
The men have received multiple awards and recognition for their heroism including a resolution of appreciation by the Florence County Council and two Medal of Valor awards: one from the state sheriff’s association and the other from the state law enforcement association. Media outlets from across the state reported their story. But the deputies don’t see themselves as heroes at all. 
   
For Urquhart, the recognition and publicity are not something he expected or wanted. Urquhart said he was just doing his job. 
   
““It’s nice to get a good job every now and then but this is overwhelming to say the least,” Urquhart said. “Everybody gets that once in a lifetime opportunity and this was it.” 
   
For Odom, saving a life just creates a deeper passion for his career as a law enforcement officer. 
   
“You don’t forget it,” Odom said. “It makes you love your job more and appreciate it. 
   
“When you save a life, it makes everything worthwhile.”</content>
