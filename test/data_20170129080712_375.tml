What are your earliest memories of Port of Spain? 
 
My late grandfather Aldric taking me to feed the homeless on Fredrick Street. 
 
What’s the most memorable meal that you have enjoyed in Port of Spain? 
 
The very first time I visited the Breakfast Shed; it was the first time I learned the tradition of eating curry crab and dumplings. 
 
What would you do if you were mayor of Port of Spain for a day? 
 
Implement a toll for all vehicular traffic into the capital, invest in more efficient and modern parking facilities, and with the tolls and fines accrued feed and clothe the homeless. 
 
What would be your recommendations to a first-time visitor to Port of Spain? 
 
Visit the Breakfast Shed for authentic local Creole food; a long-time institution on Port of Spain’s bustling waterfront, the Breakfast Shed is located two buildings down from the Hyatt Regency Trinidad on Wrightson Road. 
 
For the rest of 2017, ‘chilling in the West Indies’ is about to look like... 
 
Visiting the non-English-speaking islands of the Caribbean, such as Curacao, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Haiti, Aruba, Bonaire – learning the different types of patois. 
 
As a digital influencer, how do you go about curating your likeness from photo to photo, online? 
 
I try for each photo to represent a moment or memory in my life so I can look back and reflect. My page is the modern-day scrapbook of my life. 
 
‘If not now, then when’ and ‘if not me, then who’ are tattooed on your forearms. Who is the man in your mirror? 
 
The man in the mirror is a soul searcher who is constantly looking for his authentic self. All too often we are consumed by our social lives, and swayed off the path to self-realisation. My tattoos also help to remind me to stay the journey of personal enlightenment. 
 
Say you were charged to lead a culinary renaissance in the Caribbean, how would it begin? 
 
Through education; making cooking and the culinary arts mandatory in the secondary-school curriculum. 
 
Eat your way across the globe in six international destinations and their corresponding cuisines.

You’re standing in a sea of costumed revellers at any given Carnival, in an undisclosed location, now compose an idyllic postcard. 
 
Dancing with two women, drinking a Stag beer, looking up at a fire-breathing Moko Jumbie, while Machel Montano performs on a music truck in the background, with a caption that reads, ‘Get your life together and come to Trini for Carnival’.</TEXT>
