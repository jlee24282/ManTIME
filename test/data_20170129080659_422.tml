Ex-Nkana striker Djunes Kanda has reportedly resurfaced in South Africa. 
 
According to media speculation in South Africa, Kanda could be on trial at PSL side Baroka FC. 
 
“Yes, he is a striker, but I don’t know his full name, we only know him as Julies. We got him from Mpumalanga (province). Some say he previously played for Zambian side Nkana FC,” Kickoff.com quoted a source at Baroka. 
 
Kanda joined Nkana in 2015 following his move from Indeni in 2014 where he scored 7 goals after joining them from Tanzanian club Azam. 
 
However his stay at Nkana was a flop where he managed only a goal in 2015 before dropping off the radar.
