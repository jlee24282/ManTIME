<TITLE>Golden State Warriors blast L.A. Clippers by 46 points</TITLE>
<TEXT>OAKLAND >> The catering trays were picked over, the uniforms were folded and packed away and most of the Clippers had already headed for the bus. But, still, in the middle of the locker room, the biggest reasons why the Clippers suffered their worst loss of the season were printed in easy to read letters. 
 
Long after the Golden State Warriors beat the Clippers 144-98, the white board  where the game plan is scribbled before each game  four two-word sentences were the only words not erased. 
 
Play hard. Play smart. Play together. Have fun. 
 
Theyre written there every game, and Saturday, theyd never been ignored more. 
 
I agree, the Clippers DeAndre Jordan said. Weve got to figure it out because if not, were going home early. 
 
That Jordan is reflecting on the teams fate in April while the calendar still says January perfectly encapsulates the Clippers issues against the Golden State Warriors  issues that couldnt have been easier to see if the team wore highlighter-green uniforms. 
 
Against the Warriors, everything seems bigger and more important because the Warriors  the NBAs best team  are better. 
 
The Clippers wins over San Antonio or Cleveland dont mean a thing inside Oracle Arena, where Golden States beaten the Clippers 10 straight times. Against the Warriors (who have now won the last eight meetings between the two, no matter the venue), the Clippers just freeze. 
 
You want it to so bad, you almost psyche yourself out of it, Blake Griffin said. 
 
Its why Austin Rivers unleashed a few four-letter words when asked if the Warriors hold a mental edge over his team. Its why two early fouls to Griffin feels like a death sentence. Its why the first pass that sails into the seats seems to lead to another and another. And, its why each Golden State basket  and boy, do these guys make baskets  feels like its worth two or three times the points it puts on the scoreboard. 
 
The mistakes kind of build, J.J. Redick said. As they take advantage of it, it becomes like an avalanche. You saw that at the end of the first half. 
 
The Warriors scored 17 points in 2 minutes and 38 seconds to close the second quarter, a stretch Redick described as some (expletive) that happened. 
 
Stephen Curry, who scored 25 of his 43 points in the third quarter, closed the first half by sinking a one-footed jumper from beyond midcourt to beat the buzzer. 
 
While its hard to simulate stopping Curry, the Clippers had the NBA equivalent to a bye week  three days off  to prepare. But once they got on the court, all the work and preparation simply got erased. 
 
 
A loss like this, its made a lot worse with the type of effort we gave in stretches. For the whole game, we didnt play with the right type of attitude. We kind of went through the motions, Griffin said. We didnt attack. We had two great days of practice where we were attacking. Guys were playing hard. Defensively we were great. And, then to come out here on the stage that you were practicing for and not to do it, its embarrassing. 
 
They didnt play hard enough. They didnt play smart enough. They werent together, and they sure didnt have fun. 
 
We were horrible, Doc Rivers said. I thought we gave in way too easy. You should never lose by this much in any game, in any situation. But theyre better right now. 
 
Until we improve, theyre going to keep beating us.</TEXT>
