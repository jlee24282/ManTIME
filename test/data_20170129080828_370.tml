Noah Allen scored a career-high 34 points as host Hawaii ran away from UC Santa Barbara and cruised to a 78-56 win in a Big West basketball game Saturday. 
 
The victory allowed UH to complete a five-game homestand with three wins, and improve to 3-4 in the Big West and 9-11 overall. UCSB is 1-6 and 3-16. A crowd announced at 5,498 at the Stan Sheriff Center saw Hawaii take control early in the first half and never threatened seriously in the second. 
 
It was the Rainbow Warriors’ largest margin of victory in conference play this season, and overall since beating Hawaii Hilo 86-55 in November. 
 
UH never trailed after Leland Green hit a 3-pointer to tie it at 10-all with 14:38 left in the first half, starting a 9-0 run that included two buckets by Ido Flaisher. Flaisher fouled out with eight points and seven rebounds. 
 
Max Heidegger hit a 3-pointer for the Gauchos to make it 16-13, but then Allen made a turnaround 12-footer, and UH steadily built on the lead. 
 
Heidegger scored 10 points to lead the Gauchos, who shot 29 percent from the floor in their fourth-consecutive loss. 
 
Hawaii led 37-29 at halftime as Allen scored 15 points and UH shot 54 percent from the floor. Green had eight first-half points, including another 3 on a buzzer-beater headed into the break. 
 
Gabe Vincent scored all nine of his points for UCSB before intermission.
