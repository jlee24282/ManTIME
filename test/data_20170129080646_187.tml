<content type="str">Republicans lawmakers gathered in Philadelphia this week to work on their agenda to repeal healthcare from 20+ million people, gut Medicare and whatever other bad-for-the-American people legislation they may be working on for 2017 and beyond. Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnell, Donald Trump, and Mike Pence were all there with Congressional republicans. From the moment they arrived, the resistance was everywhere. Protesters surrounded their hotel, alternating chants of &quot;Shame! Shame! Shame!&quot; and &quot;Ass-holes! Ass-holes!&quot; No doubt they couldn’t wait to get out of Philly, back to their cushy Georgetown residences and well-guarded D.C. offices. They planned to return to D.C. in a privately chartered train car, but these tough-talking Republicans were too cowardly to even enter the train station:“They totally had a private chartered train waiting for them at the station that pulled away empty because none of the GOP were willing to walk into the station,” one protestor on the scene told us. “The Amtrak agent had called for the boarding of the charter train number, over and over announcing its departure,” she said, “and then conferred with the protest organizers, who then announced it to the crowd.” Whereupon the crowd cheered. It was a fitting and triumphant end to a week that saw so many in Philadelphia responding to the absurd madness and craven greed of the Trump presidency in a way that the city’s founders would have been both proud of, and there for.Well done, Philly. Well done. This is the type of action that Republicans should be greeted with in every city across the country. </content>
