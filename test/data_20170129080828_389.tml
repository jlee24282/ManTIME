<content type="str">New figures this weekend show the US economy grew at a slower than expected pace last quarter. 
Quarter four GDP came in at 1.9 per cent. Thatâ€™s a drop from 3-and-a-half per cent the quarter before. GDP for the year is estimated at 1.6 per cent, the slowest growth in five years.
