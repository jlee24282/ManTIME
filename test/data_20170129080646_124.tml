<TEXT type="str">A huge majority of 83.8 percent of Japanese people are concerned that the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump could create global instability, according to a Kyodo News survey conducted Saturday and Sunday.

The support rating for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe&apos;s Cabinet stood at 59.6 percent in the nationwide telephone survey, up 4.8 percentage points from the previous survey conducted last month.

In the latest survey, 63.3 percent of respondents said they favored the establishment of a permanent system to allow future emperors as well as Emperor Akihito to abdicate, rather than the government&apos;s plan for special one-off legislation.</TEXT>
