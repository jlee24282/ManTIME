THERE have been concerns over the Philippine police force going rogue and using President Duterte’s bloody war on drugs as a cover for their activities following allegations of extortion, abduction, murder and the framing of people. 
 
According to the Manila Times , multiple scandals have been uncovered following last week’s revelation that a South Korean businessman was strangled to death inside the national police headquarters in October when he was kidnapped by anti-drug officers who were looking to extort money from his family. 
 
“It is hard for the all-out war on illegal drugs to succeed because we have a problem with members of the police force taking advantage,” the news outlet quoted Senator Panfilo Lacson, an ex-national police chief and a member of Duterte’s ruling coalition, as saying. 
 
Duterte has in the past promised to shield the police from prosecution if they are charged with killing drug suspects as part of the crackdown on drugs.

A government investigation revealed the three officers who killed Jee Ick-joo were members of the Anti-Illegal Drugs Group based in the Philippine National Police headquarters in Camp Crame in Metro Manila. 
 
The death of the businessman comes as the Philippine police face growing criticism from rights groups and some lawmakers, who say cover-ups and abuses of police power are rampant. 
 
The Human Rights Watch has spoken out about the revelation, calling it an “ominous indicator” of the breakdown of the rule of law under Duterte. 
 
“Duterte has pledged effective immunity  for police who kill in the name of his drug war,” Phelim Kine, the group’s Asia division deputy director said. 
 
“He underscored his own personal contempt for human rights and rule of law on Dec 12 when he publicly announced that he had  personally killed suspected drug users  and dealers while mayor of Davao City,”Kine added. 
 
Duterte has publically apologised for the murder of the South Korean national and called for severe punishment to be meted out to the culprits behind the act.

He called again for the death penalty to be reinstated so that he can hang 20 criminals a day. 
 
“I will see to it that they are sentenced to the maximum,” he said of the policemen. “You give that power to me back again, I will execute them… I’ll hang them in one day, 20 of them – 20 a day.” he warned. 
 
Capital punishment has been a priority for Duterte, whose allies introduced a death penalty bill in Congress on June 30 last year, the same day as his inauguration. 
 
Meanwhile, a Senate investigation into Jee’s killing began on Thursday.
