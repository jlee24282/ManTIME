<content type="str">Every interview, even the ones that don’t end in a job is a good opportunity to practice the skills you need for the working world; how to share your value with others, how to present yourself effectively, and how to react and interact in new situations. 
 
When you’re looking for a job, interviews can start to feel rote. And when you’re going into one thinking it’s “another interview” instead of “The Interview,” you’re unlikely to put your best foot forward. So what are some of the basics to remember no matter if it’s your first interview or your tenth? 
 
Dress the part: The first impression you make when you walk into an interview is visual. You want it to reflect your best self, so when you’re getting dressed, you should feel like that. Yes, your clothes must fit well, be neat and clean. No, you may not need to wear a suit. Over-dressing is certainly better than under-dressing, but you want the hiring manager to be able to easily picture you in the role, so dress for it. Research the company culture and the position you’re seeking and then take it up a notch. Take your outfit for a test run beforehand and see what happens to your shirt when you sit down and if your shoes are comfortable enough to walk in. Pulling on your clothes or constantly adjusting something that isn’t comfortable will be distracting for you and your interview. 
 
Listen: I think I put in a note about listening in everything I write, no matter what the topic. Why? Because it is essential. Listening starts before you even get in the room. Before your interview research the company – read their employee blogs and learn about the interviewer and the position. (And be sure to review your own resume, you’d be surprised at how much you’ve forgotten.) One of the skills your interviewer is looking for is good communication. So be sure to listen carefully. You’ll get a lot of information and be able to engage with the interviewer more adeptly. Listening isn’t just being quiet when the other person speaks. It means not spending that time thinking about what you’re going to say next. Really listen to what is being said and you’ll be able to confidently give the best, most thoughtful answers. 
 
Tell your story: Part of your interview preparation is knowing what story you’re going to tell. Instead of one word or one-sentence answers, tell a short, but clear, story. Focus on a theme that best suits the position and the question that was asked, whether it’s about why you want the job, your leadership or your ability to work in a team. This is also an excellent way to work in relevant personal experiences. Practice your story beforehand – you can do it with a friend or even record yourself speaking. It’s unlikely you’ll sit down in an interview and give the exact same speech about yourself, but it will be helpful to know how it sounds best. 
 
Ask questions: If you’re in a first or second interview for a position, this is easy. When you’re in your third, fourth or fifth, it takes more work and preparation. One candidate I know was in her last round of interviews for her dream job and had prepared everything but this. When the interviewer asked if she had any questions for him, she paused for a moment and asked, “What are some questions I might not know to ask?” hoping his answer would prompt her. What questions do you have?” is a question you have to be prepared for. It not only gives you an opportunity to get answers you’re seeking, but lets the interviewer know that you’ve listened to what’s been said, you’ve thought about the job and that you’re truly interested in the position. 
 
Follow up: What you wear to interviews has changed. Where they take place has changed. Maybe you’ve had a virtual interview. But the “thank you” note has not. Send a note within 24 hours to everyone who was involved in your interview. Email is fine, but do remember that it’s business correspondence and that it must be error-free and appropriately formatted. Read it out loud to yourself as you’re more likely to catch typos that way. Keep the notes short and personalize them to each interviewer. You want to let them know you not only appreciated their time, but to remind them of why you’re a good fit and that you took something meaningful away from the interview.
