<TEXT type="str">January can certainly seem glum once the celebrations of the holiday season are behind us. Still, I’m thankful we’re finally having a real winter to refresh our lakes and streams. That said, a few rainstorms needn’t keep anyone housebound. Especially, not when you live in the heart of Central Coast wine country where our creative wineries offer some pretty great events every month of the year. 
   
With Valentine’s Day a little over two weeks away, I’ve found some very special ways of saying &quot;I love you&quot; to your sweetheart by taking part in a winery event, featuring great wines and delicious treats in Santa Ynez wine country. And more great news, some events will last through the month of February in Paso Robles. 
  
 Santa Ynez Wine Country  
  
Zaca Mesa, founded in 1973, is notable because most wine industry insiders think of it as the university where many of our greatest local winemakers got their start. Not only that, most of them stayed here to create their own noble brands in Santa Barbara County. So the minds behind Zaca Mesa today have created Zaca University, naturally. They offer wine classes that are open to the public to help you better understand the magic that goes into the making of a bottle of fine wine. The upcoming class, “Seduced by Syrah,” takes place at their tasting room Feb. 11 from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. It will provide a tasting experience to allow you to truly get to know their five unique syrahs during a tasting with the winemaking team and a certified sommelier. They describe the tasting as a “deeper look into the remarkable 2013 vintage.” They will teach you to recognize the impact from each factor of making the wine, from farming the vines, the effects of the vintage (the year it was grown) to winemaking, has on each wine even though they are all grown in their estate vineyard. It’s not only informative, it’s fun. The price is $75 per person (wine club members get in for $60 per person), which includes lunch with Zaca Mesa’s great team of people who are quite passionate about winemaking. Learn more and/or buy your tickets at www.zacamesa.com . 
  
 Solvang Wine Country  
  
There are many new tasting rooms in Solvang. This quaint little town just keeps on growing better all of the time. But this special event, Solvang’s Third Wednesday Wine and Beer Walk, which only happens once a year, is on Feb. 15 from 4 to 7 p.m. It’s a great way to help you get to know some new tasting rooms. For only $20 per person, you can taste two samples at five wine and beer tasting rooms. The ticket price gets you a souvenir glass, and a map to make it convenient to find them all. You must be 21 or over. Purchase your tickets (cash only) on the day of the event at one of these three businesses: the Olive House at 1661 Mission Drive, Wandering Dog Wine Bar at 1539-C Mission Drive and Sort This Out Cellars at 1636 Copenhagen Drive, where you will also be able to pick up the Wine &amp; Beer Walk logo glass and head out to make some new favorites.

 Paso Robles Wine Country  
  
Whether you live nearby or an hour away, Vina Robles in Paso Robles offers some compelling reasons to rank them among your favorite Central Coast tasting rooms. On three Saturdays during the month of February, they will provide free concerts at the tasting room. Not only is it complimentary, but reservations are not necessary. Their fine wines will be available, which you can purchase in flights (small pours of several different white and red wines), by-the-glass or by-the-bottle. They only ask that you do not bring in alcoholic products that they haven’t made. They will also have tapas available for purchase to sate your hunger. The free events take place on Feb. 4, 18 and 25. 
   
On Feb. 11, they are offering a pre-Valentine’s Day early evening tasting from 5 until 8 p.m., featuring a “Chocolate Festival.” They have invited other wineries and several chocolate vendors in for a wine and chocolate tasting that will be exceptional. The cost is $40 per person ($35 per person for wine club members), with a portion of the proceeds going to the Big Brothers Big Sisters of SLO County charity. Singer-songwriter Melody Flemin will perform. She will also appear during the free concert on Feb. 4. Other artists will include Kenny Taylor on Feb. 18 and Whitherward, a nationally touring indie-folk duo, on the Feb. 25. Learn more about the free concerts and other concerts in their spectacular amphitheater (I saw Tony Bennett last year) at www.vinarobles.com . 
   
There are many more events going on, but I picked the ones that appealed most to me. Although I will steer you right, you may find something more appealing for your taste on the vintners associations’ webpages of events for the entire year of 2017. I recommend visiting pasowine.com , www.slowine.com , and sbcounty.com .</TEXT>
