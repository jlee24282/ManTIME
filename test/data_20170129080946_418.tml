<TEXT type="str">ï»¿ A BRITISH consultant, who was brought in to draw up a strategy to develop and promote the Old Manama Suq, has until March to submit his plans, revealed a top public figure. Capital Trustees Board chairman Mohammed Al Khozaie said Hank Dittmar, of Urban Futures, is helping prepare new plans for the suq, blending modernity with tradition. The consultant is a global sustainability authority and urbanist, advising governments, companies and communities all over the world on making cities and towns more liveable and resilient. Based on his assessment a budget will be allocated for work to begin immediately, said Mr Khozaie. The suq project is a joint responsibility of the Bahrain Tourism and Exhibitions Authority (BTEA), the Economic Development Board, the Bahrain Chamber of Commerce and Industry (BCCI), and the board. &quot;Funds are there - they just need to be divided according to the needs, whether structural, technical or commercial or for other support facilities such as car parks,&quot; said Mr Al Khozaie. &quot;We have already approached some of the businesses in the area to build multi-storey car parks on their property in return for benefits and they are considering it. So, hopefully, approval will come with the report&apos;s findings. &quot;There is a commitment to develop the suq and we have a lot on our minds, like possibly closing certain areas and turning them into pedestrian-only zones. &quot;However, that again depends on how we will handle the load factor. &quot;We are also thinking about confining car parks to certain areas rather than the whole market to reduce congestion and allow people to move around freely.&quot; He said the consultant was considering all options with the suq area being huge and how to conduct work in phases. BTEA marketing and tourism promotion director Yousef AlKhan told the board members that the aim was to turn the suq area into Bahrain&apos;s most recognisable destination. The old suq was the first destination for tourists coming on cruises, he said. &quot;We are putting a huge emphasis on the Capital Governorate as our main frontier destination for tourists and the Old Manama Suq is our biggest attraction. &quot;The suq fascinates tourists mainly those coming on cruises and it is the first thing they want to see whenever they arrive in Bahrain. &quot;And for that it needs to be developed in a way that protects its identity to be in line with expectations.&quot; mohammed@gdn.com.bh (c) 2017 2016 Al Hilal Publishing and Marketing Group Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc.
