<content type="str">Santa Monica Airport is set to close down in 2028, the Los Angeles Times reported Saturday. 
 
In recognition of the city&apos;s authority to make decisions about land use, the agreement allows Santa Monica to shorten the airport&apos;s single runway to 3,500 feet from its current length of 4,973 feet. 
 
In the meantime, the city can shorten the airport&apos;s single runway to 3,500 feet from its current length of almost 5,000 feet, which means larger jets will no longer be able to take off or land, city officials said. Residents have raised concerns about noise, air pollution and the risk of planes crashing into neighborhoods. 
 
Further, jet traffic is expected to be substantially reduced as will commercial charters. 
 
The city plans to turn the 227-acre site into a large park, spokeswoman Constance Farrell said. 
 
&quot;Mutual cooperation between the FAA and the city enabled us to reach this innovative solution, which resolves longstanding legal and regulatory disputes&quot;, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said Saturday. 
 
The agreement allows the city to close the facility any time after December 31, 2028, and officials said they plan to take that action on the first possible day - January 1, 2029. 
 
&quot;It is certainly a disappointing development, first concerning the immediate ability to shorten the runway, and the ultimate ability to close the airport in 2028&quot;, Pelton said in a statement. 
 
A press conference has been scheduled for 2 p.m.at which point more details will be released. &quot;This is a fair resolution for all concerned because it strikes an appropriate balance between the public&apos;s interest in making local decisions about land use practices and its interests in safe and efficient aviation services&quot;.</content>
