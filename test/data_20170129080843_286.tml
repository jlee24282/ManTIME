He and his colleagues don&apos;t have much else to do. There hasn&apos;t been a single customer since December, when neighbouring Nigeria banned car imports by land as part of a wave of protectionist policies that are strangling Benin&apos;s economy.

&quot;We spend our days smoking, it&apos;s our life now,&quot; Hijazi sighs, sitting in a gazebo beside his stock of thousands of cars steadily accumulating the dry winter dust.

This afternoon, Hijazi -- who, like the vast majority of car dealers in Benin, is Lebanese -- called in his Beninese accountant to help close up shop.

Debts are accumulating and the stress is becoming too much. &quot;I lost in one year what I have earned in 16,&quot; Ali Assi, another car dealer, told AFP.

Benin, a tiny country with scarce natural resources, relies on its port business to survive.

From the port city of Cotonou, imported cars, fabrics, and food from all over the world get distributed across west Africa.

But since the Nigerian economy crashed following the collapse in global oil prices, Benin has been suffering knock-on effects.

Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari&apos;s protectionist policies -- his government has banned a slew of items including cars imported by land -- has only aggravated the situation. 

&apos;Encourage smuggling&apos;

&quot;This decision will encourage smuggling, it&apos;s back to square one,&quot; Gouton said.

Several agreements were signed in the past between Benin and Nigeria to facilitate legal trade.

But Nigeria accuses Beninese customs of failing to monitor the exported goods and collect taxes.

Buhari hopes that closing land borders will revitalise Nigerian industries and attract business to the port at Lagos, Nigeria&apos;s economic capital and largest city.

Today more than 20 products -- the list has never been officially published -- are banned from being imported overland.

&quot;For the past 18 months, we have seen a lot of policies that are not market friendly&quot;, said Nigerian economist Nonso Obikili. &quot;The self-sufficiency policy has led the government to create all sorts of h…</TEXT>
