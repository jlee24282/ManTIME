Former UCLA women’s tennis standout Abigail Spears captured the first grand slam title of her career Saturday in mixed doubles. 
 
The former Bruin had reached two previous grand slam mixed doubles finals with Mexico’s Santiago Gonzalez at the US Open in 2013 and 2014, but fell short both times. 
 
Spears partnered with Colombia’s Juan Sebastian Cabal to take the 2017 Australian mixed doubles title with a straight-sets win over the No. 2-seeded team of India’s Sania Mirza and Croatia’s Ivan Dodig.
