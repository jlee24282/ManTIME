 MSU update: The Spartans enter todays game in need of a win to keep their postseason trajectory on course. MSU, which has lost three straight, cant afford to drop home games to NCAA tournament bubble teams if it wants to avoid being on the bubble itself. The good news for MSU is it seems to have freshman Miles Bridges back at 100 percent and, in two of his last three games, playing as well as ever. Bridges is coming off a 33-point effort Tuesday against Purdue, which set an MSU freshman scoring mark. As MSU plays the school that produced the Fab Five, its own four-member freshman class is averaging an Izzo-era best 42.2 points and 18.7 rebounds. Spartans redshirt sophomore Kenny Goins will play with a protective mask  as he did much of last season  after breaking his nose against Purdue. 
 
 Michigan  update: The Wolverines are coming off a blistering offensive performance in a 90-60 home win over Indiana Thursday, which followed a one-sided home victory over Illinois last weekend. At 14-7 and 4-4 in the Big Ten, Michigan is creeping toward the NCAA tournament bubble. What the Wolverines lack is quality wins or road wins, though early season neutral site drubbings of Marquette and SMU are looking better by the hour. Beating MSU at Breslin would go a ways toward bringing the Wolverines into the NCAA tournament conversation seriously, if Thursdays win didnt already do that. Michigan is 0-5 this season in true road games. Thatll have to change at some point if the Wolverines want to play in the Big Dance. Michigans struggles are on defense and on the glass. The Wolverines are last in the Big Ten in field goal-percentage defense and 3-point defense and second to last in rebounding margin. 
 
 About the matchup: Michigan wont be able to punish MSU inside if the Spartans get in foul trouble. Thats not what the Wolverines do, nor do they have the personnel to make MSU pay for its lack of depth of size. What Michigan can do is bury an opponent from beyond the arc. The Wolverines 9.3 3s per game are second in the Big Ten  behind Purdue and ahead of Indiana. Six different U-M players have 22 or more made 3-pointers on the season. MSU, while often statistically sound defending the perimeter, has regular lapses guarding shooters, especially off penetration. Michigan doesnt have the future NBA players in its backcourt it did when it was making deep NCAA tournament runs a few years ago. But the Wolverines have a ton of experience in this rivalry, including two senior starters (Derrick Walton and Zak Irvin) who were on the team that won at Breslin in 2014. Three of MSUs starters have never played in this matchup before today. 
 
 Prediction: There has been little carryover from game to game for most teams in the Big Ten this season, MSU and Michigan included. If the Wolverines hit 63 percent of their shots and 55 percent of their 3s and only turn the ball over six times, as they did against Indiana, then the Spartans are in trouble. Of course, Indianas disorganized and sometimes disinterested defense contributed to those numbers. Minus the final few minutes of the first half and a few in the second Tuesday, MSU played its most complete game of the season in its loss to Purdue. That effort might get it done against Michigan. The only reliable predictive variables today are that Breslin Center will be rocking and both teams will be dialed in. Home court in this rivalry can mean a ton. 
 
 Make it: MSU 81, Michigan 77
