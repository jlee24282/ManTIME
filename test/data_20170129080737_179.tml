Defense Ministry spokesman Mohammad Radmanesh said on January 27 that the government had set several measures, including a special salary scale for female recruits, to encourage more women to join up. 

'At this stage, we have 1,575 Afghan women in our army ranks, it is a mere 3 to 4 percent -- which is nothing,' Radmanesh said. 'We are aiming to raise this percentage to 10 percent.' 

Radmanesh said there currently were about 400 Afghan women recruits training at Defense Ministry facilities.
