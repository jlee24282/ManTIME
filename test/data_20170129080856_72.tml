<content type="str">The Earth&apos;s magnetic field surrounds our planet like an invisible force field â€“ protecting life from harmful solar radiation by deflecting charged particles away. Far from being constant, this field is continuously changing. Indeed, our planet&apos;s history includes at least several hundred global magnetic reversals, where north and south magnetic poles swap places. So when&apos;s the next one happening and how will it affect life on Earth? 
During a reversal the magnetic field won&apos;t be zero, but will assume a weaker and more complex form. It may fall to 10 percent of the present-day strength and have magnetic poles at the equator or even the simultaneous existence of multiple &quot;north&quot; and &quot;south&quot; magnetic poles. 

he alteration in the magnetic field during a reversal will weaken its shielding effect, allowing heightened levels of radiation on and above the Earth&apos;s surface. Were this to happen today, the increase in charged particles reaching the Earth would result in increased risks for satellites, aviation, and ground-based electrical infrastructure. Geomagnetic storms, driven by the interaction of anomalously large eruptions of solar energy with our magnetic field, give us a foretaste of what we can expect with a weakened magnetic shield. 

In 2003, the so-called Halloween storm caused local electricity-grid blackouts in Sweden, required the rerouting of flights to avoid communication blackout and radiation risk, and disrupted satellites and communication systems. But this storm was minor in comparison with other storms of the recent past, such as the 1859 Carrington event, which caused aurorae as far south as the Caribbean. 

The impact of a major storm on today&apos;s electronic infrastructure is not fully known. (Source: livescience)
