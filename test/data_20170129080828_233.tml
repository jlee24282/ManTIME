Premier League giants Chelsea will play the A-League&apos;s Perth Glory in a friendly next year in the team&apos;s only Australian appearance, officials said on Sunday. 
 
The match will take place in late July or early August at Perth&apos;s new 65 000-capacity stadium, Western Australia Premier Colin Barnett said in a statement. 
 
Officials are hopeful Antonio Conte&apos;s side – the 2014-15 Premier League champions and current league leaders – will attract fans from across the island continent and from Asia. 
 
&quot;This is an enormous opportunity for not only football fans, but sport fans in general, from around the nation and the Asia-Pacific region, to witness one of the best and biggest clubs in the world to play in our own backyard,&quot; Glory&apos;s chief executive Peter Filopoulos said. 
 
There has been a growing trend of top clubs choosing Australia as a warm-up destination. 
 
Arsenal, currently second behind Chelsea in the EPL standings, are playing two pre-season friendlies in Sydney this year. 
 
A string of other clubs including Liverpool, Manchester City and Real Madrid have visited Australia in recent years. 
 
Perth Glory are currently fifth on the A-League table. 
 
London club Chelsea – owned by Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich – last played in Sydney in 2015, the club&apos;s first game in the country for 41 years.</TEXT>
