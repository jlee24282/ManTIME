Drugged-up Carl Barlow drove on the wrong side of the road and went through red lights as he was chased by police. 
 
Officers had attempted to stop the 27-year-old&apos;s Toyota car after he sped off from traffic lights in Broad Street, Hanley, and turned into Sun Street. 
 
But Barlow took police on a seven-minute pursuit as he went the wrong way down a one-way street, went round a roundabout the wrong way, and drove through red lights.

The pursuit came to an end when Barlow was arrested after he misjudged a turning and ended up in a front garden within a cul-de-sac. 
 
The defendant failed to give a sample of blood and refused a drugs test at the police station. 
 
Now Barlow has been jailed for nine months and banned from driving for 28-and-a-half months following the July 10 offence. 
 
Prosecutor Heather Chamberlin told Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court: “The Toyota accelerated strongly in Broad Street and turned right into Sun Street. The officer illuminated his lights but the car failed to stop.

“It went the wrong way down a one-way street, went round a roundabout the wrong way and drove on the wrong side of Cobridge Road. It travelled at 60mph in a 30mph zone. He took a mini roundabout on the wrong side of the road and veered from side to side. He went through traffic lights on Festival Park on the wrong side of the road causing a vehicle to reverse out of the way. He went through various junctions without stopping. Eventually he misjudged a turning and ended up in a cul-de-sac and came to a stop on the grass of a front garden. 
 
“He was arrested. It was clear he was under the influence of some sort of intoxicant. He was searched and there was a psychoactive substance in his pocket, a legal high which is now illegal.&quot; 
 
The defendant tested &apos;zero&apos; for alcohol. He told police he had been smoking monkey dust and knew he would fail a drugs test so he refused to take one.

Barlow, of Davison Street, Cobridge, pleaded guilty to dangerous driving, driving without a licence, driving without insurance, failing to provide a specimen of blood, and refusing a drug test. 
 
Anis Ali, mitigating, said: “He acted out of stupidity. He realises what he did was dangerous. He recognises the potential for harm and injury being occasioned. He self-confessed he had been using illicit substances which explains why he failed to comply. He realises he can&apos;t carry on in the way he has been.&quot; 
 
Recorder Stephen Thomas told Barlow: “The seven-minute pursuit involved you driving at up to 60mph in a 30mph area. It involved you weaving around narrow streets with houses on either side and causing other vehicles to alter their course to accommodate you.&quot;
