<TEXT type="str">After a tough seven-point loss to Lawrence on Friday, the Emporia High girls hoped they could find a little extra spark on Saturday in the third-place game of the Glacier&apos;s Edge Tournament. 
 
Unfortunately for the Spartans, a brief lead in the first didn&apos;t hold up as they dropped a 54-37 decision to Maize. 
 
&quot;Our energy wasn&apos;t there, I thought we came out flat,&quot; EHS coach Carolyn Lee said. &quot;We can&apos;t allow that. All these teams are playing three games in three days, so there shouldn&apos;t have been an excuse.&quot; 
 
The Eagles had a 34-point loss to Derby earlier in the week, but didn&apos;t show signs of it on Saturday as Lee said the Spartan opponent had much more energy. 
 
&quot;Maize wanted it more,&quot; she said. &quot;I thought they played harder than us. We had a lot of girls not playing very hard — not diving on the floor — jogging to their spots (and) hands downs. That&apos;s just atypical of what we expect — (and an) atypical team that we saw last night. 
 
&quot;We have to be better than that.&quot; 
 
At times during Saturday&apos;s contest, EHS had three freshmen on the floor at the same time. Senior Baylee Beatty is still out due to a concussion. Freshmen Rayanna Breshears, Drue Davis and Mya Tovar saw significant minutes. 
 
&quot;Having three freshmen out there is difficult,&quot; Lee said. &quot;They got valuable experience to see. We played two ranked opponents in the state — I had two or three freshmen on the court at the same time getting experience from that.  
 
&quot;Other players like (Taylor) Milleson — only a sophomore — there&apos;s a lot of upside to these kids.  They&apos;ve got to figure out how to play harder. We walked away with some players who got game-like experiences we needed them to have.&quot; 
 
EHS (8-4 overall, 4-1 Centennial) finished 1-2 in its home tournament will now focus on the second half of Centennial League play. 
 
The Spartans will have a back-to-back beginning on Friday at Topeka West, before traveling to Junction City on Saturday for a make-up contest from Jan. 13. 
 
EHS is a game back behind Manhattan and Washburn Rural, who are both undefeated in league play and sit in a tie with Seaman with one loss. 
 
&quot;We&apos;ll get after it on Tuesday,&quot; Lee said. &quot;We&apos;ve got to get ready. We&apos;ve got back-to-back and it&apos;ll be tough. We&apos;ve got to get ready for league play. We want to be competitive to finish out league strong. 
 
&quot;One game at a time. We&apos;ll talk about Topeka West this week and then worry about Junction City on Saturday when we get there.&quot; 
 
Senior Kelsey Gordon led EHS with nine points.
