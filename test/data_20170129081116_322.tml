<content type="str">John Hurt, whose acting career spanned five and a half decades, has died. He was 77. 
 
Hurt was featured in three Harry Potter films as wandmaker Garrick Ollivander, and was also known for his roles in Alien, Hellboy, and dozens of other films and television programs. His role in Midnight Express earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor in 1978, and in 1980 he was again nominated for an Oscar, this time for Best Actor, for his role in David Lynch&apos;s The Elephant Man. 
 John Hurt as the War Doctor in Doctor Who. 
Hurt&apos;s appearances over the years read like a who&apos;s-who list of memorable sci-fi and fantasy movies and television shows. 
 
In Alien, he played Kane, the first of the crew to die -- and the first-ever Alien chestburster victim, in arguably one of the most famous scenes in movie history -- and he also lent his voice to the 1978 animated version of The Lord of the Rings as Aragorn, and voiced the Horned King in Disney&apos;s The Black Cauldron. He also appeared in V for Vendetta, Snowpiercer, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, and Spaceballs (parodying his famous Alien role), and can currently be seen in theaters opposite Natalie Portman in Jackie. In recent years he also played the War Doctor in Doctor Who. 
 
In the movie adaptation of George Orwell&apos;s 1984, Hurt took on the role of Winston Smith, the protagonist and employee of the Ministry of Truth. 
 
Hurt is survived by his wife Anwen Rees-Myers, and two sons Alexander and Nicholas.
