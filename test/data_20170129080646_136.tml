<TEXT type="str">Arsenal boss, Arsene Wenger, has praised Danny Welbeck after the England striker’s fine performance, in their 5-0 win over Southampton in the FA Cup on Saturday. 
 
Welbeck, who was making his first start in eight months, scored the first two goals and set up the third, as the Gunners cruised to victory at St Marys Stadium. 
 
Wenger, who was serving the first of his four-match ban, admits he was surprised by Welbeck’s display and resilience. 
 
The Frenchman said: “Danny Welbeck was very sharp because he has been working very hard. He comes back from a long way out and has gone through some very difficult moments mentally. 
 
“But his resilience was absolutely marvellous and he was rewarded tonight, so we are happy. 
 
“We were very dynamic, explosive and overall we had a good consistent performance over 90 minutes and everybody played well. 
 
“Welbeck has been out for such a long time, I didn’t expect him to score straight away and it shows the desire is there. 
 
“People say I make changes but I bring in Walcott, Welbeck and Perez, all top quality players. After that I try to find the best balance for the team.” 
 
On watching his team play from the stands, Wenger added: “You miss something. I have spent so much time on the bench that physically it is difficult to be far away, but the most important thing is Arsenal to win.”
