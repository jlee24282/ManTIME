Hearts broke all over the University of Tennessee’s campus the morning of Sept. 6, 2016, as we heard of Andrew Vermillion’s suicide. Vermillion, a 22-year-old fellow Vol, jumped off the 11th Street pedestrian bridge on campus. Unfortunately, suicides on college campuses are not that rare. According to www.collegedegreesearch.net , 1,100 college students die of suicide per year. Vermillion&apos;s tragic death and the deaths of so many college students around the country should be a call to action for universities to implement funding that keeps up with the growing enrollment rate and for counseling center services to be more publicized and accessible. College students are one of the most at-risk populations in the United States for anxiety and depression, which means it is imperative our Volunteers know their resources and have full access to them. 
 
With the consistent rise in admissions rates on college campuses, the need to expand mental health services has significantly increased. In fact, the numbers of students who have seriously considered attempting suicide, injured themselves without suicidal intent, made a suicide attempt or considered hurting another person all went up between 2010-13, according to the American Psychological Association. Despite the growth in college enrollment each year, many universities have not adjusted their budgets appropriately for mental health and counseling services. 
 
As the Center for Collegiate Mental Health determined, the demand for counseling services has been outpaced by enrollment rates five-fold. This means that in order to keep up with the enrollment rate of a university, administrators must increase the counseling center’s budget by the same percentage. As for UT specifically, according to the Board of Trustees&apos; annual meeting reports, the proposed budget increases the counseling center’s budget by about 3.1 percent, but it is questionable if that will be enough to combat the increase in enrollment for next year. 
 
Funding is not the only problem. The stigma surrounding mental health is so prominent that college students are less likely to seek help, even though they may be the population that would benefit the most from it, according to the Journal of Medical Care Research and Review. 
 
Knowing that, it is imperative that the university community stand together to eliminate the stigma surrounding mental health issues. It is also vital that the university educate the student body about resources available to them. Resources like drop-in consultations, psychological assessments, crisis interventions, individual, couple and group therapy can be discussed in a Freshman 101 class or by the resident hall directors. These services are all free for students. 
 
It is important to know that the mental health of students is not the responsibility of just the counseling center. Informing each other on coping strategies, being aware of our surroundings and of the emotions of others can encourage someone at risk to set up an initial consultation with the counseling center or be referred to another psychologist in town if they want to exceed the 12 allotted appointments that the counseling center gives. 
 
College can seem like another universe. Students must adjust like they have never had to before and peer relationships are crucial, which is why college students are at a high risk for suicide and serious mental health problems. If we stand together in true Volunteer fashion and promise to stomp out the mental health stigma, demand more publicity for mental health resources and counseling center services, and be vigilant with those around us, maybe we can all help prevent someone from committing suicide, and do justice to Vermillion. A forever Vol. 
 
UT students experiencing mental health issues or who know other students who are should contact the Student Counseling Center at 865-974-2196 or email counselingcenter@utk.edu. Vols help Vols.
