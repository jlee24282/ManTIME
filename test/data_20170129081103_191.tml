<content type="str">There’s been far too much carnage on the roads around Chico recently, the latest being the crash last Sunday evening on Highway 32 that killed beloved Pleasant Valley High School coach and teacher Brett Silva. 
 
It was the second fatal accident on 32 between Chico and Orland since November. November also saw a double fatal on Highway 99 north of town. 
 
All of the crashes occurred on two-lane highways. As we’ve pointed out before, Chico is largest city in California that can’t be accessed by a four-lane road. To get here you’re going to have to drive 20 miles or more with cars zipping by in the other direction just a few feet away. 
 
There’s little margin for error, and with two oncoming vehicles’ combined speed in excess of 100 mph, if one slips into the other’s lane, the results are likely to be disastrous. 
 
We’re not expecting Caltrans to build a four-lane connector anytime soon, so it’s hard to blame the roads. That small margin of error we mention requires an error, and it’s not possible to engineer away recklessness, drunkenness or inattentiveness. 
 
On Highway 32, Caltrans in recent years has rebuilt the bridge over Stony Creek and moved the dangerous intersection of River Road a 100 yards or so east to a much safer location. Left-turn pockets have been added and the road has been repaved and striped with markings that you can actually see at night. If you want to go back a few more years, the frighteningly narrow Gianella Bridge was replaced. 
 
We’re not sure what more can be done with asphalt and concrete, short of the expansion that’s not realistic to expect — look at how long the planned four-lane artery from Chico to Sacramento has languished. Perhaps the oncoming lanes could be separated, but even that doesn’t guarantee safety. 
 
It’s the same with Highway 99 north of town. Caltrans made improvements including rumble strips to tell drivers when they were leaving their lane, but again what more is there, unless the lanes could be physically separated? 
 
It’s hard to say that, as a couple of these crashes have reached into the newsroom at this newspaper, and they hurt. But you can’t idiot-proof a road. 
 
One thing that could be done is the Highway Patrol could dedicate a little more manpower to the state’s two-lane highways, which have so much more potential to be deadly. Have a presence. Enforce the laws. 
 
And then, make the “traffic schools” bad drivers use to clear their records less of a joke, figuratively and literally. How in heck do comedy traffic schools get approved by the state? Add a little rigor to that process and maybe some responsibility can be hammered into a few thick skulls. 
 
 
Ultimately highway safety comes down to driver safety. We’ve had callers and letter writers say they’re afraid of the highways around Chico, and that’s actually a good thing. Driving afraid is driving cautious, and the more cautious drivers on the road the better. 
 
But the state has to go after the fools who aren’t afraid, if the rest of us are to be safe.</content>
