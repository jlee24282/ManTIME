<TEXT type="str">In his maiden post-appointment postings as the Inspector General of Police (IGP), David Asante-Apeatu has replaced COP Prosper Kwame Agblor with DCOP Bright Oduro as the Director General of the Police Criminal Investigations Department (CID).

In a police signal signed by Mr Asante-Apeatu and stumbled upon by DAILY GUIDE, COP Prosper Agblor is now Director-General, Special Duties.

DCOP Bright Oduro, until the new posting, was DG in-charge of Welfare.

ACP Maame Yaa Tiwaa Addo-Danquah, second-in-command of the PIPS, now moves to the CID headquarters as the deputy.

ACP Dennis A. Akob-dem, second-in-command, CID headquarters, now moves to CID headquarters Special Duties as second-in-command.

The changes at the CID headquarters – a critical segment of policing – is a pointer to what the new IGP intends doing to the law enforcement system which in the past few years has been regarded as not living up to the expectation of Ghanaians, including personnel of the Service.

With many deliberately delayed murder cases involving political activists, the CID is one area Ghanaians would be looking up to for addressing the many instances of improprieties.
