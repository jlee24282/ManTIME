<TITLE>When was the last time you patronized a business owned by an immigrant?</TITLE>
<TEXT>Among the New England states, Rhode Island has the smallest percentage of immigrants who make their living owning a business. Yet in Providence, the number of immigrant business owners increased nearly 50 percent from 2000 to 2013, a city whose population is more than one-quarter immigrant. 
 
It is clear that more activity by immigrants would translate into a more vital state economy, but it is not clear that the businesses owned by immigrants are connecting with the main stream community. Have you patronized a business owned by immigrants recently?</TEXT>
