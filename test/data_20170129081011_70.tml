<content type="str">Two active National Basketball Association players, Los Angeles Lakers veteran Luol Deng and Milwaukee Bucks rookie Thon Maker, originally hail from what is now South Sudan, which is not on the list of affected countries. 
 
The NBA wants to know if foreign players in the league now or in the near future might be affected by the immigration ban. 
 
&quot;We have reached out to the State Department and are in the process of gathering information to understand how this executive order would apply to players in our league who are from one of the impacted countries&quot;, Bass told the USA Today . 
 
The NBA has contacted the State Department for some clarification on how the US ban on immigration from seven countries might affect the league. 
 
Deng was also born in Wau, Sudan, but like Maker has dual citizenship, having become a British citizen in 2006. 
 Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen are the countries listed in Trump&apos;s 90-day immigration ban. . 
The Bucks were concerned about Maker&apos;s ability to travel freely with the team back to the United States from its game Friday in Toronto. He lived in Australia as a youth, is an Australian citizen and holds a passport from that country. Still, there were concerns for Maker as the Bucks were returning from a Friday night game in Toronto just as Customs and Border Protection notified airlines about passengers whose visas had been canceled. 
 
The NBA&apos;s successful Basketball Without Borders program, for instance, has been credited with identifying and developing players from the Sudan. 
 
The National Basketball Association has contacted the State Department to understand how President Donald Trump&apos;s executive order to suspend immigration from seven countries could impact the league&apos;s players.</content>
