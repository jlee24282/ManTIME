<content type="str">A late strike by Cameron Murray sealed all three points for Scarborough Athletic in their 2-1 win over Ossett Albion at Queensgate yesterday (28 January.)

Jacob Hazel squeezed in the opener for the home side with a deflected effort on 19 minutes, but failed to take the jnitiative.

The visitors were effective on the counter, and levelled up the scores when James Eyles netted an equaliser midway through the second half, rounding Boro keeper Jordan Porter to net from close range.

It looked like it would end honours even but with two minutes to go Murray showed a turn of speed to break clear of the Unicorns defence and fire in the winner for the home side.
