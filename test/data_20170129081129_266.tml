INDIANAPOLIS  On the night of April 17, 1969, Dick Tinkham sat courtside for a playoff game many expected the Indiana Pacers to lose. 
 
The Pacers were two years into existence, facinga Game 7 against the Kentucky Colonels after falling behind 3-1 in the series. About 11,000 fans packed into Indiana State Fairgrounds Coliseum for the game, cheering and hollering the entire time. 
 
Except there was Tinkham, who co-founded both the ABA and the Pacers franchise, watching more nervously than everyone else because he knew a secret: The Pacers were a day-to-day operation with no long-term existence guaranteed. 
 
Wed raised some money, wed spent the money, and we realized we had to go pretty far in the playoffs to continue to operate because the team, early on, was not a raving investment vehicle for people, Tinkham said. Im sitting there realizing, What happens (if we lose)? We dont have a plan. You end on a playoff loss, who wants it? We honestly didnt have a long-range plan at that point. We just figured we had to win. 
 
Bob Netolicky, an ABA Pacers great, didnt know the consequences of the game as a 26-year-old ballplayer out of Drake. He remembers Game 7 fondly forscoring 32 points and grabbing 16 rebounds, pushing the Pacers to their first-ever playoff series victory. 
 
But he didn't know that a loss might have meant the end of the Pacers. 
 
I think, 'Thank God we didnt know what was on the line,' because I dont know if it would have affected the players or not, Netolicky said, adding: If we lost that game, which we were supposed (to do), the Pacers would fold. 
 
Perhaps less surprising now that the Pacers are celebrating their 50th season as a franchise  they were founded Feb. 2, 1967 as an original member of the ABA  the winning didnt stop after they beat the Colonels, 120-111, that night in 1969. 
 
The Pacers eliminated the Miami Floridians 4-1 in the next round, then suffered a4-1 series loss in the ABA finals to the Oakland Oaks. But they had saved the franchise. Indiana won its first championship the following season and reached the finals five times total, adding two more titles in its nine years in the ABA. 
 
But nearly 48 years later, Tinkham and Netolicky still talk about the night the franchise won its first playoff series as the moment that changed everything for the organization.

The defining moment was one in which we understood we had to win to stay in business, Tinkham said. Because there were other owners in the league who had a lot more money than we had who werent winning and they were folding. The box office was not giving them enough money to operate on. 
 
Tinkham doesnt sugarcoat the early days. The way he tells it, on that day in February 1967 when the official announcement was made that Indianapolis would once again house a professional basketball team, none of the owners knew much about the basketball industry. 
 
Netolicky refers to the years in the late 1960s as the sports dark ages, where the NBA was about as popular as night bowling. 
 
It was a different time, long before the days of superstars such as Paul George making roughly $240,000 per game. A single payday for George now would have covered the total salaries of all of the players from the first two years of the team, according to team salary records provided by Scott Tarter, a lawyer who runs Dropping Dimes, an ABA charity, and collects historical documents connected to the league.

To add further perspective: The NBA struck a nine-year, $24 billion media-rights deal with ESPN and Turner Sports in 2014. Local television carried Pacers games from the birth of the franchise, generating around $2,500 in revenue. 
 
Nevertheless, the Pacers compiled a roster oozing with talent  players such as Hall of Famers Mel Daniels and Roger Brown and Freddie Lewis  and won their first playoff series in their second year in the ABA.

Thats when really I think the city got behind us, Netolicky said. That was the game that kind of turned it all around for the city. 
 
In a way, the Pacers winning that Game 7 helped revitalize Downtown Indianapolis. 
 
The city was just closing its last hotel Downtown when Richard Lugar became mayor in 1968. Hesaw the potential intalks between the Pacers and architects looking to build what would becomeMarket Square Arena. 
 
Tinkham said he contacted Marriott in hopes of putting a hotel close tothe arenas originally proposed location near I-465, but Marriotts evaluation revealed a hotel location would be better suited for Downtown. That led the city to urge the Pacers to build their future home arena on East Market Street. 
 
The addition of the arena helped Lugars administration push the citys new identity as a Great American City following Unigov, which consolidated the governments of the city and Marion County in 1970. 
 
Here we are 30 years later, weve got the (Indianapolis) Colts, Netolicky said. Without another ...pro franchise Downtown, you think the Colts would have even looked at Indianapolis?

And yet, none of them knew  not even Tinkham  what winning that night in 1969 would do for the face of the basketball and the city. No one understood at the time how important winning a game of basketball could be for the lives of millions. 
 
But that night, Tinkham learned what it took to survive in basketball. 
 
What we found out as a result of that game was, and I hate to keep repeating myself, but you have to win, Tinkham said. You have to win in order to survive. Thats what that game taught us.

 INDIANA PACERS vs. HOUSTON ROCKETS  
Tipoff: 6 p.m. Sunday, Bankers Life Fieldhouse. 
 
TV: Fox Sports Indiana. 
 
Radio: WFNI-AM (1070). 
 
Storylines: 
 
>> According to ESPN, Houston MVP candidate James Harden assisted on or scoreda total of 80 points in the Rockets' 123-118 win Friday against Philadelphia. The Western Conference All-Star starter concluded that game with 51 points, 13 assists and 13 rebounds forhis 14th triple-double of the season. Harden enters Sunday averaging 29.1 points, 11.6 assists and 8.3 rebounds per game, all career highs. 
 
>> The Pacers (24-22) continue to look like a different team at home than they do on the road. Friday's win over the Kings at Bankers Life Fieldhouse pushes the Pacers home record to a robust 17-6. Meanwhile, they are 6-17 on the road while allowing opponents to score 8.2 more points per game (110.9)on the road that at home(102.7). 
 
>> Pacers coach Nate McMillan's decision to insert C.J. Miles into the starting lineup has paid dividends through three games. Not only are the Pacers 2-1, but Miles is+23 in game +/-, and he's averaged 12.3 points and 3.6 rebounds per game. He also has knocked down 11 of his 22 attempts from beyond the arc. 
 
>> The Pacers have been successful at home, but there will be no climbing out of 16-point holes  like they didagainst the Kings  against Harden and the Rockets (35-15). If they have another lapse like they did in third quarter Friday, expect Houstonto put them away. Rockets 116, Pacers 106.
