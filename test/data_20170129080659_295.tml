<TITLE>MIKE MCGUIRE: Find traffic safety fixes that work</TITLE>
<TEXT>Many deaths are created by carelessness or bad behavior.

I have several points to make on recent editorials that address highway safety in our area.

First, one years data does not make a trend. While incidents that result in these deaths should be reviewed, there is no definite conclusion to be made.

Second, pedestrian safety should not have priority. Arent all lives special? Many deaths are created by carelessness or bad behavior, and are caused by those who are the victims of such encounters. So with some 80 percent of deaths occurring after dark, better lighting and educating pedestrians on the need to wear light-reflective clothing would be a big help to motorists. Im sure all of us have been out at night and seen folks crossing or walking along roads, and noted that their clothing made it very difficult to see them.

With more visitors coming to our area and with the warm weather much of this year, it is reasonable that more people are walking and bicycling than in colder, more rainy years.

Before we attempt to arrive at possible changes that could affect some of the issues causing the higher number of roadway deaths, first we need to look at the causes. That information is lacking at this point, and guessing at the problems will not help matters. When I see words like believed, suspects and probably used by authorities in trying to figure out what to do, I know that these folks dont know why this happening and thus are just guessing at answers. Would patients want their doctors guessing at what to do when they have a medical issue? I think not.

Lets get the facts together and study them before jumping to conclusions.

One thing we should not do is pass more laws about what people cannot do in their cars. Whether it be seat belt use, having an open container inside, or texting or otherwise using a cellphone, such laws just become revenue streams and provide law enforcement with excuses for stopping motorists who are posing no harm to others. This also removes our scarce and valuable police from patrolling for the real problem: drivers who we all see, all too often, getting away with bad and dangerous behavior. We should be concentrating on drivers who show by their actions on the road that they are a threat to others.

In statistics I have seen, pedestrians are as often as not responsible for getting hit by vehicles. Im all for the crosswalks with flashing lights that are used in high-pedestrian areas such as Clearwater Beach. Woe be you as a motorist or pedestrian if you do not use and honor the crossings as intended.

The advent of the Share The Road campaign is another problem because it pushes bicycle use of roadways. Combining high- and low-speed traffic is dangerous, which is why most freeways prohibit pedestrians and bicyclists. Marked bike lanes also shrink the pavement for vehicles, increasing chances of collisions with other vehicles. Motorists, not bicyclists, paid for the roadway  and considering 99 percent of people use roadways to travel or engage in commerce, the speedy and efficient use of highways by vehicles should be the highest priority. That said, sidewalks and bicycle paths are good community investments but not with highway funds.

Lets figure out what the problem is before we come up with a big plan that may not address the real issues.
