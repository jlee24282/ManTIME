The price of Kuwaiti oil went up by 27 cents to USD 51.73 per barrel Friday as oppose to USD 51.46 pb the day before, said Kuwait Petroleum Corporation (KPC) Saturday . 

Globally, the price went down after data showed an increase in oil drilling rigs in the US. The decrease was also attributed to investors&apos; doubts regarding the validity of the decision to cut down oil production by world major producers . 

The price of the Brent crude went down by 72 cents to USD 55.52 per barrel, the same case with the American crude which went down by 61 cents to USD 53.17 pb.
