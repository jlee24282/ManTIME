<TEXT type="str">Betty Heath / As I See It 
    
In January, 1986 my family and I were living in Clear Lake City, Texas, which is a suburb of Houston. I was working as administrative assistant for the dean of the School of Education at the University of Houston at Clear Lake City. 
 
Besides balancing the school&apos;s $12 million budget, my job responsibilities included maintaining personnel files for the adjunct professors and collecting the class syllabus from each of them each semester. In doing so I came to know them quite well. June Scobee was one such professor. But, I also knew June and her husband as my neighbors. Both friendly and personable, they always greeted me with a smile. My son, Tim, and I were shopping at one of the local malls when we encountered June and Dick. When she introduced Tim to Dick, and Tim was immediately awestruck. He had just met Richard Francis Scobee, the astronaut. Dick was somewhat shy and unassuming, but he was quick to answer all of Tim&apos;s questions and explain some of the workings of NASA to him. He later brought us back a patch from one of his space flights. 
 
It wasn&apos;t unusual to run into astronauts, as they all lived in our area. We shopped at the same grocery stores. Their children went to the same schools as our children, played little league together and participated in church activities together. By 1986, space flights had become routine. Those of us living in the space community no longer held parties to watch the launchings on TV. We just more or less took it for granted that the space program was a common occurrence. 
 
Jan. 28, 1986, began as routinely as any other day in South Texas. Everyone went about their business and didn&apos;t give a second thought to the launch scheduled that day. 
  
  
I had been invited by one of the professors to fly to Florida for the launching that day. A group usually flew on a cargo plane out of Ellington Air Force Base, and there was room for a few more to board before leaving, but I had to decline the offer. I was in my office when the call came in around 11 a.m. CST. One of my neighbors told me the Challenger had just fallen into the ocean and I needed to get home right away. As I drove home I thought surely everyone was all right. After all, it fell into the ocean, so certainly they would be rescued. 
 
At 11:38 a.m. EST on that January day the Challenger had lifted off with Dick Scobee as its commander. Then, 11 miles high and 9 miles downrange, just 73 seconds into the flight a fireball lit up the sky as the Challenger disintegrated over the ocean. That day I lost a good neighbor and friend and the country lost a great citizen. After one of the many memorial services, June gave me an autographed picture of Dick and the flight crew from a previous launch. 
 
I had it placed in a frame, along with the flight patch and hung it in my office. One year to the day of the tragedy the picture fell off the wall and crashed to the floor damaging the frame. 
 
This year, I met with the principal of Frederick High School and presented the photo and patch still in the damaged frame along with other mementos of that tragic day to add to their collection at the school. I think maybe Dick would want it that way.
