<content type="str">As readers surely know by now, the news came earlier this week that Star Wars: Episode VIII will be called Star Wars: The Last Jedi. That of course got fans to speculatin&apos; about the nature of the title -- who is the last Jedi ? And also, why is the logo&apos;s font in the first poster for the film red ? 
 
You&apos;ll have to click through the links above for more on those burning questions, but below you&apos;ll find a quick slideshow of every Star Wars announcement poster ever released. From the original film (before it was even called A New Hope) to the prequel films and of course up through The Force Awakens, Rogue One and now The Last Jedi, see them all right here: 
 
Mark Hamill recently gave his thoughts on the new title, and Adam Driver has said Episode VIII will explore Kylo Ren&apos;s humanity . In addition to the returning cast, the film will also star newcomers to the Star Wars universe including Benicio Del Toro, Laura Dern and Kelly Marie Tran . 
 
Star Wars: The Last Jedi is written and directed by Rian Johnson and scheduled for release on December 15, 2017.
