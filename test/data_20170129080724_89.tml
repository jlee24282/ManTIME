<TITLE>EDITORIAL: Stefanik should lead on climate change</TITLE>
<TEXT>The defining characteristic of Elise Stefaniks 21st Congressional District is its wilderness. The district includes the whole top of New York state, including all but a tiny corner of the immense Adirondack Park. 
   
Since she is the federal representative for one of the great natural treasures of the United States, climate change should be her top priority, so we applaud her recent decision to join a bipartisan caucus on the issue. The mission of the Climate Solutions Caucus, which now comprises 10 Democrats and 10 Republicans, is to look for economically viable options to reduce climate risk and explore bipartisan policy options. 
   
The caucus does not have a bold agenda, at least not yet. But as storms strengthen and sea levels rise, perhaps this group of moderates will come up with responses that match the seriousness of the threat. 
   
It is reassuring that the congresswoman who, just a few years ago, would not affirm the reality of climate change has now committed herself to finding ways to cope with it. She is no longer in the head-in-the-sand camp of people like Scott Pruitt, President Trumps nominee to head the Environmental Protection Agency. As recently as 2016, Pruitt wrote the debate over global warming is far from settled. 
   
Pruitt is the attorney general in Oklahoma, where hundreds of earthquakes triggered by hydraulic fracturing (fracking) for oil and gas have been shaking the state apart. Despite the extensive damage from these fracking-generated quakes, the strongest statement Pruitt would make at his confirmation hearing, under questioning by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, is Ive acknowledged that I am concerned. 
   
We are concerned about the consequences for the worlds environment and for upstate New York if the United States fails to lead the effort to slow the pace of climate change. Big changes have already taken place, but even bigger ones  such as sea level rises that would have a catastrophic effect on oceanside communities  will take place without a concerted worldwide effort. 
   
Oceanside communities in the context of rising sea levels does not refer just to Key West and American Samoa. More than half of the worlds great cities are near the ocean and hundreds of millions of people live in low-lying coastal areas. 
   
It makes sense that the co-chairmen of the Climate Solutions Caucus, Ted Deutch and Carlos Curbelo, are both from Florida. It also makes sense that climate change skeptic Pruitt is from landlocked Oklahoma. 
   
Here in Stefaniks district, we also are landlocked, but we are affected by climate change in countless ways, from the increase in tick-borne diseases among upstate residents to the struggles of snow-dependent businesses like ski centers and snowmobile dealerships. 
   
We consider Congresswoman Stefaniks alliance with the Climate Solutions Caucus a good start, but no more. 
   
We have a lot of work to do on this issue, said Co-Chairman Curbelo, who, like Stefanik, is a Republican. 
   
Hes right, and because climate change legislation will face resistance from the Trump administration, progress will require bipartisanship. Rep. Stefanik has so far kept a low profile when bucking the Republican line, but the time has come for her to speak up for her district and the country on climate change, even if that means speaking against the Trump administration.
