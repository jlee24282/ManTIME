It is Roger Federer vs Rafael Nadal again ! The two greats of the game, who share possibly the greatest rivalry in the history of the game, will take on each other once again, this time in the men&apos;s singles final of the 2017 Australian Open on Sunday. Nadal has struggled with injuries, especially his wrist which made him miss Wimbledon last year, and last reached the final of a Grand Slam event in 2014. On Sunday though, he can win his second Australian Open title and become the first man in the Open era -- and only the third man in history -- to win each of the four Grand Slam titles twice.

Swiss maestro Federer, on the other hand, himself stated that he was on &quot;one leg&quot; as he missed the latter half of the 2016 season due to his knee surgery, not to mention his back which also bothered him. 
 
But there they are. The two greats will once again take on each other in what will be their first Major final since the 2011 French Open when Nadal won in four sets. 
 
With Federer and Nadal both returning from injuries, and neither having won a Major since mid-2014, a ninth Grand Slam final between two of the most dominant men in the sport was considered an extreme long shot at Melbourne Park. Nadal leads Federer leads 6-2 in Major finals.</TEXT>
