<TITLE>Newman: As National Signing Day looms, Colorados recruiting stock continues to rise</TITLE>
<TEXT>With National Signing Day coming up Wednesday, Coloradosstake in college athletics keeps getting higher and higher. 
 
The Denver metro area in particular  where recruiters have long dogged the lack of elite Division I players  has seen an increasein talent across the board, with powerhouse athletic schools Valor Christian , Cherry Creek and Regis Jesuit each having more than ten Division I commits in the Class of 2017. 
 
Behindthat upward trend are a number of factors. For one,this place is a boomtown. Colorado was the second-fastest growing state between 2014 and 2015, meaning more kids, a bigger pool ofathletes and thus more talent. The explosion of the private training business in the last five years hasnt hurt either,and plenty of athletes andtheir families are learning to leverage that training  and the college connections that come with it  to advance to the next level. 
 
And amid the conditions ripe for botheconomic andathletic development, Colorado has taken a stranglehold on a couple sports in particular. 
 
The local girls soccer scene is loaded with toptalent, with more than 150Division I commits in the last three recruiting classes.Top clubs such as Real and Rush continually dominate on a national scale in the Elite Clubs National League, making championship game appearances the norm. Thats not to mention that the future of the United States Womens National Team, 18-year-old phenom Mallory Pugh,became the youngest American soccer player to score in the Olympic Games last August, just a few months after graduating from Mountain Vista High School.

Colorado is an epicenter for lacrosse too. Its partly why legendary college coach Bill Tierney  who won six titles at Princeton  decided to ditch the East Coast for the University of Denver, where he has used an influxof homegrown players to build the Pioneers into a national powerhouse. That success is mirrored at the high school level, as the30-plusDivision I commits in the Class of 2017 are defined by guys such as Mountain Vista senior attackman Colin Munro, who in addition to earning a scholarship to North Carolina already gainedinternational recognition by leading theCoquitlam Junior Adanacs to thecoveted Minto Cup last summer. 
 
And while the states twomost popular sports, football and boys basketball, are still a long, long way from matching the likes of Texas and California, serious strides have been made in the last decade. On the gridiron, though the majority of Division I talent has become more concentrated within a dozen or so 5Aschools, the talent level is increasing nonetheless. The proliferation of the national schedule has helped with that, and Class of 2017 starssuch as Valor Christian quarterbackDylan McCaffrey (University of Michigan) and Pomona lineman Jake Moretti (University of Colorado) give promise to more blue-chip recruits in the future. 
 
On the basketball court,the same trend is becoming evident, without-of-state tournaments, year-round club ball and names such as 2016 Overland graduate DeRon Davis (now playing at the University of Indiana) driving more local interest in the game and causing more recruiters to stopby The Centennial State. 
 
And as Colorado continues to grow into national prep relevancy  hockey, wrestling, baseball and softball are on the upswing too  all local fans who fill the stands can ask is that the athletes keep the hard work coming. If they do that, Colorado could be in the same recruiting realm as Texas and California before youknow it.</TEXT>
