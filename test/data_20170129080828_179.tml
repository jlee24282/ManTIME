<TEXT type="str">A local state representative has filed legislation prohibiting abortions of an unborn child after 20 weeks except in the case of a medical emergency. 
 
State Rep. Don Hahnfeldt, R- The Villages, and Rep. Joe Gruters, R-Sarasota, filed the “Florida Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act” making it a third-degree felony to perform an abortion after 20 weeks; it also requires physicians to report abortion information to the Department of Health. 
 
According to the legislation (HB 203) “20 weeks after fertilization, an unborn child reacts to stimuli that would be recognized as painful if applied to an adult human.” 
 
But published research in the Journal of the American Medical Association based on studies related to the pain of an unborn child showed that “evidence regarding the capacity for fetal pain is limited but indicates that fetal perception of pain is unlikely before the third trimester.” 
 
There are 13 states that ban abortions after 20 weeks. 
 
“This is a step in the right direction regardless of what the medical experts say,” Hahnfeldt said. “I believe that life is a gift and it begins at conception. We should make effort to protect the life of an unborn child just as we do after delivery.” 
 
Hahnfeldt said his preference would be to mirror what the state of Ohio was trying to do in outlawing abortion at six weeks. 
 
“But Gov. John Kasich, R-Ohio, vetoed the bill being that it would not be successful in the court system,” he said. 
 
Hahnfeldt’s legislation is just one of several controversial bills by local representatives and senators concerning religious expression in schools; narrowing the scope of the Lake County Water Authority; exempting law enforcement officers from handgun purchase waiting period; and limiting to 12 consecutive years the number of years Supreme Court justices and judges may hold the same office. 
 
Sen. Dennis Baxley, R-Lady Lake, filed legislation prohibiting a school district from “discriminating against students, parents or school personnel on the basis of religious viewpoints or expression,” according to information on the bill. 
 
The bill (SB 436) also gives students permission to wear clothing, jewelry and accessories displaying religious messages or symbols. It also specifies that a “school district may not prevent school personnel from participating in religious activities on school grounds that are initiated by students at reasonable times before or after the school day if such activities are voluntary and do not conflict with the responsibilities or assignments of such personnel.” 
 
Caroline Mala Corbin, professor of constitutional law at the University of Miami School of Law, raised some questions about the bill. 
 
“It is not clear how broadly it would be interpreted,” she said. “There is always a possibility that it could clash with the establishment clause of the Constitution. It is the clause that requires separation between church and state. Teachers are government employees. The teachers are the government. The government may not favor one religion over the other. They are more limited in their capacity as school teachers rather than private citizens.” 
 
But Baxley disagreed. 
 
“I think it’s irrational to think that a person’s worldview does not color their expression of how they look at things,” he said. “What we are seeing is an attempt to sterilize the environment from any expression of faith. I don’t think free expression of faith crosses the line that you are establishing a state religion.” 
 
Corbin also questioned what motivated the law considering that students already have freedom of speech and freedom of religion. 
 
Baxley said the bill was brought to him by Rep. Kimberly Daniels, D-Jacksonville. 
 
“She and I share a concern about freedom of religious expression because in many of the school policies they are prohibiting teachers from participating,” he said. “They are cracking down on wearing any emblem that expresses your faith. They are prohibiting prayer, even student initiated prayer. We still sense there is evidence of suppression of people’s free expression of their personal faith.” 
 
The Lake County Water Authority and its mission and authority has become another point of contention this legislative session. 
 
Rep. Larry Metz, R-Yalaha, is filing legislation that revises the Lake County Water Authority’s Enabling Act, which operates like a charter for the district. It establishes the powers and duties of the district. 
 
Those changes include: prohibiting the LCWA from using public funds to actively promote recreation and tourism; prohibits active parks, except for Hickory Point Park, and allows passive parks on LCWA property; and leaves in place the core mission of improving and protecting the streams, lakes and canals of Lake County, according to a press release from Metz’s office. 
 
“I am trying to revise the Enabling Act of the Water Authority to ensure it stays focused on its core mission of protecting our lakes, rivers and streams and to prevent it from performing functions that belong to other government agencies like parks and recreation, tourism, promotion and economic development,” Metz said. 
 
But Mike Perry, executive director of the LCWA, said its board was taken aback by the bill. 
 
“They are not sure the bill is necessary,” he said. “They have not strayed from their primary mission and it has never misused many of the powers it is given. They are elected officials and responsible to the electorate. They are concerned about having things like eminent domain that Rep. Metz wants to take away from us. He wants us out of the tourism business, particularly active recreation, and the board has never expressed an interest to do anything like Hickory Point. Some of the language would restrict us from being able to construct boat docks on our existing property.” 
 
But Lake County Commissioner Sean Parks and Baxley support the legislation. 
 
“If the LCWA is a special district, special districts should periodically be reviewed for efficiency and efficacy of purpose,” Parks said. “Rep. Metz is simply re-evaluating the purpose of the LCWA and in doing so is being mindful of the taxpayer.” 
 
And Baxley said Metz was clearly on “track to articulate the (LCWA’s) mission.” 
 
“Right now it is a little too broad and they have something like eminent domain rights, which I don’t think belongs there,” he said. 
 
Any legislation concerning firearms always seems to bring a fair amount of debate. 
 
Hahnfeldt filed a joint resolution with Rep. Robert Asencio, D-Miami, exempting law enforcement officers from a three-day handgun purchase waiting period. 
 
“Sworn law enforcement officers go through much more rigorous training and background checks then do concealed weapon permit carriers,” Hahnfeldt said. &quot;Therefore they have already met the requirements and should not have to wait for three days.” 
 
The issue concerning term limits for justices was also the focus of a local bill filed by Rep. Jennifer Sullivan, R-Eustis. 
 
Sullivan filed a joint resolution that proposes an amendment to the state Constitution to “limit to 12 consecutive years the number of years supreme court justices and district court judges may hold the same office and prohibiting justices or district judges from being reappointed for one year after leaving office.” 
 
Despite repeated attempts, Sullivan could not be reached for comment. </TEXT>
