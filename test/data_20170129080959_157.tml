<content type="str">FOXBORO - Mansfield High hockey coach Mike Balzarini saw the potential of his squad on the ice at the Foxboro Sports Center Saturday as the Hornets scored a goal in each period while blanking King Philip Regional High, 3-0, in their Hockomock League clash.

&quot;In a game like that, the shutout was huge,&quot; said Balzarini of Mansfield senior goaltender Brendan McKenna, who made 20 saves for his first shutout of the season. &quot;He came up big for us to play that well in a game we really wanted.&quot;

In a penalty-marred contest, KP was assessed 10 penalties and Mansfield seven. However, the Hornets killed all seven of their man-down situations, protecting a two-goal lead five minutes into the third period after being whistled for a four-minute major boarding infraction.

&quot;That was a huge kill for us,&quot; said Balzarini. &quot;We struggled with the power play all game, even though we were getting good looks, but the penalty-kill has been great for us all year.&quot;

Hornet senior captain Matt Farragher netted the first goal in the sixth minute of the first period off assists by freshman Chris Jenkins and senior Joe Olsen.

&quot;We&apos;ve been trying to get guys to use their bodies to gain control of the puck,&quot; said Balzarini. &quot;Farragher used his body and kept his feet moving around the net.&quot;

Mansfield had nearly a 5-on-3 advantage for nearly 1:30 in the first period, but Warrior goaltender Shane Frommer (38 saves) held strong against the Hornet attack, giving his team a chance.

Mansfield had 19 shots on net in the first period, outshooting King Philip 41-20 for the game. The Warriors had their best scoring chance when sophomore Garrett Maxwell teed a shot of the crossbar.

&quot;The last game against Oliver Ames, we were held to just three shots in the third period,&quot; said Balzarini. &quot;We aim for 10 (shots) a period so today was a lot more like what we want to see.&quot;

At the 11:56 mark of the second period, Jenkins took the puck from a KP skater and was able to beat Frommer with a wrist shot near his own bench to extend the Mansfield lead to 2-0. It remained that way until 2:44 of the third period when Hornet junior defenseman Tim Arnold made it 3-0, assisted by junior Patrick McCafferty.

&quot;Overall, that&apos;s how we want to get it done,&quot; said Balzarini. &quot;It was a good win and we fought hard all three periods.&quot;

Mansfield (6-5-1, 3-2 in the Hockmock) will take on North Attleboro at New England Sports Village on Sunday, while King Philip (3-10, 3-3 in the Hockomock) will resume play Wednesday against Franklin at Pirelli Veterans Arena.</content>
