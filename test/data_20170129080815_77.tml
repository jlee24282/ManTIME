<content type="str">The Academy Awards will go down at end of February, likely providing us with a gorgeous collection of red carpet gowns , plenty of PDA-friendly couples , and some truly spectacular moments . It will be the 89th iteration of the annual award show, and although they&apos;re sure to be great, we have a feeling it&apos;ll be hard to top what happened at the Oscars 20 years ago. That&apos;s right â€” the red carpet at the 1997 Oscars was, as the kids say, f*cking lit. The dress code included crop-tops, t-shirts, and velvet capes, and couples who seem bizarre to us now were getting cozy all over the place. 2017&apos;s show might have Ryan Gosling , but the one in 1997 had someone legitimately dressed as the Oscar statue. There&apos;s no coming back from that.</content>
