<content type="str">RANDOLPH TWP. - Attorney Eric Harrison, who represented Randolph Township during a civil trail in the Morris County Superior Court in which Randolph Police Officer Melissa Bailey was awarded $87,403 in damages for gender discrimination and sexual harassment, has filed a motion with Superior Court Judge W. Hunt Dumont to set aside the verdict and have a new trial ordered. 
   
After a two-month civil trial, Bailey was awarded $50,000 in damages and an additional $37,403 on Tuesday, Dec. 20, to cover lost wages when she took a nine-month leave of absence in 2014 after being diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, after a Morris County civil jury found that she had suffered emotional distress and was a victim of harassment because of her gender by higher ranking officers in the department. 
   
Bailey received a separate check for $40,000 from the township to cover lost wages in 2014. 
   
Harrison claimed in his motion that the jury was incorrectly told by the judge that Bailey had participated in three counts of &quot;protected activity&quot; under New Jersey Law Against Discrimination . 
   
Two of the instances were separate conversations in 2010 and 2011 between Bailey former Randolph Police Chief Robert Mason in which she said it was unfair that female officers be penalized for using sick days to take care of sick children at home according to court documents. 
   
The conversations took place after Bailey was passed over for a promotion to sergeant in consecutive years. 
   
The third instance was Bailey&apos;s continued efforts to seek that promotion while she maintained a good faith despite her belief that gender discrimination existed within the department. 
   
Attorneys Richard Murray and Omar Lopez, who represented Bailey in the trial, have opposed Harrison&apos;s motion. 
   
According to court papers, Murray said that Harrison &quot;failed to demonstrate clearly and convincingly that there has been a miscarriage of justice that warrants a new trial.&quot; 
   
In the court papers, Murray argues that Dumont&apos;s legal charge to the jury and on the verdict sheet were correct, despite Harrison&apos;s claims. 
   
Harrison wrote that the three acts and evidence in the trail did not establish protected activity under Law Against Discrimination and that the only protected activity was the filing of the 2012 lawsuit. 
   
Harrison claimed that Bailey&apos;s supervisors did not treat her any differently than they would treat any of the male police officers in the department and called witnesses at the trail to support his claim. 
   
The verdict sheet did not specify which actions of the ranking officers originally named as defendants by Bailey were found to be offensive or discriminatory towards Bailey and resulted in the award. 
   
By the end of the trial, Randolph Township was the sole defendant in the case although when she originally filed the lawsuit in 2012, Bailey had sued Mason, current Randolph Police Chief David Stokoe, Lts. William Harzula and Christopher Giuliani and former Township Manager John Lovell. 
   
In the trail, Bailey alleged that she had been passed over for the promotion to sergeant because of her gender and that after questioning Mason about the results of her sergeants exams, which she did not pass, she was intimidated by Mason. 
   
She testified that Mason pressed his body up against hers and that she was the target of internal affairs investigations and corrective action mandates, which she alleged were not endured my male officers on the force. 
   
During the trial, the jury found that Bailey did not prove that she should have been promoted to sergeant. 
   
A date has not yet been set for the judge to hear Harrison&apos;s motion for a new trial.</content>
