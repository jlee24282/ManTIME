<TEXT type="str">A day off that was supposed to help the Lakers improve their overall health brought news of one player getting sicker, while another may be closer to a return. 
 
Julius Randle, who sat out Thursday’s game at Utah with an illness, was diagnosed with pneumonia. Per a statement from the team, he will not participate in basketball activities for 2-3 days, but will be re-evaluated Monday. The timing allows for the possibility that Randle wouldn’t miss any more game and could be available Tuesday when the Lakers host Denver. 
 
D’Angelo Russell, however, is showing signs that he could be ready to face the Nuggets. A Lakers spokesman said the team is “hopeful” that Russell will be able to practice Sunday, which could pave the way for Russell’s return to the court two nights later. 
 
Russell has missed the last three games with a strained right calf and a sprained MCL in his right knee. He was originally expected to be out 1-2 weeks. 
 
Randle has started all 44 games he has played in for the Lakers, averaging 13 points, 8.4 rebounds and 3.8 assists. He had struggled in recent appearances, however, scoring in double figures just once in his last six games and snaring 10 rebounds just once in seven games. 
 
Russell is the Lakers’ second-leading scorer, averaging 14.3 points per game. He leads the Lakers with 4.4 assists per game. 
 
The Lakers took advantage of the rare break in the schedule, practicing neither Friday — typical after playing back-to-back games — or Saturday. 
 
Following Thursday’s 96-88 loss to the Jazz, coach Luke Walton said the Lakers would benefit from the rest. 
 
“I think it will be good for some of our guys,” he said. “Some of our guys are beaten down a little bit, hopefully get D’Angelo, Julius back and get some good practice time in. We’re a young team so the more practice time we get, normally we’re pretty sharp after that.” 
 
With the exception of the All-Star weekend, which this year will stretch from Feb. 16-23 for the Lakers, this weekend marks the longest remaining span between games for the Lakers. After playing the Nuggets on Tuesday they will head East for five games in 10 days. 
 
The extended break could also be an opportunity for Walton and his staff to tinker with lineups, with a special eye toward the point guard spot in the event Russell remains sidelined. Two games ago, Walton moved Jose Calderon into the starting lineup and Brandon Ingram, his first choice to take Russell’s spot, back to the bench. 
 
 
Since then, neither player has scored in a combined 70 minutes on the court. 
 
“We’ll obviously be on the drawing board and depending on D’Angelo’s situation,” Walton said. “We like Jose or (Marcelo Huertas) out there just because they’re point guards, so even when they’re not scoring they help settle us in and get us into our offense.” 
 
Randlel’s availability also creates a question mark at power forward. On Thursday, Walton turned to Tarik Black, who tallied just four points, two rebounds, a block and a steal in a season-high 31 minutes. 
 
“I thought that Tarik was good honestly,” Walton said. “Mainly on the defensive end. Defensively more than anything he was really helpful.” 
 Motivating Mozgov  
One subplot to rookie center Ivica Zubac’s recent statistical surge is what it could mean for starter Timofey Mozgov. After signing a four-year, $64 million contract in the summer, Mozgov has struggled to make his mark with the Lakers. 
 
Walton acknowledged that it was possible Zubac’s success, including back-to-back double-doubles last week, could serve as a bit of a wake-up call to Mozgov. 
 
“Yeah, I’m sure,” Walton said. “It’s human nature when someone behind you is playing as well as Zu’s been playing well for us.” 
 
Mozgov is averaging 7.6 points, 5 rebounds and less than one block per game in 21 minutes for the Lakers — all around his career averages. 
 
Against the Jazz, he recorded nine points and nine rebounds, while Zubac scored a career-high 16 points to go with 10 boards. Walton said that after Mozgov “struggled early” against the Jazz he “stuck with it and he was a big part” of the Lakers’ efforts to keep the score close early in the third period. 
 
But he’d understand if Mozgov is looking over his should at Zubac. 
 
“It’s natural for him to at least be thinking about it a little bit,” Walton said, adding that Mozgov played a big role in keeping the Lakers in the game against the Jazz early in the third quarter. “We’ll encourage him to keep playing his game.” 
 They know how to win  
While speaking to schoolchildren at a clinic hosted by Spectrum SportsNet on Saturday, former Lakers point guard Derek Fisher offered some advice that could apply as well to the current Lakers as to kids. 
 
“I don’t think anyone is just a winner because they woke up today,” said Fisher, who joined Spectrum as a studio analyst this season. “And so when you say winning is a skill, meaning that it’s possible for anybody, a skill is something that if you work at it in the right ways and you invest the right amount of time … if you’re willing to invest the time in something you can develop the skill to be good at it.” 
 
Appearing with James Worthy at a clinic for students from Toland Way Elementary and Fletcher Drive Elementary, Fisher said it is important for members of the current team to be active in local communities “so that during the tough times, the people in this city will still have your back if they feel like you’re a part of it.”</TEXT>
