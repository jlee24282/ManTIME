<content type="str">died peacefully on January 13th in Gilbert, Arizona at the age of 77. Bob was born into an Arizona pioneer family on June 29th 1939 in Jerome, AZ . At a young age his family moved to Flagstaff, AZ, where he graduated from Flagstaff High School in 1957, and attended Arizona State College (now NAU). Bob then enlisted in the United States Army. After his service, he returned home to Arizona State University, graduating in 1965 with a degree in Engineering. While still in college, Bob began working for General Motors at the Desert Proving Ground in Mesa, AZ where he spent his entire 35-year career. Bob was an avid outdoorsman and photographer, who enjoyed camping, hiking, skiing, fishing, and hunting. Most of all, he had a passion for traveling to places off the beaten path. Many will remember Bob as one of the founding members of the Arizona Outdoor and Travel club, where he lead many trips throughout Arizona, the western U.S, Mexico, and Canada. He especially loved Alaska and British Columbia where he visited many times. 

Bob is survived by his sons Michael of Mesa and Brian of Tempe; grandsons Ryan and Sean of Mesa; sister Marcia Devere of Sierra Vista, AZ, and brother Bill Riordan of Apache Junction, AZ; plus several nieces, nephews, and cousins. He is preceded in death by his parents Robert and Jean Riordan of Flagstaff.
