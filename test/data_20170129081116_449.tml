Former Derby County defender Danny Higginbotham says leaving Manchester United for the Rams was the best decision he has ever made. 
 
Higginbotham, who made 86 appearances for Derby before joining Southampton in 2003, has written about his time at Old Trafford in his weekly column for The Sun. 
 
The 38-year-old Sky Sports pundit was first told of Derby&apos;s interest by Sir Alex Ferguson, who told him to consider the offer to join the Rams carefully. 
 
&quot;It was late June 2000, I was 21, living at home with mum and dad and had signed a four-year deal with Manchester United the summer before. Everything was good. Then the phone rang. It was Sir Alex Ferguson,&quot; he said.

&quot;He asked how my summer had been, the usual. Then he said Derby had made an offer for me and United had accepted. 

 
&quot;Transfer windows are an uncertain time for clubs but they are too for players, especially young players.Whole careers hinge on decisions made — and often the player has little say. 
 
&quot;Sir Alex said I could stay if I wanted but he also said Phil Neville, Denis Irwin and Mikael Silvestre were ahead of me. I&apos;d only known United. I had been there since I was 10. 
 
&quot;But I knew before I&apos;d put the phone down that I would leave. I wasn&apos;t heartbroken. I supported United as a boy, I had been with them a long time — but I was a realist.

&quot;It was great to be at a club like United but I was happy to go. It was sink or swim. I had to be brave.&quot; 

 
Derby paid United £2m for Higginbotham and Jim Smith&apos;s side managed to avoid relegation from the Premier League on the penultimate day of the 2000-01 season with a 1-0 victory over United at Old Trafford.
