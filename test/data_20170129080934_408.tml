 Sevillas Hottest Hunks  SeePics  
Fans have to feel bad for Messi. Even when his rival, Ronaldo, loses, he overshadows the Barca superstar. Real Madrid were on a record-setting 40-game undefeated streak when they ran smack into Sevilla. After losing to Sevilla for the first time in this La Liga season, they fell 2-1 to Celta Vigo in the first leg of the Copa del Rey quarterfinal. Many expected them to bounce back, but in the second game, Celta held Ronaldos crew to a 2-2 draw. Real has been eliminated from tournament! 
 
Real Betis was in the news, as the teams left-back, Riza Durmisi , 23, has drawn the eye of Liverpool . Riza has a 17million buyout clause on his contract, meaning that he would come at a hefty price. These reports of the Reds interest come after the teams manager shot down the idea that hes shopping for more players in that position. 
 
What I can say is that I didnt think for a second until now about another left-back, Jurgen Klopp, 49, said earlier in January, according to This Is In Anfield . We are always looking for players but in this moment we have two left-backs [James Milner ] is one and Alberto Moreno the other. 
 
If Riza goes all Wu-Tang on Barcelona and scores like hes powered by the Shaolin, he might be too attractive of an offer for Jurgern to pass up. Of course, he needs to get by Barca first and thats no easy task.
