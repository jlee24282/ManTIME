Donald Trump&apos;s nominee for secretary of education, Betsy DeVos, probably survived the grilling she got from angry Democrats on Jan. 17. 
 
When Sen. Patty Murray demanded she promise not &quot;to privatize public schools,&quot; DeVos replied, &quot;Not all schools are working for the students.&quot; 
 
When Sen. Bernie Sanders asked her to make &quot;universities tuition free,&quot; DeVos replied, &quot;I think that&apos;s a really interesting idea (but) there&apos;s nothing in life that&apos;s truly free.&quot; 
 
Those answers were fine. I suppose it&apos;s important for a nominee to be polite. 
 
But what I wish she&apos;d said was: &quot;No, Sen. Murray, I won&apos;t promise not to privatize! Didn&apos;t you notice the mess government schemes create? Many government-run schools are lousy! Private is better!&quot; 
 
&quot;Sen. Sanders, how clueless can you be? Your &apos;free&apos; stuff is already bankrupting America! Your &apos;free&apos; health care plan was rejected by your own state — once your fellow Democrats did the math. Then your wife bankrupted Burlington College! You call yourself &apos;socialist!&apos; Haven&apos;t you noticed that socialism wrecks people&apos;s lives? You should resign in shame!&quot; 
 
Sen. Elizabeth Warren demanded DeVos explain what she will do about schools like Donald Trump&apos;s &quot;fake university ... I am curious how the Trump administration would protect against waste, fraud and abuse at similar for-profit colleges.&quot; 
 
DeVos tried, &quot;If confirmed, I will certainly be very vigilant ...&quot; 
 
&quot;How?&quot; interrupted Warren, who went on to sneer, &quot;You&apos;re going to give that to someone else to do?&quot; 
 
Warren&apos;s attack was absurd because Trump University was not an actual college that received federal funding. As the Cato Institute&apos;s Neal McCluskey points out, &quot;Of course it wasn&apos;t, and the education secretary did not have jurisdiction over it.&quot; 
 
What DeVos should have said: &quot;I would do nothing about Trump University, you smearmonger! Trump U has nothing to do with schools that get federal money. Do you conflate the two just to make profit the villain?&quot; 
 
Sen. Al Franken asked DeVos whether students&apos; learning should be assessed based on &quot;proficiency or growth.&quot; Proficiency means a third-grader masters third-grade-level work. Growth means improvement — that&apos;s fairer to disadvantaged students, who start from behind. 
 
DeVos began, &quot;I would ... correlate it to competency and mastery ...&quot; 
 
&quot;That&apos;s growth. That&apos;s not proficiency,&quot; interrupted Franken, suggesting that DeVos didn&apos;t understand education terms. 
 
DeVos should have said: &quot;Senator, neither measure is fair to teachers or kids! The proficiency vs. growth argument is a by-product of your stupid No Child Left Behind law. Such federal micromanagement is terrible because every kid is different. That&apos;s why your opposition to choice is destructive. Of course, you don&apos;t even know how bad many government-run schools are. You sent your kids to a private school that charges $44,000 tuition. Get real, Al!&quot; 
 
Sen. Chris Murphy demanded that DeVos support a ban on guns in schools. DeVos replied, &quot;That is best left to locales and states.&quot; 
 
Murphy was incredulous. &quot;You can&apos;t say definitively, today, that guns shouldn&apos;t be in schools?!&quot; 
 
Earlier at the hearing, Sen. Mike Enzi mentioned a Wyoming school that has &quot;a grizzly bear fence.&quot; So DeVos joked that there was &quot;probably a gun in the school to protect from potential grizzlies.&quot; 
 
The New York Times called that comment an &quot;internet punchline.&quot; GQ called DeVos &quot;Horribly Embarrassing in Every Way&quot; and, oversimplifying the issue, said that &quot;she thinks guns belong in schools because of ... grizzlies.&quot; 
 
What DeVos should have said: &quot;Senator! Have you no understanding of federalism? You think Washington, or you, know what&apos;s best for all schools in America? As education secretary, I don&apos;t have the power to ban guns. No federal official does! Read the Constitution, you ignorant control freak!&quot; 
 
OK. This is fantasy. No nominee can be that rude to politicians who have power over her. 
 
But I can wish, can&apos;t I?
