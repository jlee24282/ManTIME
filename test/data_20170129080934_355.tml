<TEXT type="str">Children from Willow River Early Childhood Program sent their love to Minnesota military members stationed overseas by gifting them with goodie packages, thank-you letters and these handmade American flags.   
Children from Willow River Early Childhood Program bundled goodie packages and wrote thank-you letters to deployed military units from Minnesota as part of the program&apos;s third annual Hugs and Hellos for Heroes. Guided by program teacher Chas Balut, the children also crafted U.S. flags out of paper for their heroes. 
   
The goodie boxes delivered prepackaged food and snacks, soaps, toothpastes, crossword puzzle books, coloring books and other hygiene items.
