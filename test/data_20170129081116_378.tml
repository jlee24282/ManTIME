<TITLE>Shields Wants To Play AgainSam Shields said he's still dealing with a concussion sustained in Week 1.by Bill HuberPacker Report01/22/2017</TITLE>
<TEXT>Sam Shields said he's still dealing with a concussion sustained in Week 1. 
 
ATLANTA  The Green Bay Packers season-long problems defending the pass were on full display in their 44-21 loss to the Atlanta Falcons in the NFC Championship Game. 
 
Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan had a huge game, completing 27-of-38 passes for 392 yards and four touchdowns. The only thing preventing a bigger afternoon was the scoreboard. Ryan had 271 yards by halftime and 343 yards after the first drive of the third quarter. 
 
The Packers shoddy pass defense started with Sam Shields concussion in Week 1. Shields, who spent the rest of the season on injured reserve, was at the Georgia Dome. 
 
He said hes still dealing with the aftereffects of that concussion  the fourth of his professional career. 
 
Some days its tough headaches, some days its mild, Shields said in the bowels of the Georgia Dome near the Packers locker room after the game. It varies. I never know. Im so used to it that its just normal. Each day its getting better. Ill be back." 
 
And thats his intention  coming back. 
 
Im thinking its not over, Shields said. Ive still got more in me. But Im going through this, what Ive got to go through. Just take it one day at a time. 
 
Why risk himself and the possibility of another serious head injury? 
 
I understand why you ask that, Shields said. I dont know. I just love the game, man, and I feel that I can get back out there and play. If not, then not. But right now its just day by day. 
 
Shields is under contract with the Packers through next season. He carries a salary-cap charge of $12.125 million  a huge figure given the concussion history. If the Packers were to release him, theyd save $9 million of base salary and roster bonuses.
