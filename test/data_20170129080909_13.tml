<TEXT type="str">In a court trial, an attorney must constantly absorb witness testimony and opposing arguments while crafting articulate, legally sound strategies in response. It is a demanding task that can be daunting even to seasoned lawyers. 
 
For the roughly 80 high school students who competed at Mendocino County’s mock trial semi-final competition on Saturday, it was just one more extracurricular activity to juggle with school work and friends. 
 
Teams from Developing Virtue Girls School in Talmage, Fort Bragg High School, Laytonville High School, and Ukiah High School squared off in the first half of the two-day competition, where students took on the roles of defense attorneys, prosecutors, witnesses, and bailiffs in a fictional criminal trial. In a dramatic rhetorical struggle to prove the guilt or innocence of a restaurateur accused of human trafficking, competitors cross-examine witnesses, answer probing questions, make objections, and deliver closing arguments, and their performances are judged by legal professionals, who award points according to how well they employ carefully honed courtroom tactics. 
 
The first session of the tournament will conclude with the third round, held the morning of Feb. 4, and the two teams with the most accumulated points will proceed to the fourth and final round. The winner of the competition will represent Mendocino County at the Califronia Mock Trial Finals, which will be held in late March in Riverside.   
 
The stakes may not be real, but the skills these young jurists develop can be uncannily close to the real thing, said Zach Snyder, an attorney who coaches the Ukiah High School team. 
 
“That’s one of the things that’s also really impressive about the students, not only do they memorize what they have to, but they’re able to think on their feet and they’re able to respond in the moment,” Snyder said. “You know, I have to remind myself sometimes that they’re not real attorneys.” 
 
The constant trial and error of practice can be demanding, especially for students with already packed extracurricular schedules, students and attorneys said. But grinding competition eventually pays off, providing students the opportunity to recognize their talents and gain a clearer view of a potential career path. 
 
Hannah Hinrichs, a freshman at Ukiah High School who testifies and is cross-examined as an expert witness, has long aspired to be a defense attorney. Before participating in her school’s mock-trial program, though, she had been able to glean only a rough understanding of her likely future career from court dramas and online research. 
 
“I always kind of wanted to be a lawyer, but this really brought me closer to knowing how it actually works,” Hinrichs said. 
 
The skills these students develop over the course of a season prepare them to be confident and articulate young women and men regardless of whether they go to law school or not, Snyder said. 
 
 
“You see some students start out, and they’re shy, and they’re not good public speakers,” Snyder said. “And after a couple months, you’re like, ‘This isn’t the same person. The performance they’re giving is great.’ Which is pretty rewarding to see that happen.”</TEXT>
