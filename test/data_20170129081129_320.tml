"I called this meeting because frankly ratings have ben dropping and suddenly everyone loves cricket. So what would be our dream result to get back on top?," said Lewis Martin, Channel Seven head of sport: 
 
Bruce McAvaney: "A Roger-Rafa final would be ... special"

Martin turns to Hamish McLachlan.

HM: "I'm your man." 
 
LM: "What's on your wish list? 
 
HM: "Well Gill said what has worked well for the AFL is this Heritage Round. We could make the courts faster, get the serve-volley back, maybe it will help Roger get another slam." 
 
LM: "Love it. Roger and Rafa in the final. Brilliant. 
 
HM: "And it could help Venus. We could see a Serena-Venus final." 
 
LM: "You're an ideas man Hame." 
 
Martin: "Anyone else? Thoughts?" 
 
"I think we should run lots of My Kitchen Rules ads. Everyone loves them," said no-one. Anywhere. Ever. Proving you don't always get what you wish for. 
 
RETRO DREAMING 
 
Two finals between the most compelling thirty somethings 'rivals' in the game, unseen for ten years in grand slam finals. Even if nothing else happened, Roger and Rafa in the final was enough but on top of that: Serena and Venus played a final; thirties were the new twenties with all finalists and most of the quarter-finalists aged thirty something; the world number one got beaten by a serve volleyer; oh and Ash Barty was playing WBBL cricket this time last year. 
 
THE RETURN OF THE SERVE VOLLEY 
 
The Zverev brothers made the biggest statement of this Open. Sascha because at 19 he has a game, as he showed in losing to Rafa, that will take him to tennis' peak. And Mischa because he played a game against Andy Murray that made many wonder if serve volley was back. 
 
In Melbourne the courts and balls were faster. So Ivo Karlovic set a new Australian Open record for most aces in a match (75 against Horacio Zabellas). Games were taking less time than Rafa takes picking at his undies. 
 
THE EFFING COMEBACK 
 
Eff me if she didn't effingmake the effing semis. FFS. Lucic-Baroni delivered the most candid on court post-match interview making her first quarter final in 20 years. 
 
Asked how she persisted for so long against so many obstacles she replied: "Eff everything and everybody whoever tells you you can't do it. Just show up and win in your heart." 
 
She then won her next match and this time tearfully hinted more at the back story for why the woman dubbed 'The next Steffi Graf' had not realised that potential for 20 years. 
 
TWEET TWEET 
 
Roger does everything the best, even tweets. Federer tweeted a video of his new boy band  him, Gregor Dimitrov and Tommy Haas  singing "Hard to say I'm Sorry". 
 
ALL ADVICE WELCOME, NOT HEEDED 
 
If losing after imploding on the court wasn't enough Mark Philippoussis giving career advice on how to right his career has to be Nick Kyrgios' penny drop moment. 
 
His meltdown loss to Andreas Seppi came after being up two sets to one and a break. Afterwards he admitted, finally, that hey being the only player in the top 100 without a coach might not be the smartest move. 
 
WHO ARE YOU WEARING? 
 
Even Daria 'Dasha' Gavrilova did a double take when she appeared on court against Timea Bacsinszky wearing identical outfits. 
 
"It's a bit weird, but what can we do?," she said. 
 
It sent social media buzzing in the way only the truly irrelevant can and was only outdone by Mirka Federer's jumper choice - a pink and green Gucci number with the words L'aveugle par amour, ("blind love", or "blinded by love") written on it. Big in central Europe but not so pleasing to tennis fans it seems. 
 
THE INTERNATIONAL LANGUAGE OF "WHAT ARE YOU LOOKIN AT?" 
 
Things got testy on court between bustling Jo Wilfried Tsonga and Stan Wawrinka who is ordinarily as deadpan as a fondue bowl. 
 
Tsonga muttered about Wawrinka giving him greasy looks. 
 
"I looked at you when? Did I look at you at all? It's a tennis match. You've got to calm down, relax a bit." Wawrinka protested quite reasonably. 
 
"There's no worries," Tsonga said. But plainly there is. 
 
The pair both live in Switzerland and had been close but things went awry a few years ago after Stan's first slam when Tsonga was quoted in L'Equipe saying "If Stan can win a slam, then I deserve one too". 
 
ADIEU 
 
And with that we bid adieu to Australian Open 2017. Welcome back next year when Pat Rafter and Pete Sampras are favourites to play in the final on a green court.</TEXT>
