Not that we wanted to see the two men kill each other in the boxing ring, but we think the match would&apos;ve been more entertaining if someone actually won the competition. 
 
Even one knockout from Gadaffi or Azwindini would&apos;ve made our day, but it seems like Vuyo Dabula (Gadaffi) and Gabrielle Temudzani (Azwindini) were not out there to be victors but to play a fair sport and entertain the masses. 
 
The match which played last night, on SABC 2 had fans of Generations: The Legacy and Muvhango glued to their seats patiently waiting to see which man would swing the first blow. 
 
Although it was a draw, Vuyo Dabula was very prepared and confident that he was going to handle Gabrielle properly. 
 
During the weeks ahead of the fight Vuyo constantly taunted Gabrielle but in a playful manner of course. 
   
Vuyo was so prepared for the fight, he&apos;s videos were starting to scare us, just look at that swing. 
   
Even though the fight was a draw some felt that Azwindini should&apos;ve won the fight.

And unfortunately, some viewers thought the boxing match was a waste of time whilst some shaded Gadaffi&apos;s fighting technique. 
  
And why is Gaddafi fighting with one hand? Was he trained by black coffee? #BoxingAwards  pic.twitter.com/3DatZY328Q

We&apos;re sorry to see that some of you did not enjoy the match as much.

I would like to refer #BoxingAwards to section 7 (a) of the Euphonik Act of 2016. #Nonke for wasting our sleep.
