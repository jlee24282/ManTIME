<TITLE>Job aspirants ransacked party</TITLE>
<TEXT>Job offer to the unemployed in Tripura instead of bringing cheers caused resentment among aspirants across the state. The erring job seekers blocked the National Highway in North Tripura and shutdown CPI-M party offices in several places in past three days. The agitated youths had resorted attack on the ruling party leaders and ransacked the party offices in multiple places in North and South Tripura after job offers for various lower grade posts reached to the villages. While the number of offers is very limited, it is often alleged that genuine candidates have been deprived and only candidates of privileged section are getting most of the jobs. Resentments among youths of Udaipur, Shantirbazar, Belonia and Kumarghat sub-divisions over offer letters have become obvious on similar cause recently. The alleged most of the offer letters went to candidates belonging to affluent families and added, "Even members of youth wing of ruling CPIM have been overlooked." Most of the job offers went to candidates of families where other members of the family are already in Government service. It is also alleged one person who is discharging his duties in Government service, has got an offer. UNI BB KK</TEXT>
