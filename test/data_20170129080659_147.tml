There’s a scene in the film “Hidden Figures” in which Col. Jim Johnson (played by Mahershala Ali) expresses surprise to see a woman doing complex mathematics because it’s “so taxing.” 
 
Katherine Johnson (played by Taraji P. Henson), the woman doing the math, replies with this: “On any given day, I analyze the binomial levels of air displacement, friction and velocity and compute over 10,000 calculations by cosine, square root and lately analytic geometry. By hand. There are 20 bright, highly capable Negro women in the west computing group, and we’re proud to be doing our part for the country. So yes, they let women do some things at NASA, Mr. Johnson. And it’s not because we wear skirts. It’s because we wear glasses.” 
 
There are a lot of ways the film, nominated Tuesday for the Best Picture Academy Award, can be seen: as women overcoming the times and attendant social barriers; as black women overcoming even more barriers because of their race; and as the triumph of math. 
 
Used by people who know what they’re doing, math saves the day. 
 
In “Hidden Figures,” it helps the United States win the space race and beat the commies. In life, well, we’d still be living in caves without it, assuming the human species wasn’t dead from some plague that could’ve only been defeated with a foundation of math. 
 
It would be wrong to call this the Age of Math, because every age has been an age of math or else life as we know it wouldn’t exist, but it seems that finally popular culture is recognizing that the people to celebrate in film and on TV are the ones who know their way around the trapezoidal rule. 
 
In fact, it’s an especially hopeful sign for math getting its rightful recognition that the female mathematicians in “Hidden Figures” aren’t basement-dwelling weirdos incapable of interacting with other humans, but normal, cool, brilliant women who really, really know calculus. 
 
This is a step up, because how many times in film have the mathematically inclined been portrayed as the geeky, the unstable, the hopeless and the hygienically challenged? 
 
OK, yes, the gang on “The Big Bang Theory” are huge nerds, but they’re hilarious and that’s a top 10 show. 
 
Maybe Hollywood will continue to recognize that the mathematician on the team is just as valuable, and probably more so, than the beefcake with the gun. Heck, maybe the mathematician is the beefcake with the gun. 
 
Maybe this could be the beginning of everyone loving, or at least appreciating, math just a little bit more. 
 
“Math puts the real world in numbers,” explained Emad Shahnoushi, 17, a junior at Palisade High School and a student in one of teacher Ann Conaway’s AP calculus classes. 
 
At the end of a recent class, the 15 boys and 11 girls in attendance that day pondered what they love about math. 
 
“Because it makes sense.” 
 
“It has a right answer.” 
 
“It explains science.” 
 
“Because it has rules and it’s not arbitrary like every other subject,” said Shaun Arhelger, 17, also a junior, and only half joking. 
 
This was at the end of a lesson on the trapezoidal rule, which began with an exercise Conaway designed based on the Stephen King book “The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon”: “Nine-year-old Trisha McFarland is Hopelessly lost in the woods, and the efforts of those looking for her have turned up nothing. The graph below shows the woods in which she is lost and measurements of the width of the woods (in miles) at regular intervals.” 
 
The students had to use the trapezoidal rule to approximate the area of the woods and the number of people it would take to scour the entire woods in a single day, based on one person being able to search 15 square miles per day (which Conaway acknowledged is extremely generous). 
 
Like she does occasionally, because that’s how math is approached in the real world, Conaway allowed her students to pull their super-strength calculators from their backpacks, though she wants them also to be able to do the calculus on paper. 
 
Ultimately, after a few hits and misses — “We make a lot of mistakes in math,” Conaway said, “and the learning comes in when you recognize the mistake and figure out how to fix it.” — it was determined that the woods were 51,850 square miles and the search would require 3,457 people. 
 
So, this one’s for the people who ignominiously lump arithmetic and mathematics together, who sneer, “When am I ever going to use calculus in the real world?” 
 
You might not, but here’s hoping the search and rescue team does. 
 
And yes, granted, not everyone is good at math, just like not everyone is good at laying tile or fixing cars or doing public relations. Maybe even reading about that trapezoidal rule exercise made you itchy and uncomfortable. 
 
But math — so foundational, so fundamental — has long borne the stigma of being “hard.” Remember the talking Barbie debacle from the late ‘90s, when one of her programmed phrases was “Math is hard!” 
 
Tee hee! If everyone thought that way, Barbie, then you’d probably want to stop driving your convertible over any bridges or near any kind of man-made structure. 
 
Conaway said while some students do psych themselves out about the difficulty of math before they attempt it, District 51’s emphasis on Habits of Mind is encouraging students to at least be willing to try. 
 
“Through the integration of Growth Mindset and Habits of Mind into our classrooms, students are more and more willing to treat things that are difficult for them as a challenge and an opportunity,” explained Josh King, a math teacher at Central High School. “Our school has been emphasizing the importance of effort over skill to encourage students to learn from their mistakes. 
 
“Growth Mindset is an ideology that is based on the work of Dr. (Carol) Dweck and revolves around the idea that our brains are malleable. Depending on our approach to tasks, concepts, etc. we can either let our prior experience hold us back and use it as an excuse (fixed mindset), or we can look at tough situations as a chance to grow — ‘I can’t factor that trinomial YET’ (growth mindset).” 
 
Perhaps it’s this mindset that will raise the number of undergraduate students pursuing math-intensive majors, which has not seen net growth over the past 30 years, according to the Mathematical Association of America (maa.org). We need students in math-intensive majors! There will be no smartphone innovations, no space stations, no efficient machines, no crowd control, no urban design without them! 
 
Plus, consider this: Start typing the name “Isaac” into the Google search bar. All it takes is “Isa” and Google suggests “Isaac Newton.” Talk about a legacy! Who doesn’t want to be that famous? Or at least as cool as, say, Neil deGrasse Tyson or Elon Musk? Or as visionary (and rich) as Bill Gates? 
 
There is art in math, and elegance. British author G.K. Chesterton opined, “The difference between the poet and the mathematician is that the poet tries to get his head into the heavens while the mathematician tries to get the heavens into his head.” 
 
And in “The Housekeeper and the Professor,” Yoko Ogawa wrote, “Solving a problem for which you know there’s an answer is like climbing a mountain with a guide, along a trail someone else has laid. In mathematics, the truth is somewhere out there in a place no one knows, beyond all the beaten paths. And it’s not always at the top of the mountain. It might be in a crack on the smoothest cliff or somewhere deep in the valley.” 
 
Yes! Math! The ultimate adventure! The uncharted territories! Let’s keep this zeitgeist going! 
 
Math is hard? No, math is awesome.</TEXT>
