<TEXT type="str">People are still talking about the removal of some thickets in Watch Hill. Birders participating in the Christmas Bird Count reported that two thickets that had provided habitat for certain species had been removed, and not for the purpose of construction, but for aesthetic reasons. 
 
Here’s an email I received from birder Glenn Williams after I first wrote about this issue: 
 
“I just read your column after being told that I was quoted in it,” Williams writes. “I am so glad that someone is taking the issue to the public. I just sent a description to someone who asked about it and thought that I should send you the same information. 
   
From this section: 
Editorial: At this DOT, rubber actually hits the road 
  
“I have been doing the Napatree CBC since its inception and am a co-compiler. The area that I cover for the count is Watch Hill. Every year, there are less thickets. Homeowners are definitely switching from a natural and wild look to a manicured style of landscaping. The latter is of little value to birds and other animals. There is nothing that can legally be done as the areas are upland habitat. 
 
“What bothered me most is that this year, two large wetland thicket areas were completely destroyed. I thought that there was protection for wetlands. The first is on the left of Wauwinnet Avenue (always thought that it was Watch Hill Road) as you drive into Watch Hill. It is a pond that had extensive trees and thickets. It has been clear cut to the ground all the way to the pond. There is a silt fence, but it was actually in the pond, not outside of it. The other spot is along Ocean View Highway. Wetlands were filled in to build a large house and surrounding thickets have been clear cut. This is a pretty large area that has produced numerous quality bird species in the past.” 
 
Williams’ email raises a lot of questions. I began to think about whether the clear-cutting had been done at the owners’ request or if it was a landscaper, a garden designer, or even a landscape architect who had just gone ahead and done it. The homeowners might not even have been in residence when it occurred, so they might not be aware that this was done on their properties. 
 
How many property owners share Williams’ perspective that most landscapes can and should also offer less-manicured places for wildlife and birds? Are people even aware of the importance of these thickets? You don’t have to have a big ugly pile of sticks in your front yard, but most people can find an unobtrusive spot where they can offer cover and food to birds. 
 
Perhaps some ecologically minded group could publish a pamphlet for homeowners that would explain the value of thickets and brush piles and how a manicured landscape with a large expanse of green monoculture lawn is of no value to the ecosystem. Some people will not care, but others might. 
 
Wildlife rehab courses begin 
 
The January sub-permittee wildlife rehabilitation course has already begun, but if you have an interest in working with orphaned or injured wild animals and birds, you might want to check out the February session. This course is the first step toward becoming a state-licensed rehabilitator. 
 
I took the course a few years ago and I found it fascinating, although the calculations of medications and feeding formulas were very technical, as they have to be, since the requirements of different species are so exacting. 
 
The course fee is $50. Wildlife Rehabilitators of Rhode Island has more information on its website: http://www.riwildliferehab.org/events 
 
Pileated woodpeckers 
 
I always enjoy visiting people in other areas to see which birds are coming to their feeders. While in Quebec visiting family over the holidays, I sat in my sister’s living room watching the purple finches, which I have not had at my feeders. She also gets occasional irruptions of common redpolls, which, when they descend en masse, number in the hundreds and scarf up her expensive thistle seed at an astounding rate. 
 
It was too early in the season for the northern finches, but one morning, a pair of pileated woodpeckers that sometimes stop by swooped in and fed for several minutes at the peanut feeders. These are the largest of our woodpeckers, and very impressive when seen up close. They’re also the woodpeckers that make the weird, oblong holes in trees. 
 
As always, please email me with your thoughts and observations.
