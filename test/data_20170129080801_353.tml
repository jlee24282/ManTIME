<TITLE>Sunday's letters: Electoral College's president</TITLE>
<TEXT>Electoral Colleges president 
 
To the editor: In answer to Jan. 8 letter writer Candler Willis cry to liberals, Deal with it (i.e., the presidential election), I would point out that the people of America did not choose the president-elect; the Electoral College did. A plurality of more than 2 million people of America chose otherwise.

Former presidents legacy 
 
To the editor: Here is how I view Barack Obamas legacy. 
 
Positive: 
 
1. A good husband and father. 
 
2. A very good speaker and a charismatic personality. 
 
3. Elected to be a U.S. senator from Illinois. 
 
4. Elected president of the United States twice. 
 
These are outstanding personal accomplishments. 
 
Negative: 
 
As president, he was not able to shape future events for positive outcomes. He was therefore reduced to characterizing these events in an almost delusional positive manner. The result of this was (of course) little positive change in the real world. 
 
It is regrettable that because of a flawed political belief system a person with such great talent would accomplish so little for the citizens of the U.S. and the people of the world.

Womens March in Asheville 
 
To the editor: Your Opinion page cartoon Wednesday showing an angry, screaming woman at the Womens March on Washington is a far cry from the atmosphere at Asheville Womens March. We who live in Western North Carolina can be proud of the women and men who marched on behalf of the traditional American value of equality. 
 
Those of us from Hendersonville marched with people from Murphy, Waynesville, Weaverville, Mars Hill, Asheville and other towns. Thousands of us expressed our support for equality, civility, truth, integrity, diversity, peace and more. Organic farmers marched for the environment. Grandmas and grandpas marched for womens rights. Veterans marched for affordable health care. Church groups marched for reconciliation and openness. 
 
There was no screaming, no cursing, no violence. 
 
Handmade picket signs expressed the gracious, generous spirit of the Asheville march. I copied only a few: 
 
The rise of women does not mean the fall of men. 
 
Sexism is a social disease. 
 
Saying no to hate makes America great. 
 
My body my choice. 
 
Compassion in action. 
 
We ended the march by singing America together as raindrops fell. 
 
While the Times-News published an angry cartoon, it completely missed the spirit of the march I took part in, which was filled with love and truth and the American way.

Not buying GOPs claims 
 
To the editor: With this new incoming administration, I am worried about two phases of the medical insurance issue. From calls I made to their offices, I learned that both of North Carolinas Republican senators voted for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act (also known as Obamacare). The problem is, the GOP has never had a plan to replace it despite trying to repeal it for seven years. 
 
I am also concerned about their so-called plans for the future of Medicare. Im a lifelong Democrat and I believed President Lyndon Johnson when he created Medicare in 1965 and said it would look after me and my medical needs in my old age. It worked for my grandparents and my parents. Why not for me, too? 
 
Now, congressional Republicans want to privatize the system. They want to give me a voucher and make me shop the private market  with very little protection. They promise me this will be better. 
 
Sorry, this old guy isnt buying it. Ill be at the mercy of the insurance companies, and I cant use their promises of something better to pay my medical bills.

Obamacare repeal process 
 
To the editor: Dont allow any member of Congress to tell you Obamacare cannot be repealed completely because reconciliation must strictly deal with the budget. These claims are false! 
 
All of Obamacare, including the insurance regulation provisions, has a budgetary impact. Obamacare insurance regulations are the main reason why premiums continue to rise and require taxpayer-funded subsidies. 
 
A precedent already exists for a one-provision reconciliation bill that fully repeals a piece of legislation. 
 
If a senator raises a Byrd Rule point of order against a provision repealing the insurance regulations due to budgetary concerns, the Senate parliamentarians word is not final. It is ultimately up to the presiding officer, and ultimately, the Senate as a whole. The parliamentarian is an employee of the Senate with the job of providing advice to the presiding officer on historical precedents, and the Senate then overrides this obstacle with a simple majority vote. 
 
After Obamacare is completely repealed, Congress can then pass a second budget for fiscal year 2018 that lowers spending levels and achieves other conservative priorities like consumer choice, strengthens the doctor-patient relationship, lowers costs and provides ample time to transition back to the individual market without losing coverage. No more excuses!
