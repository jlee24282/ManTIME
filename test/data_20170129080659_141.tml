THE leadership crisis in the Ondo State House of Assembly deepened  as warring factions, yesterday, laid  claim to the speakership. 
 
Those in the majority (16members), led by suspended Speaker Jumoke Akindele, alleged that the plot  to cause crisis was “hatched, nurtured, and executed by the All Progressives  Congress, APC, in the state.” 
  
They condemned the shenanigans of the minority members at “an unauthorized sitting at which the leadership   of the House was purportedly suspended”. 
 
The other faction, who are ten in number and  led by newly appointed Speaker Coker Malachi,  insisted that there was no going back in the sack of the leadership of the assembly. Both factions addressed  journalists,  yesterday, sticking to their guns.</TEXT>
