<TITLE>Editorial: No pretend cops on COCC campus</TITLE>
<TEXT>The public safety officers at Central Oregon Community College should stop pretending to be cops. Its altogether unclear they have any such authority. 
 
Deschutes County District Attorney John Hummel says COCCs officers do not possess lawful police powers . From his analysis of Oregon law, the officers can enforce campus traffic regulations, but thats about it. Hummel has told the college that he would initiate criminal charges against it if the officers continue to act without lawful authority. 
 
COCC has presented no legal analysis to the public to prove Hummel wrong. 
 
We pointed out in an editorial in August that COCC public safety officers should not be using blue lights on their vehicles. Under Oregon law, blue lights are supposed to mean only one thing: the police. 
 
But the concerns with COCCs public safety operations go back further than that. In 2015, Hummel and Bend Police Chief Jim Porter began asking questions. That was after a botched COCC investigation into an iPhone that was apparently set up to record in a womens restroom on campus. Then in July, Kaylee Sawyer was allegedly kidnapped and killed by Edwin Lara, who was at the time a COCC public safety officer. 
 
COCC President Shirley Metcalf announced several changes in a message to the campus this week. For now, the campus public safety officers are not going to make any arrests. The blue lights in their vehicles have been disabled. The bars to create barriers between the front and back seats in the public safety vehicles have been removed. Other practices, including the look of the officers uniforms, will be evaluated. 
 
Those are good steps, though its worth asking why it took so long for COCC to change its practices. 
 
There can be disagreements about interpreting the law. And COCCs leadership wants to ensure it has a safe campus. But it was clearly more than just possible that COCC was allowing its officers to act without lawful authority. The campus leadership should have put a stop to it immediately until the issue could be sorted out. That is not what happened.</TEXT>
