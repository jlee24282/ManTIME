<TEXT type="str">TACOMA - A mysterious ailment that has killed or paralyzed gulls around the Port of Tacoma this week is baffling wildlife biologists. 
 
About 50 gulls have been found dead or paralyzed from the neck down. 
 
&quot;We have never seen a situation like that,&quot; said state Department of Fish and Wildlife biologist Michelle Tirhi. &quot;It was a mystery to our biologists and veterinarians.&quot; 
 
Ill birds have been found in a seated position with only their heads moving. 
 
&quot;One could walk up to them and pick them up,&quot; Tirhi said. &quot;They can&apos;t fly, they can&apos;t walk, they can&apos;t move.&quot; 
 
Port workers began finding dead and sick gulls Sunday night. 
 
&quot;By the time they got to work on the 23rd they were finding more dead and sick birds,&quot; Tirhi said. &quot;Ground zero for this mortality event was Port of Tacoma.&quot; 
 
Ill birds were found at three shipping terminals and other points around Commencement Bay, including Ruston Way, Browns Point, Point Defiance Park and as far north as Kent and Redondo Beach, according to Tirhi. 
 
The mass die-off is affecting only glaucous gulls - the common gull. 
 
&quot;This is the thing that&apos;s odd to us, they&apos;re only gulls,&quot; Wildlife spokeswoman Madonna Luers said of the fatalities. 
 
Though other species, including crows and ducks, wing around the port, there have been no reports of other species being affected. That could mean the gulls ate something that is causing the illness, Tirhi said. 
 
&quot;Perhaps no other species was attracted to it,&quot; Tirhi said. 
 
What that might have been is unknown. 
 
Port of Tacoma spokeswoman Tara Mattina said there have been no recent contaminations. 
 
&quot;I can confirm that there was no spill of any sort,&quot; she said. 
 
Tirhi said the sick and ill birds were clean. 
 
&quot;They have no odor or anything discernible on their body,&quot; she said. 
 
Toxicology testing has ruled out lead poisoning and other heavy metals.</TEXT>
