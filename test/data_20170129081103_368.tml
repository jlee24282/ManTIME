<content type="str">​ State Government Co-operative Loans Scheme assists new infrastructure projects for Geraldton-based western rock lobster processor and exporter  
The Geraldton Fishermen&apos;s Co-operative Ltd has secured a $3.5 million loan through the State Government&apos;s Co-operative Loan Scheme to build an 80-tonne live lobster holding facility at Welshpool to facilitate increased exports to China. 
 
Agriculture and Food Minister Mark Lewis said that as Western Australia&apos;s biggest rock lobster processor, the Liberal National Government recognised the importance of the Geraldton Co-operative to the economy of both the Mid-West and the State. 
 
&quot;This scheme has enabled this Geraldton-based processor and exporter to build vital infrastructure to further grow premium western rock lobster exports,&quot; Mr Lewis said. 
 
&quot;The facility being built by the co-operative in Welshpool will be Australia&apos;s biggest rock lobster tank holding facility, and will facilitate air freight of fresh rock lobster into China to reduce the time from &apos;catch to plate&apos;. 
 
&quot;A new warehouse with lobster holding tanks has also been established in the Guangdong Province in China to assist with this growing market.&quot; 
 
The Minister said producer-based co-operatives made an important contribution to the economic development of regional communities and the State. 
 
&quot;The scheme facilitates the growth and development of established co-operatives through the purchase of assets or capital items,&quot; he said. 
 
&quot;A co-operative loan gives businesses, such as the Geraldton Fishermen&apos;s Co-operative, the ability to adapt to current global market requirements.&quot; 
 
Loans through the scheme allow co-operatives to claim a tax deduction on the principal repayments of the loan together with the usual taxation deductions of interest and fees under the Income Tax Assessment Act. 
 
&quot;The Co-operative Loan Scheme has approved a range of loans to eligible Western Australian co-operatives totalling $75.8 million since its establishment in 2004,&quot; Mr Lewis said. 
 
&quot;Sweeter Banana Co-operative and the WA Meat Marketing Co-operative are also currently accessing loans through this scheme.&quot; 
 
Western rock lobster is a sought-after ecologically sustainable product, with exports from WA worth $443 million in 2014-15.
