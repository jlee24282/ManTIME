<TEXT type="str">A teenage girl who sheds her skin every two months because of an ultra-rare condition has been cruelly likened to a &apos;human snake&apos; Shalini Yadav 16 needs to constantly smear her body with moisturizer to stop it from hardening and seizing upThe youngster&apos;s family are so poor they cannot afford that and need to spend their money on providing food for eight people including her grandparents According to Daily Mirror  the Indian teenager had been thrown out of school because of her extraordinary appearance 

Doctors have diagnosed Erythroderma an inflammatory skin disease also known as &apos;red man syndrome&apos; but are unable to treat it 

It causes the skin over almost the entire body to become scaly and flake off 

Shalini has shed her skin every 45 days since she was born 

She has to soak her body in water every hour -- night and day -- and smear himself with lotion every three hours to prevent drying out 

Her desperate mother Devkunwar said 

&quot;Shalini is suffering from the disease since childhoodWe saw several doctors but none of them could cure her and her condition has continued to get worseI feel so helpless when I see her skin coming off causing excruciating pain to my child This disease is not killing her but taking her life bit by bit&quot;We have no idea where to go to and who to consult&quot;It is better to die than living a life of misery&quot; Shalini said &quot;I wanted to study but they threw me out of school as the children would get scared by seeing my face</TEXT>
