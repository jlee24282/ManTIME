<content type="str">WHILE everyone is engrossed with the Miss Universe festivities in Manila, a set of beauty queens were also taking Palawan by storm. 
 
Led by Miss Universe 2015 second runner-up Olivia Jordan, the group of former Miss Universe entrants sizzled in their red bikini while exploring the island of El Nido. 
 
Jordan was joined by Miss Universe 2014 first runner-up Nia Sanchez and local beauties, Miss International 2013 Bea Rose Santiago and Miss Universe Philippines 2014 Mary Jean Lastimosa. 
     
Miss Universe Ukraine 2014 Diana Garkusha, Miss Universe Great Britain 2014 Grace Levy and Miss Costa Rica 2014 Kary Ramos also made it in Palawan. 
   
Jordan and Sanchez are in the Philippines for the 65th Miss Universe competition happening on January 30 at the Mall of Asia Arena. 
 
PLDT Home and Smart Communications flew Jordan and Sanchez to the Philippines to lead its social media coverage of the much-anticipated pageant. (SunStar Philippines)</content>
