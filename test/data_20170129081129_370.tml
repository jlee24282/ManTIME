Brisbane Roar made a move but other finals contenders lost ground on runaway A-League leaders Sydney FC in round 17. 

The Roar jumped to third spot with Brett Holman scoring a precious late winner against Western Sydney on Saturday night. 

The 2-1 win allowed Brisbane to climb above Melbourne City, who were stunned by Newcastle 2-1 on Friday night and slip to fourth place on the ladder. 

Sixth-placed Perth Glory also blew a golden opportunity to entrench themselves in the top six when Central Coast downed them 2-0 on Saturday night. 

And Wellington Phoenix were unable to make in-roads with an away 2-2 draw with Adelaide United on Sunday afternoon - had they won, they would have been fifth but find themselves eighth. 

Sydney&apos;s 2-1 away win against Melbourne on Thursday night increased their view from the top, now 11 points clear of Victory (32 points), who next meet home-town rivals Melbourne City in a pivotal derby on Saturday night. 

The Sky Blues are still undefeated in their astonishing season - 13 wins, four draws, having conceded just eight goals. 

John Aloisi&apos;s Brisbane are five points adrift of Victory after former Socceroo Holman&apos;s triumphant return from a knee injury which had sidelined him since November. 

Perth (21 points) and Newcastle (20) completed the top six. 

Brisbane&apos;s Holman scored his club&apos;s winner in the third minute of injury time in a result coach Aloisi says answers critics of his team, who meet Sydney on Friday night. 

&quot;A lot of people question this group - I don&apos;t know why,&quot; Aloisi said. 

&quot;They never give up. They keep going. We spoke about it before the game - winners find a way to win.&quot; 

The result left Western Sydney in eighth spot, but still only two points outside the top six. 

&quot;To think we&apos;re going home with nothing is hard to believe. I thought we were good for at least a point, if not three,&quot; Wanderers coach Tony Popovic said. 

Perth coach Kenny Lowe was another manager scratching his head after Saturday&apos;s 2-0 loss to Central Coast. 

Lowe blamed concentration lapses for the end of his side&apos;s five-game unbeaten stretch. 

&quot;We handed them two gifts,&quot; Lowe said. 

&quot;At the moment we&apos;re giving people chances to capitalise. They&apos;re not playing through us or hurting us, we&apos;re actually giving them goals ... it&apos;s not acceptable. 

&quot;The disappointing thing is that we&apos;re consistently inconsistent.&quot; 

Glory gloveman Liam Reddy is also set to be suspended for next week&apos;s home clash against Newcastle after copping a late red card for fouling Trent Buhagiar.</content>
