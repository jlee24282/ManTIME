David Stephens, Chairman at Battens Solicitors explained: &quot;The Lexcel accreditation is the legal world&apos;s stamp of quality. Gaining it for a tenth year running is a fine achievement and one of which we are very proud because it not only recognises that good practice is reflected throughout our firm, but that we provide excellent levels of care and professionalism in our services to our clients.

&quot;I want to thank Battens Solicitors Limited for their commitment to continuous improvement through Lexcel and congratulate them on maintaining accreditation.&quot;
