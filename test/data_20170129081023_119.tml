<content type="str">PALO — Geraldine Parvinen was in the eighth grade when she first met young John Kangas on the sliding hill at the Laskiainen. It was a relationship that would lead to a long and lasting marriage — and a dedication to the Finnish sliding festival in Palo now in its 80th year. 
   
John Kangas died in 2009, but Gerry Kangas has carried on the tradition of the festival to be celebrated Feb. 3, 4 and 5 on the shore of Loon Lake, rural Aurora. And she will again be in charge at the museum — wearing the rhinestone snowflake pin given to her when she attended the St. Paul Winter Carnival as a guest of honor in 1954 as the reigning Miss Laskiainen. She appeared with numerous queens from throughout the country, she said, showing a scrapbook she has kept all these years. 
   
&quot;It&apos;s been fun. I&apos;ve been looking for artifacts most of my life,&quot; she said in an interview. She and her late husband operated Salmi Homes for the elderly for several years — she was just 18, and learned a storehouse of history from the Finnish immigrants who had settled in the area. &quot;That&apos;s where I learned about Laskiainen. I was president of the Palo-Markham Teen Club (with teacher Virginia Thompson in charge). The fund-raiser for the club was the Laskiainen dance.&quot; And then she was a Laskiainen Princess of the Snows in 1951 and queen in 1953. &quot;I have been involved with Laskiainen from 1951 to 2009 with my husband John. I keep up the Loon Lake Museum for more years than I can remember,&quot; she said. 
   
When she was involved with the Iron Range Historical Society as treasurer, she met Dr. Thomas Vennum, who was with the Smithsonian in Washington D.C., and he became interested in learning about Laskiainen. The result was that Laskiainen was featured in the nation&apos;s capital in 1980 — including a replica of the famous Laskiainen vippu kelkka, or whip sled, set on a plywood track at the base of the Washington Monument to give rides to 2,000 school children. &quot;What an honor!&quot; Kangas said. 
   
She said that &quot;studies have concluded that our festival has survived because while holding on to our Finnish folk ways, we move on with the times.&quot; 
   
She gives a great deal of credit to the involvement of Carol Skinner and Vivian Williams. &quot;Our committee also consists of young people who do a fabulous job. They have definitely risen the bar. Our slides have had such a dedicated crew even in the coldest weather. The queen coronation continues to draw very special young women,&quot; she said. 
   
&quot;I am amazed and thrilled to be part of this very old tradition brought here by the immigrant pioneers&quot; from Finland, which observes its centennial this year. 
   
Kangas enjoys the work in the museum. She likes to tell stories, such as about the history of the sugar lump popular with Finnish people — and how it had medicinal purposes that could cure sores. &quot;You get this passion (for Laskiainen) and then you have to pass it on,&quot; Kangas said. &quot;You give the young people a little taste of the tradition and they run with it.&quot;</content>
