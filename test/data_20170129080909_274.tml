Video posted to Twitter by ABC7NY reporter CeFaan Kim shows a sea of protesters at JFK with a message projected high above them in blue letters that read, “F*** YOUR WALL”. The protesters were chanting over and over, “F*** your wall! We’ll tear it down!”, in protest of Trump’s commitment to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.

Independent reporter Tim Pool posted to Twitter that he was threatened several times by protesters at JFK who demanded of him, “agree with us or leave.” 
  
So while I have been at the JFK protest I have been threatened with violence three times and told &quot;agree with us or leave.&quot;

Pool noted the difference in his treatment between Trump supporters and Trump protesters. 
  
Why is it that Trump supporters say &quot;we don&apos;t agree and that&apos;s OK&quot; and the Trump protesters say &quot;I&apos;m going to break your phone&quot;
