EXETER — No one likes shoveling snow, but most of us New Englanders must to do it occasionally, even if it’s just to get to work. 
 
What many may not consider is that shoveling snow is a strenuous form of exercise, and puts someone who is out of shape at risk for injury or, in severe cases, a potentially deadly heart attack. 
 
Dr. Gregory Goodkin, a cardiologist at Exeter Hospital, said heart attacks relative to shoveling are fairly common, and often avoidable. 
 
“It’s pretty simple,” Goodkin said. “The reason this occurs is not strictly shoveling, but is the rapid onset of heavy exertion. It could be digging a hole, same principle. Unfortunately, most people do not exercise regularly. Suddenly they go outside to move what could be hundreds of pounds of snow. It’s like going to the gym for the first time and going wild.” 
 
Dr. Jeffrey Kuvin, a cardiologist at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, said people tend to be less active in the winter months than they do in the warm weather, so even a person who is usually in good shape may be less so this time of year. 
 
Another factor working against people who are out of shape is the cold. 
 
“Snow is wet and heavy, and we are going from a warm, cuddly house, outside to tackle the snow piles,” Kuvin said. “We feel obligated to take on this strenuous behavior, which taxes our muscles and our heart.” 
 
Kuvin said there is some evidence that the blood thins in the cold, increasing blood clotting factors. 
 
“When you go from a warm house to outside in the cold, blood vessels constrict. Clotting factors work harder and a blood clot is more likely. Blood pressure and heart rate increases with the activity. It is a perfect setup for a heart attack so not a big surprise when it happens.” 
 
For many who are stricken, there may be an underlying heart condition that the person is not aware of, said Goodkin. 
 
“Sometimes, the symptoms are misread,” said Kuvin. “People attribute the chest and muscle pain, the sweating, dizziness and nausea to the stress of the activity. Be very aware of the symptoms and what they could mean.” 
 
“I tell my patients to not underestimate the power of snow,” Goodkin said. “I tell them to treat it like the gym and warm-up first with some stretches or light exercise indoors. When they shovel, take light loads and rest breaks as needed. Make sure to stay hydrated.” 
 
A heart attack is not the only risk when shoveling snow. Dr. Richard Feeney of Core Physiatry in Exeter said shoveling snow is a great way to injure the back. 
 
“We see a lot of people in pain in our practice,” Feeney said. “Shoveling snow is a common cause of back pain related to the spine. We see a lot of lumbar disc herniation, injury to the soft tissue between vertebrae.” 
 
Feeney said shoveling is the perfect storm for spinal injuries. 
 
“Leaning forward is a flexor stressor,” Feeney said. “Then there is a lot of rotation involved. There is increased pressure to the intervertebral discs. This can happen as a natural part of aging, too, but shoveling is a good contributor. People who may not be in the best shape are suddenly going from zero to 60.” 
 
Kuvin said people should consider whether they are physically fit enough to shovel snow, or if they should consider getting help from others. 
 
“If you take it on by yourself, know your limitations,” Kuvin said. “Warm up and acclimate yourself to the cold. Most important is to know when you have reached your limit and stop. We see a lot of patients who decided to shovel or snow blow their driveway, and had a heart attack.” 
 
Feeney said if a person does take part in a core stabilization program, he or she strengthens the core and is better able to tolerate shoveling. 
 
“If not, a better idea might be to delegate,” Feeney said. “I ask my patients – would you rather pay a neighborhood kid $10 or hire a plow person, or risk the injury?”</content>
