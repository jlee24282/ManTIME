<TITLE>5 Technologies That Have Modernized Firefighting</TITLE>
<TEXT>From pouring buckets of water to using tech savvy gadgets,firefighting has come a long way! 

Civil engineers and firefighters are working in collaboration to make todays structures as fireproof and safe as possible. The technique to design materials, such that they are as less flammable as possible, is a conventional one. Unless we makethese methods foolproof, there will always be a danger of fire. Thus, improving firefighting techniques is an utmost priority, and today, we will cover the five most incredible advancements in modern-day firefighting! 

1)Swedens futuristic firefighting helmet

Critical information like the temperature, remaining Oxygen and Carbon dioxide levels, brightness index, etc. are displayed on the helmets screen. This display helps the firefighter to make informed choices and take measured risks. A thermal imaging camera is also installed as an aid to visibility in case of thick smoke.

2)Fire shelters made from space-age materials 

The concept was first discovered in 2013, after a tragic fire on Yarnell Hill in Arizona, at NASAs Langley Research Center. Since then, researchers have collaborated with theU.S. Forest Service to integrate their space-age technology to improve the odds of the heroic firefighters. 

NASA engineers have created shelters of the thickness of amillimeter, with the lightest prototype weighing almost4.3 pounds (1.95 kg). Itcan be rolled upinto the size of a half-gallon milk container, making it extremely handy. The amazing fire shelter is due to launch in 2018. 

3) Fire extinguishing grenades

These bottles were thrown into the blaze in a bid toextinguish it. Today, more complex compounds, like carbon tetrachloride, have replaced water in these grenades. Although some of these chemicals have their associated disadvantages, yet, no one can deny their importance in firefighting. 

4) Firefighter on Jetpacks 

ATunisian company has created a new turbine design that uses rotating fan blades and produces up to 1 kW of electricity in a product, called the Biometric Wind Converter.The plan entails carbon fiber wings flapping in a figure-8 motion, which gives the turbine a capability to move both up and down. 

The idea was adopted by Dubai Civil Defenceand is now, integrated into its Dolphin systemwhere their firefighters use jetpacks water pressure to move thevantage points in emergency situations. The system also comes with a thermal camera that helps in search and rescue missions, and is indeed, the most impressive addition to the high-tech armory of the firefighters! 

5)Sonic fire extinguishers 

This state of the art apparatus is known as wave extinguisher and uses acoustic waves to suppress flames instead of using any liquid or chemical. The extinguisher uses sound to extinguish the fire, which makes it ideal for usage. In summary, the vibrations of the sound separate the air from the fuel, which stops the oxidation process and kills the blaze.
