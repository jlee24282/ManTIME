Bowtell, Kevin Bennett, and Felicity Urquhart took out the golden guitar categories of duo or group of the year and alternative country album of the year with their their self titled album. 

Travis Collins won three golden guitars – male artist of the year, song of the year and single of the year. 

Lyn Bowtell also picked up a golden guitar for her vocal collaboration on FU Cancer with Catherine Britt, Kasey Chambers, Josh Pyke, Wendy Matthews and Wes Carr. Bowtell also co wrote the song. 

Bennett, Bowtell and Urquhart first came together two years ago in Tamworth. 

The union was prompted by a phone call from Bowtell. Working with Bennett and Urquhart was on Bowtell’s bucket list. Once the decision was made to record, their busy individual schedules only allowed two days to write and two days to record the album. 

This year’s wins brings Bowtell’s collection of golden guitars to six.

Thanks to the additional golden guitar that Bowtell picked up on Saturday night for the vocal collaboration bringing her total for the night to three. 

This ties her with friend and Newcastle native Travis Collins for the most awards won on the evening. 

Lyn Bowtell and Southern Steel will play at Lizottes, Newcastle on February 17.</content>
