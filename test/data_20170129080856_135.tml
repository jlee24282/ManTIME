<content type="str">She says her street is particularly bad for dog muck with people leaving it as they walk their pets down the street towards the river.

It comes after another estate in Sleaford was plagued with huge amounts of excrement. READ MORE: Jude Dalkins, 52, who lives in New Street, Sleaford, said she regularly washes the front of her property and has even tried using pepper to deter the animals.

She said: &quot;Because I don&apos;t have a front wall I can constantly see people stopping and allowing their dogs to poo right on the gravel. We didn&apos;t have it when we first moved here, we put gravel down thinking it would stop them and it didn&apos;t.

&quot;The amount of times I have shooed people away and said &apos;it&apos;s my garden would you like it if I did that to you&apos; and still they do it.

&quot;It&apos;s absolutely disgusting, they do it on the pavement too. I think there should be some patrol - they do it along the riverbank too and it&apos;s a busy area for people going to school, using the car park and going into town.&quot;

Ms Dalkins said she would also like to see more dog bins in the area.

She said: &quot;It happens at least three to four times per week - you hope for rain in the summer so you can get rid of the smell.

&quot;If dogs use the area then other dogs will re-scent the area so they keep doing it. Even if you go out there with soapy water another dog will re-scent it.&quot;

She added the problem is fairly bad between a picnic area and the dog bin near the National Centre for Craft and Design.

Another person who felt the problem down the street was particularly bad was Gias Uddin.

The 42-year-old said: &quot;They leave it on the pavement and sometimes the children step in it. You always have to ask them to &apos;watch it&apos; and then it&apos;s in the house and it&apos;s horrible.

&quot;If you own a dog then you have to keep it clean and look after it.&quot;

Kelly Tarren also lives down the street. She agreed that it is a problem if children step in it.

The 32-year-old said: &quot;You don&apos;t want it in your house. Luckily we have a laminate floor.

&quot;People clean it up but there is still residue.

&quot;I think there is just one bin over the river so we could do with one or two more.&quot;

This comes after residents complained of dog poo problems on an estate of Grantham Road.

Faeces were being left on the pavement and some were put in a bag and hanged from a branch just metres from a bin.</content>
