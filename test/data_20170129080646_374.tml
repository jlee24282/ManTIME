The match was a fight from start to finish and was tied up at 1-1, 2-2 and 3-3.

Shortly after, sophomore  Amanda Rebol downed her opponent in  #6 singles, earning a 6-4, 6-3 win over Arkansas&apos; Cepelyte to take back the lead, 2-1. NC State&apos;s Rogers fell to Arkansas&apos; Jurasic, 2-6, 6-7(7) to tie the match back up at 2-2.  
  
From there, Arkansas took its only lead of the night after Jeanjean defeated the Wolfpack&apos;s Adriana Reami in a three-setter, 6-4, 2-6, 2-6.  
  
No. 36 Frantova took #1 singles, beating Arkansas&apos; Oparenovic, 6-2, 6-7 (6), 7-5, to tie the match up once again, 3-3. 
  
Wiktorin found the deciding point in a three-set battle against Arkansas&apos; Hudson. Both the first and second set were sent into a tiebreaker, but Wiktorin ultimately prevailed in the third set to win the match, 6-7 (6), 7-6 (2), 6-4.

Simon Says 
&quot;Well another season and straight into another dramatic match right from the get go! I think both teams played hard and did what they could. The conditions were extremely changeable, we started in relatively good conditions and the end was played in quite cool blustery winds. It&apos;s early in the season and our best tennis is still ahead of us. We managed to come through some really tight moments on a couple of courts and that got us through. I&apos;d like to say the doubles point was the difference and that&apos;s very important for us but ultimately Martina and Claudia pulled this one out when we had our backs to the wall. It&apos;s funny because Martina had 3 matches points in the 2nd set reminiscent of her 1st match this past Fall, however she hung in there, played very tough points on both of Oparenovic&apos;s match points. Happy for her as a senior to see her get that match and give Claudia the opportunity to play a deciding point. Claudia&apos;s made a ton of progress since last year and I&apos;ve got a lot of faith in her and what&apos;s she capable of. She was close to making a break-through this Fall on a couple of occasions and this was the perfect moment for it to happen. Proud of our effort all round today and looking forward to tomorrows match with Pepperdine. Go Pack!!!&quot;
