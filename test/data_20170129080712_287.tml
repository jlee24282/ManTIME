<content type="str">Chevron Corp. posted its first annual loss since at least 1980 as the world&apos;s biggest oil companies struggle to emerge from the worst collapse in a generation. Investors punished the stock, wiping out about $5 billion in market value. 
 
The company had a $497 million loss last year and failed to replace all of the crude and natural gas it pumped with new reserves, the San Ramon company said Friday. 
 
Fourth-quarter net income of $415 million ( 22 cents per share) was lower than analysts had expected. 
 
Shares fell $2.76 , or 2.4 percent, the most in four months, to close at $113.79 . 
 
Chevron announced plans last month to curtail spending on drilling and other projects for a fourth straight year. 
 
Despite the belt-tightening, Chevron is on pace to spend about $2 billion on shareholder dividends each quarter. That equates to about $1 million an hour. Exxon Mobil is set to disburse about $3.1 billion per quarter in payouts.
