<TITLE>Tabloids: A wonderful Harry surprise, plus Julias cameraman cuts and runs</TITLE>
<TEXT>Pre-marriage! Post-marriage! And feuding, now possible without marriage!   
OK! 
 
Cover: The answer to your question is three : the article on Prince Harry and Suits star Meghan Markle mentions Toronto three times. The Spare to the Throne proposed to her on their six-month anniversary; I found a Pinterest page full of six-month-anniversary gift ideas and they run along the lines of a box of doughnuts, but I suppose a bunch of mouldy old castles will do. 
 
Stone tired: A photo feature on Emma Stone reveals shes had those adorable bags under her eyes since roughly age 7; lifelong sleep deprivation can pay off. Stage Mom must be thrilled. 
 
Masked terrors: Raccoons eat the koi in his pond, and Jason Statham cant deal with the rogues because hes terrified of them. If you ever wondered why he never made a movie here . . .

Cover: Cameraman Danny Wassisname has fled from Julia Roberts, his wife of 14 years (3 Hollywood lifetimes). Now ol Pelican Briefs is in a battle for her three kids allegiances; she woos them with vegan food and strict rules, and hes over in the guest house, with the skate park and BMX bikes. Which will they choose? 
 
Dirty Weeknd: In Touch details the Justin Bieber-Selena Gomez-Weeknd drama, involving all sorts of attractive young people (and Scott Disick). It mentions the Weeknds lyrics from Starboy  Like Selena, ass shaped like Selena  without critiquing his grammar (does she really have an ass shaped like the entirety of Selena Gomez, Mr. Tesfaye?) Also, it isnt noted that both gents are Canadian, so lets get upset about that in our characteristically small-minded way. 
 
Breeding ground: Ellen DeGeneres has decided, at age 59, to give Portia de Rossi a child, one way or the other. Ellen was wary for years but now she can see that by the time the kids an teenager, shell probably be dead. 
   
STAR 
 
Cover: There is, Star asserts, a bitter battle going on between Tom Cruise, leading Scientologist and global star, and Leah Remini, ex-Scientologist and star of . . . a documentary series on A&E. If this were in a boxing ring, they would have stopped it. 
 
No rest: Emma Stone flirts with the only young star with BIGGER lines under the eyes: Mr. Robots Rami Malek. We wouldnt let two hemophiliacs fall in love  somebody call the authorities or therell be a kid who looks exhausted since birth.
