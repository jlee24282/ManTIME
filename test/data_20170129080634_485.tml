<TEXT type="str">(0) Darren Way conceded that his Yeovil Town side were beaten by the better side as Doncaster Rovers cruised to a 3-0 win at Huish Park this afternoon.

The table topping visitors eased to victory as Mathieu Baudry put them in front before John Marquis scored a brace to cap off a clinical performance by the visitors.

Way said: &quot;On another day, certainly in the first half with one or two chances that we could&apos;ve taken, we could&apos;ve been looking at a different story, but overall we were beaten by the better team.

&quot;As a manager I&apos;m going to show the players support and make sure they learn from that experience. &quot;Unfortunately today we came up against a better team which have got a lot of quality. They&apos;ve got three forwards that are going to score goals and they&apos;ve spent large parts of their career scoring goals. Could we afford them? No, probably not, so I look forward to Tuesday [against Plymouth Argyle].&quot; The Glovers players were booed off both at half-time and full-time after a game that looked beyond them from the moment that Baudry opened the scoring.

Way added: &quot;I&apos;ve got to be honest, they want to see their team win and they want to see individuals making the right decisions at the right time and I have to accept that as a manager.

&quot;That&apos;s why I&apos;ve given the role and responsibility to manage the football club, but realistically I have to make sure I can sleep straight at night knowing what I&apos;m working with and where we are as a football club. That was a big test today.&quot;

Way remained coy when quizzed on whether he will be bolstering his squad before the transfer market shuts on Tuesday.

He said: &quot;We are working in that area and we&apos;ll have to wait and see what develops.&quot;</TEXT>
