      President Donald Trump isn&apos;t the only member of the First Family who&apos;s a little bit behind on hiring staff . 
According to CNN , First Lady Melania Trump has yet to announce her White House team, in part because she hasn&apos;t filled most of her top staff positions yet. Despite the fact that Trump will be staying with her son, Barron, in New York City until he completes his school year, the First Lady will still be commuting back and forth to D.C. in the coming weeks in order to fulfill her duties as FLOTUS - and part of that will include interviewing candidates.

CNN goes on to note that Trump is so far missing several top staff positions, including a press secretary, social secretary, director of communications, and chief of staff. That being said, don&apos;t expect to see any of these jobs on LinkedIn or even the White House website anytime soon. 
 
As New York Magazine reports, Trump has reportedly tapped former Vogue staffer Stephanie Winston Wolkoff as her chief strategist, who will help her begin the interview process for other key roles in her White House team soon. Given that Winston Wolkoff used to be in charge of planning the Met Gala and its guest list for a few years, one can only imagine the &quot;guest list&quot; to interview with the First Lady will be very exclusive, and likely not open to just anyone interested in applying.
