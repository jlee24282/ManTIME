<content type="str">Officials from Carnegie-Stout Public Library and the Dubuque County Library system are conducting a joint survey to find ways to improve service. 
 
The survey comes as officials from the two libraries have discussed some sort of partnership to bolster service on Dubuque’s West End. 
 
On the table is a program that would allow cardholders at either the county or city system to request Carnegie-Stout materials and pick them up at the county library branch in Asbury. 
 
The program also would lift the rule preventing county library cardholders from placing holds on items at the City of Dubuque library. 
 
Carnegie-Stout library Director Susan Henricks said the program would give residents in the western part of the city easier access to the library’s materials. It would have the same effect for residents who live outside Dubuque. 
 
“We talked. We said if we can collaborate, obviously that’s in the best interest of the taxpayer,” Henricks said. “We have a need for west side service and (a partnership) would be ideal. The next step is to determine the feasibility. Can this be done?” 
 
Rather than base cost projections on past usage, members of both library boards decided to conduct a survey to get a better picture. 
 
About 61,000 items annually are checked out from Carnegie-Stout by non-Dubuque residents, according to a report compiled by Henricks. About 21,000 items are checked out each year by Dubuque residents at the county library branch in Asbury. 
 
Henricks had estimated about 41,000 items a year would be checked out under such a partnership. But she felt that number could be high. 
 
Officials from both library systems are working to determine the cost of running the program. 
 
“We just don’t have a crystal ball,” Henricks said. “We need to ask people, ‘Will you use it? And how often do you think you’ll use it?’ From that we can get a more realistic idea of what our costs will be, and that will determine the level of participation in the partnership that we’re going to have.” 
 
Dubuque County Library Director Michael Wright said the partnership would offer Dubuque County residents a wider selection of library materials. 
 
“Carnegie-Stout has a much larger collection than we do, overall,” Wright said. “Even though we may have multiple copies of a title, they may be out. Or if it’s a unique title, we might not have it while Carnegie-Stout may. It definitely offers our patrons access to a much larger collection. It offers advantages to both parties.” 
 
The five-question survey is available online through each library’s website. Paper surveys also will be available at the county library, which also has branches in Epworth, Farley, Holy Cross and Peosta, and at Carnegie-Stout. 
 
The survey is available through Feb. 28. 
 
Henricks expects to have results ready for review by early March. 
 
“Our boards should be able to discuss this at their (March) meetings and then determine next steps,” she said.</content>
