Kim and Kourtney Kardashian proudly flaunted their abs in tiny crop tops while heading to dinner during their family vacation in Costa Rica on Saturday night. 
 
Kourtney paired a black-and-pink bra top with high-waisted pants for the evening outing, while Kim put her cleavage on display in a sexy black-and-white look. 
 
Their mom, Kris Jenner, and her boyfriend, Corey Gamble weren&apos;t far behind as the whole family got together for their first night of the tropical trip. 
 
Kourtney, 37, and Kim, 36, have clearly been putting in some major time at the gym, though it was their younger sister, Khloe Kardashian, who spearheaded a morning workout on Saturday. </content>
