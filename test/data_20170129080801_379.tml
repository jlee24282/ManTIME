<TEXT type="str">NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian dumps senior MP&apos;s including Minister for Education Adrian Piccoli in cabinet reshuffle. 

MEMBER for Murray Adrian Piccoli has been dumped as Minister for Education under Premier Gladys Berejiklian&apos;s cabinet reshuffle was on Sunday, but remains confident his Griffith schools plan will go ahead.

Mr Piccoli said he is confident his replacement will continue to, “bridge the education divide between students in regional schools and their city counterparts”, including proposed options to improve Griffith&apos;s high schools.

&quot;The new minister is a great guy and I think he will continue with most of the things we have been doing with education, which I am very happy about,&quot; Mr Piccoli said.

&quot;The merger proposal continues on, it is not subject to me being Minister of Education or not, there are still two options there.

The two options are either $10 million to be split between Griffith High and Wade High or $45 million to build a new super school.

“There is still more work to be done over the next few months before a final decision is made, but these two options are part of government policy, they are not my policy.”

While Mr Piccoli said one of the two proposed school options will go ahead, Director of Public Schools NSW Griffith Network David Lamb was unable to confirm the status of the proposals on Sunday.

Mr Lamb said he will be in Sydney throughout the week for meetings to determine the fate of Griffith’s high schools and looks forward to the new minister announcing his plans.

Mayor John Dal Broi said the most recent development with the proposed school options involved officials from the Department of Education who supported the $45 million super school.

“Griffith is one of the regional areas growing above the state average and education and health are two aspects attracting people to the area so I would expect to see what was previously put in place to continue,” he said.

Cr Dal Broi said he would seek a meeting with the new minister if proposed options changed. 

Despite being replaced by Rob Stokes, Mr Piccoli supported his successor and said it was a privilege to have served as Minister of Education for nearly six years.

&quot;In 165 years there have only been four Ministers of Education who served longer than I have and there is a lot of goodwill towards what I have achieved as minister, which gives me a great personal satisfaction,&quot; Mr Piccoli said.

“I can look back over my time as Minister satisfied with what I have achieved.

&quot;What more could you want.”
