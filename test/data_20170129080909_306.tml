<TEXT type="str">Alabama is losing yet another coaching staff member as receivers coach Billy Napier is headed to Arizona State to be the offensive coordinator, a person with knowledge of the situation told USA TODAY Sports.

The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because the schools had not announced the move.

Napier was Clemson&apos;s first offensive coordinator under Dabo Swinney, getting the job at age 29. After parting ways with Clemson, he landed at Alabama as an offensive analyst in 2011, then moved with Jim McElwain to Colorado State, where he was the quarterbacks coach for a year. He returned to Alabama and was instrumental in the development of star wide receivers like Amari Cooper, Calvin Ridley and ArDarius Stewart.

He will replace Chip Lindsey, who left Arizona State for Auburn after one season. Napier joins former offensive coordinator Lane Kiffin (Florida Atlantic head coach) and tackles/tight ends coach Mario Cristobal (Oregon co-offensive coordinator) as significant departures from Nick Saban&apos;s staff this offseason.</TEXT>
