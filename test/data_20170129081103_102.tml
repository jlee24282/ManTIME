Dozens of travellers have been detained at US airports and protests have erupted around the country. Qantas is offering refunds to any passengers travelling from Australia to the United States who are affected by a new entry ban. Dozens of travellers have been detained at US airports and protests have erupted around the country. The executive order signed by US President Donald Trump has barred citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries – Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen – from entering the US for 90 days. That includes legal US residents temporarily out of the country.

The order has also barred all refugees from entering the US for 120 days and Syrian refugees indefinitely.

Additionally, Australian citizens who have travelled to the seven countries since March 1, 2011 are no longer eligible to enter the US under the Visa Waiver Program, and are now required to apply for a US visa.

Australians who are dual citizens of the nominated countries, including government officials, and &quot;have previously been issued an [Electronic System for Travel Authorisation] are likely to have the ESTA revoked&quot;, according to the Australian government.

No travellers from Australia are known to have been immediately affected by the ban.

&quot;The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has not received any requests for consular assistance from Australians unable to board transport to the United States,&quot; a spokeswoman for Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop said.

&quot;The Australian embassy in Washington is engaging with US officials on the potential implications of the suspension for Australian travellers, including dual nationals.

&quot;Travellers are advised that visa and other entry and exit conditions can change at short notice.&quot;

Qantas is advising anyone who thinks they may be affected to contact the airline directly or speak to their travel agent, and said it will provide affected passengers with a number of options, including a refund or a change of destination.

&quot;Qantas notes the advice from the US government regarding tighter entry conditions,&quot; a spokesman for the airline said.

&quot;We will reflect this change in our processes and booking systems, however it is not likely to materially impact Qantas passengers.&quot;

It is estimated 100 to 200 people who had already begun their journey when Mr Trump signed the order yesterday have been detained at US airports, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. An has temporarily stopped the government from sending those who landed with valid visas out of the country.

Crowds of protesters have gathered at US airports in response to the order and subsequent detainments. The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.</TEXT>
