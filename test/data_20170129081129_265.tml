<TEXT>You have a choice: You can sit on the sidelines and complain about how hard your life is or you can get up and get in the game. You can make excuses and stay where it's safe and comfortable and boring or you can get up, face your fears, and take that first step. 

You were made for more than a wimpy life. But you have to make the choice to get up off your behind and do something. 

Nothing ever comes to those who just sit there and hope that eventually something will happen. Get up and go happen to life! 

It's time to stop stalling and start doing. 

You don't have to write a book or climb a mountain or run a marathon or start a business. You just have to get up and do the next right thing... whatever that next right thing is. 

Get up and do it. The best time to start is NOW.</TEXT>
