<TEXT type="str">RASNOV, Romania (Kyodo) -- Japan&apos;s Sara Takanashi came second and Yuki Ito third at the 11th event of the women&apos;s ski jumping World Cup season on Saturday, finishing behind winner Maren Lundby of Norway. 
 
Three-time overall champion Takanashi jumped 93 and 98 meters to score 249.8 points but was unable to overhaul Lundby, who flew 97 and 99 meters off the 100-meter, K-90 hill to score 259.0 points. 
 
Ito won three of the last four events, all held in Japan over the last two weeks, but had to settle for third after 91- and 93.5-meter efforts gave her 238.5 points. 
 
&quot;This shows where my performance level is at the moment,&quot; Takanashi said. &quot;A good performance must precede a title-winning effort. I&apos;d like to focus more on that.&quot; 
 
The 20-year-old Takanashi won five of the first six events this season but failed to add to that tally in the four rounds held in Japan, and the latest result sees her wait for a landmark 50th win continue. 
 
&quot;My form has dipped and the jump, which is the base for everything, isn&apos;t good. I&apos;ve had to be conscious of doing things that I didn&apos;t need to do before,&quot; she added. 
 
&quot;I have to place myself where I want to be at the takeoff and then give a burst of power. I did have a decent jump (on my second), moving in one flow from the takeoff to landing after a proper in-run.&quot; 
 
Ito failed to claim her third straight win but showed consistency with her fifth straight podium finish. 
 
&quot;I&apos;m satisfied as I jumped better than at the last World Cup meet in Zao,&quot; Ito said. &quot;The motivation to get results doesn&apos;t change, and I need to move forward mentally regardless of whether I did well or not.&quot;</TEXT>
