<content type="str">GREAT BEND, Kan. - A Hutchinson man has been sentenced to three years in prison for a drunken-driving accident that killed his friend. 
Twenty-year-old Dakota Wade James was sentenced Friday for a May 15 wreck on the Barton/Stafford county line. Investigators say James missed a curve and rolled his pickup truck rolled, leaving 20-year-old Jacob Kenny of Great Bend dead. 

The Hutchinson News reports (http://bit.ly/2jI7qGU ) James told authorities after the accident that Kenny had been driving. James also had a history of alcohol-related violations, including a DUI arrest four months before the crash. 

Prosecutors charged James with involuntary manslaughter, driving under the influence but he pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of involuntary manslaughter by reckless behavior. 

A 30-day sentence for filing a false police report will run concurrently with the prison time.</content>
