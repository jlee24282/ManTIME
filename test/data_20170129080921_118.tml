<TEXT type="str">BlackBerry has been very mysterious with its upcoming smartphone codenamed Mercury. TCL did show the BlackBerry-branded smartphone at the recently concluded CES 2017 event, and even allowed a hands-on of the device, but its specifications and features are still under wraps. A new leak however claims that the upcoming smartphone is likely to feature one of the best smartphone cameras. 
Posted on Twitter by Roland Quandt , the new BlackBerry Mercury is said to sport the same camera sensors as Google’s Pixel smartphones. According to his tweet, the BlackBerry Mercury smartphone is likely to come with a 12-megapixel rear camera with Sony IMX378 sensors. The Google Pixel smartphones boast one of the best cameras, and it would be interesting to see if BlackBerry is able to emulate it on the Mercury. Up front, the BlackBerry Mercury is said to house an 8-megapixel selfie camera with either a Samsung S5K4H8 sensor or an Omnivision OV8856 sensor. 
 
Up until now, what we do know about the BlackBerry Mercury is that it will feature a combination of metal and rubberized body. The smartphone will feature a capacitive QWERTY keypad similar to the BlackBerry Passport. The interesting bit here is the placing of the fingerprint sensor which is embedded on the space bar of the smartphone. In terms of specifications, what has been confirmed so far is that it will feature a USB Type-C port for connectivity and on the software front, it will run on Android Nougat out-of-the-box.

The BlackBerry Mercury smartphone has been rumored to feature a 4.2-inch display, whereas some reports suggest a 4.5-inch display. At the core of the smartphone, the BlackBerry Mercury could run Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 821 chipset or Snapdragon 625 chipset. In terms of RAM and storage, the BlackBerry Mercury is said to come with 3GB of RAM and onboard storage of 32GB. There is no word on a microSD slot as of now. For power, the smartphone could be powered by a 3,400mAh battery. ALSO READ:  MWC 2017: BlackBerry Mercury to be unveiled on February 25
