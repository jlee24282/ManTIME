<TITLE>College roundup: Central men come up short in loss to Western Oregon</TITLE>
<TEXT>ELLENSBURG  An already rough week for Central Washingtons men got worse Saturday night. 
   
Upset Thursday at home by Concordia, the Wildcats were whipped 85-68 in GNAC play in Nicholson Pavilion. 
   
CWUs third straight loss left the Wildcats 7-5 in the conference and 12-6 overall. It also dropped them into a fourth-place GNAC tie with Montana State Billings. 
   
Free throws, as they had been in last Saturday nights loss at first-place Western Washington and again Thursday, loomed large. 
   
While Central made 4 of 12, the Wolves (8-4, 11-9) were 24 of 31. 
   
Coach Greg Sparling calculated that over his teams three-game losing streak the Wildcats have been outscored 73-24 from the free throw line. 
   
Im not blaming the officials, not at all, he said. But the thing is, we simply have got to find a way to get to the foul line more. 
   
Center Fuquan Niles was Centrals lone double-digit scorer, and he posted a double-double with 12 points and 11 rebounds. 
   
But Dom Hunter, the GNACs scoring leader at 25.2 points per game, managed only nine on 4-of-17 shooting, and the teams second-leading scorer, Naim Ladd, sat out with an injury sustained late in Thursdays game. 
   
Ali Faruq-Bey led Western Oregon with 21 points and Demetrius Trammell, a transfer from Yakima Valley College, had 12 off the bench. 
   
We have 72 hours before we take a seven-hour bus ride to Northwest Nazarene, Sparling said, and weve got to get a lot of things fixed.
