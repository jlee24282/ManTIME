President Donald Trump is carrying through on his campaign promise to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. I lived in El Paso, Texas, for many years and would like to offer my perspective. 
 
El Paso and Ciudad Juarez are two separate cities in two separate countries, but together they form one large metropolis that is economically interdependent. If you were to stand at one of the border crossings in El Paso you would see Mexican citizens crossing legally into El Paso to visit family, shop, attend the University of Texas at El Paso , conduct business and attend cultural events. 
 
American citizens cross into Juarez to visit family, shop, work as supervisors and administrators of maquiladora plants and some go for affordable medical and dental care. Trucks cross bringing goods from Mexico into the United States every day. 
 
At a large shopping mall in El Paso many cars in the parking lot have Mexican plates. They belong to Mexican citizens who come legally to shop in El Paso. They come to buy big ticket items such as cars, refrigerators, washing machines, computers, clothing, household items, etc. They contribute a great deal to the El Paso economy. When currency fluctuations make it too expensive for them to shop, El Paso merchants lament the loss of their good Mexican customers. 
 
I think that most border cities would welcome increased security, but I am not sure that they want it to take the form of a border wall. There has been no discussion of how a wall could affect the interdependent economies of border cities.
