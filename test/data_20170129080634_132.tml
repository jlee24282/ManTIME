Trainers Jamie Richards and Stephen Autridge applied the headgear to Melody Bell following her last start unplaced effort and they had the desired effect on the daughter of Commands. 
 
Settled in fourth place with cover to the home turn, Melody Bell ($32) cruised up to share the lead 200m out before quickening clear and was untroubled to go on and defeat Hasahalo ($4.10 equal fav), which made up a lot of ground in the straight, by 1 1/4-lengths with Felton Road ($4.90) a neck away third. 
 
Richards said a troubled run last start saw brought about the gear change. 
 
&quot;Her last start was about having her spot on for today. She drew the outside and we went back, poked up between a few late after being shunted off the track,&quot; Richards said. 
 
&quot;Blinkers went on and Opie came down to gallop on Tuesday and he was very happy. 
 
&quot;It&apos;s a huge buzz, full credit to everyone behind the scenes, the team at home have done a lovely job with her.&quot; 
 
Richards said the addition of Opie Bosson as jockey played a huge part in the win. 
 
&quot;Geeze he&apos;s riding well and he just put her in the perfect spot. The draw helped but I think every horse got it&apos;s chance,&quot; Richards said. 
 
&quot;We&apos;ll give her a couple of days to settle down and then we&apos;ll have a look at where we go next, there&apos;s the Diamond Stakes here and the Manawatu Sires (Produce) down the line so there&apos;s plenty of options for a filly like this.&quot; 
 
Padraig started the other $4.10 equal favourite under Hugh Bowman and was beaten 3 1/2-lengths into sixth place.
