<content type="str">Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to inaugurate the three-day National Women&apos;s Parliament-2017 (NWP) being organised by the Andhra Pradesh Assembly at Pavitra Sangamam at Ibrahimpatnam on February 10. 
 
Buddhist spiritual leader Dalai Lama will attend the inaugural session along with a host of leaders from India and abroad, Speaker Kodela Sivaprasada Rao said addressing a press conference. 
 
The vision of NWP is to enable and encourage social, political and economic empowerment of women in all strata of the society. 
 
&quot;The NWP will come out with Amaravati Declaration on women empowerment at the end of the three-day deliberations,&quot; the Speaker said. 
 
&quot;National Women&apos;s Parliament will be a common platform for women from diverse backgrounds like politics, arts and culture, sports, education, industry, media, cinema, judiciary and social sector to share their knowledge and research in the area of women&apos;s social, economic and political empowerment,&quot; he said. 
 
Asked if a resolution would be passed at the conclave seeking the long-pending 33 per cent reservation for women in Parliament and state legislatures, the Speaker said the issue would only be &quot;discussed&quot;. 
 
&quot;We want to stay clear of any controversial issues,&quot; Kodela said. 
 
The NWP, a first-of-its-kind conclave in India, would facilitate interaction between women from varied backgrounds and also girl students to raise awareness on issues like malnutrition, social security, sexual harassment, sanitation, oppression and other gender-based problems. 
 
&quot;One of the objectives of this conclave is to make girls realise their potential and make them aware of the canvas where they can leave their footprints. 
 
&quot;Our endeavour is to enhance the network between eminent women and girl students to enable them to take leadership roles in all sectors,&quot; Kodela added. (MORE)
