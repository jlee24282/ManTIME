<TEXT type="str">SIERRA VISTA  —  This week, members of the Rotary Club of Sierra Vista opened their meeting by hearing from Victoria Howell, the Rotary “Student of the Month.” 
   
In her speech, Victoria revealed how Rotary’s Four Way Test applied in her life and impacted her interests and passions. Victoria was raised in a family that encouraged exploration of career options, acting with integrity and doing the best at whatever career chosen. 
   
Victoria explained how her generation (the so-called Millenials) could be a great benefit to society by seeking out and pursuing careers that are uplifting and satisfying. Victoria believes that by being true to who we are we can become what we truly should be. She encouraged Rotarians to remember that being fair to all concerned recognizes the importance of exploring interests and allowing others the same opportunity. Working with others to accomplish great things develops a sense of goodwill in society, as it does in small group settings, that will last a very long time. 
   
Victoria concluded by offering her opinion that society will derive great benefits from youth exploring and pursuing careers that they love and that motivate them to accomplish great things. 
   
Rotarians then participated in the first club assembly of the new year. Club assemblies allow Rotarians to discuss the functions of the club and to provide input regarding proposed changes to those functions. During this club assembly, Rotarians first received an update on the projects it has completed this year, and those yet to be done. 
   
The club then reviewed its annual goals and learned that it is well on its way to meeting those goals. The main areas where the club is falling short is on attracting new members and members not fully implementing MyRotary.org . 
   
The club then reviewed its bylaws and constitution and discussed changes or  
   
updates that have been proposed.Some of the changes include updating membership categories (such as corporate memberships, family memberships or associate memberships), and updating the club&apos;s meal charges.
