ISLAMABAD, Jan 29 (APP): The Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) in the 
country have registered 230 cases under Anti Money Laundering (AML) Act to 
curb sources of funds being used in terrorism. 
The number of cases registered under Foreign Exchange Regulation Act 
(FERA) was 498. The number of cases registered as Suspicious Transaction Reports (STRs) 
from Financial Monitoring Unit (FMU) was 116. 
A data issued by Interior Division while highlighting the details of 
registration of such cases and steps being taken to curb sources of such funds on 
Sunday revealed these relevant cases are under investigation in provinces. 
The data further revealed that Anti Money Laundering Act 2010 has been enacted, 
and, AML Rules, 2008 have also been framed. 
The government has signed to International Convention on Suppression 
of Financing of Terrorism adopted by General Assembly of the United Nations in its 
resolution. 
Moreover, in order to strengthen anti-terrorist regime,specially with 
a focus to choke terrorists funding sources, amendments in ATA 1997 have been introduced 
in March 2013 and in June, 2014 respectively. The basic objective was to make the law 
more effective and harmonized with international best practices. 
Rules under ATA 1997 for freezing of assets of terrorist have been 
framed and are with Law and Justice Division for final vetting. 
The government has so far proscribed 62 organizations under provision 
of ATA 1997 while State Bank of Pakistan has issued detailed Regulations to all banks, for 
strict compliance, regarding anti-money laundering/terrorist financing. These Regulations 
are regularly updated by SBP. 
Prevention of Electronic Crime Act (PECA) 2016 has been promulgated 
which makes collection of funds for terrorist organizations through any information system 
or electronic devices in offence. 
Similarly, Financial Monitoring Unit (FMU) has also been set 
up which is now fully functional. FMU is regularly sending 
Suspicious Transactions Reports (STR) and Currency Transaction 
Reports (CTR) about suspects to various agencies like Federal 
Investigation Agency (FIA), Anti-Narcotics Force (ANF), National 
Accountability Bureau (NAB), Federal Bureau of Revenue (FBR), 
(Directorate General of Intelligence and Investigation) to 
investigate and take action according to law. 
National Action Plan (NAP) had also been chalked out wherein 
point No, 6 relates to “Choking financing for terrorist and 
terrorist organizations.” NAP is being implemented in letter and 
spirit. 
The collection of funds, through donation boxes, for different 
organizations has been banned. In case of violation, donation boxes 
are seized and action under the law is taken by local police. 
In terms of AML Act, 2010 reporting entities are legally bound 
to send financial intelligence to FMU in all cases where there is a 
suspicious that funds are related to terrorist activities or 
terrorist organizations. 
Moreover, the data said the government has recently shared a 
list of persons placed on Schedule 4th of ATA 1997, along with their 
Computerized National Identity Card (CNIC) numbers for freezing of 
their bank accounts, accordingly the SBP has frozen 4461 bank 
accounts of 4th Schedules all over Pakistan. 
The SBP has also issued prudential regulations under which 
bankers are duty bound to exercise Customer Due Diligence (CDD) and 
Know Your Customer (KYC) obligations without fail and report all 
Suspicious Transactions to FMU. 
Designated/proscribed entities and individuals are prohibited 
from opening of bank accounts and/or availing any facility from any 
financial institution in Pakistan. 
Various capacity building programmes are regularly arranged 
for Law Enforcement Agencies to develop and strengthen their skills 
regarding investigation of financial crimes while units for 
countering of terrorism financing have been established under 
counter terrorist departments of the provinces.
