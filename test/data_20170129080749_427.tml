<content type="str">MONTGOMERY - The Barr-Reeve Vikings got a tournament quality win at Kavanaugh Kourt on Saturday. Although they only led in the final minutes of the game, they were able to complete the comeback and move to 16-1. 
 
The No. 1 2A Vikings didn&apos;t put anyone into double figures and shot just 6-11 from the free throw line, but were able to find enough heart to win, 43-41 over the visiting Pike Central Chargers (9-6). 
 
&quot;That was a very different Pike Central team than we faced at the Graber Post (Classic). They made it very difficult to get the ball into Trevor (Lengacher) and they played some great defense. It turned into a street fight for awhile,&quot; said B-R coach Bryan Hughes. &quot;We are going to have to realize that teams are going to get into us and start guarding us differently in the post. 
 
&quot;I give our kids a lot of credit for hanging in there. I thought Keegan (O&apos;Neill) played well and I thought Kolten Graber gave us a big basket. The one thing I was disappointed with was our free throw shooting in the double bonus.&quot; 
 
Pike Central took an early 4-0 lead, all from senior Gabe Elliott, and giving him his 1,000th career point.  Although Javan Miller and Lengacher added buckets, PC pushed it to 11-4.  O&apos;Neill got on the board for the Vikings, but PC was able to extend it to 18-6 and end the quarter on a 9-0 run. 
 
Lengacher and Gabe Gladish combined for the first five points of the second quarter and cut the Charger lead to seven. An O&apos;Neill &quot;and 1&quot; cut the Viking deficit to just four with 4:00 left in the half. 
 
Bryant Nalley accounted for all seven Charger points of the quarter, but B-R was able to trim the margin back to five, 25-20, after a pair of Gladish free throws. 
 
O&apos;Neill was able to cut the lead back to three, however PC was able to move it back to five throughout much of the quarter, before Colten White and Elliott gave them an eight-point lead with 2:24 left in the third. The Chargers were able to go up by 10 when B-R missed six straight shots. However, O&apos;Neill added his second basket of the quarter, but B-R was still down 34-26 with eight minutes to play. 
 
The Vikings began a fourth quarter rally with a jumper from Austin Ainscough and a trey from Gladish to get it back to five with 6:00 to play. Jon Walker added a trey that cut it to two. 
 
After a questionable call, B-R was given a technical and PC was able to go up by three. After baskets from Ainscough and Lengacher, B-R had its first lead of the night with 2:45 left. 
 
Graber pushed the lead to three and a Walker rebound gave the Vikings the lead and the ball with 2:00 left.  B-R missed three of its next four free throws and Elliott made the front end, but the Chargers were still only able to cut the margin to three. Miller added one, but a trey from Elliott kept the Chargers in the game with :18.3 left to play. 
 
Miller added a free throw to make it 43-41 and PC rimmed out the long trey at the buzzer, as the Vikings completed the comeback. 
 
No Viking made it to double figures. 
 
Lengacher and O&apos;Neil posted nine points each, Gladish had eight and  Ainscough had six. Walker had five, Miller four and Kolten Graber had a very important two points. 
 
The Chargers were led by 14 each for Elliott and Nalley. 
 
B-R took the JV game, 44-39, which saw the younger Vikings down by as much as 15, before collecting the win. Quentin Yoder led with 15 points, while Kam Graber had 12. 
 
Barr-Reeve takes to the road for three straight games, beginning with Jasper on Thursday.</content>
