Dayo Johnson, Akure 
 
THE leadership crisis in the Ondo State House of Assembly deepened as warring factions, yesterday, laid claim to the speakership. 
 
Those in the majority (16members), led by suspended Speaker Jumoke Akindele, alleged that the plot to cause crisis was “hatched, nurtured, and executed by the All Progressives Congress, APC, in the state.” 
 
They condemned the shenanigans of the minority members at “an unauthorized sitting at which the leadership of the House was purportedly suspended”. 
 
The other faction, who are ten in number and led by newly appointed Speaker Coker Malachi, insisted that there was no going back in the sack of the leadership of the assembly. Both factions addressed journalists, yesterday, sticking to their guns.
