<TITLE>Book review: Book explores the dark side of Einstein</TITLE>
<TEXT>Albert Einstein was a cad. No amount of history can gloss over that fact.

If you find that notion intriguing, puzzling or even infuriating  The Other Einstein, by Pittsburgh-based writer Marie Benedict, is worth a read.

Letters between Albert Einstein and Mileva Maric  his first wife and the novels protagonist  have served as a window into Einsteins heart. However, one letter is notorious for painting a very unromantic picture of the celebrated physicist.

It is, in short, a list of terms and conditions Einstein claims Maric must abide by. If she does not, he will leave her. The letter includes housekeeping demands, instructions that she refrain from speaking to him except during public outings and commands for obedience. It begs the question, how could a secular saint like Einstein be so backward and misogynistic?

The Other Einstein attempts to answer this question, and in doing so, highlights the dangers of deifying any man.

Until very recently, Maric has been little more than a footnote in Einsteins story, even though she was also a brilliant physicist who studied among Einstein and his peers. The Other Einstein puts Maric at the forefront of the narrative, letting her tell her own story. And, in doing so, the reader begins to get a more complete picture of who she was, and in turn, who Einstein was as well.

The book offers no surprises to those who are familiar with Einsteins life. But because it is a work of fiction, it is able to go beyond what we know, filling in the gaps of history.

The novel opens with Maric, a withdrawn yet witty young woman, traveling to Zurich to attend classes. Her gender, physical ailments and Serbian background make her a target on every level for disdain and prejudice. But, despite all this, it is in Zurich where she starts to come into her own, eventually seeking intellectual and social fulfillment.

At first its an idyllic beginning for young Einstein and Maric. But a shadow looms over even the bright parts of the novel. Whether youve read the cruel list of demands Einstein penned, or simply recall the fact that he married his cousin later in life, you know things do not turn out well for Maric.

In a sad twist of fate, it is her hunger for knowledge that puts her in the path of a man who, in many ways, would hold her back from fulfilling her dreams.

The Other Einstein is rife with harsh revelations about Einsteins character. He is frequently portrayed as manipulative, narcissistic and abusive. Despite there being some evidence to back up her portrayal, many will argue that the way Ms. Benedict portrays Einstein is unfair and biased. However, casting Maric in such a benevolent way was likely not done without a purpose. Her story arc is reminiscent of many gothic tales and recalls Jane Eyre especially. They are both pure young women who overcome great obstacles in a pursuit of happiness only, in the end, to be seduced and thwarted by a man who is both malevolent and compelling.

However, unlike Jane Eyre, our heroines story does not end in redemption. Readers will find that the book is easily digestible, as Ms. Benedict breezes through even the most traumatic events. This can be frustrating, as Marics story is so unique and rich, and has been ignored for so long, that many will want to delve deeper into her motivations, thoughts and sorrows. However, The Other Einstein is a compelling read, and offers up a moral that many can appreciate: brilliance of mind does not equal excellence of character.
