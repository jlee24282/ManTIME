Armada Area Schools students will benefit from new projects and programs thanks to teachers, the community and the Armada Education Foundation, a local non-profit. In January, the AEF Board of Trustees awarded $25,000 in grants to 19 teachers for the 2016-2017 academic year.

All grade levels will benefit from the projects, programs and equipment the grant will fund, including an IXL Learning Inc. program, PASCO physics lab equipment, iMac computers with on-camera microphones, robotics equipment, deluxe squishy circuits kits, hands-on science materials, Sphero SPRK robotic balls, headphones, microphones, Rubik’s cubes, sources of low-dosage electromagnetic radiation and shields, flexible seating options, Pasco sensors, sensory integration items, Twiddles and Theraputty and an evening of exhibits at the STEAM Team event in April, a press release states.

Grant requests are submitted early on in the school year. Each application is reviewed and scored based on content and specific criteria. Each trustee’s scoring results are tabulated and the outcomes are reviewed by the entire board to reach the final decision on which teachers receive a grant.

The AEF has awarded more than $360,000 to teachers at Armada Area Schools since 1988.
