<content type="str">Claude Puel believes Southampton’s 5-0 defeat to Arsenal will be a valuable learning experience for many of his young players. 
  
Saints were dumped out of the Emirates FA Cup by the Gunners yesterday, with Puel naming a youthful team for the fourth-round encounter. 

While it was a chastening afternoon, Puel explained that lessons can be learned from it. 

&quot;It&apos;s hard. It&apos;s difficult to lose 5-0 at home,” he said. “It&apos;s a disappointment of course for our fans and these young players. 

“It&apos;s a good lesson. When we win, it&apos;s easy. In a bad moment it is a good time to learn. 

“But, of course, it&apos;s a difficult moment for young players to take a 5-0 defeat, but it was not possible to give them the best balance between experienced players and young players, because this moment is difficult for us on the physical side. 

“It&apos;s important to consider this, to analyse this game and this defeat. 

“We have a lot of injuries in the squad, and we continued with this game to improve our young players. It&apos;s important to give experience and it&apos;s a good lesson for the future for all these young players.”</content>
