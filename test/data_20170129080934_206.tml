<content type="str">I&apos;ve never seen a president.

I&apos;ve interviewed politicians who have tried to become president. Ted Kennedy. Mike Dukakis. Paul Tsongas. John Kerry. Mitt Romney.

Heck, I&apos;ve never even seen anyone who eventually because president. It had escaped my memory that one of the most popular players in the pro-am for the Deutsche Bank Championship - the PGA Tour event held annually at TPC Boston in Norton, which this year will be renamed the Dell Technologies Championship - was Donald John Trump, a New York billionaire most famous for his reality series, &quot;The Apprentice&quot; and now the 45th president of the United States. Each year, his group drew a big crowd, with many fans pointing at him and saying, &quot;You&apos;re fired.&quot;

I&apos;ve been lucky enough to cover the tournament in each of its 14 years, and one year, 2008, I decided to follow Trump around. His group was smaller than usual because, instead of his usual afternoon tee time, Trump began play at 7 a.m. (those early-morning tweets are no surprise, then). He was partnered with one of golf&apos;s leading men, Sergio Garcia of Spain.

The buzz in the crowd was that Trump&apos;s trademark hair resembled cotton candy even more than the past.

One spectator drew a chuckle when she had Trump autograph a $100 bill.

By 1 p.m., a helicopter buzzed over TPC Boston, the letters T-R-U-M-P on the bottom, its passenger presumably headed back to New York.

It gave me a glimpse of the magnetism Trump has with many Americans.

Trump owns several courses, some ranked among the best in the world by golf magazines.

He&apos;s also a very good player. Last month, Tiger Woods teed it up with then-President-elect Trump at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Fla.

Woods called it a &quot;great day&quot; with &quot;perfect weather&quot; as he and Trump walked 18 holes.

&quot;At the time I think we only had, what, 10 security carts,&quot; Woods said Monday while preparing to play a PGA Tour event in Los Angeles. &quot;I think his might be increased now.&quot;

When asked about Trump&apos;s golf game, Woods commented on Trump&apos;s power.

&quot;For a person who is 70 years old, he hits it hard,&quot; Woods said. &quot;People don&apos;t realize he&apos;s that old and he can rip it and hit it as far as he does. He keeps himself in pretty good shape and pretty good health, and has an inordinate amount of energy.&quot;

That&apos;s what I remember too. Trump swings hard. And not just at golf.
