<TITLE>National Basketball Association asks USA state department how immigration ban will affect players</TITLE>
<TEXT>The NBA wants to know if foreign players in the league now or in the near future might be affected by the immigration ban. 
 
Lakers forward Luol Deng was born in the part of Sudan that has since become the country of South Sudan. 
 
Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen are the countries listed in Trump's 90-day immigration ban, and two National Basketball Association players in particular may be affected by it. 
 
Before a federal court in NY issued a ruling to suspend Trump's order to ban, National Basketball Association spokesman Mike Bass issued a statement saying: "We have reached out to the State Department and are in the process of gathering information to understand how this executive order would apply to players in our league who are from one of the impacted countries". 
 Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen are the countries listed in Trump's 90-day immigration ban. . 
In a statement obtained by Wojnarowski , Bass pointed to the NBA's worldwide reach as a primary reason for the inquiry: "The NBA is a global league, and we are proud to attract the very best players from around the world". 
 
Deng's family left the Sudan at 5 years old, and came to the United States as a teenager. 
 
Maker, who was an Australian passport, was in Toronto for a game against the Raptors on Friday and made it back to America without a hassle, the USA Today reported. Maker is just a rookie, who was able to maneuver around the NBA's age rule to shirk attending college for a season, jumping straight into the NBA, where he was taken with the 10th overall pick by the Milwaukee Bucks in the 2016 NBA Draft. 
 
On a broader scale, Wojnarowski pointed to the NBA's involvement in programs like Basketball Without Borders, which "recruits, develops and invests in Sudanese talent".</TEXT>
