<TEXT type="str">Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe (D) held an afternoon press conference to respond to President Trump&apos;s executive order curtailing immigration of refugees and foreign nationals from several Middle Eastern and North African countries. 
 
One family, including two children, is now being detained at Dulles, the governor said, citing non-government officials. 
 
&quot;I am outraged and disappointed by the actions President Trump has taken to ban travelers from certain Muslim nations and to close our country to families seeking refuge from persecution&quot;. Gov. McAuliffe asked. &quot;We were built on immigrants, they have made our country the great nation it is today&quot;. 
 
&quot;On behalf of the people of Virginia, I urge President Trump and leaders in Washington to reverse this policy and restore our nation to its place as a beacon of opportunity for all&quot;, he said in a statement. 
 
&quot;We believe in vetting, and we believe in strong vetting&quot;, Gov. McAuliffe said. McAuliffe spoke along with Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring in the terminal while scores of protesters carrying signs and chanting were also there.</TEXT>
