<TITLE>The time has come to fix our water problems</TITLE>
<TEXT>Hoosick Falls and Petersburgh. Newburgh and Long Island. 
 
Just four areas of the state that have recently faced health threats from contaminated water supplies. They are far from the only ones. 
 
There comes a time when you can no longer turn your back on a problem. 
 
And when it comes to the crisis of contaminated drinking water in New York state, the time for greater action has arrived. 
 
To protect the long-term health of its residents, the state cant go half-hearted. It cant go on the cheap. Taxpayers must be willing to pay for improvements, not only for themselves but for the health of future generations. 
 
A report issued by the state Senate earlier this month included several recommendations for making New Yorks water safer to drink. 
 
The recommendations include more reporting and public notification of contamination (possibly setting up a reverse 911 system for sharing information about spills and other contamination), more government testing, stricter standards on contaminants, greater connectivity between water sources and the states cancer mapping system, more public education, creation of an independent entity that would include experts, scientists and water providers, and greater cooperation between state and federal agencies and other states. 
All that is necessary. But fixing the problem ultimately comes down to fixing the infrastructure that carries and cleans our water supply. 
 
The report recommended that in addition to ensuring that the Superfund Program and infrastructure water improvement grants are funded in the state budget, New York should establish a new clean water bond act to help smaller and more rural communities pay to fix their aging water and sewer systems. 
 
Gov. Andrew Cuomos proposed budget includes a $2 billion clean water infrastructure fund. And last week, two state senators  one representing Long Island and the other central New York  introduced legislation to create a $5 billion Clean Water Bond Act. Voters would be asked to support the borrowing during a referendum in November. 
 
It might be difficult for state residents, already highly taxed, to authorize borrowing that kind of money. But given the extent of the problem, they might have to bite the bullet. 
 
A report card issued last year by the American Society of Civil Engineers estimated the cost of repairing, replacing and updating the states drinking water infrastructure would be $38.7 billion over 20 years. To repair, replace and update New Yorks wastewater infrastructure, the report concluded, would cost $36.2 billion over 20 years. 
 
While the state cant afford to spend $75 billion for a full-scale replacement of its entire water and wastewater infrastructure, the numbers do provide an idea of how extensive (and expensive) the problem is. 
 
The $5 billion contained in the bond act wouldnt fully fund the solutions, but combined with other state and federal initiatives, it could go a long way toward helping municipalities make and afford improvements. 
 
New York hasnt been totally ignoring its water problem, but it hasnt put on a full-court press to solve it either. The time for that kind of commitment has arrived. 
 
Failing to take significant action now will only put the health of New Yorkers in further danger.</TEXT>
