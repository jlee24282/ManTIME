<TITLE>First Reading: Zephaniah 2:3; 3:12-13</TITLE>
<TEXT>3 Seek the LORD, all you humble of the land, who do his commands; seek righteousness, seek humility; perhaps you may be hidden on the day of the wrath of the LORD. 

12 For I will leave in the midst of you a people humble and lowly. They shall seek refuge in the name of the LORD, 

13 those who are left in Israel; they shall do no wrong and utter no lies, nor shall there be found in their mouth a deceitful tongue. For they shall pasture and lie down, and none shall make them afraid.</TEXT>
