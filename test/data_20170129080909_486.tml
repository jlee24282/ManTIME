The Indian Coast Guard (ICG) was formally established in 1978 by the Coast Guard Act, 1978, of the Parliament of India as an independent armed force of India. It operates under the Ministry of Defence and works in close cooperation with the Indian Navy, the Department of Fisheries, the Department of Revenue (Customs) and the Central and State police forces.
