<TEXT type="str">It is the first Verne novel in which he perfected the &quot;ingredients&quot; of his later work, skillfully mixing a plot full of adventure and twists that hold the reader&apos;s interest with passages of technical, geographic, and historic description. The book gives readers a glimpse of the exploration of Africa, which was still not completely known to Europeans of the time, with explorers traveling all over the continent in search of its secrets.</TEXT>
