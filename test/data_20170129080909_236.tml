Speaking to PEOPLE ,  the actress said, &quot;On the evening of the 25th, I went out with a group of friends to celebrate my birthday. While having drinks, I realised that something was not right as my behavior was becoming erratic and continued to intensify over the next several hours.&quot; 
 
She continued, “I voluntarily went to get professional help, and I was informed by their staff that I had been given GHB. After an overnight stay, I am home and doing well.
