<TITLE>Irving Heritage House to Host Vintage Valentine Tea</TITLE>
<TEXT>The silver is polished. The sweetheart has been secretly selected, and the recipes have been double-checked for the Vintage Valentine Tea. Join the Irving Heritage Society 2 to 4 p.m., Sunday, Feb. 12, as it opens the doors of the Irving Heritage House, 303 South OConnor, for a 1914-themed Vintage Valentine Tea. Reservations are not required, and admission is free. 
 
On Thursday, Feb. 19, 1914, the Irving Index newspaper reported: 
  
Mr. and Mrs. Charles Percy Schulze threw open their beautiful new home Saturday evening to one hundred and fifty invited guests. The housewarming was in the nature of a Valentine Party  the decorations and color scheme throughout being hearts, arrows and cupid in reds and yellows. 
  
Just as in the 1914 article description, there will be strings of hearts from the chandeliers. The lace draperies at the windows and dining table will have festoons of hearts and arrows. Rose Cannaday and Betty Fulbright are serving as co-chairs of this years event.
