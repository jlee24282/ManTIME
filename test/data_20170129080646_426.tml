<TEXT type="str">Here’s food for thought. 
 
Dystopian tales, books most people haven’t read since high school, were sprinkled into Amazon’s Bestseller List of books this week. 
 
A book first published in 1949 — George Orwell’s “1984”— shot to No. 1 on that list. 
 
Orwell’s dystopia — where all language and thought are controlled by the Party — has experienced enough of a resurgence that publisher Penguin ordered a 75,000-book reprint, according to CNN. 
 
If you recall from your high school English class, the book’s protagonist Winston Smith’s job is to replace historical truths with new, state-approved “facts.” 
 
Orwell wrote: 
 
“Every record has been destroyed or falsified, every book rewritten, every picture has been repainted, every statue and street building has been renamed, every date has been altered. And the process is continuing day by day and minute by minute. History has stopped. Nothing exists except an endless present in which the Party is always right.” 
 
In Orwell’s dystopia, where language is changed into the Party’s Newspeak — and a Party slogan is “Ignorance is Strength” — the first primary means of thought control is Crimestop. He writes: 
 
“Crimestop means the faculty of stopping short, as though by instinct, at the threshold of any dangerous thought. It includes the power of not grasping analogies, of failing to perceive logical errors, of misunderstanding the simplest arguments… Crimestop, in short, means protective stupidity.” 
 
“Power is in tearing human minds to pieces and putting them together again in new shapes of your own choosing.” 
 
“It Can’t Happen Here,” a 1935 dystopian novel by Sinclair Lewis, hit No. 7 on Amazon’s Bestseller list as of Wednesday night (the list is updated hourly.) 
 
The pre-World War II semi-satirical political novel by the Pulitzer Prize winning author is, according to the publisher’s synopsis, a “cautionary tale about the fragility of democracy, it is an alarming, eerily timeless look at how fascism could take hold in America.” 
 
Hitting No. 9 that night was a book written 86 years ago: Aldous Huxley’s 1931 novel, “Brave New World.” 
 
In Huxley’s dystopia, set in London in the year 2540, or 632 A.F., ”After Ford,” humans are created and conditioned according to the society&apos;s strict caste system, life has been almost entirely industrialized to create consumers, and is controlled by a few people at the top of a World State. 
 
Ray Bradbury’s dystopian “Fahrenheit 451” — a bleak future where television rules, books are burned and literature is on the brink of extinction — hit number 17 on that list on Wednesday night. 
 
At No. 27, Margaret Atwood’s dystopian “The Handmaid’s Tale,” about a future where women are second class citizens, valued only as reproductive units to create babies, and are barred from reading. 
 
I won’t go into the hows and whys. Hey, maybe a whole lot of English teachers assigned dystopian novels last week. And after all, this is only one site’s list. 
 
I’ll just say that when the winds of change shift, we fall back into art, words, music, poetry. We fall back on writers. Have since the dawn of the written word. Before that, we looked to fire and drumbeat, cave paintings of animal fat and pigment smeared on rock walls. 
 
We look to ideas, to words, because we need to look to something that feels permanent and real. We look to ink, formed into shapes, stamped onto wood and pulp. We hold them in our hands. Or we see them on a screen, illuminated, glowing, black and white sculptures that fire neurons inside our skulls. 
 
Optic fibers translating some code, something ancient, into cells, into strands of fiber and carbon. Synapses, nerve endings pulsing inside casement of bone. Blood flows, pulses quickens. Breath changes. Something is released. Something is eased. 
 
Orwell died in 1950. This week, droves of people bought his book. So maybe this passage is the truest thing he ever wrote: 
 
“We are the dead. Our only true life is in the future. We shall take part in it as handfuls of dust and splinters of bone…We can only spread our knowledge outwards from individual to individual, generation after generation… there is no other way.”
