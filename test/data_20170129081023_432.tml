<TEXT type="str">The Australian Greens has issued a slap down to the formation of formal factions just weeks after the establishment of the controversial anti-capitalist group Left Renewal within its ranks. 
 
A statement issued by the Australian Greens National Council on Sunday declares formal factions &quot;incompatible&quot; with the party&apos;s principles. 
 
The statement comes amid escalating tensions between former party leader Bob Brown and Senator Lee Rhiannon over the party&apos;s direction under Senator Richard Di Natale. 
 
Ms Rhiannon - who is on the left of the party - last week said the Greens are at a &quot;crossroads&quot; and should consider adopting the policies of former US presidential candidate Bernie Sanders. 
 
But she was criticised by Mr Brown, who blasted her as the &quot;Greens version of Tony Abbott&quot;. 
 
In its statement, which was emailed to every Greens member, the National Council said one of the Greens&apos; greatest strengths is that it is a member-driven organisation. 
 
&quot;We reject, as fundamentally inconsistent with our principles of egalitarian and collaborative consensus-based decision making, the formation of formal factions in the party,&quot; it said. 
 
&quot;Furthermore, the formation of formal factions is incompatible with our party structure and rules&quot;.
