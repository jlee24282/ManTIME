<content type="str">The Lake Havasu Consolidated Court runs a pretty tight ship. A little too tight for some. 
   
Lake Havasu City Magistrate Mitch Kalauli said the court has maxed out its current 20,000 square feet of space and will need to double its size if Havasu’s population continues to increase. 
   
“It’s not that the court is reaching capacity - we’ve already reached it,” Kalauli said. 
   
At a meeting with city officials earlier this month, Kalauli laid out the numerous challenges Havasu’s consolidated court faces including a lack of space for files, lagging IT services and security concerns. During comments, Lake Havasu City Council member Donna Brister-McCoy said the court’s situation was ‘deplorable.’ 
   
Kalauli said frustration stems in part from the ‘extremely inefficient’ case management system created by the state that requires clerks to process all payments by hand and retain paper records. Kalauli estimated it takes more than 6,000 hours, or three clerks working full time, just to locate and complete the paperwork each year. A new system the state is working on isn’t expected to reach Havasu’s Consolidated Court for another three to five years, he said. 
   
“By the time it rolls out to us it would also be a legacy system and be obsolete. We’re really frustrated with our inability to move forward, especially as we see what’s happening with the city,” Kalauli said. “I mean, the city is at the forefront of what’s going on technologically and we can’t adjust to that.” 
   
That files have jammed up the court’s already limited storage space, which was reduced to make room for a new courtroom. As a result, for the past five years, files have been accumulating in hallways, where some members of the public can access them. 
   
“Our jury deliberation rooms are back here, so members of the public do have access to this area,” Court Administrator Jennifer Harrold said. “It’s not that they’re unsupervised, but it’s still a concern.” 
   
She said the court is not aware of any missing or tampered-with files. 
   
Workspace is also maxed out. Harrold said there’s no growth potential to hire more employees at its current facility. 
   
“Luckily I have a great staff who do the best with what they have. We’ve become really close as a group,” she said. 
   
Looking ahead 
   
The consolidated court functions under an agreement between Lake Havasu City and Mohave County. Both entities help fund the court, but the State Supreme Court determines the court’s management practices. 
   
Kalauli asked city officials to consider reassessing its longstanding agreement with the county in order to provide more immediate services and also to begin planning for more courthouse space. 
   
Lake Havasu City Mayor Mark Nexsen said he’s willing to help, but it will have to be a joint effort. 
   
“I really think it’s beneficial for the city and county to work together to find a solution to these issues that affect everybody that’s in that courthouse, and if the three cities - Kingman, Bullhead and Lake Havasu - can come together and save taxpayers money like we have in the past, why can’t the county and city do the same?” Nexsen said. 
   
County Supervisor Steve Moss said he hasn’t received any formal requests from the court, which is in his district, but said the board would be open to hearing proposals. 
   
“I’m sure if it were to be brought up to the Board [of Supervisors], they would be very sympathetic,” Moss said.</content>
