<TITLE>The driving test changes coming in 2017</TITLE>
<TEXT>It is a rite of passage for every motorist.

But the driving test is due to undergo major changes in 2017, as a number of features are being added - and some are being dropped.

There's good news if you hate reversing around a corner, as that will no longer form part of the test. Instead, learners will be asked to show how they can reverse out of a parking bay.

Drivers will also be tested on their ability to use a sat-nav rather than driving by following road signs.
