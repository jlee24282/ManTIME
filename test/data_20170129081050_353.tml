<content type="str">Mexico&apos;s Foreign Ministry expressed on Saturday night its &quot;dismay and disappointment&quot; over Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&apos;s tweet on the wall that U.S. President Donald Trump is interested in building on the border with Mexico. 

                                                                                         
                
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
&quot;The Mexican Foreign Ministry told the Israeli government, through its ambassador to Mexico, its deepest dismay, rejection and disappointment over Prime Minister Netanyahu&apos;s Twitter message regarding the construction of a border wall. Mexico is a friend of Israel, and must be treated as such by its prime minister,&quot; it said in an official announcement.

President Trump is right. I built a wall along Israel&apos;s southern border. It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea  
— Benjamin Netanyahu (@netanyahu) January 28, 2017   
Netanyahu voiced what seemed to be support Saturday for Trump&apos;s plan to build a border wall along America&apos;s border with Mexico and praised Trump for referencing Israel in defending his wall.  

                                                                                         
                
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
&quot;President Trump is right. I built a wall along Israel&apos;s southern border. It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea,&quot; Netanyahu tweeted. 

                                                                                         
                
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
The Mexican statement added that Foreign minister Luis Videgaray Caso visited the Israeli embassy only a day earlier, on Friday, to express solidarity and friendship to Israel on the occasion of International Holocaust Remembrance Day. 

                                                                                         
                
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
&quot;Mexico and Israel share the historic rejection of racism and xenophobia, and Mexico will continue to work closely with Israel to combat any form of discrimination in the world,&quot; it said. 

                                                                                         
                
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
The Prime Minister&apos;s Office and Israel&apos;s Foreign Ministry published a clarification hours after Netanyahu&apos;s original tweet, prompted by Mexico&apos;s outrage on the matter, according to a senior official in Jerusalem. 

                                                                                         
                
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
&quot;The prime minister was addressing Israel&apos;s unique circumstances and the important experience we have and which we are willing to share with other nations. There was no attempt to voice an opinion regarding U.S.-Mexico ties,&quot; according to the clarification. 

                                                                                         
                
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
The heads of the Jewish community in Mexico also issued a statement condemning Netanyahu&apos;s words. 

                                                                                         
                
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
&quot;The Jewish community of Mexico disapproves of the announcement by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about a wall on the border. We don’t agree with his approach and strongly oppose his position. 

                                                                                         
                
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
&quot;As Mexicans and Jews, we support the steps taken by our government, headed by President Enrique Pena Nieto, in negotiations with the U.S. We identify with our citizens who live, work and contribute to the U.S., who must receive fair treatment and protection of human rights at any time,&quot; it said.</content>
