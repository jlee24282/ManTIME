<TITLE>Lincoln City fans pumped up for Brighton FA Cup tie - come on you...</TITLE>
<TEXT>Tension is reaching fever pitch in the city as the kickoff for arguably Lincoln City's biggest ever match approaches.

Fans are on tenterhooks with the eyes of the footballing world focusing on Lincoln as The Imps take on the might of Premier League hopefuls Brighton and Hove Albion in the FA Cup fourth round at 3pm today (Saturday, January 28).

The city centre is packed with fans and shoppers as they drink in the atmosphere before heading off to Sincil Bank.

And, as you would expect, both sets of supporters are bullish about their chances.

Watch Imps fans Darren and Christian Pearson with Phoebe Skipper talk about the massive match.

Fellow Lincoln fans Maria and Del Hollowthorpe said all the pressure is on Brighton.

"No-one's expecting us to win so they'll be feeling the pressure to beat us and beat us well," said Maria.

"And that's how we'll win - I can see us scoring at least twice on the break."

Del said: "I'm quietly confident - they shouldn't underestimate us."

Welder Steve Ambrose, 34, from Lincoln was doubtful of the Championship club's chances.

"They haven't got a hope of coming here and turning us over - it'll be 3-0 Imps," he said.

"We've got so much momentum at the moment and that can't be stopped!" Main Street was rammed with supporters getting a pre-match drink and bite to eat and were being watched over by a large police presence, stationed at strategic points along Lincoln's main shopping street.

Among the throng were Brighton fans Dan Topley and Matt Cooke.

"We've never been to Lincoln but it's lovely, although our memory of this place will be better if we beat them today," said Matt.

"If it was down to teams on paper, then we should be winning by four goals at least. But it's the FA Cup and Lincoln have had a great run so you can never be sure. Hopefully that will come to an end today!"

Dan said: "It wouldn't be the end of the world if we got beat as we've got to make sure we get to the Prem. But this is the sort of game that the FA Cup is all about - we'll be the bad guys if we beat them! Everyone else will be willing Lincoln to win."
