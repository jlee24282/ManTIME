<TEXT type="str">Physically, Federer may have a slight edge, which might sound freakish when he has been out for six months, but which makes sense when you take into account Nadal&apos;s four hour and 54 minute semi-final win over Grigor Dimitrov of Bulgaria. 
 
On Sunday evening at Melbourne Park, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal will lock horns in a grand slam final for the ninth, and probably the last, time . 
 
Federer broke the mould in 2009 when he broke down into tears after losing an epic Australian Open final to Nadal. 
 
That he meets Federer there will be viewed as the flawless closing chapter to a throwback Australian Open, which now boasts four singles finalists aged 30 or older - a first for a grand slam in the Open era. 7-5, 6-3, 1-6, 4-6, 6-3!-it actually lasted just over three hours, and the two major inflection points were injury timeouts. 
 
Wawrinka earned three break points in the ninth game with some splendid groundstrokes and on his third break point he rifled a forehand cross-court victor to break, and then served out for a fifth set. I feel very happy, I enjoyed it a lot. 
 
Nadal won through to his fourth Australian Open and his 21st Grand Slam final. Nadal faced an extremely tricky draw also, having to rally from two sets to one down against Alexander Zverev in the 3rd round, the German eventually succumbing to cramp in the latter stages. 
 
The Williams, who have dominated women&apos;s tennis since the dawn of the millennium, will also become the oldest female pairing in a Grand Slam final at a combined 71 years. 
 
Either Federer, 35, will expand his record haul of major singles titles with his 18th, or 30-year-old Nadal will close the gap on the Swiss legend by winning his 15th. 
 
Federer was watching on with relish as his rival in Sunday&apos;s final was taken the distance in a draining physical battle. 
 
And now, the dream final tennis fans had hoped for when favourites Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic were upset in the first week is going to happen Sunday night in Rod Laver Arena. 
 
He came out firing, with an ace, but had to dig deep to stave off two break points in his opening two service games. 
 
A brilliant backhand pass down the line, followed by a Dimitrov double fault, saw Nadal break back in the seventh game. 
 
Nadal has already proved that from the baseline he is king, and the missiles that he launches from there will whiz past the stretched racquet of Federer. 
 
The match turned quickly for Wawrinka as Federer raced to a two sets lead after holding three set points. 
 
&quot;It&apos;s exciting for both of us that we are still there and fighting for important events&quot;, said Nadal. 
 
There was a danger that the tie break loss could have taken its toll on Dimitrov&apos;s game but the 25-year-old continued to take the fight to Nadal in the fourth . 
 
This was when the nostalgia started to get serious, as the two most credible threats to a Federer-Nadal final were now out of the way.</TEXT>
