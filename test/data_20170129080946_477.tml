<TEXT type="str">File photo - Amit Verma&apos;s unbeaten fifty took Assam past Jharkhand&apos;s 133 with nine balls to spare Â© Fotocorp Amit Verma&apos;s all-round performance helped Assam overcome Jharkhand by four wickets at the Eden Gardens. Verma hit an unbeaten fifty to follow his 3 for 17 that had restricted Jharkahand to 133 for 9 in their 20 overs. 

After they were put in, Jharkhand went off to a quick start, posting 59 before Abu Nechim (3-24) removed top-scorer Virat Singh (26) off the last ball of the Powerplay. He then removed Ishank Jaggi in his next over, and Kumar Deobrat fell soon after as Jharkhand were reduced to 73 for 4. Verma then accounted for the next four wickets - three with his legspin and one run-out - and it took Varun Aaron&apos;s unbeaten 16 off 9 to lift Jharkhand to 133 at the end of their innings. 

Assam were off to a quick start of their own in the chase as No. 3 Sibsankar Roy struck 34 off 21. However, they were reduced to 51 for 3 in the middle of the sixth over when Verma came in. He put on 25 for the fourth wicket with Roy, before dominating the next three partnerships - his three partners scoring a combined 17 off 29 - en route to an unbeaten 55 off 41 that took Assam past the target with nine balls to spare. Aaron (2-39) and Rahul Shukla (2-30) were among the wickets for Jharkhand, while Shahbaz Nadeem took 1 for 9 in his four overs.</TEXT>
