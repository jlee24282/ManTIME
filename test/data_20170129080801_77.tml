<TITLE>Newmarket school plan worthy of approval</TITLE>
<TEXT>Newmarket residents this March have their best chance to date to make substantial, yet pragmatic, improvements to their elementary and junior-senior high schools. 
 
School officials, led by the 2-year efforts of the Facilities Committee, crafted a $39 million plan that will solve overcrowding issues at both schools and, most importantly, provide a modern learning environment for students at the junior-senior high.The renovation and expansion plan breaks down as $28.4 million at the high school and $10.5 million at the elementary school. Full details are at www.newmarketschoolprojects.com. 
 
Efforts to modernize the high school date back a dozen years, and past failed efforts led to this plan, an honest, reasonable investment that takes into account the towns economic diversity.The $39 million plan is integrated to provide shared spaces such as a cafetorium in the high school and new gymnasium in the elementary school that are available for all district students. 
 
A homeowner with a house assessed at $250,000 would pay an additional $788 per year, or $66 a month. That is a considerable amount, but its less than the previous plan, which only dealt with the high school, and its likely to be less than any future plan should this one not be approved, especially as construction costs and interest rates rise. It is also less of a financial impact given the towns increased property tax base since 2014, which on April 1 will include the full taxable base of the redeveloped mills as it received a tax deferral as part of its redevelopment. 
 
It is regretful that the New Hampshire Legislature has thus far failed to reinstate school building aid. Should lawmakers do the right thing this plan is designed to be eligible for some level reimbursement. 
 
School leaders respected that a town with the economic diversity of Newmarket cannot pass a wish-list plan. A cafetorium, which is a cafeteria with a stage and appropriate acoustics to provide a performance venue, instead of a much more costly auditorium, is a perfect example of the pragmatic design.No one can tell all residents they should vote for this plan if they have limited income, but the committee did consider all with a need-based plan. 
 
Modernizing both schools will help increase property values. In time, while building upon Newmarkets renaissance, especially its vibrant downtown, property values will equalize with surrounding towns. This pragmatic modernization will limit the tax increase to what is truly necessary and that will also help increase property values. 
 
There will be debate about the $39 million cost, which has been referred to as the elephant in the room, but most of 2014s divisiveness will be absent because its not as hard to sell the merits of this plan. 
 
Some will ask how an early estimate of a $15 million to $18 million renovation of the junior-senior high school rose to $28.4 million. School officials say that estimate didnt create a real plan that provides a 50-year upgrade to the high school. This plan is not another Band-Aid, the collection of which has already cost residents millions of dollars. The high school plan will create 50,501 square feet for a total of 128,134 square feet. It preserves the original 1924 building and there is value in saving this piece of town history and culture. 
 
Renovation/expansion plans are common at Seacoast schools, including Portsmouths high and middle schools, Winnacunnet High and Oyster River High. Those projects proved to be cost-effective and efficient. 
 
The 2014 $45 million plan didnt address the elementary school while nearly maxing out the schools legal bonding capacity. This plan will modernize the elementary school, which now uses modular classrooms and doesnt have appropriate cafeteria or gym space. Recent approval of full-day kindergarten further adds to the need for reinvestment in the school. 
 
Its been a long road, but this plan is worthy of approval.</TEXT>
