<TEXT type="str">Repetition has been key for Eddie Jones Eddie Jones believes using the same tactic of repetition that Donald Trump employs has played a key role in his bid to get England back to the top of world rugby.

The Australian has overseen a tremendous turnaround of England&apos;s fortunes since replacing Stuart Lancaster after the 2015 World Cup, and next weekend looks to start a repeat of last year&apos;s Six Nations Grand Slam.

Jones says that repetition of a particular message has been key to his unbeaten record - 13 games in total - and drew comparisons with the new American president in that respect.

&quot;I just changed their mindsets, that&apos;s all,&quot; he told the Daily Mail.

&quot;My vision was that they should be more &apos;English&apos;, so I kept repeating the message in different ways. One day I put mustard on it, the next day I put tomato sauce on it - but it was basically the same message.

&quot;Yes, like Trump. Trump&apos;s clever, there&apos;s no denying that. The mantra &apos;Make America great again&apos; - he repeats and repeats it. Americans were pounded with that message.

&quot;People on the television say, &quot;I think he can make America great again.&quot; There&apos;s no evidence he can; but he&apos;s convinced them. He&apos;s changed mindsets. That&apos;s how you win. And having super-talented players.&quot;

England&apos;s Six Nations defence starts against France at Twickenham on Saturday.</TEXT>
