<TITLE>College Town: MSW program offered at Worcester YWCA</TITLE>
<TEXT>By Bonnie Russell Telegram & Gazette Staff  
Professionals living and working in the city will have the opportunity to earn a masters degree in social work from Westfield State University at the YWCA Central Massachusetts, 1 Salem Square, Worcester. 
 
The university will begin offering its masters program in social work at this location in the fall. This represents the only public, accredited MSW program offered in downtown Worcester. 
 
Westfield State chose Worcester because of the strong demand for an affordable, well-established MSW program to be offered in that city. Developing an affordable and accessible MSW option with a community-focused partner provides a valuable resource for the city, the surrounding area and the commonwealth, according to Tricia M. Oliver, director of campus communication at Westfield State. 
 
Classes are held online or in person at the YWCA, Ms. Oliver said. 
 
Applications for the hybrid program are now being accepted for fall enrollment. 
 
College Town asked Ms. Oliver if there is a limit for the number of students. 
 
Enrollment begins in fall 2017 with an anticipated 16 students. We expect the program to develop over three years to a full capacity of 64 students, graduating 24 annually starting May 2020, she said. 
 
Based on 2016-17 tuition and fees, the total cost to complete Westfield States traditional, three-year MSW program is $27,984 and the part-time, two-year advanced standing program costs $15,688, according to Shelley Tinkham. Westfield State dean of the division of graduate and continuing education. 
 
Among the advantages to the partnership with the YWCA is its connections with area social services and heath care organizations and agencies, which will be helpful to enhance students learning, Ms. Tinkham said. 
 
There are some other options in the Worcester area for Central Massachusetts residents pursuing masters degrees in social work. 
 
Springfield College School of Social Work began offering graduate level classes at St. Vincent Hospital in Worcester in September 2011, but students may only take four courses at St. Vincent, two in the fall and two in the spring, all on weekends. The remaining courses need to be completed at the Brennan Center on the Springfield College campus. 
 
Approximately 30-35 students are enrolled in the program, according to Damon Markiewicz, associate director for media relations at Springfield College 
 
Wheelock College's Wheelock@Worcester offers an MSW program designed for those working for social service agencies, community health or education settings, advocacy organizations or career-changers committed to effecting change in the social conditions and well-being of diverse groups of individuals, children and families. 
 
Courses for the off-campus master of social work program take place at Anna Maria College in Paxton and will continue to be held there through this current spring semester. 
 
Wheelock is currently assessing options and will soon identify a new Worcester location in order to continue offering our human rights and justice based MSW program, said Alexandra V. Smith, director of communications and media relations for Wheelock College 
 
Anna Maria College recently launched a new masters in social work program, which is accredited by the Council on Social Work Education. Classes will start with the fall semester. 
 
AMC hosts Special Olympics games 
 
The Anna Maria College Student-Athlete Advisory Committee will host two days of regional basketball games in partnership with the Special Olympics of Massachusetts today and Feb. 12. There will be four games per day, with each game starting on the hour, beginning at noon on both days. 
 
Today, the AMCATS will welcome the COH Ducks, the Auburn Eagles, the Seven Hills Huskies and the Mass. Bandits. The public and the Anna Maria community are also encouraged to attend these free events. There will be music, giveaways, contests and fun for the whole family throughout each day. 
 
Documentary on Market Basket at Assumption 
 
Assumption Colleges MBA program will sponsor a screening of Food Fight: Inside the Battle for Market Basket at 7 p.m. Feb. 6 in Kennedy 112 at Assumption College, 500 Salisbury St., Worcester. Tom Bennett, the producer of the movie, will be in attendance to answer questions after the screening. 
 
"Food Fight" is the story of the battle to save Market Basket and about the power of ordinary, passionate people to rewrite corporate history. 
 
The event is free. 
 
HC prof named Regis president 
 
The Rev. Thomas Worcester, S.J., professor of history at the College of the Holy Cross, will become the 11th president of Regis College, the Jesuit Faculty of Theology at the University of Toronto and one of North America's Roman Catholic ecclesiastical faculties. 
 
He will begin his five-year term on Aug. 1, prior to the 2017-2018 academic year.</TEXT>
