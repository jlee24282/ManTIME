<TITLE>Eric Jamal - Stoopid Wrist</TITLE>
<TEXT>Buffalo, New York isn't exactly known as a rap hub, and Eric Jamal is well aware, describing his hometown as "a forgotten city." Jamal, who describes himself as an artist, director, and producer, is ready to put on for his city that lives in the shadows of NYC, delivering "Stoopid Wrist," which sounds somewhere between NY nostalgia and current Atlanta trap. It's an effective combo, and one that finds strength in Jamal's hypnotically repetitive hook. 

Listen to more of Eric Jamal's music on his official SoundCloud account. Let us know what you think of him so far in the comments below. 

Quotable Lyrics: 

My wrist be movin' stupid 
I know how to move it 
I can not trust no bitch 
'Cause all these hoes be choosey 
You be trynna ride my wave 
But your ass still cruisin'</TEXT>
