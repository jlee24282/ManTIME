<content type="str">Buffalo, New York isn&apos;t exactly known as a rap hub, and Eric Jamal is well aware, describing his hometown as &quot;a forgotten city.&quot; Jamal, who describes himself as an artist, director, and producer, is ready to put on for his city that lives in the shadows of NYC, delivering &quot;Stoopid Wrist,&quot; which sounds somewhere between NY nostalgia and current Atlanta trap. It&apos;s an effective combo, and one that finds strength in Jamal&apos;s hypnotically repetitive hook.Â

Quotable Lyrics: 

My wrist be movin&apos; stupid 
I know how to move it 
I can not trust no bitch 
&apos;Cause all these hoes be choosey 
You be trynna ride my wave 
But your ass still cruisin&apos;</content>
