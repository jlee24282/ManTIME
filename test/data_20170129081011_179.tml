Arsenal have made it comfortably through to the last 16 of the FA Cup, following a 5-nil victory against League Cup finalists Southampton with Theo Walcott scoring a hat-trick to go with Danny Welbeckâ€™s first-half brace. 
 

 
Welbeck, starting for the first time since a knee injury in May, put the Gunners in control of the match with two neat finishes inside the first 22 minutes. 
 

 
The 26-year-old striker then set up Walcott who gave Arsenal a 3-nil lead before halftime, with a simple close-range strike. 
 

 
The Gunners, with manager Arsene Wenger watching from the stands due to a touchline ban, kept pressing for more goals after the break, and it paid off as Walcott completed his treble to help his side outclass Southampton at St Mary&apos;s.</content>
