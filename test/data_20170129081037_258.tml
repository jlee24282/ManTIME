<TEXT type="str">Washington, January 29 ( QNA ) - A US judge has issued a stay temporarily halting the deportation of visa holders or refugees under an executive order from President Donald Trump. 
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed a legal case early on Saturday in response to the order. 
The judge&apos;s stay prevents those &quot;caught up&quot; in the aftermath from being deported, the ACLU said. 
The group estimates that between 100 and 200 people were being detained at airports or in transit, according to the (BBC). 
Trump&apos;s executive order, signed on Friday, halted the entire US refugee programme and also instituted a 90-day travel ban for nationals from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. ( QNA ) The ruling, from US District Judge Ann Donnelly, prevented the removal from the US of people with approved refugee applications, valid visas, and &quot;other individuals... legally authorised to enter the United States&quot;.
