<TEXT type="str">ATHENS， Jan. 28 (Xinhua) -- When humanity and selflessness surpass any kind of adversity， even the hardest one， then there is hope.

In the Greek sports scene， two of the most intense rivals are Olympiacos and Panathinaikos. Whether in football， basketball， volleyball or even polo and chess， the &quot;reds&quot; and the &quot;greens&quot; often far exceed the limits of fair athletic rivalry.

For seven years now， the president of Olympiacos is Evangelos Marinakis， who from the moment of taking over the club， has offered humanitarian support to many social initiatives.

For the seventh consecutive year， Olympiacos FC made its visit to the Association of Friends of Children with Cancer &quot;ELPIDA&quot;.

Headed by Marinakis， the entire football squad and coaching staff visited the Children&apos;s Oncology Unit &quot;Marianna V. Vardinogiannis - ELPIDA to offer their moral and financial support to the Association of Friends of Children with Cancer， reinforcing thus the huge endeavor taking place to help children in need.</TEXT>
