<content type="str">For more than five decades, St. Pius X School in Westerly has educated children in the teachings of Christ and the Church and has helped children to form a lifelong relationship with Christ. During that time, St. Pius X School has reached out to all families with a goal of making Catholic education attainable. We are a school where families and children of all faiths are welcomed and educational needs are met: a school where families are active participants in the education of their children, and a school where the community members support both religious and educational goals. 
 
Students need to be prepared to live a life enriched by the teachings of Christ and to integrate these skills into college and career readiness. Our mission is to carry on this rich Catholic tradition in times that are economically challenging while meeting the educational challenges of the 21st-century. How do we carry out this mission? 
 
The ways and teachings of Jesus Christ are modeled in an environment where students demonstrate their knowledge of Catholic teachings, their growth in faith and their willingness to serve others. Students will grow academically, display critical thinking skills and use technology as a learning tool.

After careful study of research-based programs, we at St. Pius X have embarked upon restructuring our school program both academically and economically. In our rebranding we are changing our name to better represent the school and services provided. St. Pius X School will be changed to St. Pius X Regional Academy. Regional reflects the many communities and parishes we serve. Academy reflects the personalizing, specializing and spiritualizing of the educational program. 
 
The restructuring of the academic programs will begin with the implementation of a principal/academic dean leadership program. This new model directly benefits every member of our community. The academic dean will work directly with classroom teachers focusing on curriculum development, data analysis and instruction. Through a personalized, specialized and spiritualized education, we educate the child in mind, body and spirit. 
 
Through the implementation of lead teachers and peer coaching, we will personalize and specialize the educational process. We will continue to meet the needs of all students by adding a math specialist to expand our math curriculum to include algebra 1, which will prepare students to enter grade 9 with the option of taking geometry or algebra 2. One of the responsibilities of the math specialist will be to work with teachers in grades 5 to 8 to implement the diocesan math curriculum. We will also be adding a Spanish curriculum for students in grades K to 8. The diocesan integrated curriculum will complement the STREAM (science, technology, religion, engineering, arts and mathematics) program. “Bring Your Own Device” (ex. Chromeboook) will be implemented in grades 5 to 8. 
 
It is our goal to keep Catholic education affordable. To that end we are implementing a tuition freeze. Sibling discount and financial assistance will also be available. For the long-term sustainability of our academy, it is imperative that we have the support of both individual benefactors and local businesses. We do not benefit from tax money. We rely solely on tuition, fundraisers and some subsidies from local Catholic parishes. In order to maintain our tradition of excellence, we are asking individuals and businesses to consider supporting us through sustained charitable giving. 
 
Through God’s blessings we are able to teach students about his great love for us and how we can better serve others. Please visit our website at westerlystpiusxschool.org or call or for an appointment to visit our academy.
