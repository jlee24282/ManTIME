<TEXT type="str">Tiny crappie jigs are highly effective trolling lures for locating crappies in deep water in winter. Frank Sargeant    
Crappies are not hard to catch if you know where to find them. The problem often is finding them--with the traditional method of lowering live minnows around channel edges and underwater structure, it&apos;s possible to go all day and never hit that motherlode of keepers, particularly in cold weather. 
 
Trolling, on the other hand, allows covering lots of water and hopefully by the law of averages eventually coming across that big school of keeper-size crappies that will fill the cooler. Guide Mark Collins at Weiss Lake, among other experts, frequently relies on the tactic at this time of year. 
 
Crappies for the most part hang out in deeper water during the winter in North Alabama, typically suspending in tight schools at depths of 12 to 16 feet, often off the edge of river ledges or where blackwater creeks dump into the main lakes. 
 
They have to eat, and so they&apos;re often found close to balls of shad or other bait. The shad are easier to see than the crappies on a sonar--they often form schools that stretch for many yards, making an obvious cloud on the depthfinder screen. 
 
Areas where there are several of these schools are made to order for winter trolling. The trick is choosing the right weight of lure and the right gear so that it gets down to the fish. Crappies don&apos;t generally eat large baits--jigs of 1/8 to 1/32 ounce, tipped with tiny soft plastics from 2 to 2.5 inches long, are pretty much the universal lures for trolling. 
 
The right speed is critical--most gasoline outboards won&apos;t idle slowly enough to allow crappie trolling. An electric trolling motor, set at a power that produces 1 to 2 mph--about half of walking speed--is a part of success. (The GPS systems on most sonars these days will accurately measure speeds as low as you care to go, and allow you to repeat that speed both upwind and down.) 
 
So is combining lure, line weight and line length to put the lure down where the fish are. The lighter the line and the more that&apos;s let out, the deeper a given lure will run. Six-pound-test gets deeper than 8 at the same speed and distance from the boat. 
 
Most crappie trolling experts put out a spread of four to six rods, each with a slightly different offering set at a different depth. Bladed baits like the RoadRunner--a winter favorite--run a bit shallower than straight jigs like the Gene Larew or those from Wally Marshall. 
 
Color matters with crappies. Some days they want only white-and-chartreuse, other days only black-and-chartreuse, some days pearl-and-blue. It&apos;s a good idea to set out a selection of colors, then switch all the rods to the color that produces first. 
 
Once you see that one rod is producing with a given lure weight, color and line length, all the rigs can be set out at that length and you can get down to the work of filling the cooler. 
 
When the bite slows down in trolling, it&apos;s also possible to use the sonar to get right on top of the school, anchor and drop live minnows down to just above the crappies. On a big school, it usually doesn&apos;t take long to finish off the 30-fish limit with this tactic. 
 
Trolling is not only a winter tactic, but it also works in early spring as the fish begin their move towards the shallows to spawn. And, it becomes effective again in summer as the shallows heat up, pushing the fish back to the channel edges.</TEXT>
