<content type="str">Kolkata (West Bengal)[India], Jan. 29 : Former Indian cricketer Sachin Tendulkar on Sunday flagged off the inaugural edition of IDBI Federal Life Insurance Kolkata Full Marathon, which will have 8,000 participants across three events.

The face of the event, Tendulkar urged the people to come out and start running for a healthy living.

&quot;Thousands turned up to make this event successful. I would like to applaud their effort and their commitment. It was nice to see many women competing hard. This has a positive effect on life, and basic idea of having a marathon like that to encourage people to run and enjoy good health,&quot; he told the media here.

Tendulkar added that with health challenges, life become difficult and it doesn&apos;t give a person reason to smile.

Citing example of the modern day Team India under Virat Kohli, Tendulkar said it&apos;s their fitness regime that has made them one of the best fielding sides in the world.

The full marathon began at 5 a.m. and half marathon at 6.30 a.m. and about 8,000 people ran in this inaugural edition. (ANI)
