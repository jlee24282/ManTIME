<TEXT type="str">California quarterback Davis Webb passed for 165 yards and one touchdown and earned MVP honors on Saturday as the South recorded a 16-15 victory over the North in the Senior Bowl at Mobile, Ala. 

Webb completed 11 of 16 passes, including a 39-yard scoring pass to Texas AM receiver Josh Reynolds. North Carolina State running back Matthew Dayes added a 2-yard touchdown run for the South. 

Toledo running back Kareem Hunt rushed for 118 yards on 15 carries and was named the North&apos;s Most Outstanding Player. Pittsburgh quarterback Nate Peterman was 16-of-23 passing for 153 yards and one touchdown. 

Peterman tossed a 6-yard touchdown pass to East Carolina wideout Zay Jones with 1:51 remaining to pull the North within one point. The North went for two points and the lead but Peterman&apos;s throw was intercepted by Brigham Young linebacker Harvey Langi. 

&quot;To say you can drive down and win the Senior Bowl in the last seconds, that would have been pretty cool,&quot; Peterman said. &quot;We didn&apos;t get it but it was a great experience still.&quot; 

The North&apos;s other nine points were courtesy of three field goals by Arizona State&apos;s Zane Gonzalez. Saint Francis (Pa.) linebacker Lorenzo Jerome -- an FCS standout -- intercepted two passes and forced a fumble. 

Meanwhile, Reynolds caught six passes for 96 yards after meshing well in the week-long practice sessions with Webb. 

&quot;I told Josh (Friday) night, &apos;You were my favorite outside receiver all week. If we get 1 on 1, I&apos;m going your way so you&apos;d better win,&apos;&quot; Webb said. &quot;And he did. He won multiple times.&quot; 

Hue Jackson and the Cleveland Browns&apos; coaching staff guided the South squad, while John Fox and the Chicago Bears&apos; coaches led the North.

Afghanistan&apos;s Defense Ministry says it wants to raise the number of women serving in the Afghan National Army to a level where women comprise 10 percent of the force. 

Defense Ministry spokesman Mohammad Radmanesh said on January 27 that the government had set several measures, including a special salary scale for female recruits, to encourage more women to join up. 

&apos;At this stage, we have 1,575 Afghan women in our army ranks, it is a mere 3 to 4 percent -- which is nothing,&apos; Radmanesh said. &apos;We are aiming to raise this percentage to 10 percent.&apos; 

Radmanesh said there currently were about 400 Afghan women recruits training at Defense Ministry facilities. 

Women serving in the military is a controversial topic in conservative Afghanistan.
