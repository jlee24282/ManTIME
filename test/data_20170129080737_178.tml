<TITLE>Webb named MVP as South beats North in Senior Bowl</TITLE>
<TEXT>California quarterback Davis Webb passed for 165 yards and one touchdown and earned MVP honors on Saturday as the South recorded a 16-15 victory over the North in the Senior Bowl at Mobile, Ala. 

Webb completed 11 of 16 passes, including a 39-yard scoring pass to Texas AM receiver Josh Reynolds. North Carolina State running back Matthew Dayes added a 2-yard touchdown run for the South. 

Toledo running back Kareem Hunt rushed for 118 yards on 15 carries and was named the North's Most Outstanding Player. Pittsburgh quarterback Nate Peterman was 16-of-23 passing for 153 yards and one touchdown. 

Peterman tossed a 6-yard touchdown pass to East Carolina wideout Zay Jones with 1:51 remaining to pull the North within one point. The North went for two points and the lead but Peterman's throw was intercepted by Brigham Young linebacker Harvey Langi. 

"To say you can drive down and win the Senior Bowl in the last seconds, that would have been pretty cool," Peterman said. "We didn't get it but it was a great experience still." 

The North's other nine points were courtesy of three field goals by Arizona State's Zane Gonzalez. Saint Francis (Pa.) linebacker Lorenzo Jerome -- an FCS standout -- intercepted two passes and forced a fumble. 

Meanwhile, Reynolds caught six passes for 96 yards after meshing well in the week-long practice sessions with Webb. 

"I told Josh (Friday) night, 'You were my favorite outside receiver all week. If we get 1 on 1, I'm going your way so you'd better win,'" Webb said. "And he did. He won multiple times." 

Hue Jackson and the Cleveland Browns' coaching staff guided the South squad, while John Fox and the Chicago Bears' coaches led the North.

Afghanistan's Defense Ministry says it wants to raise the number of women serving in the Afghan National Army to a level where women comprise 10 percent of the force. 

Defense Ministry spokesman Mohammad Radmanesh said on January 27 that the government had set several measures, including a special salary scale for female recruits, to encourage more women to join up. 

'At this stage, we have 1,575 Afghan women in our army ranks, it is a mere 3 to 4 percent -- which is nothing,' Radmanesh said. 'We are aiming to raise this percentage to 10 percent.' 

Radmanesh said there currently were about 400 Afghan women recruits training at Defense Ministry facilities. 

Women serving in the military is a controversial topic in conservative Afghanistan.
