<content type="str">TWIN FALLS, Idaho (KMVT/KSVT) Lathan McKay and Scott Truax found the original X21 Sky Cycle from Evel Knievel&apos;s snake river jump in a pawn shop in Canada. 
  
The guy who was holding it wanted $1 million for it. They were able to talk him down a bit. 
 
They will put it in the Evel Knievel thrill show museum in Topeka, Kansas. The Sky Cycle will go with a scale model of the jump. They are using some of the original ramp and they want some of the original dirt. 
 
&quot;Everything we have is authentic and actual dirt and soil and rocks from the actual launch site to complete the job,&quot; McKay said. 
 
McKay and Truax are talking with the Parks and Rec department to get the okay to take a small amount of dirt. The museum is set to open this summer. Along with that exhibit they plan to have a plaque explaining what happened in Twin Falls and that the dirt was from there. 
 
At the museum they plan to have a portion dedicated to science, technology, engineering and math, or STEM, education for children. They say that should be easy considering that Evel Knievel wasn&apos;t the only hero of his stunts. 
 
&quot;The other hero of the story was the rocket and Iâ€™m excited to be able to hopefully excite a new generation of kids to be interested in science technology and rocketry because we need those things,&quot; Truax said. 
 
They are also excited to share with the next generation the things that they looked up to about Knievel. 
 
&quot;I want my children to believe and know that they can do anything they set their minds to and Evel will always be a representation of that,&quot; Truax said. 
 
The pair have a documentary about Knievel&apos;s son called &quot;Chasing Evel&quot; debuting on Feb. 19 in the Big Sky Film Festival. They also will have a theatrical movie coming out about Eddie Braun&apos;s jump over the Snake River Canyon in September. They said they have footage of the jump that has not been released yet. 
 
The two have been involved in multiple movies about Knievel. They love sharing what they can about him and his message. 
 
&quot;it&apos;s just about living your dreams, never giving up and seeing things through. That&apos;s it for me,&quot; McKay said.</content>
