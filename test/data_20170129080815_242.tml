<TEXT type="str">• The ‘Wonder Women’ of the Baroque Age is a public talk that Sandra Mifsud Bonnici will deliver on Thursday at 6.30pm at the premises of Din l-Art Ħelwa, 133, Melita Street, Valletta. Women in 18th-century Malta were under the control of husbands, brothers, fathers or even sons. Yet a substantial number of these women managed to overcome the restrictions imposed on them by law and society. Ms Mifsud Bonnici is a senior lecturer in Systems of Knowledge at the Junior College. The talk is being held in collaboration with the University of Malta’s International Institute for Baroque Studies. Admission is free but donations to Din l-Art Ħelwa would be appreciated. 
 
• A sale of publications at bargain prices on Malta’s cultural, historic, architectural, artistic and environmental patrimony will be held by Din l-Art Ħelwa at Old Bakery Street, corner with 133, Melita Street, Valletta, on Friday and Saturday from 9.30am to 4pm and next Sunday from 9.30am to 1pm.
