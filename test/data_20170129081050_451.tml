<content type="str">BOULDER, Colo. Derrick White scored 17 of his 23 points in the second half, keying Colorado&apos;s 74-65 upset of No. 10 Oregon that snapped the Ducks&apos; 17-game winning streak on Saturday night. 
 
Xavier Johnson added 13 points as the Buffaloes (12-10, 2-7 Pac-12) kept the Ducks winless in seven trips all-time in Boulder. 
 
Payton Pritchard&apos;s 19 points led the Ducks (19-3, 8-1), who lost for the first time since Nov. 21 against Georgetown. 
 
White had a pair of 3-pointers early in the second half that put the Buffaloes ahead 45-39 while Colorado&apos;s stifling defense was keeping the Ducks out of rhythm at the other end of the court. And he had a 3-pointer, a three-point play and two free throws in an 11-1 run that gave Colorado a 64-52 lead. 
 
The Buffs are just the third team to top 70 points against the Oregon this season.</content>
