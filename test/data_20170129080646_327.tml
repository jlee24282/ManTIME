<TEXT type="str">David Beckham has revealed he and wife Victoria used to have dates in restaurant car parks in the early days of their relationship in order to keep it a secret.

The ex-England captain opened up about his long-lasting marriage to the fashion designer and former pop star in a wide-ranging interview on the 75th anniversary edition of Desert Island Discs.

He said keeping an open dialogue was the secret to their “strong family unit”.

David, 41, said: “We all know marriage is difficult at times and it’s about working through it. We know each other better than anyone knows us. We’ve got strong parents, we were brought up with the right values. Of course you make mistake over the years. Whenever we’ve come through tough times… we talk.”

He added: “People have talked about ‘do we stay together because it’s a brand?’ Of course not, we stay together because we love each other, we stay together because we have four amazing children.

“We’re very respectful of our life. And when we do go through tough times we work through them as a family, as a unit.”

He said that when the couple first started dating they spent their dates in his “amazing bright blue” BMW in order to keep the relationship private.

“I drove down, I picked her up… we used to sit in a Harvester car park and we just used to kiss, of course, and spend time together.”

The couple married in an extravagant ceremony in 1999, with David cringing as presenter Kirsty Young recalled the lavish affair which saw the happy couple wearing purple outfits.

“That was bold,” said David. “What was I thinking?”</TEXT>
