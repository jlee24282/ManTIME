<content type="str">It’s one thing to be a shooter, but LaMelo and LiAngelo Ball are makers. 
 
LaMelo made nine 3-pointers and LiAngelo made six, totalling 33 and 32 points for the brothers, respectively, in Chino Hills 106-80 win over Wasatch Academy (UT) Saturday night in the Rolling Hills Prep State Preview at Cerritos College. 
 
Chino Hills (23-0) has now won 58 straight games dating back to last season, and notched its 13th 100-point game this season. 
 
The flair and flash of LaMelo and LiAngelo are a must-see treat for basketball junkies, but senior Elizjah Scott dazzled in his own right with 26 points, 11 rebounds and multiple dunks. 
 
“We all play hard and I just feed off the energy of my teammates,” Scott said. 
 
The Huskies never trailed in the game, and started the game on a quick 14-4 run. After a small surge from Wasatch, which is touted as the No. 1 high school boys basketball team in Utah by many rankings, more shots from beyond the arc fell from LaMelo and LiAngelo, who combined for 17 of Chino Hills’ 27 first quarter points. 
 
Scott had a run of his own to start the second quarter, scoring seven straight after a sequence that included an and-1 layup followed by back-to-back dunks that had the crowd buzzing. 
 
“What teams are ranked doesn’t matter to us, we treat every team the same,” said Scott. 
 
By halftime Chino Hills was up 60-35. 
 
The high-scoring was even more impressive Saturday night due to Chino Hills’ 124-point performance against Damien on Friday night. 
 
But scoring wasn’t the only highlight. Center Onyeka Okongwu had seven blocks in the game. 
 
“It’s my role to be the defensive leader and I will continue to do that moving forward,” Okongwu said. “We don’t feel any pressure at all (when it comes to the win streak), I’m just playing to win.” 
 
Chino Hills’ next big test will come when it faces Oak Hill (VA) on Saturday in the Nike Extravaganza at Mater Dei High School.

Santa Margarita’s (17-5) Kaden Rasheed scored a team-high 15 points to help the Eagles edge Corona Centennial 52-51. Centennial’s (17-7) Gio Nelson hit a jumpshot as time expired that appeared to be a 3-pointer to tie the game, but was called a two-point shot by the referee because his foot was on the line. Nelson led the Huskies with 15 points.
