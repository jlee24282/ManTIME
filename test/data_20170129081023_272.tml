<TITLE>Cougars chase off Bulldogs, 53-42</TITLE>
<TEXT>ELNORA  North Daviess got a game-high 21 points from Caleb Wagler Saturday night as the Cougars turned back Orleans, 53-42.

North Daviess started the season off 5-0 before injuries began to take their toll, but with everybody now back and healthy the Cougars (9-7) are rolling once again.

They have a really good team,, said Orleans coach Tom Bradley. They came out in the first quarter and hit five 3s. I think they were 5 for 5 from the 3-point line in the first four minutes. Thats tough to take when they are shooting the ball like that.

North Daviess netted 17 points in the first quarter and 15 came by way of 3-pointers.

That kind of stunned us a little bit and we did not get things going in the second quarter, Bradley said. We challenged them at halftime and got the lead down to six in the fourth quarter, but we could never hit that big shot.

Duncan Gerkin led the Bulldogs in scoring with 16.

Orleans (3-13) returns home to face Loogootee (12-6) Thursday.
