<content type="str">The Military Order of the Purple Heart (MOPH) held its first &quot;meet and greet&quot; meeting at the Montana Ale Works on Jan 21. Members are those veterans who received the Purple Heart Medal for being wounded in combat. Local attendees included working business people as well as retirees. This first local meeting spanned Purple Heart recipients from all overseas services: the U.S. Navy, U.S. Marines, U.S. Air Force and U.S. Army. At some specific time and place yet to be determined in April, there will be another meeting. Local Purple Heart recipients, whether or not they are MOPH members, are encouraged to attend that April meeting.
