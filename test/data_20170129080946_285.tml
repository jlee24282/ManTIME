The organisation helps some 3,000 people in the district every year with problems including money worries, making sure they claim the benefits they are entitled to, relationship and employment problems. To help protect the service in the future, Uttlesford Citizens Advice is looking for community-minded people to become Friends of the charity. A Friend may give a few hours of their time to participate in fundraising activities or provide financial support with a donation, big or small.
