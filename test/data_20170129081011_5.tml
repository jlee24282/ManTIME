<TEXT type="str">Ché-Lee Nel’s (10) disability hasn’t stood in the way of her recording her debut album, “Believe”. The Laerskool Rynfield learner is 100 per cent deaf in her right ear and 60 per cent deaf in her left ear.

The album, which lists 13 songs – three of which were written by the youngster – will be launched at Carnival City’s Mardi Gras Theatre on February 11.

Her mother, Chantel Blignaut, said she was initially opposed to her daughter’s dream of a career in music, due to her hearing impairment. READ: She hoped Ché-Lee would focus on modelling instead.

“We didn’t succeed at all; she’s very persistent,” said Chantel.

“She said ‘Mommy, I will do modelling, but please understand that I’m not being cheeky. I love you but this is what I want, so please don’t change me – support me for who I am’.”

Ché-Lee told her mother that she’s not disabled.

“Carnival City is a proud supporter of local, emerging talent,” said Michelle Smith, marketing manager of Carnival City.

“We consider it a privilege to host a little star with this much determination and passion.

“Ché-Lee is an inspiration and makes us look at our own lives to see where we could improve and better utilise our talents more.”

The show starts at 6.30pm.

Tickets are available through Computicket.</TEXT>
