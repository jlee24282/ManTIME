Marcie was born on July 13, 1983 to Mark and Debbie (Tank) Rolla in Watford City, ND. She attended WCHS and graduated Class of 2002. She loved high school and played on the Volleyball and Basketball teams. Marcie was an active member in FFA and won numerous awards. After High school she continued her studies at North Dakota State College of Science in Wahpeton, ND. She concluded her educational journey with a degree in Massage Therapy. Marcie enjoyed working at every job she ever had especially working with Koch Johnson. 
   
On April 17, 2004 she was blessed with her baby boy Payton Alexander Rocha. Marcie loved her son and family very much. In summer of 2016 Marcie and Payton became travel enthusiasts. Together they enjoyed the open road; the beautiful Black Hills was their favorite place to visit. The most special activity they shared together was fishing; she loved to catch and eat them, but had a hard time touching them. Payton remembers his mothers favorite shades of color are purple and red.  
   
Marcie was very creative. One of her last projects was building a walkway at her home from rock and petrified trees she had collected. Marcie had the heart and mind of an artist. She would make most of the gifts she would give at Christmas and birthdays. 
   
She was a fun and outgoing person. The word charismatic could not describe Marcie more. Marcie loved everyone she knew and if she didnt know you, she would visit with you until she did. She loved helping others and never asked for anything in return. Whenever she could, she would share love and peace to the world. 
   
Marcie is preceded in death by her paternal grandparents Garvey and Lottie (Frisinger) Rolla; her maternal grandparents George and Phyllis (Mutter) Tank; uncle Gregory Rolla and infant uncle Timothy Tank 
   
She is survived by her precious son Payton; parents Mark and Debbie Rolla; brother Chad (Heather) Rolla of Fargo and their children Kaylee and Ethan; along with aunts, uncles, numerous cousins and friends.</TEXT>
