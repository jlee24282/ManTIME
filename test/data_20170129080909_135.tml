<TEXT type="str">SUNDAY 29 JANUARY  

Connacht SFL final  
1400  Roscommon v Galway, Kiltoom 
 Action from the 2016 FBD final 
Wins over Sligo and Leitrim were enough to see the defending champions Galway reach another decider. Roscommon topped their group on scoring difference, but some cause for concern was the manner in which they shipped three goals late on to allow Mayo sneak a one-point win last weekend.   
 
That said, Rossies manager Kevin McStay is taking the positives from this campaign, insisting that his side are heading in the right direction ahead of a tough Division 1 opener away to Tyrone. 
 
Galway are among the favourites to get promotion from tier two and with the emergence of Barry McHugh, Michael Day and Killian McDaid as attacking threats, the early season vibes are good.     
 
O&apos;Byrne Cup final  
1400 Louth v Dublin, Drogheda 
 

 
It&apos;s a first O&apos;Byrne Cup decider for Louth since 2011, while Dublin are looking to regain the trophy they last captured in 2015. 
 
After the semi-final win over Meath, Louth boss was full of praise for his charges and believes they are in good shape ahead of a spring campaign in Division 3. 
 
Speaking to RTÉ Sport, he said: &quot;We have played four games in 2017 and we have won all four of them, so winning is becoming a habit with the group. Ultimately, they’re resilient, they’re driven, they’re trying to become as good as they can be. It’s a pleasure working with them. 
 
&quot;Every fellow we have in the panel is striving [to get better] and it is just a great group to work with.” 
 
Dublin have been working with a developmental squad throughout and temporary boss Paul Clarke feels that seven or eight of the players may push for places in Jim Gavin&apos;s squad for the league. 
 
Looking ahead to Sunday&apos;s final, Clarke told RTÉ Sport: &quot;Another real competitive game will bring the group on, the team on and players on another bit. For a Louth team to beat Meath [in the semi-final], that’s a great result for them, they’ll be really delighted with that. 
 
&quot;We’ll be underdogs going into it but it’s a challenge that all those guys are looking forward to.&quot; 
 
Munster SHL final   
1400  Limerick v Cork, Gaelic Grounds 
 

 
In a repeat of their clash from two weeks ago, Limerick and Cork will battle it out in the Munster SHL decider. On 15 January, Cork had 21 points to spare over their opposition - Patrick Horgan and Shane Kingston bagged two goals each as the Rebels ran riot. 
 
In other games, Kieran Kingston&apos;s side finished strongly to defeat both Waterford and Clare - ideal preparation then for the Leesiders before the competitive waters of the league&apos;s top flight. 
 
After their trimming a fortnight ago. Limerick recovered to beat Clare in a tight encounter and then had too much in hand for Kerry.         
 
Walsh Cup semi-final 
1400 Wexford v Kilkenny, New Ross 
 

 
This game will be a good test for Davy Fitzgerald&apos;s Wexford against the form team in this season&apos;s Walsh Cup. It&apos;s interesting that Fitzgerald has only used 18 players in the three January games to date. Not many from the recent Leinster U-21 winning sides are getting a look in so far. 
 
The Cats have been keeping the scoreboard operator busy in accounting for DCU, Antrim and Westmeath. Things should be a little bit tougher for them in New Ross.
