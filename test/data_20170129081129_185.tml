There was a big Facebook flap over a paid advertisement that ran in the Abilene Reporter-News on Jan. 18. It was definitely controversial, but the response on Facebook had me mystified. 
 
I worked at the Reporter-News for a couple of years and I have a unique perspective as a former employee of the paper. I sold ads in the advertising department. It was obvious there was a lot of misinformation on Facebook about how a newspaper operates. 
 
One of the first things I learned at the ARN is the editorial department is completely separate from the advertising department: editorial is upstairs, advertising is downstairs. The paper did not want even a suggestion that advertisers and their dollars spent could influence what is printed in the editorial content of the paper. It was like having two different companies in the same building. 
 
When I did see an editorial person, they were usually sprinting through the advertising department to get to the nearby bathroom! 
 
I called the woman who was, at the time, my supervisor at the paper….a Christian and a conservative. To be totally transparent, I am conservative, too. 
 
We were speculating how this ad might have been printed. We agreed there are lots of ways it could have happened. Now, I don’t know how this controversial ad actually went to print, but I can assure you the &quot;liberal editors&quot; upstairs were not responsible. Something happened in the advertising process. To suggest that this ad is an act of liberalism by the editorial staff is ludicrous and is totally against the internal policies of the paper. 
 
A lot of kind, caring, involved, giving people work at the newspaper and live in our community. Their kids play with our kids. They go to church, pray and volunteer with us. They’re our neighbors and friends. They get up every day (and night) to cover stories they think will be of interest to us. 
 
The Abilene Reporter-News also supports and sponsors many events and activities here in the Big Country. We may not agree with the editorial views, but we can certainly appreciate the local stories and events they cover and their contributions to our city. If an ad offends us, we can turn the page. If we don&apos;t agree with an editorial, we can be vocal and let them know or even write an op-ed piece like this one to express our own ideas and opinions. 
 
If you don&apos;t value our hometown newspaper, talk to someone who no longer has a newspaper in their town. 
 
When we go after the paper, we&apos;re not only hurting the newspaper, we’re hurting the hard working people there and our community. I know I want the paper to continue to be here to report on what&apos;s going on in Abilene and the Big Country. I am a conservative and I&apos;m fighting for the principle that I thought conservative people value — freedom for everyone, even if the ad they submit and pay for is stupid and disgusting. 
 
When Republicans only do business with Republicans, Democrats only do business with Democrats and Independents only do business with Independents we are no longer a community. When we only allow ideas that are the same as ours, we are losing our freedom. 
 
I stand with the Abilene Reporter- News as I would any other honest business that takes responsibility for something that happened &quot;on their watch.&quot;
