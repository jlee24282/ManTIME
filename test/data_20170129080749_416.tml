<TITLE>Sherman: 'It would be odd' if National Football League punishes Seahawks</TITLE>
<TEXT>Covered the Philadelphia Eagles for Philadelphia Magazine and Philly.com from 2008 to 2015. 
 
Seahawks coach Pete Carroll revealed on 710 ESPN Seattle's Brock and Salk Show that Sherman suffered a "legit" knee injury sometime in the middle of the season. 
 
Seattle Seahawks general manager John Schneider said Thursday the team "didn't do anything that was malicious at all" regarding cornerback Richard Sherman not being placed on the injury report this season despite a lingering knee injury. 
 
The Seahawks claim they did nothing wrong when handling Richard Sherman's injury. 
 
Sherman was never listed as having a knee issue on any of the club's injury reports. So yeah, I think Pete - it was in a press conference at the end of the season and was quite frankly was sticking up for the different bumps and bruises and issues that Richard had so I think that's why they've gone ahead with this. "But we feel like we didn't do anything that was malicious at all". Sources told ESPN's Chris Mortensen that the National Football League is considering docking the Seahawks a second-round pick as a result of not disclosing the injury. Before the Seahawks' Week 12 game, he was listed with an ankle injury. 
 
But their argument could be that Sherman's injury wasn't almost as serious as Carroll described it. 
 
"Obviously it's something I can't really get into but we feel like we didn't do anything that was out of the norm or trying to avoid any rules by any stretch of the imagination", Schneider said in an interview with Mark Dominick at the Senior Bowl on Sirius XM NFL Radio. "All [doctors] would tell you, you have to manage the player and not the MRI, the patient and not the MRI, and that's what we did. He never missed [a game or practice]". The guy was a total stud about it. It would be an elevation of the fifth-round draft choice the team had already lost for repeated violations of offseason training rules. 
 
Sherman said the Seahawks should not incur a penalty.</TEXT>
