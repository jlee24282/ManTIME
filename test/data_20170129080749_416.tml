Seahawks coach Pete Carroll revealed on 710 ESPN Seattle&apos;s Brock and Salk Show that Sherman suffered a &quot;legit&quot; knee injury sometime in the middle of the season. 
 
Seattle Seahawks general manager John Schneider said Thursday the team &quot;didn&apos;t do anything that was malicious at all&quot; regarding cornerback Richard Sherman not being placed on the injury report this season despite a lingering knee injury. 
 
The Seahawks claim they did nothing wrong when handling Richard Sherman&apos;s injury. 
 
Sherman was never listed as having a knee issue on any of the club&apos;s injury reports. So yeah, I think Pete - it was in a press conference at the end of the season and was quite frankly was sticking up for the different bumps and bruises and issues that Richard had so I think that&apos;s why they&apos;ve gone ahead with this. &quot;But we feel like we didn&apos;t do anything that was malicious at all&quot;. Sources told ESPN&apos;s Chris Mortensen that the National Football League is considering docking the Seahawks a second-round pick as a result of not disclosing the injury. Before the Seahawks&apos; Week 12 game, he was listed with an ankle injury. 
 
But their argument could be that Sherman&apos;s injury wasn&apos;t almost as serious as Carroll described it. 
 
&quot;Obviously it&apos;s something I can&apos;t really get into but we feel like we didn&apos;t do anything that was out of the norm or trying to avoid any rules by any stretch of the imagination&quot;, Schneider said in an interview with Mark Dominick at the Senior Bowl on Sirius XM NFL Radio. &quot;All [doctors] would tell you, you have to manage the player and not the MRI, the patient and not the MRI, and that&apos;s what we did. He never missed [a game or practice]&quot;. The guy was a total stud about it. It would be an elevation of the fifth-round draft choice the team had already lost for repeated violations of offseason training rules. 
 
Sherman said the Seahawks should not incur a penalty.</TEXT>
