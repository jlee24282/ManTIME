<TITLE>French Left picks presidential candidate as Socialist rebel faces ex PM Valls</TITLE>

Hamon, who is often compared to British Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn , is favourite to beat Valls in the primary's head-to-head vote, but has little chance of winning the presidential race proper after five years of unpopular Socialist rule.</TEXT>
