<TEXT type="str">&quot;Snatch the red packet” is fast becoming the popular way to send blessings and traditional red packets to family and friends during Spring Festival. 

On WeChat, China’s major instant messaging app, one can send an electronic red packet containing money and a message. If it’s sent in a group chat, only the first few people who open it can get the money, so the faster you tap the message, the better chance you get the money. 

The latest data shows a total of 14.2 billion red packets (known as &quot;hongbao&quot; in Chinese) were sent and received through WeChat on Lunar New Year Eve alone, up by 75.7 percent over the past year. 

Some 340 million users, also a record high, shared red packets on QQ, another social media platform under Tencent. 

&quot;We chose to send red packets this year instead of setting off fireworks, it&apos;s really joyful and festive! It also brings in the atmosphere of the New Year, we&apos;re very happy,&quot; said a resident, surnamed Yao. 

In fact, it is not important how much the red packet is, the important thing is the blessing and appreciation sent with the red packet. Family and friends become closer through snatching red packets and enjoying the Chinese New Year, expressing their love to each other. 

One Nanjing resident, surnamed Yang, said he snatched about 100 to 200 yuan on the Chinese Lunar New Year. 

&quot;Most of my friends and colleagues were snatching the red packets, and they couldn&apos;t stop. As everyone says, now is the era of the internet, plus red packets, in fact, the internet has linked us closer and lets us feel the atmosphere of the New Year,&quot; he said. 

&quot;So happy, our whole family enjoys the happiness. We are too old to go out this year, so we chose to send and snatch red packets to have New Year&apos;s celebrations with our family and friends, and give our regards to each other,&quot; another man surnamed Yang. 

Another trend is seeing more and more people this year send their holiday cheer by recording videos and sending them to relatives and friends.</TEXT>
