<TITLE>Dad wont put mom with dementia in a care facility</TITLE>
<TEXT>Q: My parents are in their 80s. They have always had a loving relationship. Mom has dementia and dad is her caregiver. He is refusing to put her into a home and his health is taking a turn. He has been able to take care of her to this point, but now it just is too much. How do I get him to let go? 
 
A: You are probably speaking of a long-standing marriage, likely of more than 50 years and your father is being a good husband to his wife. The thought of losing her or seeing deterioration in her care is so far a greater burden than being her caregiver. 
 
At the same time, you are trying to be a supportive daughter with due concern for the well being of your father. These are challenging times and altogether too common. 
 
From your father's perspective, his care for your mother may be well worth the sacrifice of his own well being, even if unbearable for yourself. While you can't necessarily get him to do anything, you may be able to influence him with regard to his decisions. 
 
Influencing starts with empathy. However, rather than empathizing about the difficulties in caring for his wife, you can empathize with him in losing her to this dreaded disease. You can also marvel at and appreciate his devotion to your mother. 
 
In establishing an empathetic relationship, then you can discuss care options that could be consistent with his love for your mother and consistent with his expectations of her care. You can research and introduce your father to the various care options so he is well informed. The strategy is to help him improve her care without necessarily replacing him. 
 
Care options may include home-care, respite care or placement in a care facility. Your father will need to know the details of each and every option and how that enhances your mother's life and what role he can play in their ongoing relationship. He feels responsible for her well being and needs to feel useful to her. 
 
With whichever option he may choose, he will need to be front and centre in terms of viewing the service delivery until such time as he gains confidence in the standard of care. 
 
Your local Alzheimer Society and local CCAC (Community Care Access Centre) will be among your best resources at this time.</TEXT>
