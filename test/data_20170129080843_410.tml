The containers are mainly filled with electronic products as well as some subsistence goods. 

The Chengdu-Europe Express began operation in April 26, 2013. With the thorough implementation of the &quot;Belt and Road&quot; strategy, the operation frequency has increased from one train per week to one to two trains per day. 

In 2017, products including flowers, plants and toys have begun shipping to Europe, and the frequency of shipment is expected to further increase to two to three trains on a daily average.</TEXT>
