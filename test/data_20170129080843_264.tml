<TEXT type="str">As thousands around the country remain protesting at major airports in response to Donald Trump&apos;s sudden and shocking &quot;muslim ban,&quot; causing even dual citizens and green card holders to be detained upon returning to the country, Ivanka Trump continues to display her wealth, disconnect, and utter tone-deafness towards the American people her father had promised to lead. Rather than choosing right now to post a forced-smile selfie with your equally as soulless husband, maybe you could have, oh I don&apos;t know, NOTÂ HAVE? Yes, you get to go to a fancy party in a tinfoil dress while refugees and yes, in fact, LEGAL immigrants are currently terrified for their lives.
