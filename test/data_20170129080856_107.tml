Five people were injured when a staircase collapsed at an Edenbridge golf club. 
 
Emergency crews were called to the Kent and Surrey Golf and Country Club at about 3.45pm yesterday. 
 
According to South East Coast Ambulance Service three people were taken to hospital while two others were treated on the scene at Crouch House Road. 
 
The staircase is understood to have been outside the club but no further details have been made public at present. 
 
No one at the club was available for comment this morning. 
 
A Kent Fire and Rescue spokesman said: &quot;KFRS was called to initial reports of persons trapped under a collapsed concrete staircase at a sports club in Crouch House Road, Edenbridge. 
 
&quot;Four fire engines were initially deployed, but further updates from the scene revealed no persons trapped, so one fire engine was sent in support of South East Coast Ambulance Service. Our crew assisted with casualty care, making the scene safe and assisting Kent Police with their investigation of the circumstances.
