Australian Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop says the best days of the Australia-US alliance lie ahead after Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull spoke with US President Donald Trump. 
 
Ms Bishop was tight lipped about the details of the prime minister&apos;s phone call with the president other than saying it was a &quot;very positive discussion about a whole range of issues&quot;.

Trump &apos;to honour Australian refugee deal&apos; 
 
The Trump administration will honour the refugee resettlement deal Australia struck with former US President Obama. 
    
She declined to say if the asylum seeker deal brokered between Mr Turnbull and former US president Barack Obama last year would stand despite Mr Trump&apos;s harsh new actions on refugees and citizens of Iran, Iraq, Syria and four other mostly Muslim nations. 
 
But it is understood Mr Trump assured Mr Turnbull that the refugee arrangement between the two countries would stand under his presidency. 
 
&quot;I won&apos;t go into the details of the prime minister&apos;s conversation with President Trump and will allow the prime minister to make any announcements,&quot; Ms Bishop told reporters at the G&apos;day USA gala in Hollywood on Saturday. 
 
&quot;But we have a very positive relationship with the Trump administration. 
 
&quot;I&apos;ve had two very constructive conversations with Vice President (Mike) Pence and I know the prime minister was pleased with the outcome of the discussion he had with the president today.&quot; 
 
Mr Trump has been condemned by many quarters for his move on Friday to temporarily halt refugees and the flow of citizens from the seven nations to the US. 
 
It has led to travellers being detained at airports in the US, sparking mass protest rallies. 
 
&quot;The Australian government will continue to work closely with the Trump administration so we could both implement strong border policies,&quot; Ms Bishop replied when asked about the US president&apos;s crackdown. 
 
&quot;We share a common view on many issues so we will continue to work very closely with the Trump administration.&quot; 
 
Ms Bishop said that would include Mr Turnbull travelling to the US on a yet to be decided date to meet with Mr Trump. 
 
The positive stance comes despite Mr Trump withdrawing the US from the Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade deal with Australia and 10 other Pacific countries last week. 
 
&quot;The very best days of the Australia-US relationship lie ahead,&quot; she said.
