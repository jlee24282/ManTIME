<TEXT type="str">In a setback to Indian Oil Corp (IOC), the Odisha government has slapped a notice seeking withdrawal of fiscal incentives given to the PSU&apos;s Rs 34,555 crore Paradip refinery in the state. In the December 29 notice, Odisha government has asked why the fiscal incentives like 11-year deferment of sales tax on petroleum products sold in the state should not be withdrawn considering that the refinery was delayed by over six years. Sources said the state government had in February 2004 signed an agreement with IOC to give fiscal incentives for setting up a 9 million tonnes a year oil refinery at Paradip by 2009-10. However, the project was delayed and started only in early 2016. The delay is now being cited by Odisha to seek withdrawal of the incentives, they said, adding the state government feels the delay has pushed back the payback time of deferred taxes by few years. Also, the state government says that the refinery was originally planned for a 9 million tonnes per annum capacity .</TEXT>
