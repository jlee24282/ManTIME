&quot;A happy mind is the secret for a good mark sheet,&quot; the Prime Minister said. When a student is under tension, knowledge takes a back seat. &quot;Do not let that happen,&quot; he told students. 
 
It is important to study to gain knowledge and not marks, he said. For a student, studying for marks is limiting. &quot;It is important to study for knowledge,&quot; he added. 
 
To the parents, he said, &quot;I urge parents to accept rather than expect. Our expectations from our children should not get heavy&quot;. 
 
In view of the coming assembly elections in five states, the government had approached the Election Commission seeking clearance for the programme as the Model Code of Conduct is in force in the five states. Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Goa, Uttarakhand and Manipur go to polls between February 4 and March 8. The results will be declared on March 11. 
 
The board exams begin on March 9 -- a day after the assembly elections end.</content>
