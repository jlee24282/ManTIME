<content type="str">Red Sox Bruins and patriots Celtics. About them all. He put guard. Twin forces and the new England sports continues so yeah. The card is. Network. I&apos;ve final hour of the show on it till 6 o&apos;clock. Leading you into Saturday&apos;s stage and net. There is some news I guess Bruins related I didn&apos;t put in the trendy now I did so to mention it. While I read it on Twitter during the last dollar song gimme again right now Steve Conroy the Boston Harold. Is reporting that Brad marsh and has pulled out of the fastest skater competition. I is believed to be nurse and some sort of lower body injury but mushy and will compete. In knee line shooting competition. Not social arm and be watching this bank and I blood. If you&apos;re gonna pull out Brad mosh and from me are people sell pot of the fastest skater competition men. I&apos;m fine if he is to present some Bible lower body injury I would actually just hope that he didn&apos;t even lace them up. I know there are a lot of people boss and that like to see their play is. And and the they&apos;d guys in this town represented team on that stage with those are all stars I understand but if you have some type injury. What&apos;s about to happen the next couple months this organization is a lot more important than what&apos;s gonna happen tonight and tomorrow and Los Angeles itself. Brad my share lower body injury. He will not be in the fastest skater competition he was. Originally scheduled to be but I he will be taken pot and some of the other stuff going on tonight. An NHL all star skills competition but back to football back to Super Bowl 51. I&apos;m taking your phone calls up until 6 o&apos;clock 61777979837. Let&apos;s go to Dave down McCain puts update. It would go on daily ya I wanna get it what you suitable opt in July up. I mean that&apos;s going to be to keep its air Brees talked about the patriot defense personally let our pets I think it&apos;s completely opposite. How that line could hold up against it deep sense of what to reaches opposite it was good dictate. How did defense played the game with a simple bolt they lost they gave up. Seventeen and 21. Didn&apos;t come to the table I&apos;m saying at the author it comes to the table Bree gets protected. I mean I&apos;m not saying the blow all acts you can win by ten. And I&apos;ll look at. That&apos;s why when Houston came and everybody was talking off. I thought that was a good thing to my dog that looked across playoff schemes that would the past deep and so what from the port yeah. Wanting to skip the ball. He&apos;d ended its role atop the giants Seattle banged up but I would look at that deep threats against the soft it&apos;s. You know what Seattle has banged up. Invention called Dave I I I still. I still don&apos;t wanna see Seattle and the Super Bowl not that I would be shouldn&apos;t have pick and Seattle to win that game over the patriots if they did advanced. Additional bowl. But you know that&apos;s not a defense to a defense that I didn&apos;t wanna see. They still have big time plays on that defense that Nellie did do some things dramatically in May begin Brady fades but to your original point. When you look back at previous super. Bowls and the games that may be Tom Brady . You know was having some issues moving the ball on the field it was because there are guys in his face all night long and it&apos;s obvious how do you prevent that Waltz the guys up front. And I think it&apos;s obvious that the blueprint that we should call it to be competitive. Against the patriots in a playoff game aren&apos;t Super Bowl is to get their quarterback to get to Tom Britt. Now when you look at what Atlanta&apos;s done in the last two games they&apos;ve been able to. Now meg quarterbacks run around. In Russell Wilson Aaron Rodgers granted that I enjoy running around shall. But I think they had to do it a little bit more at least in the first half and those two games than they would&apos;ve liked. And I think that&apos;s a credit. It would let you have to give some credit toward Atlanta&apos;s been able to do defensively the last two games or idea as much as I should -- knock on and knocked him and Atlanta&apos;s defense a shot this one. You do have to acknowledge what they were able to do against Seattle against green very. But I think you also need to look at the offensive line is that we&apos;re going up against Seattle&apos;s offensive line very well documented. They had major issues all season long Green Bay from the get called it offensive line injuries right. And also the fact that it was an Atlanta it&apos;s just committee what the patriots offensive line what they&apos;ve been able to do once again. Being healthy and having Dante Scarnecchia Iran on the show without offensive line. They have obviously given Brady. The type of protection that he needs it really get a quarterback needs to have success at this level but there are a lot of quarterbacks that even where it. Protection in the pocket still. Cannot be elite still can not. I guess whether this on the losing their best receiver lose in the one of the best tight ends in the game Tom Brady can&apos;t because they do have other weapons okay. And at. I just feel like if the patriots offensive line. And look like it&apos;s look like most of this season the point where we&apos;re not talking about on the date of the super ball and guess what. The patrons are gonna put up at least 35 points against this falcons defense that statistically. Is one of the worst pass defense is all of football they lost their best cornerback couple weeks to go and troop thought he had surgery. I want about a month ago and not I just think the pitchers are gonna do some things. To prevent. The falcons they got some big bodies that had some speed up front I get that I sought at the last two weeks. What did guy at this point you gotta believe and what the patriots have done would help the offensive line. For the most spot to be able to prevent the other team from get to Tom Brady now that Houston and at the last couple called talked about. Early on at least the first pass to Damian cloudy look like he had his way. But that should dating club I mean I&apos;ve guys a physical beast you can give me that the sack numbers in the post season all you law. But there isn&apos;t anybody on that Atlanta Falcons . Defects that is this theory as to Davy club does not bode record try to give convincing interests because that&apos;s the does away so all. Look I I just don&apos;t I don&apos;t think Atlanta&apos;s defense has what it takes to be able to give Tom Brady . The type of fit that you need to give him. The basically be competitive and this one I I just I think Matt Ryan&apos;s gonna have to basically be perfect to keep up or break. And that&apos;s remaining you get into prison pitcher&apos;s defense I would think that bill Belichick&apos;s product yet they get two weeks to prepare for Matt Ryan. And they gonna do shop and they&apos;ve got a coach summed it up early on this game whether it&apos;s a Logan Ryan blitzed. You know coming from the backside. All what are its mix in some things up with the linebackers. Now create some confusion up front and it got to do something like that. To force Matt Ryan to get the happy feet could throw a couple bad balls and a and a shoot the ball plays he&apos;s never bad to make some bad decisions. And then Brady just gonna take advantage of a pass defense that I just don&apos;t think he&apos;s going to be able to stop and that&apos;s why I think that&apos;s polishing distinct plan out. And that&apos;s how I see the patriots win and and win big 617. 77979837. Let&apos;s go to Sean in Foxborough what&apos;s up John. Hey are you don&apos;t put out good what&apos;s going. The guy you know the craps and bill which just you know years ahead of the league. So why not consider. Trading grew up below an equal rock economical source a couple Shaq around here&apos;s. And whatever else changed we might throw in because we&apos;ve proved we can win without doubt. I think the trading Barack apple always completely on the table. Ideas ideas. And you tossing Glock because we showed. We can win without them and then we can&apos;t count didn&apos;t really quite a course gonna happen replaced Brady. But if we get you know on number four as far as Tek was somebody coming up the line. If Belichick knows who&apos;s coming out of high school who&apos;s gonna beat that number one pick entry or. Well let me ask you is if you&apos;re gonna UPS and you want to trade garrote below and on talent right now I think that&apos;s gonna be on the table next year&apos;s the last year of his deal at a fund telecheck. Why nobody is a manic poignant if you&apos;ll want to trade Rob Lowe which I&apos;m I&apos;m one bullet went right out and stick or Brady the next couple years. Then why wouldn&apos;t you keep Prague and like rocket pack on the field to play the Brady I don&apos;t understand why you would want that. Because we&apos;ve proven we can win in willow both of them and we can prove that change. Quite a scene at this he&apos;s thirty years down malign. Jonathan&apos;s grandson still being an app the pop. That&apos;s how he thinks nobody else thinks that way. I just think you&apos;ll improve as a football team we&apos;ve got a trigger drop along thanks for the call you got to improve as a football team next to abide to ground back and get them healthy. I mean that&apos;s the way I&apos;ll look at the ground situation. Morgan Hamm would not be as imminent as movement some like a drop well. In my opinion based on the contracts. But I just if you&apos;re gonna. Tell yourself as an organization OK you moving broccoli gonna stick a brave for as long as he can stick this out in his career and play at a high level. Which I still think is another three years after this. Then net Y or June. And moved rock why Richard considerable program I just. I don&apos;t think that makes much sense you say well they can win without a are fun but don&apos;t try to tell me that when they have ground cannot about a team they are about a team. With Brooke on the field. This would probably be the best here to move on from Bronx though because the tight and debts coming out of colleges some of the best we&apos;ve seen. So this should be. Yeah it&apos;s a move. I mean it&apos;s not it&apos;s not obviously they&apos;re not better than Graf but the they haven&apos;t had this this high levels tied. I was young Shane Yost and the patriots would then draft and a tight net. Well the when you said that the first thing I think of his will not. No nobody would do that because they see so many good tot young tight ends in the draft they&apos;ll keep depiction and wrapped tight end. Who maybe isn&apos;t coming off of serious back surgery and not his first surgery self. I mean if you audible grunt. Now I&apos;ll get them back. Then she began to fall season. Maybe trip what is healthy. But did that treated rock as it&apos;s not a migrate and so easy it&apos;s just not. Drop only is because if on Belichick obstacle Brady and moving forward. Bad new girl Rob Lowe has trade value it&apos;s a quarterback league. Roll call is going to be out there available you can create some type of quarterback bidding war on the trade market I think it appeared team that&apos;s what I&apos;m for quarterback. Woody wants 125 point six rather than someone and we&apos;re almost going to be like 3637. I mean. Committee the patriots could get some pretty damn good for grapple this offseason. That is. I&apos;d make more imminent if you&apos;re gonna use the word limited that&apos;s more imminent than them over gras pummeled on the ground right now. I&apos;m trying to get ground in the field next year so that he can improve this offensive attack ads go to win the patriot to shoot the ball on some. Excitement. I imagine what it would be brought imagine what this would be abroad was helping. Pick up that. People be saying that we didn&apos;t play. But again it grounds out the shot. I had. Excellent 7779. 79837. Let&apos;s go to. Aden in east Milton went up Aden. Hey guys first Paul are timeless no well push at all. I don&apos;t have a quick sitting near me out. You think Roger Goodell just goes so hopeful Paula called dispute that not social. Other I would say that&apos;s not gonna happen. Aden I mean that would be. That would be absolutely hysterical. If Goodell said well I&apos;m under the brawl ball and an. Menace and someone else to use them not mean that that&apos;s not Mel skull that week and I got to see this that we candidate consumable. I&apos;d be an additional bubble in on demand my. I&apos;ve done this Schobel. Is it&apos;s my advice. Don&apos;t need to be at the show global. Imagine. I mean that&apos;s that happened we do know is going to be at the suitable could Dell&apos;s going to be this with the Lombardi trophy on that stage there&apos;s going to be confetti Vaughn from. Adult. At an IG stadium and somebody is going to be accepted that a body trophy somebody&apos;s going to be except that Super Bowl MVP. At. I&apos;m expecting Roger Goodell to be the guy to. Hand it off. A Richards. That&apos;s an unexpected. Shall. However plays out. I ID card could l.s going to be in his patronage job at the pro is even go to the Pro Bowl. Watch I watch them for. I&apos;m not a I got I saw them I sort of highlight. All of them play and dodge ball. Yesterday. And I&apos;m just like. What&apos;s happened. Why. Why the plane door. You don&apos;t want to do other things. That is what clip of Ezekiel Elliott you run as easily celebrating a dog bowl victory he runs. He&apos;s got no equipment on obviously and his knowledge grass. And each slice on the grass that you know if you&apos;re a soccer player and your school it&apos;s a wet grass and you slide and you these. She&apos;s got a huge Ezekiel Elliott did one of those slides attempt it. And he didn&apos;t slide and he like stopped short and came and like fellow vote. Round pick myself if that was my star running back. If all the cowboys fan and I see him doing that after a dodge ball game at the Pro Bowl. I remember the whole Robin Edwards situation in me flag football in the sand. That&apos;s devastating stuff that&apos;s stuff can happen. Which is. I don&apos;t plane flight on their plane on the plane and draw people. Together. I got to me why the white dodge ball again. They did make sure all. You couldn&apos;t if I was at a health plan. And I guess I say it&apos;s there for guys like Ezekiel LEI shop or go back and Julia. Around and around no pay like if I was one of those guys. You&apos;ve got to think they are competitive obviously and I am. I lose. The playoffs. And a couple weeks lady wanted to go play dodge ball against other NFL player is no events like what we&apos;ve put it&apos;s so good about that. An edge can do it&apos;s like you&apos;re watching it for that reason I can&apos;t watch it I won&apos;t want to Pro Bowl tomorrow night so I don&apos;t know Goodell would be at the trouble. Really don&apos;t buy from. What I do always good Dell will be at the suitable. And I didn&apos;t mean I&apos;m not one of these guys that told I needed good Dallas Foxboro. I don&apos;t need developed Foxboro doesn&apos;t really do when he thinks of me would be funny yeah. He would get booty would get taunted but let&apos;s be honest he&apos;d be able to sneak in the back door he be the media if you haven&apos;t. And at a home I think more the media can get into the media and for instead there&apos;s ways to get into Gillette. Two gold to security good Dell would go and net and he wouldn&apos;t come to any fans. Like it wouldn&apos;t it not been bad would happen norm. Good on that I didn&apos;t need this to develop Foxboro. I&apos;d president of the patrons extra motivation. When he&apos;s there when he&apos;s not there. President and if you do would would begin. Shock I didn&apos;t meet him there last week if you want to go to Atlanta two weeks or go to Atlanta reached tomorrow you won&apos;t. You wanna kiss the Georgia Dome goodbye kiss that George is owned by Alcan. Com put it got beyond that podium. To handle somebody trophy off the patriots. And that will be. The perfect ending to what she&apos;s in that again. As mind boggling and as it could begin with a superstar player in this league and the greatest quarterback of all time being suspended. Because it was more probable than not. But the air pressure and the patriots football is an AFC championship game a couple years ago and the first half. Well below hole. The twelve point five PS I&apos;m level that it says in the rule book that previous to that. Sting operation body NFL no there there wasn&apos;t one person in the league including the officials that even know ought to fit about the aside. Level in a football it is sure it was the stupidest thing of all time it gets me even what this stop even talking about it. But that&apos;s where this season again. And the perfect way for the season to end it. Is. A good Dell to hand that on body. Trophy off to the New England Patriots . Will be handed off Goodell will be I think that&apos;s that&apos;s a guarantee. We&apos;ll patriots beat I mean. I&apos;m verdict that they will I&apos;m verdict and the patrons will be NF podium celebrating a championship. And I think they&apos;ll do it handily I think they are gonna pop up out of Brady&apos;s gonna come up Atlanta&apos;s defense. And patent and Matt Ryan will not be able to keep up against the Patriots defense that to me it&apos;s still doesn&apos;t get enough credit credit after that especially. Beaten Ben Roethlisberger and Antonio Brown. Last week so I got the patriots went and I have the patriots won a big and I have the perfect moment with good Dell. And graduate and Tom Brady Bill Belichick Eric Robert Kraft and the New England Patriots and it will be is something else that scene. It&apos;ll be something else. And they&apos;ll be the perfect ending to this whole deflate Kate nonsense 617779798376177797. 937. Back after this time I&apos;ll. The weekend new England sports conversation continues with the Danny put cards right now. I want Sports Radio. 61777979837. I&apos;m here till 6 o&apos;clock taking your phone calls on patriots falcons Super Bowl 51 big game a week from tomorrow. Coming up at six Saturday skate. I assume they&apos;ll be talking about the fact that in these celebrity gam. Just saw this on to what they do give don&apos;t know little celebrity hockey Gammon LA. And net Justin Bieber is wearing a full cage can&apos;t Wear full change. Enacting especially enacting a very mica of your encore men&apos;s lankans. Sticks just like it or and I yeah I guess it&apos;s either. The celebrity. A full pay job. I I assume they&apos;ll be talking about that Saturday&apos;s game but also they&apos;ll be talking about the state of the Bruins here at the NHL all star break. So what in all seriousness you know you look at. What the Bruins have been able to do this season and some controversies. And hot rumors that have been out there and close Giuliani&apos;s name once again. It seems like. Every. Yeah. This timing here is a conversation has been had about close Julian future as the Bruins coach. Will he be able to survive this one. I&apos;m I&apos;m not so sure. But you know my thoughts on that. And that is. If you&apos;ve got to get critical load. You better do it after the season if they don&apos;t make the playoffs for a third straight era I don&apos;t I don&apos;t think you do it right now I did you see what can happen in the second half. And I think he obviously you don&apos;t like the playoffs. For Tina does make the last three straight isn&apos;t it you can justify coaching change but right now I would do it. But the state of the Bruins a delegate and that on Saturday skate coming up at 6 o&apos;clock. Right now on talking about the state of the patriots the state of the falcons the state of the Super Bowl Super Bowl 51 and years that. A week from tomorrow let&apos;s go to scooter and Pittsburgh. Let&apos;s us go to. No extra automate a column. It&apos;s great it was great right out of Pittsburgh Barbara but I lived up and comic caper eighteen years old. Quality guys tight. You know I think I love the most and all week about Al Brady carved up the Steelers defense and I really don&apos;t think he caught that up. You literally didn&apos;t play defense. I&apos;m terrorist or nobody within ten yards a receiver that entire game and you&apos;re up what bodies and I would watch and I came. We thought the second half they were double come out there are different because it&apos;s a game plan. Which they didn&apos;t I don&apos;t know they went and took about an app I&apos;m. What they did. But VoIP and it concerns me about the collapse and I can&apos;t wait to watch his game because they&apos;re really not the patch when this game. I hope radiant and and belt checker on a pedestal adult. And I hope they give at all. I notably general matter take the trophy and shaking hands. What I think people inside they&apos;re gonna know what they&apos;re really feel an Arctic adult in the same way the only thing my my point is. I think the only thing is that. What scares me a little about this game and I think. Even know you look at points allowed with Atlanta&apos;s defense I think they play a little cutter approach on these fronts what they&apos;re saying he&apos;s never beat back which is deal or did not. On I think I think basically if you just like my game plan for the Steelers opponent last week. Which just click on them out of the game I don&apos;t meet physically I just mean take you know you don&apos;t get an awful lot in the fog or chalk this well the play action. Do all that stop you might have been okay but they didn&apos;t do anything. Yeah did they also Pittsburgh Pittsburgh had to get to Brady and I didn&apos;t and it&apos;s like from the deck all I saw them a couple times. You know there Russian three and I&apos;m just like that&apos;s gonna get you&apos;ll win at Gillette Stadium you&apos;re gonna get down and learning that Brady&apos;s face and I just couldn&apos;t don&apos;t. You know I got no excuses dealt an ugly game I don&apos;t know where my steel as well I don&apos;t know I don&apos;t even know that was a treatment showed up. Where you actually believe in yup Pittsburgh defense thrown in that team Reinemund. I don&apos;t know I I did not only I believed. I could not believe in the back field. I believe they&apos;re not offensive line which I consider one of about Scotland to London and up now I believed them to be able to score more than. What are they scored. Eighteen points. Seventeen and and again and I don&apos;t got no excuses with audio and go on elementary is. I would I would pull away DeAngelo Williams and all day long he&apos;d get a black jury proved that he&apos;s just not just that good but he&apos;s he&apos;s good enough. You know what the way DeAngelo and I said this man did and gave the Angela lions a first couple times after eleven on bill one out I said. The way he bust through that hole on pick myself while this might be a bad thing for the patriots. He has already backe proved last year could everyone was scared one was bowed out last jerk do well to go right back. I was about backup running back in the NFL but anyway Belichick well I appreciate it go that. I want what you hear realistic about the Steelers I&apos;m curious your take on. Ben Roethlisberger he&apos;s not really gonna call it quits. It or not their power away and health and you know what happened excuse my language you know what happened that. Sunday night after that football game might come out of compassion on the radio. Uttered dug about what is made up. Antonio Brown was taken about a bunch of on the radio. And you know what they did. Qatar is really the Tuesday&apos;s news conference with Bennett a lot of men and then bow and then not prominent twelve. On Coke and pony show here on my victory seven to print expert. All of band did I swear to god can be actually like. Because they&apos;re talking about it as prominent Hollywood and that seemed to deepen in the adjustments are out on and I swear to god. I think that those two guys had a cup of coffee in the morning in the clubhouse on the south side of Pittsburgh. And they talk to each other how we gonna defend this. And then ask a simple question. And Bennett said I&apos;m not sure I need a lot for the next two or three days nobody talked about that football game they all talked about and retire. So Ali do it. I doubt guys are called league all I don&apos;t I don&apos;t. Believe that big bands it&apos;s irony that. That&apos;s an interesting theory I&apos;d nobody was talking about that game they were talking about all of these the game at Steele is that they were talking about. Roethlisberger and his future he&apos;s knock advertise. I just don&apos;t see it at Rutgers berg is a guy who plays through everything. Is a guy who plays there is much stop. And much injuries and pain as he does. I called him a psychopath earlier in the season based on how quickly he retired from that torn meniscus. And the surgery that he had and he only missed one game. Because a bye week soul. I mean. When it comes to play an engine plane banged up and battle and throw Ben Roethlisberger is sort of is a psychopath with that at. You have that type of mindset plans are bad stuff you&apos;re gonna call it quits I just don&apos;t see it. I don&apos;t see I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s exactly the spirit at the last colleges said but. That makes a little bit more sense than Big Ben Roethlisberger having a press conference actually tell us that he&apos;s retired I do not see. That being the case whatsoever ball when it comes to Pittsburgh and their defense last week on and I tried Kellan it&apos;ll end. They in Pittsburgh does not have the defense of personnel. To be able to stop the Patriots offense at Gillette Stadium I just didn&apos;t believe it to be true. And net and it turned out that they didn&apos;t have the personnel to be able to stop the patriots and whatever you all metal plant a defense of scheme or plan just didn&apos;t work out. And mom. You know the one thing that I thought they needed to do was to get that quarterback they could do and it didn&apos;t know that they would have no chance and had no chance. And now I&apos;ll save a similar thing about Atlanta. Those guys up front if they can get the Brady then don&apos;t lay this scam a week from tomorrow a little bit more interesting. But they have to do that in order for up Matt Ryan. To be able to give his high pollen offense that shot. You&apos;d they have a great offense you know van Matt Ryan&apos;s. Wide receivers. Our dad is you know you talk about should know the way that you should know those of those big guys who Leo Jones and those are big guys. You&apos;re talking about that you got a little guy Gabriel ran around Denny got a two headed monster in the backfield you know his stock to put it altogether alike that you can get an extra week to pick about it. Yeah gonna get some people talk themselves into Atlanta beaming unstoppable team. Because her offense is so damn good. You&apos;re gonna get that a lot of people pick in the falcons to win this game. People expect you sure they&apos;ll say this is Matt Ryan Jim they&apos;ll tell you that there are just one too many weapons. Offensively for the falcons they will not be stopped. By. I just think if there is any defense image got to slow them down that&apos;s elegant completely stop them but to slow them down. I think it&apos;s going to be the patriots defense and know when it comes to what Tom Brady&apos;s thrown up against. I mean that the weapons that he has the weapons that he&apos;s working with and you talk about two headed monsters in the backfield. Art. As an intuit does credit to edit my. Through the playoffs Yang had Dion Lewis had a big game against Houston. And he wasn&apos;t great against Pittsburgh and Tom Brady was moving the football me it was a Chris holding him against the Steelers. There wasn&apos;t as did hasn&apos;t been really that you headed monster attack out of the backfield for the patriots in the post season. But if need be they can go that route and they can have success. Rick that route so the patriots have so many options offensively that against this. What I call. Porous Atlanta Falcons defense. It&apos;s going to be Matt Ryan with the pressure on him to keep up with robbery. And the only way he&apos;ll be able to do data talent is if he&apos;s perfect I just and I just think the Patriots offense is going to be so good in this game against Atlanta&apos;s defense that. They&apos;re gonna score I think every time. They get the ball and and that means that Matt Ryan&apos;s gonna have to keep up. But did. Defense that Matt Ryan is now gone up against. This isn&apos;t green Bay&apos;s defense. Got a green Bay&apos;s defense. What is worst in Atlanta it&apos;s green Bay&apos;s pass defense is the second worst in football and if you watch that cowboys Packers game the week before Obama. And if you follow me on Twitter I traded out of pop Brady was a quarterback in that package. Cowboys game of the divisional round. Ray would&apos;ve put up 35 points in the first half against those two pass defense is I mean. Yeah you gotta look at as for as much as people say well Atlanta slowdown Aaron Rodgers . Now a little wasn&apos;t really tested by a defense last week against remain. In Atlanta wasn&apos;t attached to Matt Ryan green Bay&apos;s defense is terrible. Source. The wall is angry neck. You know not to follow up why. Atlantis. And because of that. That&apos;s gonna force Matt Ryan to have to play perfect football against a defense that is a homage at an angry days. A defense that let that Matt Ryan saw last week so. I got it we got over a week to talk about this one and when you say that allowed you dig itself while this is going to be a long week next week but. Once you start seeing the players Strickland the Houston got me an idol Monday night. Roger Goodell talking on Wednesday. Yeah well if there was one question you could ask Roger Goodell that Wednesday press conference what would abate. Motivate it&apos;s got you gotta thank the deflate gay questions are common. And you gotta think that Roger rebels answer is gone. Include the word integrity. At least 25 times. With him. Not Nolan actual definition of integrity. On so deflate gay will be as storyline all week. And at at as as much is a week from Sunday it seems like always away it. Once you start seeing a plays trickle and you get all these press conferences to get it may be similar story lines. Blown out of proportion. Next thing at all. It&apos;ll be Super Bowl Sunday next thing you know we&apos;ll get that one image that water damage adding we all wanna see. Roger Goodell animal body trophy. To the knowing a patriot 61777979376177797. 9837. Wrapping up the show at this time up. But card talks about all new England sports on Sports Radio WEEI. Are wrapping up the show coming up next Saturday&apos;s day. We&apos;ll take you inside NHL all star weekend it took or ask Brad marsh and represented these. That&apos;s pretty good commercial they have. That went. Tuukka Rask is. And I believe is mosh candidate as well. But they&apos;ve put out. I&apos;m not gonna knocked hockey in LA. &apos;cause I have seen them put on some pretty good I I&apos;ve seen an outdoor jam that they put on a couple of years ago I was pretty gut. I&apos;m not a big fan of the outdoor game all the time. Blood. That was something I thought that was pretty special when I didn&apos;t think it would have to do. Yet on how all star weekend. In Los Angeles I&apos;m sure they&apos;ll get that Saturday&apos;s game is rolls the state of the Bruins at the all star break if you wonder and about any Bruins. Update today Brad marsh and pulled himself out of the. Fastest skate competition he will still take pot 92 shooting competition but will not be part of the fastest skater competition. Some type of lower body injury the other and I did look like he went on the runway early and I game. But he did retirement. And mosh and I mean without am unaware the boroughs of so a lot then you don&apos;t you watch the not participate in the fastest gate copper digit. While Evans some type a low body tweak as miners that might be on perfectly fine. Width 61777979837. But there will get to all that at 6 o&apos;clock on Saturday skater and a couple minutes here. To take some more football calls his. We continue to get ready for Super Bowl 51 a week from tomorrow. Go to Stephen Robinson upstate. I don&apos;t then you go to since taking my call it&apos;s recent New York Times but local law thank you any help. Not a lot hopeful born converts it to locate what do you think that it&apos;s all there. You know we might be underestimate you know in his defense courtesy collective challenge right now and not playing would extreme competence and the other thing I wanted to ask about one&apos;s. We know that gave -- eateries watch it you&apos;re at UT that had anything to do all without the world operative Ortiz began and it would at all. Way to navigate build a Gatorade splash at the AFC championship. Yeah. Yeah yeah I don&apos;t think the dear I don&apos;t have that AFC championship. Alt opt. I don&apos;t think so that&apos;s doesn&apos;t seem like the patriot way does it to rejoin the Gatorade splash of that you really do that Q indiscernible right. I could sit on just make an actor&apos;s. You know I like Goldman has the on the ball yeah honestly. Well you know what&apos;s gonna happen and I salute Goldstein doesn&apos;t happen. Or is someone&apos;s gonna this week and media night. You tell me someone. On the Atlanta Falcons . Offense. Is it gonna say some than met the patriots could use as bulletin board material you know what&apos;s gonna happen in fact I think the Vontae Freeman already sent something. Along the lines of we are gonna have all way with the patriot defense don&apos;t quote me on that word for word but it was something along those lines. Admiral that&apos;s going to be that they have fires up the patrons usually like the patriots underdogs. And maybe don&apos;t like me she admits Eleanor that they&apos;re gonna act that Tom Brady&apos;s gonna pop up the falcons defense and it&apos;s one of the going to be close. As the deal over the next week and change. Got to get some analysts on experts. Yeah out they&apos;re gonna continue to call the patriots cheaters they&apos;re going through. Picked the falcons to win this game I think maybe even someone from the falcons is gonna say something that fires up the patriots a could be used. By someone and the patriots organization to fire up members that I ballclub. So it will go down in which the patriots inside. That building. Inside their locker room. I got a great convinced themselves that. Either Robby and the document it is still the world against annoying on patriots. Everybody has ruled against the the patriots they know that and maybe that&apos;s the only thing that they need. The fact that. The flight gate is still a gang based on the fact that Brady served its board and suspension. To begin this season and maybe got revenge toy is only paying the fact that all the critics have ruled against the patriots. Maybe that&apos;s the only thing may need. Is the only thing ninety. The patriots in this game. Protect Auburn if you can do that. I&apos;ve watched the falcons defense they all you want about what they&apos;ve done the last two games it&apos;s been impressive defensively for Atlanta you know why it&apos;s been impressive. Because. That&apos;s not usually Holland looks at least in the first capitalist game against Seattle agreement. Right. What if you watched Atlanta for a lot of that she&apos;s and dad and I think what you should know about did he is. You can pick them a pot you can draw on them you can pass in Atlanta as the you can cob down mop you can put them in a situation we Dayton all. They&apos;re gonna have to win a shoot out. Because did defense can&apos;t stop. You decide and it. What where that&apos;s come back and play in this one week from Sunday is that the Patriots defense trying to stop Matt Ryan is all lot better than what Matt Ryan saw last week. Against the Green Bay pass defense that is one of the worst in football. But we got to know week to talk about it from our got another three dollars to talk about it. In the meantime get a podcast the data for cod shell and Danny for cod dot com also want I challenge Google play an anywhere podcasts are available.
