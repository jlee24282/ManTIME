&quot;Previous Long Lunches have been a great success, raising well over $30,000 to support this valuable work,” he said. 
 
&quot;The event this year promises interest and fun in the wonderful Eumundi Markets venue under the trees. It will be great to see everyone, new lunchers and old munchers, to make this year&apos;s event even more successful.
