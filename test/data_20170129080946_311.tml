<TITLE>Droitwich Community Transport Scheme to get new minibus</TITLE>
<TEXT>A DROITWICH voluntary organisation is holding an official launch of a new minibus available to the community. 
 
The Community Transport Scheme at Droitwich Spa CVS, an independent local voluntary organisation that supports voluntary action, received a new minibus from the Department of Transport. 
 
Nigel Huddleston MP and the Mayor Coun Roy Murphy, as well as volunteer drivers, staff and service users are set to attend the official launch at 4pm on Friday (February 3) outside St Richards House in Droitwich. 
 
Tonia Enderbury, Head of Services at Droitwich Spa CVS, said: If you would like to find out more about Droitwich Community Transport and the services it runs locally please come along and have a chat and a look at the new minibus. 
 
We are very keen to speak to local charitable organisations who would like to use our minibus, or anyone that would be interested in becoming a volunteer for this local community scheme.
