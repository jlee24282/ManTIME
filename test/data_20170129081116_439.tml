<content type="str">In 1906, James Stuart Blackton made a simple short simple film called, &quot;Humorous Phases of Funny Faces.&quot; It was the first animated film in history. In 1937, Disney&apos;s &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was the first feature film that was fully hand-drawn. And for the next 50 years, Disney set the standard for animation.
