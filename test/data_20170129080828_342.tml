<TEXT type="str">The same lawyer who fought Gina Miller’s article 50 case is leading the fight against Impress. How will the Daily Mail handle that sort of contradiction? The Daily Mail doesn’t take defeat well. It tends to bury the hatchet in its opponent’s head. Thus there were no apologies to the supreme court judges over the article 50 judgment. &quot;Different judges … might well have ruled that the referendum could be treated as binding. Instead, the court bowed to the wishes of Gina Miller…&quot; Even Lord Pannick, who fought Miller’s case, &quot;was beaming with self-pleasure, two creamy dimples in his cheeks&quot;, wrote Quentin Letts. Human rights? Pah! But wait. &quot;&quot;, as the FT had it, is also leading the fight against Impress, the Mail’s worst nightmare of a press regulator, as he argues for a judicial review of its ascent to royal charter status. Let’s hope he dimples with pleasure again soon. And that good Mail-reading judges hear his case. Human rights? Yah!</TEXT>
