<content type="str">, in his home on Table Rock Lake. Gene was the only child of Sophronia Hassell Selby and Leo Selby. He was born on December 29, 1933, in Sperry, Oklahoma. He spent his early childhood in Osage County west of Skiatook. He attended Skiatook High School and graduated in 1952. He married Flossie M. Switzner on October 18, 1957. His only child, Lora, was born on January 6, 1961. He was employed by Oklahoma Tire and Supply Company (OTASCO) at their warehouse in north Tulsa for 15 years.

During their years in Skiatook, he was Skiatook&apos;s first Chief of Civil Defense now known as Emergency Management and was very active in citizen band (CB) radios. Gene had a mechanical talent and his curiosity of electronics drove his obsession with scanners and communication equipment. He organized several CB Radio Clubs and always kept an ear to the police and fire communication on his scanners. Early in their marriage, Gene and Flossie answered the calling to be missionaries in their own land. They helped to establish and strengthen six Southern Baptist churches in Oklahoma: Immanuel, Skiatook First Baptist, Oak Hill, Sycamore, Sageeyah and Bethel. Gene was ordained a deacon in 1966 and served as deacon in these churches.

In the early seventies, the Army Corp of Engineers planned for flood control of the Hominy and Bird Creek watershed, which included purchasing his family&apos;s farm on Hominy Creek. He and Flossie had fallen in love with the Ozarks and searched for property on which they could pioneer a business. Through friends in Cape Fair, in 1976, they found and purchased their property on Y-40 now known as Buttermilk Spring Rd. In 1979, they built their home and the store building and started their dream of operating their own business -- a caf and general grocery store on the lake, and named it Selby&apos;s Cedar Ridge.
