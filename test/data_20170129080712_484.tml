United paid a world-record fee of £89m for the services of Paul Pogba in the off-season, although he has come in for criticism for his latest performances. 
 
Craig Burley, who made 113 appearances for Chelsea, claims the French midfielder needs show more than tricks and flicks. 
 
“If you’re Man United, with all that cash, and you’ve spent on the most expensive player in history, then these players have to step up to the plate when your striker is having an off-day,&quot; Burley told ESPN FC. 
 
“The midfielders need to be getting goals, to be chipping in. I’m not just singling [Pogba] out, because there were others, but I’m not seeing anywhere near enough from him, from the guy who has cost so much. 
 
“[He has] so much possession, flicks and tricks and all that. Twice [against Stoke City], there was a simple killer pass down the right channel, and he took another touch, another touch, another touch, and he was getting tackled. 
 
“€100 million? I’m not seeing that at the moment.”
