<TEXT type="str">AFC Bournemouth have reportedly rejected an approach by West Bromwich Albion for striker Callum Wilson. 

Wilson has been the subject of a lot of interest from rival clubs over the past six months. 

Both West Ham United and Newcastle United have reportedly been interested in a move for the Cherries top goal scorer, but The Sun believe that West Bromwich Albion are the club to actually make an approach. 

According to their report &apos;Eddie Howe rejected their initial approach&apos; but West Brom are now &apos;ready to smash their transfer record   with a £20million bid for Bournemouth hitman Callum Wilson.&apos; 

Despite indifferent form since returning from his devastating knee injury last season, Wilson is AFC Bournemouth&apos;s top goalscorer this season. 

Three of Wilson&apos;s six goals however have come from the penalty spot with Wilson&apos;s last goal in open play coming in October.

&apos;Think we are looking for about £24 million for Wilson - if they are prepared to match that, I&apos;d take it. 

Highly doubt it will ever get to that stage though. - Join the conversation here .
