In your Jan. 19 letter, Doug Gobin, you said outgoing President Obama &quot;has done great harm to the fabric of our country.&quot; You said you were writing &quot;out of respect for the Rev. Martin Luther King&quot; who was a &quot;great man.&quot;

I don&apos;t understand how you can accuse Obama of harming the country while professing admiration for Rev. King. Both men were cut by their creator from the same righteous cloth. And both drew the same wrath from the same quarters.

Doug, if you honor King - who stood up to white supremacists and spoke out for fair housing practices, equal protection for the right to vote, equality in public education, equality in job opportunities, and equal justice for all - how can you not honor Obama for working, in the face of intense hostility, to advance those same goals? AHS sub program falls into &apos;alternative facts&apos;

To the editor:

I have to say that Jim Hand&apos;s Jan. 24 story &quot;Sub shortage forces AHS to consolidate classes&quot; tickled my retired high school principal funny bone. Attleboro Superintendent David Sawyer spins what is obviously a desperate effort to cope with a lack of substitute teachers by creating what he calls a &quot;pilot program.&quot; His &quot;pilot program&quot; is sticking several classes into a single location with minimal substitute coverage.

In my nearly 40 years as an educator, a &quot;pilot program&quot; was a term that meant testing a new and creative educational program with an eye toward later implementing it on a broad scale. Sawyer&apos;s &quot;pilot program&quot; is not new, creative or educational. Let me tell you what this &quot;pilot program&quot; will look like:

* Lesson plans provided by the absent teachers will not be followed.

* Some student time will be spent on social media, texting their friends or playing games on their phones.

* Discipline will be more of an issue than in a regular classroom.

* The noise level will be excessive, distracting students who are working.

* Absent teachers will be forced to spend time catching up with what their students missed in the lesson plans left for the sub rather than in moving on to new material.

* Eventually, this stressful work environment will have the unintended consequence of reducing the number available subs still further.

One does not have to drive a car 80 mph into a tree to find out what happens. Common sense gives the answer. While I sympathize with Superintended Sawyer&apos;s dilemma, he is making the situation worse. I believe that in his heart he must know that, since his justification of his plan to Jim Hand falls into the category of &quot;alternative facts.&quot;</content>
