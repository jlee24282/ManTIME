<content type="str">A statue of Princess Diana has been commissioned by Prince William and Prince Harry to mark the 20th anniversary of her death. 
 
&quot;The time is right to recognise her positive impact&quot; with a permanent statue in the public gardens at Kensington Palace, the two princes said in a statement. 
 
&quot;Our mother touched so many lives. We hope the statue will help all those who visit Kensington Palace to reflect on her life and her legacy.&quot; 
 
Details on the sculptor and design will be announced later, the statement said.</content>
