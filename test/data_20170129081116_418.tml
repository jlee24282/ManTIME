<TEXT type="str">CONCORD, N.C. — , 80, passed away peacefully surrounded by her loving family on Thursday, Jan. 26, 2017, after many years of declining health. 
 
Eleanor was born May 14, 1936, to the late Salvatore and Rosalie Scirica LiPetri. She grew up on Long Island, N.Y., surrounded by a large Sicilian family. 
 
She was predeceased by her husband, Frank GJ; daughter, Patricia; and her brother, Thomas, who passed prior to her birth. 
 
After graduating from Mepham High School, she attended Buffalo State College, where she met her husband, Frank. They married and moved to College Park, Md., where he then completed his degree. They moved to Warren, where Eleanor lived for 30 years before returning to Maryland. 
 
After their four children were in school, Eleanor returned to college and earned her bachelor’s degree in education. She briefly taught and then worked at the Warren Public Library until she retired in 1998. Eleanor went further to earn her master of library science from Kent State University. To Eleanor, working at the library was a job she loved so much that she would have done it for free. 
 
Two of Eleanor’s greatest pleasures were reading and traveling. She was known to finish, on average, two books a week. Historical fiction was her favorite genre. Eleanor traveled extensively throughout her life, first with her husband, and after his death, with various tour groups. Europe was her favorite destination. She traveled from the fjords of Norway to the sunny south of Spain. Throughout the years, there were two trips that she always said were her favorites. The first was a trip to Germany and Austria with her daughters, Tina, Beth and daughter-in-law, Maridy. The other was a cruise to the Greek Isles with her daughter, Beth. Pictures of Eleanor from these trips highlight her adventurous spirit. 
 
After retiring from the Warren Public Library, she moved to Annapolis, Md., where she worked part-time at the Anne Arundal Public Library and Borders Book Store. Reading and books were a passion she obviously could not live without. She always said that she continued working past retirement so that she could continue to travel. 
 
Eleanor is survived by her son, Michael (Adriana) of Maryland; daughters, Tina (Maridy) Boyer of Concord and Beth Horn of Groveport; grandchildren, Jennifer Snell, Jennifer Horn (Matt) Neff, Jaremie (Susan) Horn, Josh (Amanda) Horn, Jodi Horn and Jacob Horn; and 10 great-grandchildren. 
 
The family wishes to thank the staff of Morningside Assisted Living of Concord, Kestrel Ridge Family Home and Universal Healthcare, for the excellent care she received in the past eight years. 
 
According to the family’s wishes, there will be no services. Interment will be at Annapolis National Cemetery. 
 
In lieu of flowers, the family would like donations made to your local public library. In Eleanor’s honor, read a book or read a book to a child. 
 
Hartsell Funeral Home of Concord is serving the Boyer family.
