<TEXT type="str">Liverpool playmaker Philippe Coutinho has revealed that he snubbed a move to Barcelona to sign a new five-year deal at Anfield because he can see the ambition of the club

The 24-year-old Brazilian was a target for the La Liga chmpions but has now pledged his future to the Reds with a contract that makes him the club’s highest earner at £150000 per week

Coutinho told Daily Mail he had no second thoughts as soon as he was offered fresh terms

&quot;No need to wait I know I live this every day I can smell it I see the ambition of the club my teammates the manager I am living it seeing it Wait to sign No No Now is the right time&quot; he said

&quot;I understand what Liverpool means We can say Kenny Dalglish Ian Rush Alan Hansen Graeme Souness Luis Suarez Steven Gerrard I’ve been here quite a few years already it’s not like I am new I understand

&quot;To have signed a new contract at this club my goal is to be thought of one day in the same way as these players They are legends You define the success of a player by his loyalty or his titles Or both In order to be part of this group I have so much to do

&quot;I want to win titles Five years is my new contract  it gives me that opportunity&quot;

Coutinho has said he was not keen on the big money on offer in the Chinese Super League

&quot;China no I am not interested I don’t think about that not for one moment My football is here My heart is here I don’t think about any other club Not at all&quot; he said Top Stories</TEXT>
