<TEXT type="str">DAYTONA BEACH – Motorcycle lovers from the Flagler/Volusia area assembled Jan. 8 for the Bruce Rossmeyer’s Harley-Davidson Super Swap Car and Motorcycle Swap Meet. The Swap vendors offered motorcyclist and Harley-Davidson enthusiasts the opportunity to shop parts for restoration or enhancement. Each participating vendor paid $10, which directly benefited Food Brings Hope for a total of $427.

Despite the chilly weather, there was a good turnout of support from the community. Kind neighbors walking also came to the FBH booth, with a warm cup of coffee in hand, to place a donation in our bucket.

Gregg Daniel, of Bruce Rossmeyer’s Harley-Davidson, said he was glad to help “such a worthy cause.”

One passerby remarked how important it was to support organizations like FBH: “The youth of today simply do not have the electives my generation had, we had sewing classes and those classes inspired me to start my own business. Todays’ children have computers and tablets and it seems they are only using them for entertainment.”

Mamie Oatis, Community Grant and Operations director at FBH, remarked that the organization sees the need for children to have options.

“We are committed to showing the students enrolled in our programs how to apply the tools of technology to academic success,” she said. “The number of children enrolled in our afterschool tutoring programs increase every year. Continued support from partners and neighbors will help us reach our goal of reaching every homeless and economically disadvantaged student in our community.”</TEXT>
