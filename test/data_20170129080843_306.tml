<TITLE>Sky Views: The real reason for the Leave vote</TITLE>
<TEXT>Sophy Ridge, Sky News Presenter  
Filming in Barnsley this week, I spoke to a man in his seventies as he walked down the high street. 
 
Like many others in his town, he and his family had always seen themselves as Labour voters - "Labour, Labour, Labour" - but recently he had started voting for UKIP. 
 
He was unimpressed with the town's regeneration - more people would visit Greggs in a day than would go in the new multi-million pound library in a week, he said. 
 
And, like the overwhelming majority of people in Barnsley, he had voted to leave the EU. 
 
The first reason he gave me for his vote to leave was immigration.

Immigration is relatively low in Barnsley - ethnic minorities account for 2% of the working age population, compared to 11% nationwide. 
 
It's easy for the chattering classes to dismiss the concerns of people like this gentleman as misinformed or even racist. Fear of immigration is often greatest in areas where actual immigration is low. 
 
But as I continued speaking to him, he fleshed out what he meant. 
 
He said when he left school in the 1960s you were guaranteed a stable job. For 37 years he had worked in a rubber factory which exported goods all over the world until it shut down. 
 
After the decline of the manufacturing and mining industries in Barnsley and elsewhere, young people simply weren't given that same promise of a stable job they could be proud of. 
 
It was a refrain that came up again and again. 
   
When people say immigration is their reason for voting to leave the EU, often they are referring to the more complex reason of globalisation

Grandfathers worried about their grandchildren. A woman who said Barnsley had been "forgotten" by politicians. A man who believed that after the decline of mining in the area "people are on the breadline". 
 
He added with a smile: "But we keep plodding on." 
 
When people say immigration is their reason for voting to leave the EU, often they are referring to the more complex reason of globalisation. Yes, that means free movement of people and immigration levels. 
 
But it also means the decline of the traditional British industries and the increase of cheap imported goods from elsewhere. 
 
For the older generation, British manufacturing was in a far better state before the UK joined the EU. 
 
Once outside again, will it thrive again? It's a roll of the dice, a high stakes gamble.</TEXT>
