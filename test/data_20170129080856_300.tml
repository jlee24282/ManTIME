Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday congratulated Indian Coast Guard on completing 40 years of its formation and said the country was proud of it being among the world&apos;s four biggest Coast Guards. 
 
&quot;On February 1, Indian Coast Guard will be completing 40 years. On this occasion, I want to congratulate all the officers and its personnel for their contribution towards the country,&quot; Modi said in his &apos;Mann Ki Baat&apos; radio programme. 
 
&quot;This is a matter of pride that Indian Coast Guard, with its 126 ships and 62 aircrafts, continues to be among the four biggest Coast Guards in the world.&quot; 
Mentioning that the coast guards were continuously guarding Indian coasts from various threats and difficulties, the Prime Minister said they were also taking initiatives towards the cleanliness of costal areas.
