<TITLE>Generals dominate Mustangs to end two-game skid</TITLE>
<TEXT>ALEXANDRIA, La. (LSUA) - The Generals imposed their will on the inside to pull away late from University of the Southwest as LSUA scored its highest total on the season to end a two-game losing streak with a 92-72 win over the Mustangs Saturday afternoon at The Fort. 
 
Much like the first game between the two teams this season, it was the Mustangs who jumped out to a quick lead as Southwest made the first two buckets to get a 4-0 advantage just more than two minutes into the game. But LSUA responded by scoring seven of the next nine points as Katie Lemieuxs three-point play put the Generals on top 7-6 with 6:00 left in the opening quarter. 
 
LSUAs largest lead of the period was four points, done three times, the last on Lemieuxs elbow jumper that put the Generals up 20-16. Southwest finished the quarter on a 5-0 run, and AnJolique Woodsons lay-up right before the horn put the Mustangs up 21-20 after one. 
 
With the game tied at 30-30 just more than 3:30 into the second quarter, Kayla Morgans three gave the Generals the lead for good, and sent the Generals on a period-ending 17-8 run that another Morgan three ended with seconds left in the period to put LSUA up 47-38 at halftime. 
 
Southwest started the second half on a 9-4 push that pulled the LSUA lead down to just four points as Stephanee Carrillos basket made the score 51-47 Generals just less than three minutes into the third period. But LSUA answered again, this time with a seven straight points as Kayla Morgans free throw with just about 5:30 left in the quarter gave the Generals their first double-digit lead of the game at 58-47. 
 
The Generals would get the lead to a dozen three times in the third quarter, the final time on Nicole Bouillions made three-pointer that put the Generals up 70-58 with less than a minute left in the stanza. LSUAs lead would not fall under double-digits the rest of the afternoon as the Generals led 70-60 at the buzzer. 
 
LSUA methodically built on the lead during the fourth quarter. Kayla Morgan set the Generals on a decisive run as her jumper in the lane set off an 8-0 LSUA run midway through the period which Lillie Snowdens free throws finished with 4:35 left in the game to give LSUA an 84-65 advantage. Temekia Bonners basket with just seconds left provided the Generals with both their largest lead of the game and the games final score, 92-72. 
 
We played well as a team today, said LSUA head coach Bob Austin. We moved the ball well and got it into the hands of players who had open looks, and we did a good job of converting those shots. We were also extremely active on the defensive end, which got us a lot of steals and easy looks and helped jump start our offense after a slow start and got us rolling. And I cant say enough about Kayla, whose been shooting very well as of late and finished tonight with yet another 30 point game. 
 
Kayla Morgan led all players with 30 points on ten of 19 shooting in the contest, five of her makes coming from above the three-point arc. This was Morgans second straight game with 30 or more points and third time this season hitting the 30-point mark. Temekia Bonner had her second straight game with double-figure points with 15. Katie Lemieux added in 13 while Luv Blackburn rounded out the LSUA leading scorers with ten points. 
 
The Generals (6-8, 4-6 RRAC) shot 47.8% from the field in the contest, including 36.8% from long distance. While rebounding was even, 39-38 in favor of Southwest, the Generals got inside to score, dominating points in the paint 46-28. LSUA also dominated fast break points, 17-2, points off turnovers, 26-6, and points off the bench, 32-17. On the defensive side, Southwest (1-20, 1-10 RRAC) shot 45.5% from the field and 36.8% from deep, but turned the ball over 25 times, 18 due to LSUA steals. 
 
LSUA returns to action Wednesday evening up I-49 as the Generals take on LSU Shreveport. Tip-off between the Generals and Pilots is set for 5:30 P.M. at The Dock.</TEXT>
