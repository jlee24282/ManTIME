<TITLE>Gilfert: Give President Trump a chance</TITLE>
<TEXT>What do you do when a man you don't like and disapprove of has been elected president of the United States? If you decide you must protest, I have a suggestion: Go outside and clean up the mess left by last Sunday night's storm or pull a few weeds while you think about it. In four years you will have another chance at electing someone else. 
 
In the meantime, Give President Trump a chance. You had your opportunity to vote just like everyone else. We have to make the best of the decision that was made. 
 
Realize that nothing in life always follows your prescription. How has that worked out for you? Admit it! You are not always right. Trump has not always been a winner which is witnessed by the fact that he is on his third marriage. But he has been proven pretty good at the thing he most wanted, making money and raising his children to be good at making money. If he puts his best effort into it, maybe he will be good at being president. 
 
During the last election cycle, many of Trump's worst character flaws were brought to light. In some instances he was portrayed as a womanizer, a racist, less than honest, lacking in compassion. Let us hope that with the help of good advisers, he will put these things aside and use his amazing ability to make money for the good of the country. We, the American people, have given him a chance to make good on his boast to "Make America Great Again." If his idea of great and your idea of great do not coincide, you will have to wait and see how close he comes to your ideal. 
 
Those of you who gave up the idea of voting in the last election because the choice of candidates didn't appeal to you can only hope that you did the right thing. To me, doing nothing has never seemed to be helpful but when your choice is no choice, what can you do? We had plenty of chances to choose a better candidate but for reasons unknown, Donald Trump came out the winner even though he did not get the majority of the votes. When our founding fathers came up with the idea of the Electoral College they thought they had good reason for it. If you are confused by it, I suggest you study the history of that decision. It is too much for me to go into here. 
 
While we are deliberating on the right and wrong of this past election, let us hope that our worst fears will not be realized. Let us hope that President Trump will work as hard for this country as he did for his own prosperity. Let us hope that he loves his country as much as he loves his family. Let us hope and pray that his decisions do not lead us down paths that can not be subsequently resolved. He must eventually see that we are on a slippery slope when it comes to climate change, that human activity is affecting our planet on some scale or another. He, as our leader, must take this problem seriously and not give it a blanket denial. 
 
Whatever he is, President Trump is not a stupid man. There are shining examples all over this country of that fact in the many buildings he has built. In his words, he is "very, very rich." 
 
America is already on the path of recovery from our latest recession, but, as I am not an economist, I can only rely on what I see as an almost impossible challenge for our young families today who are struggling to stay solvent with the rising cost of paying a mortgage, paying for health care, raising their children and paying for child care even with two incomes. 
 
Will this president help change all that? At least he recognizes it and claims to be able to change it. Is this a challenge he can meet? I certainly hope so. Our young families are our hope for the future and their welfare is out country's welfare, their future our country's future. They must have the ability to stand on their own. We cannot ignore the part the environment has in their future, and we are seeing more and more evidence that we are failing to recognize that our energy challenges play a large part in what we are doing to that environment. 
 
President Trump, if I can speak to you personally, we need you to concentrate on all these problems, one at a time, and with your selected group of advisers, we need you to address them honestly and effectively. We need you to forget your ego and concentrate on the problems at hand for they are many and formidable. The American people have chosen you for good or ill. Please don't make them sorry for their choice. Don't let the nay sayers bother you. Go on and do what you were elected to do, Mr. President, and help us change the world. 
 
What can you as a good and caring and responsible citizen do to aid in our recovery? What can you do that does not require answers to our problems? Your responsibility is simple. You can first be a good citizen and work hard and honestly for the benefit of yourself and your family. Having done that, you can pray to our Creator for our new president that he will make good decisions, that he will ignore self-aggrandizement, a hostile press and angry protesters. Please pray often that all those in power will put aside selfish ambition and make the best decisions for all of us. That will do a whole lot more good than protest marches.
