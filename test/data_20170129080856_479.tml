<TEXT type="str">Usually when a high school boys basketball team plays two games in back-to-back nights, the second night it can get a little tired and sloppy. 
 
That was not the case with St. Patrick-St. Vincent High on Saturday night. 
 
Playing in front of a home gym more packed than a midnight screening of a Harry Potter movie, the Bruins fed off their faithful’s energy by constantly grabbing more rebounds and second-chance points in a 75-64 nonleague win over Benicia 
 
The win came about 24 hours after St. Pat’s (17-4) had defeated Albany on the road on Friday night. 
 
“The crowd got us into it,” Bruin senior Tavian Henderson said. “There was a lot of energy in the gym tonight. We were hoping there would be a lot of people tonight and there was.” 
 
When asked if there was any kind of rivalry between St. Pat’s and Benicia (12-8) even though the two teams play in different leagues, Henderson went the opposite direction. 
 
“What I see in this game is just another win added to our total for the season,” Henderson said. “That’s what I liked the most about it tonight.” 
 
While the Bruins added another victory, Benicia had a difficult 24 hours in Vallejo, as the Panthers had lost a 17-point lead on Friday night at Vallejo High. Despite the loss, however, Benicia hung strong early in Saturday’s contest as it trailed by only four points at 18-14 after the first quarter. 
 
In the second quarter, however, St. Pat’s started to break away. 
 
Already up 26-21, the Bruins went on a 9-2 run to build the lead to 35-23. The run was sparked by a dunk from Henderson, a layup from BJ Standley and a layup by Henderson off an inbounds pass under the hoop. Henderson finished the game with 20 points and nine rebounds, while Standley had 17 points and six assists. 
 
St. Pat’s kept the foot on the gas pedal in the third quarter, jumping out to a 10-2 run to open the second half thanks to three layups in a row from Jordan Tolliver, one of them coming off a nice pass from Marquel Johnson, who finished with 12 points and five assists. 
 
The lead was built up to 51-33 midway through the third quarter after Romeo Mays scored off a nice pass from Johnson and Standley scored following a steal of his own near midcourt. Mays, who scored nine points, was also a constant force in the paint with eight rebounds. 
 
“He was active tonight,” St. Pat’s head coach Derek Walker said about Mays. “He helped us a lot tonight with that.” 
 
Benicia wouldn’t quit, however, and made a last run in the fourth quarter to cut the lead thanks to a 10-2 run sparked by five points from Taj Toney and five more from Steve Urias. Urias’ three-point play with 2:39 left in regulation made it 69-60. Urias led the Panthers with 14 points on the night, eight of them coming in the second half. Toney, Trey Pugh and Jon Lee all added 11 points. 
 
 
A 3-pointer from Pugh made it 71-63 with under two minutes to play, but it’s as close as the Panthers would get, as they could not contain Henderson in the final quarter. The Bruin hit eight points in the final period, including a big jumper near the top of the key to slow down Benicia’s momentum. 
 
St. Pat’s continues its season on Tuesday with a home game against El Cerrito, while Benicia will play American Canyon on Wednesday night at home.</TEXT>
