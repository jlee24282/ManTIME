A number of US commandos have reportedly parachuted in the southwestern Yemeni province of Bayda, where they raided a village and killed a total of 20 people, among them civilians. 
 
The US paratroopers targeted Yakla viallge in Bayda’s Qifah district on Sunday, with some 30 planes such as Apache helicopters and drones taking part in the operation. 
 
Saudi media said 20 people, among them women and children, lost their lives in the US assault. 
 
Meanwhile, Al-Masdar Online news website reported that three ringleaders of the al-Qaeda militant group were among those killed. 
 
“The operation began at dawn when a drone bombed the home of [al-Qaeda ringleader] Abdulraoof al-Dhahab and then helicopters flew up and unloaded paratroopers at his house and killed everyone inside,” an unnamed local said. 
 
Two years ago, the US troopers conducted a similar operation in Yemen’s Hadhramaut Province to allegedly save an American reporter that was held captive by al-Qaeda. However, the operation was unsuccessful and left the correspondent dead. 
 
Separately on Sunday, Saudi fighter jets mistakenly bombarded positions held by Riyadh’s   own mercenaries in Bayda Province. 
 
Arabic-language al-Masirah television network quoted an informed military source as saying that the Saudi warplanes had also targeted homes in Bayda’s al-Quraishyah and Sharyah neighborhoods. 
 
Similar Saudi air raids were also carried out in the districts Harad and Nasim in Hajjah Province as well as the Sirwah neighborhood of Ma’rib Province.

The Saudi jets further targeted al-Amri district of Ta’izz Province with cluster bombs. 
 
Elsewhere, in Shabwah Province, a large number of Saudi mercenaries were killed and injured in the Yemeni army’s rocket attacks.

Additionally, 50 Saudi mercenaries, among them foreign nationals, were killed and injured in clashes with the Yemeni army forces in the port city of Mokha and Dhubab district, both situated in Ta’izz Province. 
 
Three rocket attacks also hit downtown Zanzibar in Abyan Province. 
 
The Riyadh regime has been incessantly pounding Yemen since March 2015 in a bid to reinstall the country’s ex-government and crush the Houthi Ansarullah movement. 
 
The Houthis and the Yemeni army have been defending Yemen against the Saudi offensive over the past almost two years. 
 
The Saudi military aggression has claimed the lives of over 11,400 Yemenis, including women and children, according to the latest tally by a Yemeni monitoring group.</content>
