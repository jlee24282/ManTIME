A number of US commandoshave reportedly parachuted in the southwestern Yemeni province of Bayda, where they raided a village and killed a total of 20 people, among them civilians. 
 
The US paratroopers targeted Yakla viallge in Baydas Qifah district on Sunday, with some 30 planes such as Apache helicoptersand drones taking part in the operation. 
 
Saudi media said 20 people, among them women and children, lost their lives in the US assault. 
 
Meanwhile, Al-Masdar Onlinenews website reported that three ringleaders of the al-Qaeda militant group were among those killed. 
 
The operation began at dawn when a drone bombed the home of [al-Qaeda ringleader] Abdulraoof al-Dhahab and then helicopters flew up and unloaded paratroopers at his house and killed everyone inside, an unnamed local said. 
 
Two years ago, the US troopers conducted a similar operation in Yemens Hadhramaut Province to allegedly save an American reporter that was held captive by al-Qaeda. However, the operation was unsuccessful and left the correspondent dead. 
 
Separately on Sunday, Saudi fighter jets mistakenly bombarded positions held by Riyadhs  own mercenaries in Bayda Province. 
 
Arabic-languageal-Masirahtelevision network quoted an informed military source as saying that the Saudi warplanes had also targeted homes in Baydas al-Quraishyah and Sharyahneighborhoods. 
 
Similar Saudi air raids were also carried out in the districts Harad and Nasim in Hajjah Province as well as the Sirwah neighborhood of Marib Province.
