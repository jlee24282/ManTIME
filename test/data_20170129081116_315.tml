<content type="str">Bandai Namco today announced Accel World vs. Sword Art Online, a new anime crossover RPG from the author of both series, Reki Kawahara. It will launch digitally on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita in Summer 2017. 
 
Check out some images from the game in the gallery below. 
 
The original story from Kawahara involves the worlds of Sword Art Online and Accel World, chaotically merging into one. As the merging unfolds, skilled Alfheim Online players from Sword Art Online and Burst Linkers from Accel World join forces to stop the Seven Kings of Pure Color. 
 
Players construct three-person teams composed of favorite characters from both franchises, combining skills like magic and fairy flight from Sword Art and special techniques from Accel World. An online multiplayer mode will let you team up in battle with three friends. 
 
Last year, we reported on the live action Sword Art Online TV series , which will hit theaters in March.
