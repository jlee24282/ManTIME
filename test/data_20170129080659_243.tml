<TEXT>are used to measure the amount of movement available in a given space. In common parlance, an objects size and shape referred to its dimensions. In science fiction and New Age philosophy, a dimension can also refer to a different plane of existence. For our purposes, our physical world appears to be a four dimensional world. Three of those dimensions are spatial  we can move up or down, forward or backward, right or left. We can also combine these movements, moving forward and to the right to move in a northeasterly direction. The fourth dimension is time. Unlike the other three dimensions, where you can move in any direction, time seems to move in only one direction. However, scientists studying chaos theory and other high-level physics problems believe that time can be moved into directions. Unfortunately, we dont know how this is done yet. In mathematics, dimensions become a coordinate system. This has been put to practical use in the measures of latitude and longitude found on Earth. By adding a third measurement, altitude, the position of a three-dimensional object can be shown in three-dimensional space. In science fiction, the word dimension is often used interchangeably with parallel  The post appeared first on . is a journalist, speaker and author of Written In Stone: Decoding The Secret Masonic Religion Hidden In Gothic Cathedrals And World Architecture. The book uncovers a lost Wisdom Tradition that was practiced globally in antiquity, found memorialized in pyramids, Triptychs, and identical images worldwide. The central tenets of this tradition have been perpetuated in Western Secret Societies. The most visible of these is the so-called Masonic Fraternity, an age-old chivalric Order whose ranks have included Europes Gothic cathedral builders and Americas Founding Fathers.
