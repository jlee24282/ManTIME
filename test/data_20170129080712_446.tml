<TEXT type="str">New Delhi [India], Jan. 29 ((ANI): Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday warned the students against cheating during the exams while terming it as a short cut which eventually leads to failure.

Addressing the nation in the 28th edition of his &apos;Mann ki Baat&apos; programme, Prime Minister Modi told the students that competing with others can make you unhappy and jealous, adding compete with yourself and you will be energised and more determined to excel.

&quot;If you form a habit of cheating, there will be no desire to learn. Trying to cheat requires time and creativity. Use it for better purposes,&quot; he said.

&quot;People have told you often, but I am saying it again do not cheat. Even if no one caught you, you know that you have cheated in exams,&quot; he added.

Asserting that the parents have an important role to play, Prime Minister Modi asked them to stress on three points- acceptance, teaching and giving time. He asked the parents to accept, saying that expectation is the root of the problem.

The Prime Minister said the expectations of parents are heavier than the weight of a school bag. (ANI)</TEXT>
