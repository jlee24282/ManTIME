<TITLE>Tech dismay over immigration order</TITLE>
<TEXT>Sundar Pichai: 'It's painful to see the personal cost of this executive order on our colleagues.' Tsering Topgyal  by Mark Bergen and Eric Newcomer  
Alphabet's Google asked staffers who may have been affected by a new executive order on immigration to return to the US quickly, joining a growing number of technology executives voicing concerns over restrictions that could interfere with how they do business. 
 
Google chief executive Sundar Pichai slammed President Donald Trump's move in a note to employees, telling them that more than 100 company staff had been affected by the order. Microsoft said it was in touch with 76 staffers from the seven countries identified in the executive order. They received a reprieve on Sunday (AEDT)after two judges temporarily blocked the Trump administration from enforcing the order that would have led to the removal from US airports of refugees, visa holders and legal US residents from seven mostly Muslim countries. 
 
"It's painful to see the personal cost of this executive order on our colleagues," Pichai wrote in the memo, a copy of which was obtained by Bloomberg News . "We've always made our view on immigration issues known publicly and will continue to do so." 
 
The comments underscore a growing rift between the Trump administration and several large US technology companies, which employ many immigrants and have lobbied for fewer immigration restrictions. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg voiced concern over the policy on Saturday, and AirbnbCEO Brian Chesky said in a tweet that "closing doors further divides" people. TwitterCEO Jack Dorsey said in a tweet the order's "humanitarian and economic impact is real and upsetting". 
   
Uber Technologies CEO Travis Kalanick said at the weekendhe plannedto outline his misgivings with the order at the first meeting of the Trump administration's business advisory group this week in Washington. 
   Stranded Drivers  
Uber had about a dozen staffers affected by the order, as well as a number of drivers, Kalanick said. 
 
"This order has far broader implications as it also affects thousands of drivers who use Uber and come from the listed countries, many of whom take long breaks to go back home to see their extended family. These drivers currently outside of the US will not be able to get back into the country for 90 days," he said. He said Uber was working out a plan to compensate those drivers stranded abroad. 
 
Airbnb will provide free housing to refugees and anyone not allowed into the US, Chesky, the home-stay network's CEO, said on Twitter. "Stayed tuned for more, contact me if urgent need for housing," he wrote. 
   Barriers for Talent  
"We're concerned about the impact of this order and any proposals that could impose restrictions on Googlers and their families, or that create barriers to bringing great talent to the US," a Google spokeswoman said in a statement. "We'll continue to make our views on these issues known to leaders in Washington and elsewhere." 
 
Some Google employees were travelling abroad and were trying to get back to the US before the order took effect. The company asked them to reach out to Google's security, travel, and immigration teams for assistance, according to a person familiar with the situation. The person asked not to be identified talking about internal company communications. 
 Rushing Home    
The employees in question normally work in the US but just happened to be abroad either on work assignments or vacations. One employee rushed back from a trip to New Zealand to make it into the US before the order was signed, Google's Pichai wrote in his memo. 
 
"We are advising our clients from those seven countries who have green cards or any type of H-1B visa not to travel outside the US," said Ava Benach, a partner at immigration law firm Benach Collopy LLP, while noting that the order takes effect immediately. 
 
Microsoft Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith said in a memo to staff at the weekend that company was working with affected personnel and that it supportedimmigration policies that "protect the public without sacrificing people's freedom of expression or religion". 
 
Microsoft also affirmed"the importance of protecting legitimate and law-abiding refugees whose very lives may be at stake in immigration proceedings", Smith wrote. 
   
Facebook's Zuckerberg said he was "concerned" by Trump's recent moves to restrict immigration. 
 
A blanket entry ban "is not the best way to address the country's challenges", Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk said on Twitter. 
 
"Many people negatively affected by this policy are strong supporters of the US," Musk wrote. "They've done right, not wrong and don't deserve to be rejected."</TEXT>
