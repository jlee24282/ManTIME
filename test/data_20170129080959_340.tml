<content type="str">Two Peterborough businesses have welcomed 2017 with a financial boost to kick start their expansion plans. 
 
Bluebell Farms Ltd and Northborough Community association applied to the Rural Peterborough and Rutland LEADER Programme for grant funding during 2016, and just before Christmas heard that their application had been approved. 
 
Based in Farcet, Peterborough, Bluebell Farms Ltd are looking to expand and diversify with a new farm shop, caf and outdoor activity and education centre. They were awarded 41,794.75 to help with the cost of the project. 
 
Lynn Briggs of Bluebell Farms said: &quot;We are delighted that our application has been successful and our project can now become a reality. The LEADER grant funding will allow us to provide the facilities to enhance our visitors&apos; experience. The additional resources will also support educational visits from local schools, allowing children to experience life on a working farm and to learn about food, farming and the environment.&quot; 
 
Northborough Community Association was granted, 29,996.46 to extend Northborough Village Hall. 
 
Jessica Phillips of Northborough Community Association said: &quot;This is fantastic news for us. The village hall is a well-used community resource, but we have struggled for space. The extension will allow us to expand and support village activities on a much larger scale moving our facilities to the 21st century.&quot; 
 
Delivered by Opportunity Peterborough, the city&apos;s economic development company, the Rural Peterborough and Rutland LEADER programme has 1 million of funding available for local projects that develop the economies of the rural Peterborough and Rutland areas.</content>
