Armed and determined, an 11-year-old Nelson Mandela Bay pupil is at the cutting edge of one of the country’s oldest sports, Olympic fencing. 

With the first fencing club having been established in South Africa in 1898, the formidable sport, which is known both as fencing and Olympic fencing, faced a number of challenges, including the country’s historic exclusion from international competition in the ensuing decades. 

But it has enjoyed a strong resurgence in recent years, with a number of clubs now well-established around the country. 

And St George’s Preparatory School pupil Ross Henderson is playing a leading role in promoting the sport among the youth, having recently convinced the head of his Port Elizabeth school to have the sport included as one of the institution’s sports-club activities. 

Confident and passionate about non-traditional school sports, Henderson created a PowerPoint presentation to convince his principal, Alex Hall, not only to include the activity at this school, but also to allow members of a fencing club to use the school’s premises as a base. 

The sport has gained increased traction over the past few years, and particularly after the first Eastern Cape Fencing Championships were held at NMMU’s Missionvale campus in 2015. 

At the third instalment of the championships, held last week in Port Alfred, Henderson – who has only been taking part in fencing “for a few months” – placed third in the under-13 category and walked away with a bronze medal.</content>
