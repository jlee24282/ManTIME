<content type="str">Manchester City made sure the Sam Allardyce bandwagon stayed in neutral with an ultimately comfortable FA Cup fourth-round win at Selhurst Park. 
 
With Vincent Kompany returning to the City starting XI, a full debut for Gabriel Jesus and a rare start for Fabian Delph it was far from a familiar side that took to the field, but still they had too much for Palace. A first-half strike from Raheem Sterling was matched by Leroy Sané after the break before Yaya Touré curled in a beautiful free-kick in added time. 
 
Pep Guardiola, resplendent in a coat of many zips, had opted to play with a youthful front three and there was anticipation from the off that the kids might cut loose for City against a Palace team yet to fully imbibe the Allardyce tonic for defensive incontinence.

The opening exchanges suggested as much, but City failed to make the most of their moments. Sané misconnected with a diving header in the second minute when it would have been easier to score from Sterling’s dinked cross. A minute later and Sterling himself was blocked at the last moment. City claimed four corners in the opening 10 minutes. 
 
As the game wore on, however, Palace grew into it. With their own unfamiliar line-up, especially in midfield where Lee Chung-yong and Jordon Mutch had been drafted in for rare starts, they were compact but competitive and had two great chances to open the scoring just after the half hour. 
 
Both came from set-pieces. The first arrived after Mutch cleverly drew a foul from Touré close to the City box, a challenge which also won the Ivorian a booking. Andros Townsend took the kick short and Mutch flicked the ball towards the six-yard box where Christian Benteke was unmarked but could only put his header over the bar. 
 
Two minutes later and the kick was on the left, 25 yards out. Lee took it and looped it high up in the air. As it came down at the back post, there was Mutch again, attempting a scissor-kick. It did not come off but did bounce around the box before eventually falling in front of James Tomkins who got his shot off and forced Willy Caballero into a diving save. 
 
Palace looked increasingly confident and started to push more men into the City half. That turned out to be their undoing. With two minutes of the half remaining Delph broke up a Palace move. His pass went straight to Jesus who, while not quite miraculously, showed great strength and technique to hold off his marker, spin and slice a pass right through the heart of the high Palace line and onto the onrushing Sterling. The England winger bore down on goal, kept his composure and finished calmly under Wayne Hennessey. 
 
Allardyce took Benteke off at the break, reinforcing suspicions he does not trust the Belgian to deliver the necessary work for his side. On came Loïc Rémy and the Frenchman should have equalised within two minutes. A cross from skipper Joel Ward was only scuffed clear by the City defence, Mutch drove another cross-shot back across goal where Rémy had time and space to drive the volley home. Instead it went over the bar.

As Selhurst Park suddenly became submerged in hail, City bounced back. Jesus should have done better with a header, Sterling cheekily backheeled the ball just wide of the post and Delph hit a low drive from 25 yards that Hennessey did well to turn wide. 
 
Finally, with 19 minutes remaining, City doubled their lead. Palace allowed David Silva to run with the ball from his own half to the edge of the home penalty area. It was three on three and Silva slipped the ball between two Palace defenders to find Sané, who applied another cool finish to score. . 
 
Sané went off with less than 10 minutes to go to a standing ovation from the travelling support and a ready-made replacement in Nolito. Palace, meanwhile, lost £11m signing Jeffrey Schlupp to injury. Those are the breaks in football and there was an air of resignation when, in the second minute of added time, Touré curled the ball into the top corner from 25 yards to wrap up the result.
