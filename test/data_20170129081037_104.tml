<content type="str">FARNHAM resident Diane Vasey is enjoying her new home for the next four months, as she puts herself forward as a volunteer in India, with WAGGGS, the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts. 
 
The association supports girls and young women to develop their full potential as leaders and active citizens of the world. 
 
Diane arrived at the Sangam World Centre in Pune, India (one of the movement’s five world centres) on December 29, for a four-month internship as guest services, which links in nicely with her role at the Mercure Bush Hotel in Farnham, where she has worked for the past 28 years, as sales and administration manager. 
 
The centre provides a unique and cultural experience for all those who choose to volunteer with them – programmes include international events, volunteering at Sangam and volunteering in the community. 
 
“My background in guiding is that I have been in the movement for 50 years. At present I am assistant guider to my daughter Rachel, who is the leader of Rowledge Guides and Rainbows,” said Diane. 
 
“This is my third visit to Sangam World Centre, the first visit was back in 2011 when I fell in love with both India and the people. 
 
“Then I was a tare (star in Hindi) and worked for three months in a creche on a building site – just one of the projects Sangam support in the city of Pune. 
 
“This time my work is slightly different I am assisting in the reception services, taking familiarisation trips around Pune, delivering sessions to girl guides staying with us from all corners of the world. 
 
“If anyone is thinking of volunteering with WAGGS, I would really recommend it – age is no barrier, I’m 62 years young.”
