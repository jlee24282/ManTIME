<content type="str">29th Jan 2017 5:00 PM THE Wide Bay Capricorn Branch Senior Surf Life Saving Championships served as a successful dress rehearsal for the state titles. 
 
The WBC Branch titles were held from Friday, January 27, to Sunday, January 29, and featured the best athletes from branches in Hervey Bay, Bundaberg, and Gladstone. 
 
While the titles were hard-fought, they served as the perfect warm-up for the Surf Life Saving Queensland Youth Championships, which will be held at Hervey Bay on February 17-19. 
 
Thousands of athletes are expected to descend on the Fraser Coast for the three-day event. 
 
It is one of three major competitions to be held in Hervey Bay next month, alongside the Central Coast Regional Athletics Championships on February 4-5 and the Queensland School Sport 13-19yrs Triathlon Championships on February 23-24.</content>
