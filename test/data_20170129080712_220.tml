<TEXT type="str">A bigger issue 
 
I think the voter fraud deniers need to understand something. Yes, Trump won the election, but it is not about this election. It is about the future of this country. It is about whether we have legal votes for president or votes that have been flooded by dead people, illegal immigrants or people voting several times. It is about future elections. The American people are not as dumb as the Democrats thought, and that showed up when Trump got elected. 
 
Promise broken 
 
I saw in the News-Press that President Trump is backing away from his promise to introduce a constitutional amendment to limit terms for congressmen and senators. That is one more of his promises he is breaking. This is one of the most important measures that need to be in even though the Republican congress would probably defeat it. It would be a good start. 
 
Fix the potholes 
 
I sure hope that the City of St. Joseph and MoDOT fix the holes in our roads before the 50,000 to 500,000 people come here to view the solar eclipse in August. How embarrassing it will be for our city and state when the visitors have to dodge huge potholes when traveling to restaurants, shops, hotels and viewing sites? 
 
Pervasive intolerance  
 
Their words and conduct since the presidential election continue to reveal a pervasive intolerance among so-called progressives to any opinion other than their own. 
 
Keep Canada friendly 
 
The estimated cost to build the wall between the United States and Mexico is $12 to $14 billion. I am glad Trump doesn’t have anything against the Canadians, because if he wanted to build that wall it would be five times as much money. 
 
Clean it up 
 
Regarding the safety issue with Pat Jones and her voting negative, why can’t she clean up her own neighborhood of Industrial City, right down the street from her? It is a mess, there is junk, big trucks parked, trailers, that bar is stacked full in there. Something needs to be done with that area. 
 
More disgrace 
 
In reference to &quot;A disgrace,&quot; what about all the Republicans who didn’t go to the inauguration, all the Republicans who had been against Trump and then did a 180-degree turn around? They are disgraceful too. 
 
Beating around the bush 
 
In reference to David Muir’s interview with Trump Wednesday night, I thought Trump was very rude to David. He beat around the bush many times. Every question that David asked him, he could give very few answers. Everything was &quot;I&quot; or &quot;me,&quot; and I don’t think that is very cool. Heaven help us.</TEXT>
