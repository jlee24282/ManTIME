1. Latigo Ranch, Kremmling, Colo.

2. White Stallion Ranch, Tucson, Ariz.

3. Devil&apos;s Thumb Ranch, Tabernash, Colo. 
 
Stay in a cabin or the lodge and get cozy near one of 45 flickering fireplaces. Enjoy local specialties in the lodge dining room where a three-story, three-hearth fireplace, comprising hand-stacked stones, warms winter visitors. Grab the binoculars to catch a glimpse of wildlife roaming on this 6,000-acre expanse of Colorado beauty or set out on the Nordic trails for an up-close view of winter scenes. Plan for a soak or scrub in the 18,000-square-foot spa where young cowpokes are invited for kid-friendly mini-massages or tween-bee facials. Contact: devilsthumbranch.com 
 
4. Westgate River Ranch, River Ranch, Fla. 
 
You&apos;ll be just an hour from Orlando and within 30 minutes of Legoland. But you&apos;ll feel a world away once you arrive at the largest dude ranch east of the Mississippi. Situated on 1,700 acres of wilderness in Florida&apos;s cattle country, the ranch offers a menu of lodging options that include glamping-style tents, lodge rooms and two-bedroom cabins.

A kids&apos; program for young wranglers 6-12 encourages snow play and sports as well as a &quot;dine and dash&quot; dinner program that allows the kids to return to friends and fun while the adults enjoy a leisurely meal and relaxing fireside conversation. Upscale and all-inclusive, summer on the ranch offers traditional riding programs, fly-fishing, barn dances, treasure hunts and mountain hiking. Contact: vistaverde.com
