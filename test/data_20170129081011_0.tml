Rawan Suleiman, assistant foreign minister for multilateral affairs who was named as Palestine’s ambassador to Holland and international organizations based there, presented Saturday her credentials to Dutch Foreign Minister, Bert Koenders, in ceremonies held at the foreign ministry in Amsterdam. 
 
Sulaiman told Koenders that President Mahmoud Abbas sends his greeting to the king of Holland, stressing the Palestinian leadership’s keenness to develop and enhance bilateral relations between the two countries in all fields. 
 
Sulaiman briefed the Dutch foreign minister on the latest developments in occupied Palestine, urging Holland to play an active role also within the European Union to bring to an end the illegal Israeli settlement activities that threaten chances of peace. 
 
Koenders reiterated his country’s support for the two-state solution, wishing Sulaiman success in her task.
