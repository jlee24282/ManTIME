<TEXT type="str">PDTA players endured sweltering conditions over the weekend. 

The weather was hot and so was the tennis at Wattle Range on Saturday.

Players of the Penola and District Tennis Association endured warm conditions on Saturday afternoon, when Wattle Range Gold took on Naracoorte and Wattle Range Green battled it out against Monbulla.

Coonawarra and Penola beat the heat on Friday night, playing each other on the McCorquindale Park courts at 7pm.
