<TEXT type="str">Production has commenced on Black Panther, Marvel Studios announced Thursday. The Ryan Coogler-directed film will shoot in Atlanta and South Korea. 
 
Chadwick Boseman reprises the title role of Wakandan king T&apos;Challa. The cast also includes Michael B. Jordan (Creed, Fantastic Four), Oscar winner Lupita Nyong’o (Star Wars: The Force Awakens), Danai Gurira (The Walking Dead), Daniel Kaluuya (Get Out, Sicario), Angela Bassett (American Horror Story, Green Lantern), Oscar winner Forest Whitaker (Rogue One), Letitia Wright (Urban Hymn), Winston Duke (Person of Interest), and Sterling K. Brown (The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story). 
 
Boseman&apos;s not the only actor making his return to the Marvel Cinematic Universe with Black Panther. Captain America: Civil War&apos;s Martin Freeman, John Kani, and Florence Kasumba are back as Everett Ross, T&apos;Chaka, and T&apos;Challa&apos;s security chief Ayo, respectively. (T&apos;Chaka&apos;s appearance in the film lends credence to the report that the film includes a flashback to the 1990s .) Marvel also confirmed that Andy Serkis will reprise his Avengers: Age of Ultron role as the villainous Ulysses Klaw.

Here&apos;s the official plot synopsis: &quot;Black Panther follows T’Challa who, after the events of Captain America: Civil War, returns home to the isolated, technologically advanced African nation of Wakanda to take his place as King. However, when an old enemy reappears on the radar, T’Challa’s mettle as King and Black Panther is tested when he is drawn into a conflict that puts the entire fate of Wakanda and the world at risk.&quot; 
 
Coogler co-wrote the Black Panther screenplay with Joe Robert Cole (The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story). Kevin Feige is producing with Louis D’Esposito, Victoria Alonso, Nate Moore, Jeffrey Chernov and Stan Lee serving as executive producers.
