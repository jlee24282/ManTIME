<content type="str">Rajesh Sawant, the India Under-19 trainer, was found dead in his hotel room in Mumbai on Sunday. According to BCCI sources, the cause of death seemed to be a heart attack. 

Sawant was in Mumbai helping the team prepare for the series against England Under-19, which begins tomorrow. 

&quot;What I have gathered so far,&quot; BCCI joint secretary Amitabh Choudhary was quoted as saying by Sportstar, &quot;is he did not report for team activities in the morning, so people started looking for him and eventually he was found to have passed away in his room. I have asked Prof. Shetty (Ratnakar Shetty, general manager - game development) to visit the site and keep me updated.&quot; 

Sawant had been part of the Afghanistan coaching staff in the past and worked with the India A teams that played the England XI in the two List A matches earlier this month. Sawant had also trained the Rest of India side ahead of the 2016-17 Irani Cup match against Gujarat.</content>
