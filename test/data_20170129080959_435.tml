<TEXT type="str">The Defence Headquarters on Friday alerted Nigerians to a new tactic being adopted by female suicide bombers in the North East. 
 
Brigadier General Rabe Abubakar, Acting Director Defence Information, in a statement said such bombers were now evading detection from security operatives by carrying babies on their back, which ordinarily passed them for innocent nursing mothers. 
 
“The two recent suicide bomb attacks in Madagali, Adamawa State are instructive in this regard,” he said. 
 
“The DHQ wishes to seize this opportunity to appeal to members of the public to be patient and cooperate with the military and other security agencies while carrying out thorough security search and checks as the essence is to nip in the bud the murderous intention of the Boko Haram suicide bombers. 
 
“The DHQ wishes to state further that the usual traffic “go-slow” at military and security check points as a result of rigorous security checks are not meant to cause public discomfort or a deliberate action to induce traffic disruptions on our roads, but an effort put in place towards protecting the lives and properties of our innocent citizens. 
 
“Members of the public are therefore urged to always volunteer useful information to the military and other security agencies that would assist in exposing Boko Haram and their evil machinations in our society and to make our communities safe and secure for all to live”, he stated.</TEXT>
