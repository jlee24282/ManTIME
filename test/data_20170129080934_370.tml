<TEXT type="str">To celebrate National Mentoring Month in January, Mentor Duluth will highlight outstanding matches. Mentor Duluth pairs caring adults with kids who can benefit from positive role models. 
  
This week&apos;s match is Nancy and Sara. 
 
Nancy and Sara were matched in 2008 and during the past nine years they&apos;ve cooked together, gone to numerous plays and craft fairs, and attend the Animal Allies Walk every year. They both love to shop, eat, go to movies and love almost anything with animals involved. 
 
Sara says, &quot;Nancy has really helped me develop a love of art fairs and &apos;older&apos; music.&quot; Nancy added, &quot;What I learned from Sara and her mom was about perseverance and determination. When the going gets tough, you keep fighting. There were a lot of road blocks along the way for Sara and Mia, but they would pick themselves up and work hard to overcome the obstacles. I admire that. Sara has excellent values regarding what things are important in life because of this journey and the things she has experienced.&quot; 
 
The two shared the same most memorable experience. It took place when they made Italian food during one of their first times together. Nancy says, &quot;I still talk about the first time Sara came over to cook, and I wanted her to help me make meatballs. She had to squish the meat together in her hands, and I think it was one of the biggest gross out moments in her life. I still remember the look on her face. I was afraid she was never going to come back.&quot; 
 
Sara said of her experience with Nancy, &quot;It was very valuable for me to have another guardian/adult that I could form a new, neutral relationship with. The experience helped me find out what kind of person I wanted to be and Nancy was a compassionate, gentle guiding hand in that search.&quot; Nancy says it was special watching Sara &quot;...grow and develop into the mature young woman she is today, and to be able to share in this experience is priceless.&quot;
