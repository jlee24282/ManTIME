<TEXT type="str">Government will award 400 scholarships for tertiary education in the 2017/2018 academic year, Education Minister Anthony Garcia announced yesterday.

As he did so, he urged the country’s top 200 students in the 2016 Secondary Entrance Assessment Examination to aspire to earn such scholarships when their secondary education ends in the next five years. 

“I want to see you lift yourselves as you climb higher so that in five years, many of you will be in line to receive these scholarships,” Garcia told the SE A honourees during a function at the National Energy Skills Centre, Rivulet Road, Couva. 

He noted the Education Ministry will look into providing continuous training for teachers so they can deliver the best curriculum. 

“We of this ministry will provide the best tools for teachers too,” Garcia said. 

On the registration of children for entry into primary schools, Garcia said he recently learned of a school in Port-of-Spain where parents had to line up from 4 am to get forms. “If our aim is to ensure equal access to education for all our students that situation must come to an end,” he said. He said the ministry issued a circular asking all primary schools principals to allow access to students across the board. 

On the topic of rebuilding ‘aged’ schools, Garcia said this is a slow process. He said there are teachers who encourage parents to remove their children and close down schools for the slightest reasons. 

“This is preventing access of education for our children,” Garcia said, noting parents and teachers should work together to ensure children have access to quality education. Garcia assisted in distributing certificates to students and school representatives at the function. 

He also said his ministry will implement new methods to help students who scored 30 percent in SE A and are placed into the secondary schools system. 

Top SE A student for 2016, Caitlin Brooker, of the Trinidad Muslim League (TML) Primary School, San Fernando, thanked her parents, teachers and all those who helped her to score high marks. Brooker, who now attends Naparima Girls’ High School, said she wants to make Trinidad and Tobago a better place. 

Minister in the Ministry of Education Dr Francis Lovell, in his remarks, urged students to work hard since a good education will provide a solid foundation in life. 

Couva MP Rudranath Indarsingh attended the function. Chief Education Officer Harrilal Seecharan gave the vote of thanks.</TEXT>
