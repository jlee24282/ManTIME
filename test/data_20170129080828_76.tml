<content type="str">U.S. President Donald Trump has assured the Australian government he will honor a deal to take around 2,000 asylum seeker from Australia&apos;s offshore processing centers at Manus Island and Nauru, local media reported on Sunday. 
 
The 25-minute conversation was their first since the billionaire&apos;s inauguration last weekend. 
 
President Donald Trump has told Australia&apos;s Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull that the United States government will honour the refugee resettlement deal struck with former President Obama. 
 
It came just days after Mr Trump&apos;s decision to put a four-month block on refugees entering the US. 
 
News that Mr Trump won&apos;t overturn his predecessor&apos;s arrangement with Australia puts to rest months of concern about the future of the deal that could finally resolve the plight of numerous refugees on Nauru and Manus Island. 
 
The Greens leader urged Turnbull to tell Trump: &quot;This is the wrong way, go back, you are a country that holds itself out to be a beacon of values of liberty, of freedom, well then you are not the America that we want to continue to have a relationship with&apos;&quot;. A two paragraph statement from the White House said both leaders &quot;emphasised the enduring strength and closeness of the US-Australia relationship that is critical for peace, stability and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region and globally&quot;. 
 
Mr Turnbull was looking forward to the conversation on Saturday. 
 
The deal has been in limbo since Mr Trump&apos;s election and more so since the president&apos;s executive orders on Friday to ban refugees from Syria and a 90-day suspension on the entry of nationals from Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. 
 
&apos;We have got to make a choice, we are either a lap dog to the U.S. and fall in behind them no matter what they do. or we take a stand and we recognise there has to be a line drawn around what are moral issues, &apos; Senator Di Natale told Sky News. 
 
Mr Turnbull has been invited to visit Washington sometime this year.</content>
