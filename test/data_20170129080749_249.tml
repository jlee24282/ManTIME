<TITLE>Poet Gladys Hidalgo  performs Jan. 30 at Ralph's</TITLE>
<TEXT>In the poem Lost, Lynn poet Gladys Hidalgo illustrates a fierce honesty. Anarchy imprinted in my mixed blood, she writes, I contain the history of the south east even the west if you fly in the right direction /My pen bleeds the tears I refuse to shed for the fallen/soldiers of a war weve been fighting since the beginning of time/Its never been so hard to be yourself. Theres a raw, emotional truth to her writing, one that makes her work compelling.
