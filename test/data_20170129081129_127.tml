<TITLE>James Stewart's Royal Rumble Preview: Goldberg's Road to Wrestlemania</TITLE>
<TEXT>Undertaker was installed at the head of Sky Bet's Royal Rumble market following his announcement on Raw that he was to compete in this year's event. 
 
When is the 2017 WWE Royal Rumble? I am going to find a way to make him pay for what he did to me. 
 
According to The Wrestling Observer Newsletter , the highly-anticipated rematch between Goldberg and Lesnar will main event the show while Roman Reigns will battle with The Undertaker in the other high profile match. 
 
"I wouldn't want to call it easy because there was a lot of work behind the scenes that nobody ever really got to see", he said. So if you're asking me who will win, I'll go with Bill Goldberg. Seth is back in, but as the No. 1 entrant. 
 
Kenny Omega appeared on the Wrestling Observer Radio show to discuss his future. There are so many options, and expect to see some surprises. 
 
Eric Young vs. Tye Dillinger and Roderick Strong vs. Andrade "Cien" Almas also are featured. 
 
There's not enough attention being placed on Cena potentially tying Ric Flair's record of 16 world titles.

What superstar do you think will make a surprise appearance? 
 
He has been getting a major push during the pre-Rumble season and even bigger plans are kept for him for the Wrestlemania season. 
 
Tickets for Wrestlemania Axxess in Orlando will go on-sale next week, but fans can gain access to a presale starting this Monday morning. Styles complaining to Shane McMahon like that is by design. Well, they won't ignore him any more . The two-hour countdown show starts at 5 pm and the four-hour Rumble starts at 7 pm. Having Lesnar win here allows the Paul Heyman client to recapture some of the momentum he lost with that ill-advised defeat while also putting him back into the title picture, which is where he belongs as a physically imposing force who's a huge draw. 
 
"If there's a way to get myself involved, I'll try to figure it out one way or the other", he said. 
 
Faade will also head overseas next month as he leaves for Nigeria on February 15 and returns on the February 21. As for the USA market, Nakamura already has every wrestling fan and NXT fan in his pocket and with his natural charisma it would probably not take him that much time to get the casual audience behind him also. 
 
The bookings were a result of Faade wrestling on two trips to Russian Federation. 
 
Being a little predictable and formulaic is a criticism often levied the way of the sports entertainment giant in the past, but this is one time of year you can always count on the company to produce the goods when it comes to content and storytelling. 
 
More on Faade's experience soon. Much of that is attributed to the legends and the new (revisited) dynamic of brand competition. 
 
There are, at time of writing, nine spots left in the 2017 Royal Rumble. 
 
There are always a few veterans or retirees that enter the Royal Rumble so why not Booker T? "I need an outlet and I feel like I'm not doing something WWE related right now ... it's hard to take a day off". 
 
WWE's  Royal Rumble begins the road to the WrestleMania . He's been in NXT since 2015 and is more than ready for the challenges of the main roster (as I stated in a past post).</TEXT>
