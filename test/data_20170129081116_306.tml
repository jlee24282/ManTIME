<TEXT type="str">Aliens director James Cameron has shared his candid thoughts on the Alien franchise and questioned whether there was even a need to continue it when asked about the forthcoming Alien: Covenant, which opens this summer. 
 
&quot;The franchise has kind of wandered all over the map,&quot; Cameron told  Vulture . &quot;Ridley [Scott] did the first film, and he inspired an entire generation of filmmakers and science-fiction fans with that one movie and there have been so many films that stylistically have derived from it, including my own Aliens, which was the legitimate sequel and, I think, the proper heir to his film. I sort of did it as a fanboy. I wanted to honor his film, but also say what I needed to say. After that, I don&apos;t take any responsibility.&quot; 
 
As for the franchise post-Aliens, &quot;I don&apos;t think it&apos;s worked out terribly well. I think we&apos;ve moved on beyond it. It&apos;s like, okay, we&apos;ve got it, we&apos;ve got the whole Freudian biomechanoid meme. I&apos;ve seen it in 100 horror films since. I think both of those films stand at a certain point in time, as a reference point. But is there any validity to doing another one now? I don&apos;t know. Maybe. Let&apos;s see, jury&apos;s out. Let&apos;s see what Ridley comes up with.&quot; 
 
&quot;Let me just add to that — and don&apos;t cut this part off, please — I will stand in line for any Ridley Scott movie, even a not-so-great one, because he is such an artist, he&apos;s such a filmmaker. I always learn from him. And what he does with going back to his own franchise would be fascinating.&quot; 
 
Meanwhile, Cameron will regain the screen rights to the Terminator film franchise in 2019, and reportedly wants Deadpool&apos;s Tim Miller to direct another installment/reboot. Cameron is also developing multiple sequels to his 2009 blockbuster Avatar, the highest-grossing film of all time.</TEXT>
