<TITLE>College Basketball: Fairfield rallies past Marist</TITLE>
<TEXT>BRIDGEPORT  The frustration finally got to be too much for Fairfield to take. 
 
After a lackluster first half against Marist, a half where the Stags found themselves down double digits and playing like a team that was just going through the motions, a collective look in the mirror, along with some mad-as-hell-and-not-going-to-take-it-anymore moments, ala the movie Network, saw Fairfield put together a solid second half, turning a six-point halftime hole into a 72-62 win Saturday afternoon at the Webster Bank Arena . 
 
I dont know if it was anything that was said but I think we prepared ourselves differently coming into this game, Stags coach Sydney Johnson said. We re-committed ourselves to playing better team defense so it had to come out. It wasnt great in the first half (allowing 40 points) but it came together in the second half. 
 
After allowing Marist to shoot 48 percent in the first half and shoot 16 free throws (making 15), Fairfield held the Red Foxes to just 31.3 percent shooting over the final 20 minutes, pressuring them into missing all nine 3-point attempts and letting them score just 22 points. 
 
We talked a lot about our defensive intensity going into the second half, senior forward Amadou Sidibe said. And thats exactly what we did. We didnt wait to get punched, we threw the first punch and we kept punching. 
 
And those punches knocked the Red Foxes  still winless in 10 career tries at the Webster Bank Arena  back against the ropes and never allowed them to fight their way out of the corner. 
 
Its been a common thing, weve had big leads before, Marist coach Mike Maker said. And when things start going South for us, we cave in, it goes really fast. Some of that is youth and immaturity, we have a very young roster  were just not mentally tough. I just think theyre settling for less than theyre capable of. 
 
In the first half, with Kristinn Palsson scoring 11 points and Isaiah Lamb adding 12, the Red Foxes used mini-runs of six points and seven points to take a 36-23 lead over Fairfield with 3:21 left. But the Stags put together a half-ending 11-4 burst, highlighted by a 3-pointer from Curtis Cobb with six seconds left after Thomas Nolan had stolen the inbounds pass with 10 seconds to play to get the Stags back in the game at 40-34. 
 
We were getting some good shots but they werent falling so we knew we had to keep defending, Cobb said. We knew the shots would start falling in the second half and as long as we continued our defensive effort, wed be OK. 
 
Down 44-37 with 18:37 to go, Fairfield went on a 23-4 run over the next 11 minutes as that Stags defense forced Marist to miss seven straight shots and eventually, 10 of 11 shots in taking a 60-48 lead with 7:30 left. The Red Foxes never got closer than six the rest of the way. 
 
Tyler Nelson led Fairfield with 21 points with Cobbs 20 right behind. Jerry Johnson Jr. added 14 and Jonathan Kasibabu scored six points, grabbed nine rebounds and blocked four shots. Lamb finished with 14 to pace Marist with Brian Parker scoring 13. For Cobb, it was his first double-figure game in the last five for the sophomore guard. 
 
Ive been a little down with some nagging injuries  they were bothering me a bit but the guys kept pulling me up, Cobb said. They kept telling me to shoot and be aggressive so thats what it was. 
 
Saturdays win was the start of a four-game home stand at the WBA  Manhattan on Tuesday, Niagara on Thursday and Quinnipiac on Feb. 6  make or break time for the Stags to get back into the upper half of the MAAC standings. 
 
We took a couple of days off after Monmouth (a 91-49 loss on January 22) and when we came back we said we were starting over and were getting back to what we do well, Johnson said. Were focusing on the strengths of the team. It all kind of came together today.
