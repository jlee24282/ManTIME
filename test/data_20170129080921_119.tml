At St. Clement’s High School, the St. John’s Boys Cadets took on St. Raphael of Medford. The game went right down to the buzzer with Luke Pulaski saving the day for St. John’s.　 
 
St. John’s struck first on a Zach Barden put-back, which was countered by a St. Raphael field goal. Cam O’Brien drained a jumper and then laid one in off a perfect feed from Pulaski. 
 
The game remained close as St. John’s used its height advantage with Zach Barden dominating inside, scoring all 11 of his points. With 2:54 left in the half, a Johnny Cuttle 3-pointer assisted by Andrew Augustin gave St. John’s its biggest lead of 23-14 but it did not last.

Andrew Augustin made a 3-pointer and after a turnover, Luke Pulaski scored inside to even the game. St. Raphael made one of two from the free throw line but on the miss, Cam O’Brien found Augustin for a lay up and 31-30 lead. 
 
Augustin then stole the inbounds and fed O’Brien for a 3-pointer to make it 34-30. The next few minutes was frantic, with both teams storming back and forth. With the game even, Augustin drove the lane for a floater to make it 40-38 St. John’s with 6:36 left. 
 
Suddenly, the momentum changed. St. Raphael scored the next seven points to take a 45-40 lead. The comeback began with another O’Brien 3-pointer to cut the lead to two. A Medford free throw followed as St. John’s desperately looked for an open shot. 
 
They finally got it. 
 
With 2:21 left, Kaden Quirk hit a big 3-pointer from the right corner to even the game at 46-46. St. Raphael retook the lead, but Luke Pulaski kicked out a pass to O’Brien for another three to give St. John’s a 49-48 lead with 1:28 left but they couldn’t hold it. 
 
St. Raphael scored and then grabbed a turnover. Forced to foul, St. John’s was called for an intentional foul. It gave Medford two free throws and the ball. Luck was with St. John’s as they missed both free throws. 
 
On the ensuing inbounds pass, O’Brien fouled out of the game and put St. Raphael at the line again in a one and one situation. They missed again and St. John’s had one last shot. After working the ball around the perimeter, Augustin drove to the basket and was fouled with six seconds left. 
 
Augustin had already achieved a double-double with 11 points and 11 rebounds, but his free throws both were off the mark. Luke Pulaski slipped through to grab the second miss. Finding himself situated behind the rim, Pulaski used his left hand to go in for a reverse lay-up and it fell through with three seconds left. 
 
St. Raphael could not in-bounds the ball as time expired, and St. John’s escaped with a 51-50 road win.　 
 
St. John’s was led by three players with double digits in scoring, Cam O’Brien (15 points, five rebounds), Andrew Augstin (11 points, 11 rebounds, five steals, four blocks, and four assists), and Zach Barden (11 points, nine rebounds, two blocks). None of that mattered without Pulaski’s (six points, nine rebounds) last second clutch rebound and basket.
