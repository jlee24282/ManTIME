Broghan Laundry stole a pass and went coast-to-coast to make it 6-1 at the 9:58 mark.

The game remained close as St. Johns used its height advantage with Zach Barden dominating inside, scoring all 11 of his points. With 2:54 left in the half, a Johnny Cuttle 3-pointer assisted by Andrew Augustin gave St. Johns its biggest lead of 23-14 but it did not last.

Andrew Augustin made a 3-pointer and after a turnover, Luke Pulaski scored inside to even the game. St. Raphael made one of two from the free throw line but on the miss, Cam OBrien found Augustin for a lay up and 31-30 lead. 
 
Augustin then stole the inbounds and fed OBrien for a 3-pointer to make it 34-30. The next few minutes was frantic, with both teams storming back and forth. With the game even, Augustin drove the lane for a floater to make it 40-38 St. Johns with 6:36 left. 
 
Suddenly, the momentum changed. St. Raphael scored the next seven points to take a 45-40 lead. The comeback began with another OBrien 3-pointer to cut the lead to two. A Medford free throw followed as St. Johns desperately looked for an open shot. 
 
They finally got it. 
 
With 2:21 left, Kaden Quirk hit a big 3-pointer from the right corner to even the game at 46-46. St. Raphael retook the lead, but Luke Pulaski kicked out a pass to OBrien for another three to give St. Johns a 49-48 lead with 1:28 left but they couldnt hold it. 
 
St. Raphael scored and then grabbed a turnover. Forced to foul, St. Johns was called for an intentional foul. It gave Medford two free throws and the ball. Luck was with St. Johns as they missed both free throws. 
 
On the ensuing inbounds pass, OBrien fouled out of the game and put St. Raphael at the line again in a one and one situation. They missed again and St. Johns had one last shot. After working the ball around the perimeter, Augustin drove to the basket and was fouled with six seconds left. 
 
Augustin had already achieved a double-double with 11 points and 11 rebounds, but his free throws both were off the mark. Luke Pulaski slipped through to grab the second miss. Finding himself situated behind the rim, Pulaski used his left hand to go in for a reverse lay-up and it fell through with three seconds left. 
 
St. Raphael could not in-bounds the ball as time expired, and St. Johns escaped with a 51-50 road win. 
 
St. Johns was led by three players with double digits in scoring, Cam OBrien (15 points, five rebounds), Andrew Augstin (11 points, 11 rebounds, five steals, four blocks, and four assists), and Zach Barden (11 points, nine rebounds, two blocks). None of that mattered without Pulaskis (six points, nine rebounds) last second clutch rebound and basket.
