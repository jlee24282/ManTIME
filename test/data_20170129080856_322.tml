<TITLE>LUFC Monk - We Will Have To Make Changes</TITLE>
<TEXT>Leeds United head coach Garry Monk is promising to make a number of changes to his side for the FA Cup tie at Sutton United. 

With Leeds back in Championship action at Blackburn Rovers in midweek, Monk will once again rotate his squad for the potential banana-skin cup-tie. 

"We will have to make changes, we have a game against Blackburn Rovers the following Wednesday," Monk told the Leeds official website. 

"We have to get the balance right in the squad to be competitive in both games, so there will be changes because we have to think about the squad correctly. 

"Our aim doesn`t change, we want to win, we have that mentality, we want to go to Sutton and put on a good performance. 

"Whoever steps on that pitch knows exactly what is expected of them and the levels they need to reach, I have confidence in all of my players and all of the squad. 

Monk will welcome Liam Cooper and Hadi Sacko back into the squad after recovering from injury and Marco Silvestri, Lewie Coyle, Tyler Denton, Kalvin Phillips, Matt Grimes and Marcus Antonsson could all feature having started the third round tie at Cambridge United. 

Leeds have also taken a number of youngsters with them to Sutton with Bailey Peacock Farrell, Mallik Wilks, Jack Vann, Tom Pearce and Mike Taylor all making the trip. 

One player definitely rested is defender Pontus Jansson with the on loan Swedish international not travelling with the squad.
