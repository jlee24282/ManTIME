<TEXT type="str">BERLIN (Kyodo) -- Japan&apos;s Nao Kodaira continued her perfect start to the season with another World Cup win on Saturday, making it six from six in the women&apos;s 500 meters. 
 
The 30-year-old logged a 37.57-second time to finish well ahead of Karolina Erbanova of the Czech Republic (38.28) and American Heather Bergsma (38.43), but could not match her 37.43-second performance from a day earlier. 
 
&quot;Ideally, I would have surpassed the record from yesterday,&quot; Kodaira said. &quot;I started off well with the right stance...but I then carried on with a calm mindset rather than being battle-ready and I ended up adjusting my movements along the way.&quot; 
 
Japan&apos;s Maki Tsuji came fourth in 38.44, and Erina Kamiya sixth in 38.58.</TEXT>
