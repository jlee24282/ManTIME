<TEXT type="str">Jaxon Castor denied two of the most dangerous scorers in the USHL on shootout attempts Saturday night to backstop the Dubuque Fighting Saints to a 2-1 victory at Muskegon. 
 
Castor stopped Andrei Svechnikov and Collin Adams, while Colin Theisen and Cole Guttman converted their opportunities in the skills competition. Castor improved to 21-8-2, lowered his goals against average to 2.06 and raised his save percentage to .914 one night after being pulled early in the first period. 
 
&quot;I kind of had an idea of what they like to do after talking to (Keenan Suthers) before the shootout,&quot; Castor said of his teammate who began the season with the Lumberjacks. &quot;Fortunately, Svechnikov shot it right into my glove, and Adams missed the net. It was a little lucky, but sometimes you have to have a little luck to win. 
 
&quot;It&apos;s pretty tough, letting in three goals on four shots, but there&apos;s nothing you can do about it once it&apos;s happened. I knew I had to come out and have a good game tonight, and thankfully the guys in front of me had a great game. I knew I had more than that, and I knew our team had more than what we showed in the first five minutes (Friday), so I wasn&apos;t too worried about how we&apos;d respond.&quot; 
 
Dubuque improved to 24-10-3 for 51 points and maintained sole possession of second place in the Eastern Conference, two points ahead of Muskegon (23-12-3, 49 points). 
 
The teams evenly split the four-game season series, which featured four one-goal games and shootout games on the final two nights. The Lumberjacks took Friday night’s game, 4-3, in a shootout. 
 
One night after surrendering three goals on five shots in the first 5 minutes, the Saints started considerably better. Dubuque’s Michael Boyle dropped the gloves with Matt Steeves just 9 seconds into the game, and the Saints tightened defensively to hold the Lumberjacks without a shot for the first 8:05. 
 
Regen Cavanagh staked the Saints to a 1-0 lead at the 11:54 mark. Austin Rueschhoff won a faceoff back to Patrick Kudla, who slid the puck along the blue line to defense partner Jacob Semik. Cavanagh drove to the net and deposited Semik’s backdoor pass under goalie Adam Brizgala for his seventh goal of the season. 
 
&quot;It really started with Boyle having that absolutely huge fight right off the draw, because that gave the boys a lot of momentum,&quot; Cavanagh said. &quot;I can&apos;t take credit for my goal. Rueschhoff had a great faceoff win to Kuddy, and Semik had unbelievable vision to pretty much put it right on my tape. It was a great team effort. 
 
&quot;We came out flat (Friday) night. We saw what we did wrong and wanted to make sure that didn&apos;t happen again.&quot; 
 
Dubuque finished with a 15-4 advantage in first-period shots. The Lumberjacks generated more offense in the second period, when they outshot the Saints, 10-4, but neither team scored despite two power plays each. 
 
Muskegon tied the game with 6:32 remaining in regulation while enjoying a 5-on-3 power play. Andrei Svechnikov wired a one-timer from the slot past goaltender Jaxon Castor’s outstretched glove hand. Bo Hanson set up Svechnikov’s 19th goal of the season. Svechnikov leads all USHL rookies in scoring with 36 points. 
 
Muskegon had two Grade A chances to win the game late in regulation and in overtime. But Castor stopped Adams in both instances. 
 
The Lumberjacks went 1-for-4 on the power play, while Dubuque failed to convert on its five opportunities. 
 
Muskegon finished with a 28-23 advantage in overall shots on goal. The Lumberjacks outshot Dubuque, 24-8, over the final two periods and overtime. 
 
&quot;It&apos;s kind of quirky the way this weekend turned out,&quot; Saints associate head coach JB Bittner said. &quot;We obviously had the rough start (Friday) night, but, for the most part, we felt we played really well after that. (Saturday) night we played really well in the beginning and kind of ran out of gas in the end. 
 
&quot;But the thing is this was two really good teams going at it this weekend. Both teams played really well at times. The times when we weren&apos;t playing well, it was mainly because Muskegon was doing a lot of things really well. They were two really good hockey games.&quot; 
 
Guttman saw his league-leading 12-game point streak come to an end. He managed two shots on goal. 
 
The Saints continue a four-game road trip Thursday and Friday with games at Sioux Falls and Des Moines before they return home Saturday night against Cowbell Cup rival Cedar Rapids at Mystique Community Ice Center.</TEXT>
