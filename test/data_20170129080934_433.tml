As of January 31, 2017, CBS Local will no longer be a part of the mPLUS Rewards network. 
At that time, registered users will no longer accrue points by visiting CBS Local sites; however, users will be 
able to start earning and redeeming mPLUS reward points following the instructions below. 

 
Don&apos;t worry -- you will not lose your mPLUS Rewards account or any of your points. 
You can keep enjoying mPLUS Rewards in many other apps. 
 Here&apos;s how: 
Check out the mPLus Rewards apps in iTunes or find one on the mPLUS Rewards website.  Download an app you&apos;re interested in &amp; log into mPLUS Rewards.  You&apos;ll see your point balance &amp; can start earning points again!
