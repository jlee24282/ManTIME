<TEXT type="str">The Georgia Northwestern Bobcats matched the visiting Oxford-Emory Eagles basket for basket in the first half. But when the second half began, the Bobcats simply couldn&apos;t keep up the pace. 
 
The Eagles from Covington used a decisive 22-4 run to open the second half on Saturday and knocked off the Bobcats, 77-61, sending a Rec League Night crowd home from the Rossville Athletic Center disappointed. 
 
Georgia Northwestern, who had been riding a four-game winning streak, has now lost two in a row to drop back to .500 on the season. 
 
The first 20 minutes on Saturday saw the lead change hands four times and witnessed three ties, though neither team led by more than a handful of points. 
 
Oxford-Emory&apos;s biggest lead was four points, while Georgia Northwestern enjoyed a six-point cushion late in the half. 
 
The Eagles would score six straight points to tie things up at 28 with just over a minute left before intermission. But Alec Rattanaxay would hit a pull-up, 15-foot jumper with 60 ticks left and, following an Eagle miss, Darrius Fugh connected on an 8-foot jumper with 22 seconds remaining to give the Bobcats a 32-28 lead at the break. 
 
But Oxford-Emory would heat up in the second half behind the shooting of Sean Wickman. Wickman, who scored 14 points in the opening 20 minutes, connected on 6-of-8 from behind the arc in the second half to end his night with 36 points. 
 
The big run, which spanned the first six minutes of the second half, saw the Bobcats&apos; four-point lead evaporate and become a 14-point deficit (50-36) with just under 14 minutes to go. 
 
Georgia Northwestern would try to chip away at the gap over the next few minutes. They closed it down to seven points with seven minutes to play, but Wickman would bury treys on back-to-back possessions to end any hopes of a Bobcat comeback. 
 
Zach Breathwaite added 20 points on the night as the Eagles avenged a 77-72 home loss to the Bobcats back on Jan. 13. 
 
Darrius Fugh had 21 points for GNTC to go with 14 rebounds. Daniel Parrish was 5-of-9 behind the arc to end his evening with 18 points and four boards. Patrick Simmons had nine points and Micah Wheeler grabbed eight rebounds off the bench. 
 
Georgia Northwestern (8-8) will look to get back on track Tuesday for Veterans and Law Enforcement Recognition Night at the R.A.C. They will take on Welch College out of Nashville, Tenn. at 7:30 p.m., preceded by the Lady Bobcats&apos; game with Welch at 5</TEXT>
