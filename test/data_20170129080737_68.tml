<TEXT type="str">A woman was killed and two other people injured on Saturday morning when two trucks collided head-on on the R104 in Rustenburg in North West. ER24 paramedics‚ along with another service‚ arrived on the scene to find both wrecked vehicles in the middle of the road‚ with a load of fruit and vegetables strewn across it.

&quot;Upon closer inspection‚ paramedics found the body of a woman lying trapped inside one of the trucks.

&quot;Unfortunately‚ paramedics found that the woman had already succumbed to her multiple‚ fatal injuries. Nothing could be done for her and she was declared dead on the scene‚&quot; said ER24 spokesman Russel Meiring.

&quot;Two other patients were found on the scene both were assessed and found to have sustained minor injuries.

&quot;The patients were treated for their injuries and thereafter transported by another service to a nearby hospital‚&quot; he said.</TEXT>
