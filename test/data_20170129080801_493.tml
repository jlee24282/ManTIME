<content type="str">FAIRBANKS — Alaska Railroad CEO Bill O’Leary delivered a state-of-the-railroad-style address at a Greater Fairbanks Chamber of Commerce luncheon Tuesday at the Carlson Center.  
   
“How’s business?” O’Leary rhetorically asked members of the chamber. “That’s the ultimate loaded question. 
   
“Depends.”  
   
In short, tourism on the Alaska Railroad is trending up, while freight is trending down. 
   
Outsiders view Alaska as an “exotic yet safe place” for travel, O’Leary said, which is why railroad tourism is increasing. The railroad saw a record number of passengers in 2016, even though cruise ship coach passengers are trending down. 
   
In 2016, the railroad had 494,236 total passengers and that number is expected to increase another 5 percent in 2017.  
   
The amount of freight shipped on the Alaska Railroad has declined 44 percent since 2008 when the recession hit, declining from 6.599 million tons of freight per year to 3.71 million tons of freight in 2016. 
   
O’Leary said the closure of the Flint Hills oil refinery in North Pole — combined with Usibelli Coal Mine’s export operation in Seward going into cold storage — has had the greatest impact on freight shipping. 
   
Despite the drastic decline, O’Leary said freight remains the Alaska Railroad’s No. 1 source of revenue.  
   
“How can we restructure the revenue streams to be successful in this difficult environment?” O’Leary said. 
   
O’Leary said changes would be coming to the Alaska Railroad, but safety and service would not be compromised. 
   
He would not elaborate.  
   
“We are a big deal in a state woefully devoid of structure,” he said.  
   
He also discussed actions the railroad has taken to increase revenue: 
   
• Railroad officials have committed to better use of their property. Alaska Railroad owns more than 36,000 acres of land. Half is used for operations, while the other half is available for lease and other uses. A large development is being built on leased railroad land in Anchorage. O’Leary said no plans are in place for subdivisions on railroad land in the Fairbanks area. However, officials are considering creating a wetlands mitigation bank with its Interior properties. He said this could be beneficial for developers.  
   
• The railroad introduced the Hoodoo Choo Choo last year, offering beer tastings and light snacks during a trip to Nenana.
