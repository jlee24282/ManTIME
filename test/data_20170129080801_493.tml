<TITLE>All aboard, visitors: Tourism trends up, freight down on the Alaska Railroad</TITLE>
<TEXT>FAIRBANKS  Alaska Railroad CEO Bill OLeary delivered a state-of-the-railroad-style addressata Greater Fairbanks Chamber of Commerce luncheon Tuesday at the Carlson Center. 
   
Hows business? OLeary rhetorically askedmembers of the chamber. Thats the ultimate loaded question. 
   
Depends. 
   
In short, tourism on the Alaska Railroad is trending up, while freightis trending down. 
   
Outsiders view Alaska as an exotic yet safe place for travel, OLeary said, which is why railroad tourism is increasing. The railroad saw a record number of passengers in 2016, even thoughcruise ship coach passengersare trending down. 
   
In 2016, the railroad had 494,236 total passengers and that number is expected to increase another 5 percent in 2017. 
   
The amount of freight shipped on the Alaska Railroad has declined 44 percent since 2008 when the recession hit,declining from 6.599 million tons of freight per year to 3.71 million tons of freight in 2016. 
   
OLeary said the closure of the Flint Hills oil refinery in North Pole combined withUsibelli Coal Mines export operation in Seward going into cold storage  has had the greatest impact on freight shipping. 
   
Despite the drastic decline, OLeary said freight remains the Alaska Railroads No. 1 source of revenue. 
   
How can we restructure the revenue streams to be successful in this difficult environment? OLeary said. 
   
OLeary said changes would be coming to the Alaska Railroad, but safety and service would not be compromised. 
   
He would not elaborate. 
   
We are a big deal in a state woefully devoid of structure, he said. 
   
Healso discussedactions the railroad has taken to increase revenue: 
   
 Railroad officials havecommitted to better use of theirproperty. Alaska Railroad owns more than 36,000 acres of land. Half is used for operations, while the other half is available for lease and other uses. A large development is being built on leased railroad land in Anchorage. OLeary said no plans are in place for subdivisions on railroad land in the Fairbanks area. However, officials are considering creating a wetlands mitigation bank with its Interior properties. He said this could be beneficial for developers. 
   
 The railroad introduced the Hoodoo Choo Choo last year, offering beer tastings and light snacks during a trip to Nenana.
