<TEXT type="str">Around March 16, based on a 2015 government-set deadline, Americans will probably experience another in a series of national debt controversies, this time in part because of Republican control of the White House and both chambers of Congress.

The federal government’s debt currently stands at nearly $20 trillion. The debt limit, or debt ceiling, is currently set by law at $20.1 trillion. Nearly every time it has been necessary to raise the limit to stay ahead of federal government spending, the issue has set off turmoil in Congress and between the executive branch and Congress.

The matter could be made worse or handled more smoothly this time, due to the fact that the Republicans control both branches. The most adamant of the anti-national-debt-rising members of Congress are the Republicans in the Freedom Caucus. However, some members evidently are willing to “balloon” the national debt in the short term as the price to dismantle Obamacare. 

The administration of President Donald J. Trump will — quite normally for a new administration — want to spend money to put its program into action. Besides dismantling Obamacare, Mr. Trump has pledged to increase military spending (let’s hope not to invade Mexico), launch an infrastructure building-and-repair job-creating program, and cut corporate and personal taxes. It is by no means clear how he plans to do that without increasing the budget deficit, in the process running the national debt up further.

Americans, including Mr. Trump, looking at his business history, are somewhat accustomed to debt. Car loans across the country stand at $1.1 trillion, student debt at $1.3 trillion and mortgages at $8.4. trillion. No one seems to be panicked. But the national debt, $20 trillion now for a population of 320 million people, seems to remain something of a political third rail. By mid-March, the debt issue could offer new insight into Republican rule.</TEXT>
