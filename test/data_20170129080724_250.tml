Marketers are investing time and resources into learning what makes potential shoppers tick. In the same way a mindset can impact behavior and appearance, so, too, can it affect the way someone fills a shopping cart. 
 
For those lacking adequate emotional and social support, the act of purchasing is a wholly unique experience, according to a University of Iowa researcher. 
 
“The more we know about lonely people versus connected people, we can better design products that satisfy the needs of these lonely people,” said Jing Wang, an associate professor of marketing. “It’s a pretty significant portion of the society.” 
 
Wang has published several papers on how lonely people spend their money. She’s found that people with social deficits are more likely to purchase specific products. 
 
For example, lonely shoppers tend to put more stock in the “minority endorsement.” If a product has received more negative reviews than positive, they’re more likely to choose it based on the suggestion of the few. 
 
“What we have found ... is lonely people would buy something that’s a two-star (review) for their private use,” Wang said. 
 
Wang also found that loneliness is subjective. 
 
A person might have dozens of friends, but lacks the close emotional connections he or she needs to thrive. Conversely, another person might only associate with a few people regularly, but is completely content. 
 
“It’s not just about how many relationships you have,” Wang said. “It’s about how meaningful are the relationships.” 
 
She said humans have two types of social needs. One is a sense of belonging; a social connection to the outside world. The second is deeper and more emotional. 
 
An abundance of one can’t replace a deficit in the other, Wang said. 
 
“These two types of needs cannot be replaced,” she said. 
 
These findings are relatively new to the marketing world, according to Wang. Previous research treated all relationships as essentially identical. 
 
But Wang found that there are key differences. 
 
For example, a recently widowed woman might stay active socially. But in those quiet moments at home, moments that had been reserved for spousal interactions, there’s no easy substitute. 
 
Dan LoBianco, executive director of Dubuque Main Street, said studies like Wang’s are vital to business owners trying to meet customers’ needs. 
 
“There’s no question, especially in today’s retail environment, that it is crucial to collect as much information on consumer habits and desires as possible for our retail merchants,” he said. 
 
While he wasn’t familiar with the specifics of Wang’s research, he is aware of multiple studies that suggest different shopping habits based on family status. He noted that for the lonely, an in-person interaction with a shopkeeper might be preferable to filling out an online order form. 
 
“If the consumer is looking for that interaction, both with fellow consumers and especially with store (staff) you definitely get that in the brick-and-mortar (stores),” LoBianco said.</content>
