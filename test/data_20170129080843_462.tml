<content type="str">When Pamela Hewitt’s husband, David, was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, she had to learn to be a caretaker. The disease was debilitating for both of them. 
 
She loved her husband, but she was angry with him for taking away her life, even though she knew it wasn’t his fault. She slipped into a dark depression. Her health declined, and she stopped taking care of herself. She was suicidal. 
 
Depression is not a normal part of aging, but seniors face loss and isolation for a number of reasons that put them at risk. Losing a spouse, a friend, a job, their health or their freedom because they have to care for a family member all are factors. 
 
North Range Behavioral Health offers a free peer counseling service to help seniors like Hewitt with those feelings of isolation or loneliness. 
 
Hewitt was a professor of sociology at the University of Northern Colorado for three decades and had a background in psychology. She was open to getting help, but she had no idea what kind of impact her peer counselor, Judy Rodriguez, would have. 
 
“I tell her every time I see her she saved my life,” Hewitt said. 
 
Peer counselors like Rodriguez focus on seniors. They have to be 55 years old or older and they’re trained to work with older adults and families as they deal with the stress of aging. 
 
Rodriguez comes to Hewitt’s home once per week to talk and hang out. 
 
“It doesn’t sound like a psychiatrist telling you how to get your life together,” Hewitt said. “She’s a peer. She’s a friend.” 
 
Hewitt’s counselor encouraged her to get involved at the senior center and reconnect with others. Reconnecting with friends and others was hard, but it was worth it. 
 
Jerry Kearney, manager for the peer-counseling program at North Range, said the purpose of the program is to support seniors in the community whether they’re living alone, with family or in assisted living or long-term care. 
 
“We’re very non-judgmental,” Kearney said. “We pick them up where they’re at, and we go from there.” 
 
For some reason, no one wants to admit they’re old and hang out with the old people, Hewitt said. She remembered how her own mom didn’t use her senior discount anywhere for many years. She also remembered how her mom would talk about not having any friends because they had died. She joked then, that her mom should make some younger friends so that they’d last longer. She didn’t understand how hard it was. 
 
She gets it now. Her own friends are getting older and some have died. Friends aren’t immediately replaceable, Hewitt said. 
 
Hewitt’s counselor has a similar sense of humor, and she’d lost her husband shortly before meeting with Hewitt. 
 
“Judy made me feel like I wasn’t the only one,” Hewitt said. 
 
But Rodriguez also has training in psychology. She knows the vocabulary and can point out things like Hewitt’s control issues, Hewitt said. It’s helped her realize things about herself and work through her issues. 
 
Thanks to Rodriguez’s encouragement, Hewitt started writing again. She joined Writing your Life at the Senior Center. At the class, folks write about phases of their life and share parts with the class. For a long time, she’d been focused on research writing for the university, but she’d always loved humor writing. Hewitt decided to take a crack at making a humorous autobiography, and she had a blast. One section is called “Goodbye Uterus,” a funny account of a hysterectomy. 
 
“To be able to laugh at yourself is so healthy,” Hewitt said. “I lost that for awhile.” 
 
Hewitt’s glad she asked for help, though she knows it’s hard to do. 
 
Now, she’s working with a CNA she hired on a cookbook. It’s full of nutrient-packed recipes with easy-to-eat foods for people with multiple sclerosis. David can only use a spoon to eat now. 
 
“I’m not angry anymore,” Hewitt said.
