<content type="str">Night Ranger stepped out with their slamming electric guitar arrangements and brought classic rock &apos;n&apos; roll to the SAP Center for the iHeart80s Party in San Jose, California on Saturday night (January 28). 
 
The band -- Jack Blades , Brad Gillis , Kelly Keagy , Kerri Kelly , and Eric Levy -- brought the crowd to their feet with their guitar shredding classics &quot; Rock In America ,&quot; &quot; When You Close Your Eyes ,&quot; and &quot; Don&apos;t Tell Me You Love Me .&quot; The five-piece group also remembered a few highlights from their heyday ( Ronald Reagan &apos;s presidential term, the birth of their album Midnight Madness , and the release of the original Ghostbusters film) before they performed their chart-topping power ballad, &quot; Sister Christian .&quot;
