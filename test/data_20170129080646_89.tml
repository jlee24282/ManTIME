“He would come to me once in three days, lock my children in another room and have intercourse with me and leave. If I refused he would assault me and abuse me. I pleaded him to leave me, but he was adamant,” Sultana to DC. 
 
And it was during her stay, she learned that she was his 31st wife after persons in the age-group of 25 to 60, identifying themselves as her husband’s children.
