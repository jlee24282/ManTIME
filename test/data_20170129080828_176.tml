<content type="str">LEESBURG — On Friday morning, more than 300 people had already walked through The Compassion Experience, which made a stop in Leesburg for the weekend before heading out to Tallahassee. This national traveling exhibit portrays the living conditions of third-world countries, giving visitors a perspective of the world they may have never seen, as well as an opportunity to sponsor a child in need. 
 
“It was such a unique experience,” Harry Kurtz said. “Oftentimes we miss what other people deal with and what other children have to go through. The reality is most of the world lives this way but we get caught up in our over-abundant life.” 
 
The experience offers two real-life stories following a boy named Rueben from Bolivia and a girl named Julian from Uganda. Each participant is given a headset that allows them to walk through rooms depicting life — including living quarters, classrooms and kitchens — while hearing their individual stories. Each story takes about 15 minutes to complete. 
 
“It was really an eye-opener,” Shannen Fitzgerald said. “The kids that went with me were really quiet as they took in everything. We don’t know what we have. In the story of Rueben, he was so happy to have a toy truck. Just think of all the things we take for granted.” 
 
At the end of the experience, patrons are given a chance to sponsor a child for $38 a month. This tax-deductible gift provides them with medical checkups, nutritious food, health and hygiene training, education assistance, surgeries and disaster relief, mentoring and a faith-based opportunity. 
 
“It’s so moving to see how far removed we are from that kind of lifestyle,” Ron Lessard said. “It should be a wake-up call to us all and allow us to help one another.” 
 
The Compassion Experience will be open 11 a.m. to 6:40 p.m. on Sunday and 11:40 a.m. to 7:20 p.m. on Monday at First Baptist Church, 220 N 13th St., Leesburg. For more information, go to www.compassion.com.</content>
