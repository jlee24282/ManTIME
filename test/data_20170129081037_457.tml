<TITLE>Cornwall growth businesses: 17 of the fastest growing Cornish...</TITLE>
<TEXT>New year, new you. New job? New business? 
 
While 2016 was the year of the unexpected superlatives with Leicester City, Brexit and Trump, 2017 will be a year for businesses in Cornwall to drive growth and put all their woes behind them. 

 Here is a list of 17 large and small growing Cornish companies to watch out for in 2017...  1. Trewithen Dairy, Lostwithiel  

 
Amanda Hubbard, from Asda Bodmin, with  Bill Clarke, founder and chairman of Trewithen Dairy.

It's been a good year for the American-style Cornish eatery company Sam's. The small business is expanding with a fourth restaurant at the Cornucopia Food and Drink visitor attraction in St Austell, which is expected to open later in 2017.

Emma Sixton, from Sam's, said: "We're harking back to our original American influences but with a modern Sam's twist. We're really excited to be able to move forward with our plans for this site and enable more food lovers to be able to enjoy the unique Sam's style and great service. 
 
"The faade will have a vintage 'Airstream' [caravan] aluminium-clad look that adds an extra bit of authenticity and the interior will be equally as quirky, which fits in well with our ethos of providing great food in a fun-filled and entertaining environment. 
 
"We'll also be creating full and part-time jobs that will further add to the positive impact that the neighbouring Cornucopia development will bring when it opens next year." 
 
Malcolm Ball, the chief executive of WMC Retail Partners Plc, the organisation responsible for the site and the Cornucopia development, said: "I'm really pleased that Sam's will be joining us at the St Austell Bay Retail and Leisure Park." 
 3. Kensa, Chacewater  

 
Simon Lomax, managing director of Kensa. 

 
Heat-pump manufacturer and installer Kensa has found a strong footing in the residential market, making it one of the fastest-growing companies in the region. Kensa has enjoyed 23% growth with a 2.4 million turnover. 
 
At first, Kensa's products were considered somewhat niche with an appeal to those embarking on Grand Designs-style projects but without mass market appeal. As renewable energy started to gain in popularity and profile, the market grew larger, but so too did the competition, with much larger, European operations entering into the UK marketplace. 
 
Continued uncertainty over government subsidies for the renewable heat sector has meant many of these larger rivals have focused their efforts on other markets or on other products, leaving Kensa as the current UK market leader.

Managing director Simon Lomax said: "As a relatively small business that is competing against better resourced rivals with global and pan-European distribution networks, we have emerged as market leader in terms of the volume of sales. We survive because we have designed a product that can be assembled using semi-skilled workers so that we can quickly recruit production staff, train them and have them fully productive within a short period." 
 4. Julian Foye, St Blazey  

 
Furniture firm Julian Foye has enjoyed a good trading year. 
 
It has been a good year for the furniture maker with the 2015/16 year up sales 5% on last year and 40% up in November alone on November 2015. The firm, which employs 40 staff, opened its latest showroom in Hayle five years ago at an investment of 1.5 million.
