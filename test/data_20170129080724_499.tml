Octavia Spencer used to send fan mail to Michael Jackson . 
 
The 46-year-old actress enjoyed writing letters to various celebrities when she was younger and she was thrilled when she received a poster in response to a note she&apos;d sent her &apos;Thriller&apos; hitmaker idol. 
 
She said: &quot;When I was a kid I would write to lots of people. 
 
&quot;I remember I wrote to Michael Jackson . I think I got back one of the posters that was on my wall.&quot; 
 
Despite her own fame, the &apos;Hidden Figures&apos; actress still gets star struck and believes the day she stops being in awe of other people is the day she should change careers. 
 
She said: &quot;I&apos;m still star struck all the time. I met Steven Spielberg, who I&apos;ve idolised since I was a 13-year-old kid. And Oprah Winfrey. 
 
She told Empire magazine &quot;I think when I stop being star struck it&apos;s time to get out of this business.&quot; 
 
When Octavia goes to the cinema, she refuses to leave until the end of the movie, even if she isn&apos;t enjoying it. 
 
She said: &quot;I don&apos;t [walk out]. If I&apos;ve spent my money and bought my popcorn, you&apos;ve got me. 
 
&quot;If people took the time to make it, then I&apos;ll stick with it to the end.&quot; 
 
And the actress will drop everything if one of her favourite movies is on TV, even if it affects her other commitments. 
 
She said: &quot;There are three I&apos;ve seen more than any other, &apos;The Color Purple, &apos;The Shawshank Redemption&apos; and &apos;Driving Miss Daisy&apos;. 
 
&quot;No matter when they&apos;re on, I&apos;m going to have to watch them and I&apos;m going to be late.&quot;</TEXT>
