<TITLE>Hull councillor Steven Bayes suspended from practising as a nurse over 'allegation'</TITLE>
<TEXT>One of Hull's most senior councillors has been suspended from practising as a nurse for 18 months.

Councillor Steven Bayes, who worked as an adult nurse at Hull Royal Infirmary, has been issued with an interim suspension order by the Nursing and Midwifery Council.

The NMC imposed the order on December 6, suspending Cllr Bayes's registration as a nurse until June 2018 while an investigation into "an allegation" is carried out.

In its determination, the NMC said: "Case examiners are yet to decide whether there is a case to answer in relation to the allegation made against you."

Cllr Bayes, who represents Orchard Park and Greenwood, has been a cabinet member since Labour retook control of the Guildhall in 2012. He was suspended by the Labour Party in October, although reasons for his suspension have not been disclosed.

Although still a councillor, Cllr Bayes no longer holds the cabinet portfolio for visitor destination overseeing regeneration projects including . Council leader Steve Brady has taken on Cllr Bayes' cabinet responsibilities and said the party suspension was being dealt with at a regional level. The interim order hearing was held by the NMC's investigating committee in London on December 6.

Cllr Bayes, who has been registered as a nurse for 32 years, was present at the hearing and was represented by legal counsel Andrew Jordan.

The NMC say the panel can only impose an interim order if it finds it is necessary to protect the public, is in the public interest or in the registrant's interest.

A review of the order will take place in six months and then every three months and 18 months is the maximum period of time for an interim order.

The review hearing can continue, replace, vary the order or evoke it. If the case against Cllr Bayes is not concluded in 18 months, the NMC can apply to the High Court for an extension.

Cllr Bayes has been contacted for comment but has not yet responded.</TEXT>
