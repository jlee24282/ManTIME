The Erie 2 Chautauqua Cattaraugus BOCES School of Practical Nursing at the Cassadaga Job Corps Academy marked the graduation of its most recent class this week. 
 
Recently, 15 students completed the intense, one year long training course to prepare for a career as a Practical Nurse. Those in this class were; Susana Arambula, Bianca Benjamin, Erin Betts of Dunkirk, Jacqueline Cruz, Charles DeCoteau, Claire Faustin, Jasmine Graham, Kathryn Hanlon of Dunkirk, Joshua Hutcheson, Fabiola Jordan-Ramos, Tyler-Nyree McDonald Fisher, Christine Nickerson of Dunkirk, Clifford Nickerson of Dunkirk, Erica Paulsen, and Tamara St. Fort. 
 
The commencement opened with remarks from Job Corps CDP Director Robert Benjamin, and a welcoming address by Laura Bailey from BOCES. Ms. Bailey thanked Job Corps for the ongoing partnership, which dates back further than 10 years, for their ongoing support to make the program possible. She also remarked to the graduates, 
 
I am thankful for your progress, stamina, strength and urgency. You entered the class with little to no knowledge of the medical field and today, 11 months later, you leave to be responsible for another persons life. 
 
Following Baileys comments was a special video presentation prepared for the class by LPN student Taila McNeill, highlighting their time at Cassadaga, and their preparation for graduation day. Joshua Hutcheson provided a heartfelt address to his classmates and those in attendance. He commented to his class, After what we have been through and done here, there is nothing that we cant do if we put our minds to it. He went on to thank by name many of his classmates for their friendship and support, without which he acknowledged he would not have made it. He also thanked the BOCES faculty, his Job Corps RAs and Counselor, and his family for helping to carry him through the past year. 
 
Each of the graduates were called up by Laura Bailey to receive their pin, award, and diploma. The white, traditional nursing uniform clad graduates each posed on the stage for their family and friends as they moved across the stage back to their seats, where a small gift awaited them. Joshua Hutcheson was presented with the class Valedictorian award. 
 
The class had co-salutatorians awarded to Christine Nickerson and Jasmine Graham. 
 
The final step in the Nursing graduation was the reciting of the Nurses pledge. Graduates rose and repeated the words that were recited by Ms. Bailey to affirm their commitment to their profession and the care of their future patients. Academy Director Ann Anderson closed the ceremony and reminded the class how important they are in their new role. She thanked the students for the mark they have left on the Center, thanked BOCES for their continued partnership, the families for their support, and wished the graduates luck as they move forward in their new profession. 
 
Anderson went on to remind the class to always be mindful of the team around you, and how important a role everyone plays in caring for the patients they are charged with. 
 
This successful partnership has helped dozens of men and women secure their career as a Nurse, or launched them into continued education and training to advance their career. BOCES provides the instruction, skill development and clinical experiences, while Job Corps provides the scholarship to eligible students to attend, as well as supportive services throughout the training period. Upon graduation, Job Corps continues follow up and assistance with placement services.
