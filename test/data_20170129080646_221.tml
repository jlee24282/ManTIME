<TEXT type="str">US President Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin of Russia have made a &quot;significant start&quot; in fixing their countries&apos; relationship, while agreeing to cooperate in fighting the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant group. 

It was Trump&apos;s first phone conversation with the Russian President since his inauguration, and it covered topics ranging from cooperation in defeating ISIL &quot;to efforts in working together to achieve more peace throughout the world including Syria,&quot; said a Kremlin summary of the phone call. 



In separate remarks, Putin&apos;s office said both leaders expressed readiness to cooperate &quot;on a constructive, equitable and mutually beneficial basis&quot;. 

The statement said the conversation also covered the &quot;main aspects of the Ukrainian crisis&quot;. 

US relations with Russia were strained during President Barack Obama&apos;s term, following the Russian annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, prompting Washington to impose sanctions on Moscow. 

The US and Russia have also been at odds over Syria, where Russia has provided extensive military support for its ally, President Bashar al-Assad. 

Since Trump&apos;s victory, Putin has praised the US leader and his policies.</TEXT>
