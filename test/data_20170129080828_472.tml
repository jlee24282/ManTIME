<TEXT type="str">Chennai, Jan 29 (IANS) &quot;Shivaay&quot; fame actress Sayyeshaa recently shot for Tamil film &quot;Vanamagan&quot; in Vietnam, and she can&apos;t stop gushing about the experience, describing it as &quot;breathtaking&quot;.

&quot;The climate in Vietnam took us by surprise, because we didn&apos;t expect it to be so cold; we weren&apos;t prepared for it. But it was breathtaking to shoot there,&quot; Sayyeshaa told IANS, adding that they shot two songs and a few scenes.

The film, which is directed by Vijay, marks her Tamil film debut.

&quot;We traveled miles each day to shoot, but the effort was totally worth it as it allowed us to explore a new location, discover places we thought we&apos;d never go to,&quot; she said.

The team also shot in Thailand.

Talking about how the shoot helped everybody to bond, she said: &quot;When we were shooting in Thailand, the entire crew - from the director to every last person on set -- would meet for dinner. We became a family and the bond we shared will remain very special.&quot;

Sayyeshaa also pointed out that &quot;Vanamagan&quot; could be the first Indian film to be shot in Vietnam.

The film, which has music by Harris Jayaraj, also stars Jayam Ravi, Varun and Thambi Ramaiah.
