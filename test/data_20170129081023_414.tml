<content type="str">The statement follows formation of the Left Renewal group 

The Australian Greens has issued a slap down to the formation of formal factions just weeks after the establishment of the controversial anti-capitalist group Left Renewal within its ranks.

A statement issued by the Australian Greens National Council on Sunday declares formal factions &quot;incompatible&quot; with the party&apos;s principles.

The statement comes amid over the party&apos;s direction under Senator Richard Di Natale.

Ms Rhiannon - who is on the left of the party - last week said the Greens are at a &quot;crossroads&quot; and should consider adopting the policies of former US presidential candidate Bernie Sanders.

But she was criticised by Mr Brown, who blasted her as the &quot;Greens version of Tony Abbott&quot;.

In its statement, which was emailed to every Greens member, the National Council said one of the Greens&apos; greatest strengths is that it is a member-driven organisation.

&quot;We reject, as fundamentally inconsistent with our principles of egalitarian and collaborative consensus-based decision making, the formation of formal factions in the party,&quot; it said.

&quot;Furthermore, the formation of formal factions is incompatible with our party structure and rules&quot;. The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.</content>
