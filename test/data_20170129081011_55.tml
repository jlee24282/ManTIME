 N - k contingency estimation plays a very important role in the operation and expansion planning of power systems, the method of which is traditionally based on heuristic screening. This paper stringently analyzes the best and worst states of power systems given the uncertainties of N - k contingency and interval load. For the sake of simplification and tractable computation, an approximate direct current (DC) power flow model was used. Rigorous optimization models were established for identifying the worst and best scenarios considering the contingencies of generators and transmission lines together with their uncertain loads. It is very useful to identify the worst N - k contingencies with interval loads. If the worst existing scenario meets security standards, all scenarios must satisfy it. The mathematical model established for finding the worst N - k contingency with interval load is a bi-level optimization model. In this paper, strong duality theory and mathematical linearization were applied to the solution of bi-level optimization. The computational results of standard cases validate the effectiveness of the proposed method and illustrate that generator contingency has more impact on minimum load shedding than transmission line contingency.
