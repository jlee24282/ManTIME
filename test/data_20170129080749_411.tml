<content type="str">People have spoken of their shock after a person was killed in a house fire in Lincoln in the early hours of today, Saturday, January 28.

One resident described seeing the glow of the fire and then hearing a loud bang from the terraced house in Derwent Street, off Carholme Road, after the fire took hold at about 4am.

Two people escaped from the house before the emergency services were on the scene but a third person died. A neighbour told Lincolnshire Live: &quot;I had just come back from a night out and a woman came out of the property and asked for my phone to call the fire brigade.

&quot;I stayed with her until the police came. The house was glowing from the fire inside and there was a loud bang at one point.&quot;

Detectives have today been making house to house enquires while forensics officers, fire service dogs and fire investigators have been at the property.

Fire investigator Jason Lawley told Lincolnshire Live: &quot;There has been a fatality and it is a joint investigation between Lincolnshire Fire &amp; Rescue and Lincolnshire Police.

&quot; Firefighters were called out just before 4am. There were three people in the house in total.

&quot;Two of them got out of the house safely prior to our arrival but one person has not made it.&quot;

Neighbour John Houtby, 66, a retired National Grid worker, said: &quot;I heard the fire engines in the early hours but didn&apos;t think much of it because it&apos;s quite a common occurence to see blue lights down this street.

&quot;But I didn&apos;t know how serious this was and I wouldn&apos;t wish this on anyone. It&apos;s very sad that someone has died.&quot;</content>
