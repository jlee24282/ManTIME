<TEXT type="str">By CONCORD — Should 13-year-old girls and 14-year-old boys be able to marry in New Hampshire? 
 
You may be surprised to learn it&apos;s currently legal for heterosexuals to marry who show “special cause” to state courts with the consent of his and/or her parents and guardians, “if there be such parent or guardian,” according to state law. 
 
A bill before the Legislature this session aims to increase the marriageable age of heterosexuals to at least 16. Rep. Jackie Cilley, D-Barrington, filed House Bill 499 at the request of a 17-year-old Barrington resident and Dover High School senior, Cassandra Levesque. Not all agree on its merit. 
 
The state’s current law on marriage is broken into two parts: the age of consent to get married and the marriageable age. The current age of consent is 18 years old; the marriageable age is 13 for females and 14 for males with “permission” from the state to marry, except for gay marriages. The gay marriage law that went into effect in January 2010 set the minimum age of 18 for same-sex couples with no special exceptions for anyone under 18. 
 
The state’s age of consent and marriageability has shifted over the years, though the age of consent to a marriage has been at least 16 since 1907, according to copies of the state law provided by Rep. David Bates, R-Windham, who opposes the bill. The current age of consent dates to 1973, which is 18 years for both sexes. From 1923 to 1973, it was 18 for females and 20 years old for men. From 1907 to 1923, it was 16 for females and 18 for males. Before 1907, there was only the age of consent, which was 13 years for females and 14 for males. Before 1891, it was 12 for females and 14 for males. 
 
Levesque, a Girl Scout, became interested in the subject after attending a workshop at the Scout’s annual Senior Leadership Conference about human trafficking and forced child marriage presented by the United Nation Children’s Fund (UNICEF). Among its advocacy is eliminating marriage under the age of 18, which it calls “a fundamental violation of human rights.” 
 
UNICEF believes more than 700 million women alive today were married before their 18th birthday and about 250 million were married before the age of 15. UNICEF&apos;s central focus is in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, where the highest percentage of under 18 marriages occur, according to its data. 
 
UNICEF USA does not list any U.S. reporting of under 18 marriages on its website, stating there is no data available. However, the Tahirih Justice Center, a nonprofit that assists those trying to flee coercion and violence globally, estimates about 1,500 to 2,900 cases of &quot;known or suspected&quot; forced marriages around the U.S., according to a tabulation of a 2011 survey of various agencies around the country.  
 
After the Scout conference, Levesque wanted to know about her home state. “I was shocked and appalled,” she said when she learned of the law. “I wanted to get rid of it and make it more just.” She contacted Cilley, who also said she was surprised at the age of marriageability. 
 
“I was a little shocked that this was the floor of our marriage laws,” she said. 
 
Cilley learned that not only was there a law, but it’s been used in modern times. While not common, she said according to the data she’s received from the Secretary of State Division of Vital Records, there has been one instance of a 13-year-old, three cases of 16-year-olds and about 25 cases of 17-year-olds getting married in the state in the past five years. 
 
“There is no other type of contract that they could enter into legally. None,” Cilley said. Not even getting a library card that&apos;s not under a parent or guardian, she said. “And yet what many people consider one of our most solemn contracts that entails, literally, 1,168 different privileges, responsibilities and benefits, somebody at the age of 13 can enter into in the state of New Hampshire.” 
 
While Cilley and Levesque expressed surprise at the law, Bates did not. 
 
“Most people are shocked to learn that our current, long-standing law permits marriage by minors as young as 13 for females and 14 for males,” Bates said. “However, what seems to be missed or ignored is the fact that this provision only applies with the consent of the minor&apos;s parent or guardian and only if special cause exists, which needs to be demonstrated to the satisfaction of a judge before they receive permission from the court to conduct the marriage.” 
 
Bates sees “special cause” mainly as early teenage pregnancy, which he made clear he doesn’t condone, nor does he advocate for early teenage marriage. He believes the reason the age of marriageability remained at 13 and 14 years old was because the state wanted to encourage the mother and father to remain together. 
 
“There was a time where there was a common belief that a child would be best served by growing up in a home with their natural mother and father,” he said. 
 
Bates urges caution on changing a law. If the Legislature is going to change a provision in the law that has been in place for 110 years, he said, it should at least make an effort to be fully informed about its history and the reason why it was enacted. 
 
Cilley remains adamant that young teens should not be unable to enter into a marriage contract. 
 
“This bill simply says we believe as a society that 13, 14, 15, even 16 and 17 is too young to enter into a contract,” she said. 
 
Cilley urged action on increasing the age of marriageability to 16 years old this legislative session with an amendment that would create a study committee to look at when special exceptions are made. “The law is really not clear,” she said. 
 
She believed the study committee should also look at how the law between heterosexual and homosexual couples can be the same. Both Cilley and Bates agreed the current law includes language that is discriminatory and unconstitutional.  
 
The Children and Family Law Committee, which had a hearing on the bill last Tuesday, where Levesque, Cilley and Bates testified, will hold an executive session on the bill Tuesday, Jan. 31 at 10 a.m. in the Legislative Office Building in Concord, Room 2</TEXT>
