<content type="str">WASHINGTON D.C. — While millions of women and allies took to the streets in protest on President Donald Trump’s first day in office, others had trouble understanding what drove people to put their bodies on the line en masse. 
 
Critics urged American women to count their blessings that they weren’t born in Saudi Arabia, where many women are still unable to drive, or in countries where female genital mutilation is commonplace. 
Yes, as American women, we are fortunate. 
 
That does not mean we should stop defending our hard-fought rights or stop pushing for the rights we have yet to secure. If history has taught us anything, it’s to not take anything for granted. 
 
If President Trump says he plans to deport millions, punish women who’ve had abortions and build a wall, why give him the benefit of the doubt and write it off as garish campaign rhetoric? 
 
The campaign is over. It’s been just over a week and he’s already made moves to defund reproductive health programs around the globe, create discriminatory immigration laws, strain relations with our neighbors and delegitimize the press with the rise of “alternative facts.” 
 
For some, what is personal and what is political remain in two separate spheres. For others, it’s painfully clear how politics impact their lives and those they love. 
 
As a member of the press, as the sister of veterans, as someone who identifies as bisexual, as someone who benefits from the Affordable Care Act, as a woman who has relied on birth control to regulate my period since high school, as someone who has been sexually assaulted, Trump’s words are not abstract. His policies will impact my life directly. 
 
If you’re not concerned after the first week of this new administration, my only guess is that you’re not reading the news, you’re overestimating our system of checks and balances, or you support his attacks on women’s health, his discriminatory policies towards immigrants and refugees, and his total disregard for the environment and the freedom of the press. 
 
Six journalists were slapped with felonies while covering protests in Washington, D.C., on inauguration day. Just days later, Trump adviser Stephen Bannon referred to the press as the opposition and suggested they “keep their mouths shut.” 
 
If you think we’re living in a post-feminist world, as President Trump’s right-hand woman Kellyanne Conway suggests, I beg you to look more closely. 
 
Look closely at the woman’s white-knuckled fist as she strategically holds her car keys between her fingers on the walk from the grocery store to her car at night. 
 
Keep in mind that women are still fighting tooth and nail for their right to have control over their own bodies. Question why your male coworkers feel they are entitled to tell their female peers to “lose the resting bitch face” while they’re simply focusing on doing their job. 
 
I am saddened and disheartened that my 4-year-old niece will grow up in a world where the leader of her nation has bragged about sexually assaulting women. 
 
I am saddened that the idea of a feminist has been distorted into an angry, misandric caricature when feminism is simply a call for equality and respect. 
 
This is why we march. 
 
This is why we sing and dance and holler in defiance of an administration that is eager to roll back the progress we have made in the last 50 years. 
 
For those of you who don’t think your rights will be impacted by this administration, all I ask is that you take the time to hear out those of us who are convinced otherwise.</content>
