<content type="str">Over a hundred people who were detained in United States airports were spared immediate deportation after a federal judge ruled that sending travellers home could cause the &quot;irreparable harm&quot; lawyers say

The lawyers sued to block President Donald Trumps’ order to block Syrian refugees from entering the US

Mr Trump on Friday signed an executive order stopping refugees fleeing killings in Syria to from entering the US indefinitely

The order which he said will keep &quot;radical Islamic terrorists&quot; from entering the country will also give priority entry attention to Christians and other minority religious groups from predominantly Muslim countries like Somalia Sudan Libya Iran Syria Iraq and Yemen

&quot;We don’t want them here We want to ensure that we are not admitting into our country the very threats our soldiers are fighting overseas We only want to admit those into our country who will support our country and love deeply our people&quot; he said

But on Saturday volunteer lawyers were frantically rushing to airports across the country to give legal aid to refugees trapped by the order and awaiting deportation

Ann Donnelly a judge of the District Court in Brooklyn New York ruled around 9 pm local time stopping the implementation of the order The government was &quot;enjoined and restrained from in any manner and by any means removing individuals&quot; already in the US with valid visas and refugee status

The ruling however did not appear to stop the Trump administration from stopping those who are yet to enter US territory

The judge gave the one-page ruling after the American Civil Liberties Union ACLU a nonpartisan human rights organisation told the court that one of the refugees detained at an airport was being put in a plane to be deported to Syria

According to the New York Times hundreds of protesters had gathered outside the court chanting &quot;set them free&quot;

Minutes after the New York’s ruling another judge in the Federal District Court of Virginia handed another ruling temporarily stopping the deportation of any green card holder being detained at Dulles International Airport

&quot;We’ve gotten reports of people being detained all over the country They’re literally pouring in by the minute&quot; Becca Heller the director of the International Refugee Assistance Project told the New York Times

But Mr Trump doesn’t appear to be perturbed by the chaotic scenes at the country’s airports

&quot;It’s not a Muslim ban but we were totally prepared It’s working out very nicely You see it at the airports you see it all over&quot; he said at the White House

Several legal residents of the US who holds green cards were being stopped in foreign airports as they return from funerals vacations or study abroad the New York Times claimed

On Saturday American Homeland Security said 109 people who were already in transit to the US when the order came into effect were not allowed into the country It also stated that 173 people were stopped from boarding planes heading to the US However 81 who were stopped eventually got waivers to enter the US Iran bans US Citizens

Meanwhile Iran has responded to the ban on its citizens from entering the US with a ban of its own

&quot;While respecting the American people and distinguishing between them and the hostile policies of the US government Iran will implement the principle of reciprocity until the offensive US limitations against Iranian nationals are lifted&quot; a Foreign Ministry statement said

&quot;The restrictions against travel by Muslims to America are an open affront against the Muslim world and the Iranian nation in particular and will be known as a great gift to extremists&quot; the statement added</content>
