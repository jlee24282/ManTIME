<TEXT type="str">Finally got some clear(ish) weather today and logged 1.4 hrs solo. It was hazy out, but AWOS report was 10 sm. 

South valley was busy, there were 4 planes in the run up area when I got there and I&apos;d never seen more than 1 before. 

Did my run up, had to wait to take off. Another first. Climbed to 5900 to stay under the SLC bravo and stayed there till I got around the mountain. Once I got into the Tooele valley I climbed up to 7000 to do some slow flight and stalls. Got into slow flight configuration but I didn&apos;t feel comfortable so I cleaned up and headed to TVY for some landings. 

I over flew the field and tear dropped for a midfield entry but let my altitude get 200&apos; low while looking for the airport. I climbed up to tpa before I got to the downwind and recovered but I was kind of mad at myself. 

Did a slow low level flyby of the runway which was about as good as I usually do (not so good) a decent touch and go on my second time around. And a pretty good full stop. Headed back to South valley and made a good landing there. 

It was awesome to be able to finally fly after about a 6 week hiatus but the uneasy feeling during slow flight and missing my altitude made for a less than awesome flight.</TEXT>
