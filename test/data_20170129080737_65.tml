<content type="str">Paris: Embattled French presidential front-runner Francois Fillon warned on Sunday that muck-raking against mainstream candidates in the race for the Elysee Palace could end up propelling the far-right National Front to power.

&quot;If we continue to try to destroy credible candidates in the presidential election, this is how it&apos;ll end,&quot; Fillon told the Journal du Dimanche newspaper in an interview. The conservative former prime minister had seemed odds-on to win the presidency in elections to be held in three months&apos; time, until satirical weekly Le Canard Enchaine published a story this week that threw his campaign off track.

The report said his wife had received a salary from fake jobs, including several years as his parliamentary assistant. Fillon has denied the jobs were fake and said his wife had for years proof-read his speeches and prepared press reviews. In Sunday&apos;s paper, Fillon vowed to fight the accusations &quot;all the way&quot; but said he had never expected the presidential campaign to be so hard. &quot;I had no idea it would be so violent and drop that low,&quot; he said.

An official inquiry into the allegations has been opened. On Thursday, investigators searched the Left Bank headquarters of the prestigious Revue des Deux Mondes She was paid â‚¬100,000 ($141,000) for an 18-month stint at the journal, owned by a billionaire businessman friend of Fillon, according to the weekly, which said it had only found two articles signed under her pseudonym. Investigators have also seized Francois Fillon&apos;s file at France&apos;s official anti-corruption watchdog, which contains previous wealth declarations, the source added.

What French media dubbed &quot;Penelopegate&quot; has rattled Fillon&apos;s supporters. It was not clear who could take up the baton if Fillon were forced to drop out of the race. On Friday, Fillon&apos;s former rival for the conservative ticket, Bordeaux mayor Alain Juppe, ruled out replacing him should he step down over the scandal.

Seeking to retake the initiative, Fillon will hold a rally in Paris later on Sunday. In the interview, Fillon said he could bring France&apos;s unemployment rate, currently hovering around 10 per cent, below 7 per cent by the end of the next five-year term thanks to a mix of deregulation, lower taxes on wages and a higher retirement age.
