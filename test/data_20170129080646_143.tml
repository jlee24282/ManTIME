Dozens of people with disabilities will show off their entrepreneurial flair at a fair next month. 
 
About 45 people with intellectual disabilities will staff the stalls to sell more than 800 lines that include handicrafts, home goods, kitchenware and artworks. 
 
Reem Al Ghaith, general manager for event organiser Enable, said it was intended to shed light on ways to include the disabled in society. 
 
She hoped it would demonstrate &quot;the ability of cognitive disabled individuals to create high-quality products and start their own small businesses&quot;. 
 
Salah Al Qassab, 27, an Emirati with special needs, will be selling his decorated plant plots. 
 
&quot;I have never seen such a creative and fast person. He uses simple yet most beautiful decorative arrangements. His artistic sense is very strong,&quot; said Ibrahim Ali, Mr Al Qassab’s supervisor. 
 
&quot;I have seen him growing from an introverted, shy boy to a confident young man who is also a very good salesperson.&quot; 
 
Mr Ali said the fair was a great way to encourage small businesses. 
 
Many people with disabilities were as intelligent as any other person, he said. 
 
&quot;We should not underestimate them. They have a capacity to make wonders.&quot; 
 
Mr Ali said Mr Al Qassab wants to start his own business. 
 
&quot;I am sure next month’s fair will boost his confidence to take the responsibility of owning his own enterprise. Salah has all the ingredients to be a successful businessman. I am sure he will prove this,&quot; said the supervisor. 
 
Ms Al Ghaith was also confident the fair would be a success. 
 
&quot;It is their first time to experience a retail setting and that’s the goal of the whole fair,&quot; she said. 
 
She hoped it would lead to more disability centres starting up enterprises. 
 
The fair will be held on February 18 at Dubai Garden Centre. 
 
Enable is a social enterprise operating under Desert Group, which offers an entrepreneurial model to young Emiratis with intellectual disabilities.
