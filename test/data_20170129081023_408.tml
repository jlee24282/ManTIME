. 
  
Mew Releasing New Album &apos;Visuals&apos; In April was a Top 3 story on Wednesday: Mew have announced that they will be releasing their seventh studio album, which will be entitled Visuals, on April 28, 2017. They have also announced European tour dates in support of the effort with North American plans being made. 
 
Frontman Jonas Bjerre had the following comments about the making of the new effort, &quot;The live shows around that album saw us hit a creative peak, writing tracks on-the-road and the spark was lit. 
 
&quot;Breaking the normal cycle felt right and we wanted to make an album spontaneously retaining the energy we&apos;d generated on that world tour, rather than wait the normal three or four years.&quot; 
 
The group will be kicking off the first run of dates promoting the new album on May 17th in Amsterdam at the Paradiso and so far they have confirmed dates that run until May 27th where they will perform at the Immergut Festival in Neutrelitz, Germany. See the dates and the new album&apos;s tracklisting - here.
