<TEXT type="str">Valdevino Miguel da Silva (pictured, left) and his wife Maria (right) show off their new home. 
 
A retired builder has constructed a completely upside down house in southeastern Brazil. 
 

 
The house, with its roof at the bottom and a garden at the top, has already become something of a tourist attraction as passers-by stop to take photos. 
 

 
While the outside of the house is totally bizarre, the inside is perfectly normal. There is a kitchen and a bathroom on the ground floor while there are two bedrooms upstairs. The entrance door of the 400-square-meter house is behind the house, on the ground floor.</TEXT>
