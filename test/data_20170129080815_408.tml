EASTON — Frustrated early by stops on breakaways, Clark Callahan would not be denied Friday afternoon at the Talbot County Community Center. 
   
Callahan broke free often and scored eight goals as Easton High’s ice hockey team rallied from a 4-1 deficit for a 10-7 victory over Eleanor Roosevelt. 
   
The Warriors scored seven goals in the second period, including five by Callahan, to take control against the Raiders from Prince George’s County. 
   
Callahan’s most important goal, though, came late. The Raiders closed within 9-7 with 9 minutes, 39 seconds remaining in the game on Timmy Platte’s goal that deflected off an Easton defender. Another shot by Platte seconds later hit the crossbar as the Raiders applied pressure on Easton goalie Cory Shorter. But Callahan broke free with the puck on the right wing and beat Raiders goalie Ryan Conover high to the left side of the net with 7:11 remaining to break the Raiders’ momentum and end the game’s scoring. 
   
Easton claimed its second straight victory to improve to 2-6-1. Eleanor Roosevelt fell to 1-9. 
   
Platte, Kenan Waters, and Evan Labonte each scored a pair of goals for the Raiders. 
   
Callahan collected a loose puck at mid-ice and scored on a breakaway, past Raiders starting goalie Noah Haycock, to open the game’s scoring with 11:37 left in the first period. But Roosevelt countered with four unanswered goals for a 4-1 lead with 2:28 left in the period. Haycock kept the puck out of the net, thwarting multiple breakaway opportunities, until Callahan beat him with 1:20 remaining to pull Easton within 4-2 at the end of the period. 
   
Period 2 was all Easton, including a lot of Callahan. 
   
“Frustrated,” said Callahan about the early going and then “when I scored that second goal it was all on from there, just steady scoring. ... It was our second win, so it felt awesome.” 
   
Twenty-five seconds into the second period, Bryan Roney circled behind the net and fed Callahan for a goal to make it 4-3. Thirty seconds later Wyatt Gosnell wristed a shot inside the far post to tie it. Callahan stopped and popped from the right wing, at the top of the circle, to make it 5-4 with 12:35 left in the second period, and Easton led the rest of the game. 
   
Callahan broke free again 39 seconds later, sticked the puck down the left wing, and scored high past Haycock to make it 6-4. He did it again with 10:11 remaining in the second to make it 7-4, ending Haycock’s afternoon in net. 
   
Play then got more physical with interference and slashing penalties called on the Raiders. Brady Barnes took advantage, scoring a shorthanded goal for Easton with 3:15 left in the second period to make it 8-4. Evan Labonte answered just nine seconds later for the Raiders to make it 8-5. 
   
Easton then got whistled for two slashing penalties (the second one negating a goal from the blue line by Callahan) and the Warriors were two men down with 2:04 left. But it didn’t bother Callahan. He knocked the puck free again and raced down ice before beating Conover high inside the far post for a 9-5 lead at the end of the second period. 
   
Shorter relieved Conner Roney and tended the net in the second and third periods. 
   
“We won because we played smart hockey the majority of the game,” Easton head coach Tucker Roney said. “We won because we gutted it out. It was a long hard-fought game with a lot of scoring, and we just came out on top. Clark showed up to play and I’m glad he did. He’s a natural skater, just a great talent with puck handling and shooting. He’s really something when he plays his game and he played his game tonight.”
