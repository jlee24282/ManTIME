<TEXT type="str">MOSCOW (Sputnik) – On Wednesday, French prosecutors opened a probe into Fillon&apos;s wife who in 1998-2002 was allegedly paid between 6,900 and 7,900 euros (up to $8,500) for working as her husband&apos;s parliamentary aide and in 2012-2013 received 5,000 euros as a monthly salary at prestigious cultural magazine La Revue des Deux Mondes, owned by Fillon&apos;s friend Marc Ladreit de Lacharriere. 
&quot;A total of 500,000 euros [$535,000] were transferred for this position. The sum would seem exaggerated, since you have repeatedly said in different interviews that you have never been engaged in your husband&apos;s political life. This is an issue of ethics and morality: if you have never performed the duties of the parliamentary aide, we ask you to return these 500,000 euros to the National Assembly and thus to us, the French people,&quot; the petition said. 
 
The author of the petition, which gathered 100,000 signatures in the first 24 hours, is Christophe Grebert, a member of the Puteaux City Council. 
 
Far-right presidential candidate Marine Le Pen said the scandal surrounding Fillon and his wife was a matter of trust between him and French people.
