<TITLE>Over 150,000 Sign Petition Urging Fillons Wife to Repay Salary for Fake Job</TITLE>
<TEXT>MOSCOW (Sputnik)  On Wednesday, French prosecutors opened a probe intoFillon's wife who in1998-2002 was allegedly paid between6,900 and 7,900 euros (up to $8,500) forworking asher husband's parliamentary aide and in2012-2013 received 5,000 euros asa monthly salary atprestigious cultural magazine La Revue des Deux Mondes, owned byFillon's friend Marc Ladreit de Lacharriere. 
"A total of500,000 euros [$535,000] were transferred forthis position. The sum would seem exaggerated, sinceyou have repeatedly said indifferent interviews that you have never been engaged inyour husband's political life. This is an issue ofethics and morality: if you have never performed the duties ofthe parliamentary aide, we ask you toreturn these 500,000 euros tothe National Assembly and thus tous, the French people," the petition said. 
 
The author ofthe petition, which gathered 100,000 signatures inthe first 24 hours, is Christophe Grebert, a member ofthe Puteaux City Council. 
 
Far-right presidential candidate Marine Le Pen said the scandal surrounding Fillon and his wife was a matter oftrust betweenhim and French people.
