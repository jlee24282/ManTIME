Viewers of the hit TV show initially thought producers made a spelling error when contestants Andy, Catherine, Jimmy and &apos;Clohe&apos; took on Jenny &apos;The Vixen&apos; Ryan.

But, bizarrely, it turns out the Essex girl&apos;s unconventional spelling is actually deliberate.

Clearly unimpressed, one fan took to Twitter and said: &quot;When your parents failed at school and you have to live with the consequences,&quot; while another added: &quot;To be fair my name&apos;s a typo. Mother wanted &apos;Antony&apos; but my Dad spelt it &apos;Anthony&apos; when he registered me.&quot;

A third chimed in: &quot;I&apos;m wondering if Clohe&apos;s mam was just dyslexic?&quot;, while another said: &quot;Watching The Chase and wondering if Clohe&apos;s parents liked but couldn&apos;t spell the name&quot;.

However, it wasn&apos;t just her moniker which sparked criticism. Her performance also left viewers feeling underwhelmed.

One witty person said: &quot;Clohe&apos;s as good at answering these questions as her parents were at spelling her name,&quot; while another said: &quot;Clohe is as silly as the spelling of her name.&quot;

Adding insult to injury, she also lost £1,000 for her team by accepting the minus offer. One viewer fumed: &quot;If they win any money Clohe needs to pay Catherine a grand for taking the minus!&quot;.

As if things couldn&apos;t get any worse, the 28 year-old also revealed a rather bizarre phobia - of salad. When asked about holidays by host Bradley Walsh, she said: &quot;I went on my first holiday with my boyfriend to Valencia to La Tomatina, which is a tomato throwing festival.

&quot;But I&apos;m a bit scared of tomatoes. I used to watch a programme called Attack of the Killer Tomatoes and I think it&apos;s stuck with me.&quot;</TEXT>
