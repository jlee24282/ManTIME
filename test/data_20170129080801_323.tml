<TEXT type="str">The movies vying for top honors at the Producers Guild Awards are nearly identical to those up for best picture at the Oscars, with the exception of &quot;Deadpool.&quot; 

Producers included the superhero romp among its 10 nominees for the Darryl F. Zanuck Award, along with &quot;Arrival,&quot; &quot;Fences,&quot; &quot;Hidden Figures,&quot; &quot;Hacksaw Ridge,&quot; &quot;Hell or High Water,&quot; &quot;Lion,&quot; &quot;La La Land,&quot; &quot;Manchester By the Sea&quot; and &quot;Moonlight.&quot; 

The winner will be revealed Saturday night during a ceremony at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills, California. Producers have predicted the Oscars&apos; best-picture winner for seven of the eight past years. The groups diverged last year, when the guild picked &quot;The Big Short&quot; and the film academy chose &quot;Spotlight.&quot; 

The Producers Guild will also present awards in nine other film and TV categories.</TEXT>
