. 
  
Alicia Keys Releases New Song &apos;That&apos;s What&apos;s Up&apos; was a Top 3 story on Friday: (Radio.com) Alicia Keys turned 36 on Wednesday and celebrated like a singer-songwriter: She released a new track called &quot;That&apos;s What&apos;s Up&quot; via her SoundCloud account. 
 
It&apos;s a song built on self-narration and proclamations of gratitude -- perhaps a kind of State of the Union address for the big 3-6? &quot;That&apos;s What&apos;s Up&quot; would have been right at home on her 2016 album Here. 
 
&quot;You want me to give you a testimony about my life/ And how good he&apos;s been to me/ I don&apos;t know what to tell you about him/ I love him so much with all my heart and my soul/ With every bone in my body I love him so much/ Because he&apos;s done so much for me,&quot; she wails. Listen to Keys&apos; birthday track - here.
