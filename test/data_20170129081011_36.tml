Lim said at every opportunity, he would ask young people who worked outside the state to ask their parents here about the services MCA had rendered in the respective areas and for they themselves (the young) to look at the development brought about. 
 
“Each time I visited an area, I could see the return of Chinese support for MCA,” he added. 
 
Among the 2,500 people who atttended the CNY open house were Teluk Kemang Umno division chief, Tan Sri Mohd Isa Abdul Samad and State Tourism Action Committee chairman, Datuk Tun Hairudin Abu Bakar. — Bernama</content>
