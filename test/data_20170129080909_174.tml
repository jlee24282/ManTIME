<content type="str">It was a successful weekend for the Marlborough rowing clubs at the South Island Rowing championships in Twizel. 
 
All up the Central RPC, Wairau Rowing Club and Blenheim Rowing Club claimed 12 medals between them. 
 
Half of the medals were golds, with Central bagging three, Blenheim two and Wairau one. 
 
Central were the best performing of the clubs with seven medals all up, two silvers and bronze to go with their golds. 
 
Central RPC coach Mark Stallard said it was a good workout for the teams. 
 
&quot;We&apos;ve been down here since Wednesday and everything seems to have gone really well.&quot; 
 
He said the South Island championships were the perfect hit out for his crews ahead of the nationals in a fortnight&apos;s time. 
 
&quot;We achieved what we wanted. We had a number of good strong competitive races and we&apos;re happy. 
 
&quot;The teams did well and have certainly improved.&quot; 
 
He said they would head home to train before returning in a just over a week. 
   
&quot;The nationals are back down here, so hopefully we can go there and do really well.&quot; 
 
Central&apos;s golds came in the men&apos;s open coxless pairs, men&apos;s open coxless quad sculls and men&apos;s open single sculls. 
 
Jack O&apos;Leary was outstanding in his single sculls race, while the coxless pairs and coxless quad sculls were also impressive, Stallard said. 
 
Blenheim Rowing Club&apos;s coach Dave Williamson said the trip to Twizel was worth it despite losing most of Sunday due to strong winds. 
 
&quot;There was some really competitive and strong racing, which was great for everyone competing,&quot; he said. 
 
&quot;We earned a couple of gold medals in the boys&apos; under-16 8s and under-16 coxed quad sculls, which was good and could&apos;ve claimed a couple more if the wind didn&apos;t ruin racing.&quot; 
 
The winning eights teams plus cox featured Finn Southey, Hunter Davies, Ethan Alderlieste, Kobe Miller, Kris Godsall, Andrew MacRae, Lachlan Stevens, Ben O&apos;Sullivan and Andy Register. 
 
Southey, Davies, Miller, Godsall and Register teamed up to win the quad gold. 
 
He said they were looking ahead to the Canterbury champs in a few weeks time. 
 
&apos;We will get to race a number of the boats again and that will be another good challenge for us. 
 
&quot;These events are good because they show us where the crews are at.&quot; 
 
Blenheim also added a bronze medal. 
 
Wairau Rowing Club&apos;s standout was Tristan Gregory-Hunt, who claimed a gold medal in the men&apos;s club single sculls. 
 
He won with a time of 7minutes and 34.65 seconds, after qualifying first from his heat.</content>
