<TITLE>Spiritualism gaining in popularity</TITLE>
<TEXT>Arthur Conan Doyle and Harry Houdini fought about it, while Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla, famously not in agreement on electricity, often wondered about it. Is there life after death? 
 
Spiritualism, the belief that the dead survive as spirits that can communicate with the living, has been debated throughout history, and in 2017 the discussion continues unabated. Believers will tell you that the number of like-minded people is growing, and while some in the other camp may dispute that, its undeniable that a portion of the scientific community is conceding that the practice does have value. Dr. Robert L. Miller, a professor in the Social Welfare School at the University at Albany, says its a subject he addresses in his class, Social Welfare and Spiritualism. 
 
Throughout history one of the challenges of social work was that it had a religious connotation, said Miller, who was recognized by the America East Conference of schools for his research on the intersection of spirituality, social welfare and public health. We got in trouble because that turned into moralizing, so people stepped away from it. But I feel the best part of religion and spirituality is essential to good social work. People can use different terms, and in my class we talk about it rhetorically, but when we assess our clients, we have to let them talk about the various strengths they need to help them, and spirituality may indeed be included in that group. 
 
In Monica McGoldricks book, The Expanded Family Life Cycle, read by students in the Social Welfare program at UAlbany, the author conceded that although spirituality can be a resource in many circumstances, it is particularly appropriate for bereavement issues because all religions have rituals or beliefs for dealing with death, and this comforts many people. 
 
Finding comfort 
And comforting people, for many psychics, is what its all about. 
 
Its about relief and release, and if I felt my work didnt have any value, I wouldnt do it, said D. Anne Austin, a native of Scotland, a Cypress resident and world-renown psychic who was offering readings at the Crossroads Gifts and Wellness on Jay Street in Schenectady last week. I work in light, love and truth, and its very rewarding work. When you see someone who is downhearted and doesnt know where to go, I help them play to their strengths and use the power that they have. Ive had people come to me after 10 years and theyll say how our reading was the turning point in their life. That is a fabulous thing to hear. 
 
Dr. J.B. Goss, a Sharon Springs resident, has worked in the pharmaceutical and health care field for more than three decades, and was Senior Vice-President of Comprehensive Neuroscience as well as director of Public Health for Johnson & Johnson. 
 
When I teach students I tell them the first thing you have to have is a healthy respect for what you dont know, said Goss, a graduate of St. Johns University. Theres no scientific evidence to support psychics, but theres none out there to debunk them. There are charlatans and fakes out there, but there are also things we cant explain. 
 
An example, according to Goss, is what seems to be the telepathic ability of twins. 
 
There are a couple of good studies out there that show when you separate twins and show one an image, the brain changes, and the twin who was not in the room has the same brain change, said Goss. Even Einstein said that intelligence was important, but imagination is also very important. Were always improving testing. Were continuing to validate. But we have to respect what we dont know and go into it with a sense of wonder. 
 
According to Austin, thats exactly what great scientists do. 
 
There are absolute truths, and sometimes science is rightly in advance, she said. But people like Tesla and Einstein, they had the same gifts that I do. People like Beethoven and Bach had all their musical opus in its entirety and then had to work back to source. Its the same with inventors. They have an idea and have to figure out, how can I make this work. Its science and spirituality marching hand-in-hand together. 
 
Doyle, the creator of Sherlock Holmes, and Houdini, the worlds top illusionist of his time, were great friends before a dispute in 1923 over spiritualism  Doyle was a believer, Houdini wasnt  ended their friendship. For the last 10 years of his life, Edison tried to build a machine to talk to the dead, and Tesla certainly didnt rule out the value of spirituality, asserting that; The day science begins to study non-physical phenomena, it will make more progress in one decade than in all the previous centuries of its existence. 
 
Publics interest 
Even if most in the scientific community continue to scoff at spiritualism, there are indications that the general publics interest in that realm is growing. In 2007, Cobleskill psychic Corbie Mitleid listened to Elisabeth Rolfes hopes and dreams of starting a business centered around spiritualism, and a decade later shes getting enough traffic that the Crossroads Gifts and Wellness is still a major presence on Jay Street in Schenectady. Rolfe, a Schoharie County native, met Mitleid at a psychic fair in Schenectady a little more than 10 years ago. 
 
I was in the spiritual manifesting stages of birthing my business and was seeking some clarity as to whether this was the path for me, said Rolfe, who moved her store from Schoharie to Schenectady four years ago. Her reading very quickly focused on my desire to offer the community a place where like minds could come together, and her message was to go for it, and that my vision would eventually be a success but with the warning that the first few years would be challenging. 
 
According to Austin, the field of spiritualism is growing because more people are realizing that to some degree, they have the gift themselves. 
 
I fought against it for a while, trying to use the logical and scientific side of my brain, said Austin, but eventually I realized that there were very smart people who were interested in all of it, the mind, body and spirit. We all have some sort of gift. We just to have work at bringing them forward.
