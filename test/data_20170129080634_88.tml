<content type="str">EXETER - On paper, it was a matchup that heavily favored the Bedford High School boys&apos; hockey team. 

The Bulldogs entered Saturday night&apos;s contest against Exeter as the stingiest team in Division I, having allowed 10 goals in 11 games. Bedford had limited its last nine opponents to a total of five goals. Offensively challenged Exeter, meanwhile, had scored more than three goals once this season. 

So Bedford&apos;s 7-0 triumph at the Rinks at Exeter should have surprised no one. 

Bedford led 2-0 after one period and 6-0 entering the third. The Bulldogs scored three times in the final five minutes of the second period. Running time was used during the final 15 minutes. 

&quot;When you&apos;re spending so much time in the offensive zone, that obviously cuts down on the offensive opportunities for the other team,&quot; Bedford coach Marty Myers said. &quot;I stress team defense. 

&quot;Exeter&apos;s a good team. They played aggressive in all three zones, and not every team plays us like that. I thought we handled that well. I thought from the drop of the puck we skated hard, as they did. I&apos;m very happy.&quot; 

Senior forward Griffin Gagne, senior forward Jay Roberto and junior forward Colin Voloshin each scored twice for the Bulldogs. Jake Rioux collected Bedford&apos;s other goals. 

The Bulldogs (11-0-1) scored two power-play goals, and twice while they were short-handed. Junior Frederick Veloshin made 18 saves to help Bedford earn its sixth shutout of the season. 

&quot;We couldn&apos;t play them five on five, nevermind five on four,&quot; Exeter coach Jim Tufts said. &quot;That&apos;s a good hockey team. There&apos;s no holes. A lot of us this year have a good first group and then it drops off a little bit. Not those guys. I think the depth makes a difference with these guys. 

&quot;It was a good battle and I thought the kids competed. I like my kids and I like how hard they work. We have to find a way to win some hockey games.&quot; 

Exeter (2-7-0) received 24 saves from sophomore Howie Fraser. 

The Blue Hawks have scored 14 goals in their nine games. 

Bedford has outscored its 12 opponents 72-10 this season. The Bulldogs are the only unbeaten team in Division I. 

&quot;They&apos;re very disciplined and they work hard,&quot; Tufts said. &quot;They&apos;re the favorite, but I wouldn&apos;t forget about Concord, Hanover and Guertin. Those guys are still pretty good.&quot;
