SAN ANTONIO  Their defense shredded in Friday nights loss 119-103 to the New Orleans Pelicans, the Spurs will try to get back on track when they begin a four-game homestand Sunday against Interstate 35 rival Dallas. 
 
The Pelicans victory snapped the Silver and Blacks five-game winning streak and dropped them to 36-10. New Orleans point total was also a season high for a Spurs opponent. 
 
Dallas, which has lost its first two games against San Antonio this season, is coming off a 109-98 road defeat to Oklahoma City on Thursday. Russell Westbrook scored 17 of his 45 points in the fourth quarter to lead the Thunder. The Spurs face Westbrook, the NBAs leading scorer, for the first time this season Tuesday night. OKC eliminated San Antonio in the Western Conference semifinals last year. 
 
Spurs starting center Pau Gasol remains out after breaking a bone in his left hand Jan. 19, and reserve forward Jonathon Simmons will sit out his second consecutive game with a sprained right wrist. 
 
The Silver and Black had subpar games on both ends of the court against New Orleans. 
 
Trailing 57-48 at halftime, the Pelicans outscored the Spurs 71-46 in the last two quarters, nailing 10 of 20 shots from the 3-point line. New Orleans made 51.6 percent (48/93) of its attempts from the field for the game, and was 43.4 percent (13/30) from beyond the arc. 
 
Jrue Holidan and Terrence Jones scored 23 and 21 points, respectively, to lead the Pelicans scoring and Anthony Davis, who had 16 points, tied a career-high with 22 rebounds. Solomon Hill added 16 points and was 5 of 7 from the 3-point line.

Back on the court after missing two games with a sore left hand, Kawhi Leonard led the Spurs with 23 points, but he missed 10 of 16 shots. Leonard had scored at least 30 points in six consecutive games before being sidelined. 
 
Tony Parker also returned to the floor after missing four consecutive games with pain in his left foot, but he made only 2 of 7 shots and finished with seven points and just three assists. 
 
LaMarcus Aldridge finished with 14 points and 14 rebounds, his ninth double-double of the season, and rookie Davis Bertans led the bench with 17 points. Bertans hit 6 of 9 shots, including a career-high 5 of 7 from beyond the arc. Bertans is only the second rookie in Spurs history to make at least five 3-pointers in game. Gary Neal holds the record with six in 2011. 
 
David Lee, who has started four of the last five games for injured center Pau Gasol, finished with 13 points on 5-of-7 shooting and added 10 rebounds. 
 
The Spurs trailed by only one (85-84) going into the fourth quarter, but Jones (11), Tyreke Evans (9) and Hill (7) combined for 27 points to keep the Pelicans ahead. 
 
Although the Silver and Black scored more than 100 points for the 23rd consecutive game, they shot only 38.8 percent overall (33/85). They were 42.9 percent (12/28) from beyond the arc. The Spurs 23-game streak of scoring 100-plus points has matched the longest in franchise history since the 1987-88 team eclipsed the century mark for 29 straight. 
 
Dallas had won five of its previous seven games before falling to OKC on Thursday night. Harrison Barnes led Dallas with 31 points and Justin Anderson had 17. The Mavs played without four of their top five scorers  forward Wesley Matthews (right hip strain), forward Dirk Nowitzki (rest), guard J.J. Barea (left calf strain) and guard Deron Williams (sprained left big toe).
