The campaign of Fillon, a former prime minister who won the conservative Republicans&apos; nomination last year, has been dealt a serious blow by claims his Welsh-born spouse Penelope did nothing to earn half a million euros ($534,000) paid from public funds over eight years.  
 
He has insisted that his wife has always worked for him during his four-decade political career, carrying out tasks including speech editing and representing him at events.

Is racism legal in France? - asks Balotelli 
 
PARIS (Reuters) - A furious Mario Balotelli asked fans if racism was &quot;legal in France&quot; after the Nice striker accused Bastia supporters of abusing him during his team&apos;s 1-1 Ligue 1 draw on Friday, prompting a French League investigation. 
     

  
Can conservative Fillon keep France&apos;s far-right at bay? 
 
Francois Fillon, having clinched the presidential nomination for the right-wing Republicans party, will now join a far bigger battle for the future of France, the European Union and mainstream politics in the West. 
    
&quot;How can we not consider that there are forces at work to silence me and to weaken my candidacy, or even try to prevent me from appearing?&quot; said Fillon in an interview with the Journal du Dimanche newspaper. 
 
&quot;It is a terrible plot, but I am sure that the justice system will not allow itself to be exploited by these defamatory allegations,&quot; added Fillon. 
 
&quot;I will not let myself be defeated ... We do not have the right to allow democracy to be spoiled by this behind-the-scenes manoeuvring, which is why I will fight with all my strength and to the end,&quot; he said.  
 
French authorities this week opened a preliminary inquiry into the allegations, which were first made by satirical weekly Le Canard Enchaine, and are also looking into payments Penelope Fillon received from a magazine owned by a friend of Fillon. 
 
Francois Fillon told the newspaper that he would only &quot;answer to justice&quot; and would &quot;not submit to a trial by media&quot;, adding that he had already handed over wage slips to investigators. 
 
&quot;The amount (allegedly) paid is false&quot;, he said, adding that Le Canard Enchaine had confused &quot;gross and net&quot; income. 
 
The newspaper alleged that Penelope received the money between 1998 and 2012. 
 
It also said that in 2012 and 2013, Penelope Fillon was paid 5,000 euros a month at La Revue des Deux Mondes magazine, owned by a friend of Francois Fillon.</TEXT>
