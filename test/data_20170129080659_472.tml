<TEXT type="str">The No. 13 CSU-Pueblo wrestling team upset No. 2 Nebraska-Kearney on Saturday at Massari Arena. 
 
The ThunderWolves (8-5, 2-2 RMAC) have won five duals against nationally ranked opponents this season. 
 
The Pack jumped out to a 9-0 lead with a 9-4 victory at 125 by Josiah Seaton (So., Bonner Springs, Kan.). Junior PT Garcia (Denver, Colo.) followed with a quick pin at 133. His second fall of the season came in just 39 seconds. 
 
The ThunderWolves lost the next four bouts, but a No. 7 Kyle Bateman second-period pin (4:42) at 174 tied the match at 15-15. He owns six falls this season, two in dual format. 
 
Ranked No. 5 nationally, JaVaughn Perkins kept the momentum going with a 5-2 decision and the home team led 18-15. Junior Cody Johnson may have posted his biggest win of the season, as a two-point near fall late in the third, plus riding time, secured an 8-0 major decision victory at 197. The win opened a seven-point lead in the dual, 22-15. 
 
The Lopers earned a pin in the final bout, the fourth overall fall of the dual, but it was not enough, as the ThunderWolves moved to 3-0 at home.</TEXT>
