Parents and guardians in the disputed territory of Abyei between Sudan and South Sudan have complained about rising of tuition fees after the Catholic Church administration decided last month to run its schools as private institutions in the area. The church said the decision aims at increasing salaries for teachers of Comboni schools and hire qualified teachers this year.

Several parents told Abyei Today newsletter that the administration of the Catholic Church in the area had decided to increase the tuition fees this year. they pointed out that the fees for preschool to primary three are 2,000 SSP.

The parents further said they don't reject the fees imposed by the school administration, but they also have fears that they would not be able to pay.

Mareng Dau, a father of three children, said he can afford to register one child only.

Meanwhile, Pachuol Yak , a father of six children who earns 617 SSP from the government job monthly, said he has sold a cow and now wants to decide whether to sell his sorghum or goats to register his six children.
