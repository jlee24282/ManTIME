<content type="str">MAYVILLE — A male riding a snowmobile was taken to an Erie, Pa., hospital after a head-on crash involving another rider this afternoon in Mayville. 
  
The Chautauqua County Sheriff’s Office responded at 2:15 p.m. to a property on Route 394 in the village for a report of a crash. 
 
Deputies learned that Adam Martin, of Salem, Va., and Samuel Fabin, of Pennington, N.J., both 24, were operating snowmobiles on the property when they collided head-on at the crest of a hill. Deputies said the crest obstructed the view when the two collided. 
 
Fabin was reportedly injured as a result of the crash and taken by Starflight helicopter to UPMC Hamot hospital in Erie. The severity off his injuries wasn’t immediately known. 
 
It’s unknown if Martin sustained any injuries. 
 
No charges were filed as a result of the incident.</content>
