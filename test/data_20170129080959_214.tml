<TITLE>Pledging integrity: AG Shapiro makes ethics his first order of business</TITLE>
<TEXT>Its a shame that its necessary, but theres a push on to embed ethics in the state attorney generals office. On his first full day in office, Attorney General Josh Shapiro signed a new code of ethics and invited his 800-some employees, covering all job classifications, to do the same. By Wednesday, a week later, all had done so.

Signing was voluntary, according to Mr. Shapiros office. But was the 100 percent participation rate a surprise? No. Did the employees believe they had a choice? Probably not. 

Mr. Shapiro has pledged his integrity to the people of Pennsylvania and expects those working for him  for the citizens, really  to do the same. The pact signaled a fresh start for an office that lurched from one controversy to the next under former AG Kathleen Kane, whose term was truncated by her conviction on perjury and other charges related to the leak of grand jury information about a political enemy.

Just paragraphs long, Mr. Shapiros ethics code pointedly requires the safeguarding of all confidential information. It also commits the signers to putting the commonwealths interest above their own, avoiding discrimination of all kinds and serving as a public employee with integrity, trustworthiness and professionalism. On the offices website is a short video of Mr. Shapiro signing the code and saying he never again wants people to have to doubt the offices professionalism.

The ethics code was partly symbolic; employees already could be fired for certain kinds of unethical behavior. Yet it was a thoughtful way for Mr. Shapiro to begin his tenure and to help the office to break with the past. He also brought in a new top aide  Eric Fillman, the offices first chief integrity officer  to enforce the cultural reset.

Mr. Fillmans work will include holding ethics training sessions, advising employees and officials on potential conflicts, and making sure employees maintain the required professional certifications and comply with continuing education requirements. His office will be in the executive suite, a stones throw from Mr. Shapiros, another statement of the importance he is assigning to Mr. Fillmans work.

During his campaign, Mr. Shapiro cited the need for a gift ban covering all state and local officials  Gov. Tom Wolf already enacted one for executive-branch workers  and for improvements to the state Ethics Commission. As attorney general, he should continue advocating for those important changes. The steps hes taken in his own office are a good start.</TEXT>
