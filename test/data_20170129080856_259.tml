Waitakere United have slipped from the top of the Stirling Sports Premiership table after a 1-all draw with Eastern Suburbs on Sunday at Trusts Arena. 
 
They fell behind in the first half, conceding a goal in the 33rd minute to Sean Lovemore that came somewhat against the run of play, but fought back hard to ensure they claimed a point at home. 
 
Dylan Stansfield drew them level, after Suburbs defender Andrew Blake fouled Dylan Manickum in the box with just under quarter of an hour to go, handing Waitakere a penalty. 
 
Stansfield&apos;s initial attempt was saved by Silvio Rodic in Suburbs&apos; goal, but he was able to follow it up and put the ball in the back of the net on his second try. 
 
  
  
  
  
   
 
It was all Waitakere from that point, with their best chance coming in the 89th minute, when captain Jake Butler fired a shot across goal, after being teed up by a Stansfield cross. 
 
While a point is better than none, the draw was a result that allowed Team Wellington to go top, albeit only on goal difference, after they managed a 4-2 win over Hamilton Wanderers on the road in a game that featured a dramatic conclusion. 
 
After conceding in the fourth minute to Josh Margetts, Wanderers fought back at the start of the second half to take a 2-1 lead, thanks to headers from Papua New Guinean striker Raymond Gunemba and their veteran captain, Aaron Scott. 
 
Wanderers had lost all three of their game so far this year, but looked capable of holding on for a victory many wouldn&apos;t have predicted, until fullback Jordan Shaw slid in with a rash challenge and was sent off in the 75th minute, leaving his side to carry on with 10 men. 
 
Having an extra body emboldened Team Wellington and they finished with a flurry, drawing level in the 82nd minute when Guillermo Moretti slotted one home after a corner, then taking the lead in the 89th, when Andy Bevin snuck in with a header at the back post. Bevin then added another in stoppage time as Wanderers chased an equaliser themselves. 
 
In Wellington, Canterbury United made light work of the Wellington Phoenix reserves, winning 4-1 with a pair of goals in each half - the first two to Stephen Hoyle and the second two coming courtesy of the opposition and Andre de Jong, who was left to run his side&apos;s midfield in the absence of Aaron Clapham and the suspended Gary Ogilvie. Ruairi Cahill-Fleury scored his side&apos;s consolation effort in the second half, 10 minutes from time. 
 
Hawke&apos;s Bay United were also missing key men - coach Brett Angell and midfielder Cory Chettleburgh - due to suspension, but shrugged that off to beat Tasman United 3-2 in Palmerston North, a result that has left six teams separated by just four points at the top of the table. 
 
Sam Mason-Smith scored a brace for Hawke&apos;s Bay in 17 minutes, either side of a response from Tasman&apos;s Tinashe Marowa. Saul Halpin than put the Bay 3-1 up in the 20th minute, following up his penalty attempt that was saved, and while Marowa pulled one back in the 52nd minute, Tasman couldn&apos;t find another. 
 
Auckland City and Eastern Suburbs are the other two teams that make up the top four as things stand, three points behind the leading pair, with Canterbury and Hawke&apos;s Bay a point behind them. 
 
Most teams have five games remaining, spread over seven weekends, while Wanderers and Southern each have six, and Auckland City seven. 
 
Auckland City and Southern United didn&apos;t play this weekend, with their fixture postponed due to Auckland&apos;s involvement in the Nike Lunar New Year Cup, where they beat Korean champions FC Seoul on Saturday night to qualify for the final on Tuesday.
