<content type="str">COLUMBIA, Mo. — Missouri men&apos;s basketball had one last chance for a January win. 
   
Final: Missouri loses 63-53 to South Carolina. 12 game losing streak, one away from the school record 
— Andrew Hodgson (@ahodgson92) January 29, 2017   
And, like most of the Tigers&apos; Southeastern Conference games, they could not stop the other team from going on a run and eventually winning. This time it was a 63-53 loss to No. 23 South Carolina (17-4, 7-1 SEC) on Saturday at Mizzou Arena. 
 
Missouri (5-15, 0-8 SEC) finished the month 0-8 and on a 12-game losing streak. One more loss and the Tigers tie the school record for most consecutive in a season. The 13 straight conference losses dating back to last season ties a school record. 
 
Yet if the Tigers are getting down on themselves, they haven&apos;t shown it. 
 
&quot;I think we&apos;re very close, at times in the game,&quot; center Russell Woods said. &quot;I believe the whole team plays hard we never try to give up we believe in each other each and every game, every practice and I believe each game we are right there.&quot; 
 
Things got off to a slow start as guard Jordan Geist&apos;s jumper and a Woods free throw were the only scoring for the first four minutes of the game. Missouri had a 7-0 lead when Sindarius Thornwell&apos;s 3 got the Gamecocks on the board at the 14:48 mark. 
 
South Carolina used that basket to start a 9-2 run and took the lead on a Justin McKie 3 with 11:33 left. Three lead changes and three different ties happened in the next six minutes, including a K.J. Walton dunk for Missouri to tie the game at 15. Hassani Gravett&apos;s jumper with three seconds left helped give South Carolina a 26-22 halftime lead. 
 
Woods, Geist and Walton were the only players to score for Missouri in the half. As a team the Tigers shot 7-of-21 in the first 20 minutes. 
 
&quot;I thought the first half, as we did the other night, we played extremely hard, I&apos;m not going to say extremely well, I don&apos;t think it was a pretty half for either team,&quot; head coach Kim Anderson said. &quot;They made a couple of shots that were tough shots but I was pretty pleased with where we were at the halftime, we held them to 26 points. I was hoping we&apos;d shoot the ball better in the second half but, obviously, we didn&apos;t.&quot; 
 
Puryear opened the scoring in the second half with a jumper, but South Carolina followed with a 9-0 run that included a 3 from Duane Notice. That run was stopped when guard Cullen VanLeer made Missouri&apos;s only 3 of the night. Missouri shot 1-of-17 from beyond the arc. 
 
&quot;The 1-for-17 from 3, they&apos;re the best 3-point defensive team in the league,&quot; Anderson said. &quot;And they&apos;ve certainly padded that lead after tonight.&quot; 
 
South Carolina responded with a pair of 3&apos;s from Thornwell and P.J. Dozier to go up by 13 at the 10:10 mark for the Gamecocks&apos; largest lead of the night. 
 
Missouri wouldn&apos;t go away, but also could not sustain any momentum. The closest the Tigers got the rest of the game was seven points. 
 
&quot;It&apos;s like the story of the season,&quot; Walton said. &quot;We&apos;ll go down and score and then we can&apos;t get a stop. I don&apos;t know we got to figure something out, but that was a big reason we lost the game.&quot; 
 
Missouri finished 20-of-56 from the field. The team&apos;s top four leaders in points per game — Puryear, Jordan Barnett, Tereence Phillips and Frankie Hughes — combined to score 13 points. Hughes did not see the floor Saturday. 
 
&quot;They make it really hard, you have to run a lot of ball screen stuff you have to run a lot of dribble stuff,&quot; Anderson said. &quot;It&apos;s hard to come down from guard to wing and make a play like you draw up. We knew coming in that would be tough. I thought both Jordan and Kevin had some looks and they didn&apos;t make them. 
 
&quot;It&apos;s been kind of the story of our season, we&apos;ve got to get all the guys playing well together in one night or playing well together for two halves. It seems like one night one guys steps up and one night the next guy,&quot; 
 
Rebounding played a factor in Missouri being unable to get a run going. South Carolina outrebounded Missouri 43-38, and 25-21 in the second half. 
 
&quot;Second half, I thought we just got beat on the boards,&quot; Anderson said. &quot;I know it doesn&apos;t statistically show up but I thought they had a lot of second balls and 50/50 balls. We have to get those, we can&apos;t give away possessions.&quot; 
 
Woods and Barnett led the Tigers with eight rebounds each. Woods, though, expected better of himself. 
 
&quot;Second half, we didn&apos;t get some of the rebounds we should have, especially me,&quot; Woods said. &quot;I had probably six at the half and ended up with eight in the game, I should have way more rebounds than that.&quot; 
 
Woods did, however, finish with a career-high 18 points. Walton added 12. 
 
Missouri is off until Thursday when the Tigers play at No. 25 Florida. 
 
Game time is 6 p.m.</content>
