   The leaves of Lannea coromandelica (Houtt.) Merr. are used in the Garo, Pahan, and Teli tribal communities of Bangladesh as a traditional medicinal plant to treat hepatitis, diabetes, ulcers, heart disease, and dysentery. However, there have been limited phytochemical and biological studies on the bark of L. coromandelica . This study aimed to investigate the antioxidant activities of L. coromandelica bark extract (LCBE) and the underlying mechanism using RAW 264.7 cells. The LCBE was analysed by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) to detect its key polyphenolic compounds. Various in vitro antioxidant assays were performed using RAW 264.7 cells to assess the antioxidant effects of the LCBE and to understand the underlying molecular mechanism. HPLC revealed the presence of gallic acid, (−)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate, catechin, chlorogenic acid, and caffeic acid in the LCBE. The extract showed a very potent capacity to scavenge numerous free radicals through hydrogen atom transfer and/or electron donation and also quenched cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation without showing any toxicity. The LCBE was found to combat the oxidative stress by enhancing the expression, at both transcriptional and translational levels, of primary antioxidant enzymes as well as phase II detoxifying enzymes, especially heme oxygenase 1, through the upregulation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2)-mediated pathway in RAW 264.7 cells via the phosphorylation of p38 kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). The LCBE exhibited strong antioxidant activities and mitigated the cellular ROS production. These results provide scientific evidence of its potential as an ideal applicant for a cost-effective, readily available, and natural phytochemical, as well as a strategy for preventing diseases associated with oxidative stress and attenuating disease progress.
