<TEXT type="str">A former union council member in Lakshmipur has been shot dead by robbers at his residence. A group of robbers stormed the house of Shofiullah Sabu, 55, at Andar Manik village during the wee hours on Sunday.

As Shofiullah challenged them, the robbers stabbed him with sharp weapons and then shot him dead. They fled away with gold jewellery and other valuables, said Shofiullah&apos;s son Alauddin.

Shafiullah was a former member of Tewariganj Union ward 7.

Hearing him scream, neighbours reached the house and found his blood-drenched body, said Tewariganj Union Council Chairman Omar Faruq Bhulu.

Police recovered the body next morning and sent it to the morgue of state-run Lakshmipur Sadar Hospital.</TEXT>
