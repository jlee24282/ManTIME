<TITLE>DAVID MURDOCK: On voyages of (re)discovery</TITLE>
<TEXT>By This semester and last, Ive been teaching courses that I havent taught in more than a decade. The amount of preparatory work I do for class has been multiplied, from looking over texts I havent read in years to converting my old lecture notes to the formats and technologies I now use. Its been exhausting ... and exhilarating. 
 
The feeling is not unlike visiting someplace where I used to live or work  that pleasant nostalgia of returning to favorite places. I find myself smiling or laughing with delight quite often lately. Its as if I were attending a reunion with old friends and reminiscing over old times. 
 
The feeling has crept into other aspects of my life. The perpetual de-cluttering of my house  that project that never seems to be finished  has slowed as I re-discover things I should have tossed many years ago ... and then remember why I didnt. Shifting books around on the shelves the other night, I found a popular book from a few years ago and was about to toss it in the trade pile. It needed reading when it was popular, but I cant imagine that Ill ever want to read it again. 
 
Then it hit me why I kept it in the first place. I had given it as a gift to my mother. She gave it back to me and told me how much she enjoyed it and that I should read it. Its the only book I have that she and I both read. Not just the same book, but the same BOOK  we both read the same physical copy. Back on the shelf it went. Ill probably re-read it again, too. 
 
These little voyages of re-discovery set off in uncharted waters, too, which is counter-intuitive. Usually, re-discovery means that the voyage covers familiar waters, someplace the voyager has been, even if not in a while. This un-charting and re-charting of the charted has taken the form of re-watching favorite old movies. Sometime around New Years Day, for example, I got that 1942 movie Now, Voyager on my mind and dug out my copy of it. Before watching, I remembered that Id bought a copy of the novel by Olive Higgins Prouty on which the movie is based. It was in the to-read pile, so I dug it out and read it before watching the film. 
 
The whole experience was a real hoot. Frankly, Now, Voyager is not the best movie ever made; its not even the best Bette Davis movie ever made (it may be the best movie Bette Davis ever made with Paul Henreid and Claude Rains, though). It is a wonderful and memorable movie, worthy of far more recognition that it now has. The treat of the movie as compared to the book is watching Bette Davis go from frumpy, dowdy spinster to chic, sophisticated socialite in a few minutes. The treat of the book as compared to the movie is finding out more about why the transformation occurs. 
 
I dont remember when I first saw the movie. It was either back when local television stations used to show the classics late at night, or on Turner Classic Movies, which is the 24 hours-per-day version of that. What I do remember is that I didnt focus in on that aspect of the movie then, but I did now. Perhaps thats the true definition of a classic, whether it be book or movie  every time a classic is experienced, it is a NEW experience, no matter how often it is RE-experienced. Those waters arent un-charted or re-charted as much as they are simply un-chartable. 
 
Digging Now, Voyager out of the to-read pile uncovered the novel under it  Vera Casparys Laura, which was filmed as a now-classic murder mystery movie. Yall know where this one is going ... and there went my weekend. Laura is a true classic and one of my favorites, so when Dana Andrews and Gene Tierney flickered on-screen, I knew exactly the waters I was about to sail, but I saw things in it this viewing that I never noticed before. Im sailing the novel right now. 
 
What was next to the DVD of Laura? The classic western Destry Rides Again with Jimmy Stewart and Marlene Dietrich. I saddled up and watched it again. I think this old favorite was based on a Max Brand novel, but I dont have it. Come to think of it, Madeline Kahns character in the Mel Brooks classic Western comedy Blazing Saddles is a parody of Marlene Dietrichs performance in Destry Rides Again. Of course, Cleavon Little and Gene Wilder are brilliant in Blazing Saddles, and Ive got a copy of it around here somewhere ... 
 
This is why I never get the house de-cluttered.
