<TEXT type="str">The plane to Sydney can&apos;t leave soon enough for Scott Waldrom and the New Zealand Sevens team. 
 
Not absolutely everything went wrong for them in Wellington this week. But plenty did, culminating in a 17-12 loss to Argentina that meant the three-time defending champions finished sixth.  
 
South Africa won the final, with a convincing win 26-6 over Fiji 
 
The World Sevens Series continues in Sydney this weekend and New Zealand co-coach Waldrom is desperate for the change in scenery to also herald a change of fortunes. The team had been fairly chipper after beating England 24-0 on Sunday afternoon, but the Argentine defeat knocked the smile off everyone&apos;s face. 
 
&quot;It&apos;s been a pretty tough week. We had to deal with a lot around the old [Gordon] Tietjens controversy, the poor [crowd] numbers and the lack of support and then the coach getting Bell&apos;s Palsy so his face is a bit munted and he&apos;s talking a bit funny,&quot; Waldrom said. 
 
  
   
   
 
&quot;The guys have been through a lot and to walk away on that note&apos;s been disappointing, because we know we&apos;re better than that.&quot; 
 
Bell&apos;s Palsy is a kind of facial paralysis which affected Waldrom in the last few days and was the last thing he needed. 
 
Particularly at a time when the team have been under pressure regarding the lack of spectator interest in this tournament. One of the - many - remedies mooted has been for New Zealand to pick more &quot;name&quot; players. Who knows, it might work. In the meantime, though, that kind of talk hardly makes young players feel they deserve to be here representing New Zealand. 
 
&quot;We&apos;ve tried to stay away from it. It&apos;s nothing we can control. Obviously better performances might get more support,&quot; said Waldrom. 
 
Fiji&apos;s supporters at Westpac Stadium appeared to outnumber - and definitely out-sung - New Zealand&apos;s in Sunday&apos;s quarterfinal and that hurt the team. 
 
&quot;Obviously we were out-supported by the Fijians in that one and to me it felt the Argentinian crowd was even louder than ours. That&apos;s a little bit disappointing for the boys that when they do get to play in front of a home crowd, it&apos;s not there.&quot; 
 
A lack of support won&apos;t hurt so much when the team hit Sydney where Waldrom is confident they&apos;ll be better. They&apos;ll definitely need to be, because they can&apos;t continue to make the sort of soft errors and missed tackles that thwarted their title aspirations in Wellington. 
 
&quot;There was some pretty stern words from everyone after that [Argentine] game and we&apos;re certainly good enough. You&apos;ve just got to look at some of the games yesterday [Saturday] and the England game,&quot; Waldrom said. 
 
&quot;If we can put in six games like that then we can certainly be a contender for the cup.&quot; 
 
Tim Mikkelson hobbled off early against Argentina and captain Scott Curry copped a few knocks too. Waldrom indicated that New Zealand would probably take the same side to an event at which they&apos;re again the defending champions. 
 
South Africa will be the undoubted favourites in Sydney after claiming their convincing win at Wellington.
