<TITLE>Trump's Muslim ban leaves residents feeing li...</TITLE>
<TEXT>As the reality of US President Donald Trump's executive order on immigration hits, immigrants and their relatives grow anxious about what it means for their loved ones. 

The executive order lists a list of seven Muslim-majority countries, temporarily banning travellers with passports from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. This includes green card holders, who travel to the US for work. 

The order has caused confusion for many longtime legal-US residents travelling abroad.

Iranian immigrant Masih Alinejad, 40, has lived in New York since fleeing her home country with her son in 2009.

Her son now lives in the UK and she fears travelling to see him will result in the end of the life she has established in the US.

"Donald Trump's decision again makes me feel like a prisoner here in the United States of America, not in Islamic republic of Iran," she said.

"Now because of Donald Trump's decision I cannot go and hug my son and my son cannot come from England to New York and visit me."

She says many people, like herself, are feeling as if they are losing their second homes and their second chance at freedom.

"My heart and thoughts are with millions of Middle Easterners and ordinary citizens who are being discriminated against not only in their own homelands, but in their adopted land, the United States," she said.

Ms Alinejad says authorities have not provided any support or future information.

Kinan Azmeh, a clarinetist born in Syria who has lived in the US for 16 years, left his home in New York City three weeks ago for a series of concerts that included a date with cellist Yo-Yo Ma  now he does not know if he will be able to return home.

"I don't know what's going on," Mr Azmeh told the Associated Press

"New York is my home."

Oscar-winning Iranian filmmaker Asghar Farhadi has also been prevented from entering the US, despite being nominated for Best Foreign Film in the Academy Awards, due to be held on February 26.

One man who was detained overnight at JFK was an Iraqi interpreter who put his own life on the line for the US.

Australians face uncertain future 

Iranian-born Maz Seyed immigrated to Australia with her family in 1988 and later they gained their Australian Citizenship.

Her sister Mahsa Seyed now lives in the US with her family. 

"My sister is now married to an American and lives there with her husband and three kids," Ms Seyed said. 

"Under these new rules, nobody from my family can visit my sister and her family even though we are Australian citizens."

Similarly, on Sunday morning a 29-year old Iranian refugee named Ali who lives in Australia received an unexpected email from the United States reading:

"Your visa appointment has been cancelled. A US Presidential Executive Order signed on January 27, 2017, suspended visa issuance to nationals of Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen."

Ali's story is another example of the global ripple effect of Mr Trump's executive order.

Social media responds with #NoBanNoWall

Social media has erupted in panic, with many people concerned about what this will mean for their families and future freedom.
