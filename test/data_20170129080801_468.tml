<content type="str">Melody Belle, a $32 shot, upset the favourites to win the $1 million Karaka Million for two-year-olds at Ellerslie on Sunday.

The races shares the title as the country&apos;s richest race with the New Zealand Derby.

Top rider Opie Bosson got a perfect run with the filly and she shot away from the field at the 300m as the leaders tired.

&quot;I&apos;m stoked,&quot; Bosson said afterwards, adding it was worth the effort of getting down to 54.5kg to ride the filly, who is trained by Stephen Autridge and Jamie Richards at Matamata.

The ingredients were there, the result followed for Melody Belle.

&quot;We got the right draw, we got the right run and we had the right jockey,&quot; Autridge said.

From barrier three gun jockey Opie Bosson slotted the Commands filly into the one-one before he peeled around the leaders at the top of the Ellerslie straight and scampered away with the$550,000 first prize.

The first three home are all owned by large syndicates giving the multitude of owners a thrill they will never forget.

Fortuna principal John Galvin put David Ellis and Jamie Richards to work at last year&apos;s yearling sale and they selected Melody Belle for $57,500 from Haunui Farm who had prepared her for breeder Marie Leicester.

&quot;We bought her under budget and put 28 happy owners into the syndicate,&quot; Galvin said. &quot;This race was always the plan and it came off.

&quot;It was a lovely ride by Opie.&quot;

The tactics were to use the filly&apos;s handy draw and be on speed and they were implemented to perfection.

&quot;That&apos;s how she raced in her first two runs and you can forget she went around last time when she had no luck,&quot; Autridge said.

&quot;She&apos;s a lovely filly and had a good preparation for the race.&quot;

It was Fortuna&apos;s third crack at the race and &quot;third time lucky&quot;. The beaten brigade weren&apos;t offering any excuses.

&quot;Our filly went a top race but the winner was too good,&quot; said Stephen McKee trainer of the runner-up.

World class jockey Hugh Bowman drew first blood in front of a big crowd on the popular Karaka Million night.

Sydney-based Bowman brought Ja Ja Binks with a late run to win the opening race for Cambridge trainers Emma-Lee and David Browne.

Bowman was in town to ride Padraig in the evening&apos;s $1 million dollar feature.

He made it two for the day riding Shocking filly Camino Rocoso for Murray Baker and Andrew Forsman in the Henley Park 1600.

Another Australian Craig Williams gave the visitors th quinella with Charles Road running into second.

Volpe Veloce was resolute in the Karaka 3YO Mile and kept her wonderful unbeaten record intact when the Graham Richardson filly nabbed Heroic Valour in an exciting finish.

The Foxwedge youngster made it seven from seven and edged towards $300,000 in earnings for her syndicate of owners.

Michael Coleman took the reins in the absence of suspended regular rider Johnathan Parkes.

Cambridge trainer Tony Pike provided the quinella in the Windsor Park Stud Karaka Stayers Cup (2200m).

Chenille carried too many guns for stablemate Sacred Shot a family affair withthe trainer&apos;s parents Wayne and Vicki breeding the Pentire 5-year-old and share in the ownership.

&quot;She&apos;s really a quality mare and it&apos;s the first time we have really had her spot on this season,&quot; Pike said.</content>
