<TEXT type="str">As any visitor to the Land of Oz will tell you, “there’s no place like home.” And many Tulsans did their hometown proud with their participation in the Parent Child Center of Tulsa’s 2017 Toyland Ball, “A Journey to Oz.”

This signature fundraising event, held Saturday at the Cox Business Center, honored Judge Doris L. Fransein, chief judge of the Juvenile Division for the Tulsa County District Court, with the Guardian Angel award for her work in supporting the center’s mission. Desiree Doherty, retiring executive director of The Parent Child Center, will also fete for her dedication to the children and families in our community.</TEXT>
