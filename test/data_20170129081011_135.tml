<TEXT type="str">WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump on Saturday ordered the Pentagon to devise a strategy to defeat the Islamic State and restructured the National Security Council to include his controversial top political adviser.

Mr. Trump signed a presidential memo directing the Pentagon to submit a plan within 30 days to defeat the Islamic State, an effort to make good on his campaign promise to more aggressively confront Islamist terrorism.

Even before Saturday’s order, military officials had been at work developing potential actions for Mr. Trump and Defense Secretary James Mattis to consider. Those include potentially deploying additional advisers to Iraq and Syria, allowing U.S. military personnel to accompany local forces closer to the front lines, and delegating greater decision-making power to field commanders.

Counseling Mr. Trump in the effort will be Stephen Bannon, the White House chief strategist whose influence inside the administration is expanding far beyond politics. 

In an executive order, Mr. Trump reorganized the National Security Council to, along with other changes, give Mr. Bannon a regular seat on the principals committee — the meetings of the most senior national security officials, including the secretaries of defense and state.

Mr. Trump’s order also states that the director of national intelligence and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs will sit on the principals committee only when the issues to be discussed pertain to their “responsibilities and expertise.” In the previous two administrations, both were included as regular attendees.

The White House thinks the changes will make the NSC more adaptive to modern threats.

The changes affirm the ascent of Mr. Bannon, the former executive chairman of Breitbart, a conservative website that is popular with white nationalists, who has emerged as Mr. Trump’s political consigliere.

Mr. Bannon has already been playing a major role in directing Mr. Trump’s foreign policy, administration officials say, and joined the president in the Oval Office on Saturday for his calls with Russian President Vladimir Putin and several other leaders.

Boat with tourists missing

KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia — A boat carrying 31 people, including around 20 Chinese tourists, is missing after sailing out from an eastern Malaysian city, Chinese state media said Sunday.

The Chinese Consulate General in Kota Kinabalu in the Malaysian state of Sabah said the boat lost contact after leaving Kota Kinabalu on Saturday morning, according to the official Xinhua News Agency said. 

It was bound for Pulau Mengalum, an island about 60 kilometers (38 miles) west of the city.

The report cited the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency as saying there were 28 Chinese tourists on board. But the Chinese Consulate could only confirm the passport details of 18 Chinese citizens, Xinhua said.

Malaysia deployed search and rescue ships and helicopters after receiving a call Saturday night about the boat’s disappearance, Xinhua reported.

Calls to the Chinese Consulate rang unanswered Sunday.</TEXT>
