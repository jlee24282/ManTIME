2PM: 

CREWS battling a fire at Bohemian Emporium and Rupanyup Pharmacy Depot on Cromie Street have brought the blaze under control.

Resident Dale Maggs said he saw smoke pouring from the roof of the building just before 12.30pm on Sunday afternoon.

“It looked like it stated in the emporium before creeping across to the pharmacy,” he said. 

“At one point you could see flames about five metres above the roof.” 

Nine Country Fire Authority appliances spent more than half an hour bringing the fire under control.

Crews had to use a cherry picker to access the roof cavity of the building.
