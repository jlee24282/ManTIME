<TEXT type="str">Nora Ball&apos;s been putting up some pretty big numbers in the Jacks &amp; Jills League at Strike Zone Bowling Center. She fired two straight 700 series, rolled a 277 game last week and hit the big one with a perfect game. 
   
&quot;I wouldn&apos;t have said that a month ago,&quot; Ball said about shooting the fourth 300 of her career. &quot;I hadn&apos;t been bowling that well.&quot; 
   
Well, the four-week run shows Ball&apos;s turned the corner a bit. 
   
Still, Ball didn&apos;t expect such a big number in her final game Wednesday after shooting 163 the game before. 
   
&quot;I had no shot to the pocket,&quot; she said. &quot;The third game I moved inside. Twelve in a row. Pretty.&quot; The closest call came on the first shot in the 10th when the 4-pin went out late on a hit she called a tad high. 
   
Ball said what she must do now is make adjustments quicker. 
   
&quot;I don&apos;t change things early enough,&quot; she said. &quot;I didn&apos;t make that move until the second game was over.&quot; 
   
It was Ball&apos;s first 300 at Strike Zone. Her other three were at Colonial Lanes. She&apos;s averaging 205 on the synthetic lanes at Strike Zone. Her average on the wood at Colonial is 192. She bowls at Colonial in the Monday Bombers League. 
   
Ball&apos;s now tied with husband Dennis for most 300s in the family with four each. 
   
There&apos;s another family member to watch. Nora&apos;a daughter, Kodi, 16, bowls in the junior program at Colonial. She had games of 146-200-141 for a 587 last week in the Teen Division.

CLOSE: George Madison probably would like to have his last ball back in the Colonial Loyals last week at Colonial Lanes. He started with 11 in a row, but a 7-count on the last ball led to a 297.
