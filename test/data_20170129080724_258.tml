<TITLE>Couple involved in serious crash seeks change in traffic signals</TITLE>
<TEXT>David McGhee said he made a bad choice when he turned at a flashing yellow traffic arrow in front of a semi-tractor trailer in Dubuque on Sept. 12. 
 
Despite knowing he is supposed to yield for oncoming traffic at such a signal, McGhee, 79, said he just didnt do it that day. 
 
There it was blinking at me, and it said to me, Go ahead and turn left, he said. And I turned left, and by golly, next thing I saw was the semi just a few feet from me and everything went crazy. 
 
The semi driven by Michael G. Wood, 70, of Yuma, Ariz., slammed into the sport utility vehicle driven by McGhee and also carrying his wife, Alice, both of Asbury, Iowa, when McGhee turned in front of Wood on the Northwest Arterial at Plaza Drive. McGhee was cited with failure to yield upon making a left turn. 
 
The McGhees credit Woods quick thinking with saving their lives. 
 
But a flashing yellow traffic signal played a role in a recent fatal crash as well. A Dubuque woman died when the vehicle in which she was riding turned on a flashing yellow in front of another oncoming vehicle Jan. 13 at the intersection of Northwest Arterial and Holliday Drive. 
 
In light of the crashes, David and Alice McGhee would like the city to stop using flashing yellow turn arrows for turning lanes  a fairly recent addition to more than one dozen traffic signals around Dubuque. 
 
Theres no question about that, David said. When you see the green arrow, you know the oncoming traffic is stopped. 
 New signals  
The City of Dubuque announced in September 2014 that it was adding flashing yellow left turn arrows to two intersections on Ninth Street. 
 
The signal tells drivers in a turning lane to yield to oncoming traffic but allows them to turn when there is a gap. 
 
City of Dubuque civil engineer Dave Ness said the city started adding the signals after the federal Department of Transportation made them standard practice. 
 
The new signals have been phased in since 2014 to replace the solid round green lights that have signs above them warning drivers to yield before turning left. Ness said sometimes those lights caused crashes because drivers assumed the green meant they had right-of-way. 
 
With the yellow flashing arrows, the biggest benefit we have with it is its not green, Ness said. Its not as easy to mistake for a protected (right-of-way with no oncoming traffic) turn. 
 
Thirteen of the old solid green lights with left turn yield signs have been converted, with 46 more to go in the next few years. 
 
Gary Meyer, owner of Gary Meyer Driving Academy, has been teaching new drivers for 40 years. While yellow lights urge caution and warn drivers to prepare to stop, many see them as an invitation to speed up to make it through an intersection, Meyer said. 
 
Even with my students in the drivers ed car, when they come up to that, some of them start to turn, he said. 
 Recovery  
The September crash left both the McGhees and Wood badly injured. 
 
David and Alice McGhee were taken to University of Iowa Hospital and Clinics in Iowa City for treatment. 
 
Alice McGhee had a broken rib and cuts, and her arthritis pain intensified. David McGhees injuries included a shattered ankle, fractured leg and pelvis, and six broken ribs. Both are back living with their daughter Brigid Rahlf in Asbury and are working on outpatient physical therapy. 
 
David McGhee said Wood was injured much worse than he and his wife. He said Wood swerved at the last second in an attempt to avoid their vehicle and struck a traffic pole. 
 
He saved our lives, McGhee said. 
 
McGhee said that, after the crash, he and his wife heard from multiple people who said they dislike the flashing yellow arrow intersections and want them changed. 
 
Some people said the lights are confusing, since they dont indicate the driver has the right-of-way, while a solid yellow arrow over a turning lane does mean the driver still has the right-of-way. 
 
Rahlf also said they are a safety concern. 
 
I noticed them before the accident, she said. Im not elderly, and they still confused me. 
 
The family doesnt think drivers have received enough education about the new signals and their meaning. 
 Change?  
Traffic engineers weigh a lot of factors when determining the most appropriate signals for intersections, Ness said. 
 
City staff has fielded some calls from citizens complaining about the flashing arrows, he said. People complained that they felt uncomfortable at those intersections. 
 
Ness said that is not necessarily a bad thing, as it compels drivers to pay more attention. 
 
Sometimes in traffic the intersections where people feel really safe have more accidents, he said. You get the ones, like some five-way intersections here, where it makes people pay more attention because theyre uncomfortable. 
 
Dubuque Police Department Lt. Scott Baxter said he did not have statistics for crashes involving flashing yellow arrows in the city. He said anecdotally that police have not noticed an uptick in crashes at those intersections since the signals introduction. 
 
Not to downplay the seriousness of a serious injury or fatality crash, but one also has to look at the volume of traffic that passes through intersections that have flashing yellow arrows without incident, he said. Youre talking a tremendous volume of traffic that navigates the flashing yellow arrows safely. 
 
Ness said when the new yellow flashing arrows were installed, the city considered adding signs telling drivers to yield, but state Department of Transportation officials said not conforming to the federal standards could create a liability issue. 
 
Ness said a solid green arrow does give a driver full right-of-way and is appropriate at intersections with visibility issues or a lot of crashes. However, those also carry a safety risk where people are speeding up to make the turn before the arrow disappears to avoid waiting for the next cycle. 
 
Its a balancing act of safety and efficiency and trying to get people to obey all of the controls, Ness said. 
 
At present, the flashing yellow arrow obviously isnt working, Meyer said. He suggested alternatives, such as a flashing red light, or increased signage. 
 
I think education is the biggest thing, he said. It really is. 
 
However, he noted that one recent traffic control addition to Dubuque  the roundabout at the intersection of North Grandview Avenue and Delhi and Grace streets  has worked out far better than he anticipated. 
 
Change is difficult, Meyer said. That roundabout has worked way better than I ever thought it (would).</TEXT>
