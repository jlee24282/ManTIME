<content type="str">The sixth annual Queen of the Diamond Home Run Derby, sponsored by the Elite Lady Sox club softball team, has its first repeat winner. 
   
Sneads, Fla., freshman Michaela Edenfield defended her title Saturday afternoon in the latest derby competition held on a slightly windy, cold overcast day at the Northview High softball field that drew 10 participants, most from the Wiregrass area. 
   
Edenfield shattered a first-round record with 21 home runs and won the competition with 38 overall homers in the four rounds. She capped it with an 8-2 victory in the championship round over Cottonwood’s Emma Coachman, the event runner-up. 
   
Asia Jones of Cottonwood and Janie Posey of Houston Academy also finished in the top four at the event. 
   
“I feel great,” Edenfield said. “I have trained every day and every weekend I go out for hitting lessons, so I feel like this is basically something that shows off my hard work.” 
   
The 38 homers surpassed her total of 34 from last year when she won the event at more homer friendly Northside Methodist. The total was shy of the annual event’s overall record of 45 set by former Dothan standout Kasey Cooper, now a standout at Auburn. 
   
Edenfield said this year’s event felt easier to her since her swing wasn’t as hard to produce homers following a year of physical growth. 
   
“Honestly it really does (feel different),” said the 14-year-old Edenfield, who is listed as 6-foot-1 on Sneads High School’s Maxpreps volleyball website. “For me, I have changed over the past year, so I felt easier and better (with a more natural swing). It was a lot better than last year.” 
   
Event organizer Jason Ford, who coaches the Elite Lady Sox, said Edenfield had a dominating day, hitting several onto the nearby Northview baseball field over the left-field fence and that several of her shots were at least 250 yards in distance. 
   
“She was just cutting it through the wind,” Ford said. “She put on a show.” 
   
With a slight wind blowing left to right field, hitting homers wasn’t an easy task for the 10 hitters, all of whom were right-handed hitters. 
   
“You had to hit it to get it out,” Ford said. 
   
The eventual winner certainly didn’t have such problems early. As the defending champion, she was the last of the 10 hitters in the early rounds. Each participant had to hit as many homers as possible before having 14 outs in each of the first two rounds. 
   
As Edenfield came up for her first round, Posey was leading the field with seven homers. 
   
That mark didn’t last, though, as Edenfield blasted 21 homers before finally making her 14th out. That total equaled the combined total of the other nine hitters in the competition. It also broke the previous event record in one round of 20 hit previously by Cooper. 
   
“Honestly, I was surprised I hit 21 over in the first round,” Edenfield said. “I was absolutely surprised. I found my rhythm and just kept on hitting. Always starting off with a good start, especially in home run derbies, puts a lot more pressure on the competition.” 
   
She hit just six in the second round, but her overall total of 27 easily advanced her to the semifinals. 
   
Jones finished as the second seed for the semifinals after hitting a combined 10 in the first two rounds. Coachman advanced as the third seed with eight homers and Posey moved on after finishing as the No. 4 seed with seven homers. 
   
The semifinals pitted Coachman as the No 3 seed against No. 2 seed Jones in a battle of Cottonwood teammates. With each semifinal participant getting just 12 outs, Coachman edged Jones 12-9 to advance to the finals. 
   
In the other semifinal, Posey went first, but struggled and hit only two in her 12 outs. Edenfield followed, needing only three to advance to the finals. Though she didn’t need much to advance, she kept a simple hitting approach. 
   
“Let it go with the flow,” Edenfield said. “Because if I put more pressure on myself then I know I won’t do good. It is just one of those things to just let it go and do your job.” 
   
It took a few swings, but she reached her third homer with two outs to spare. 
   
In the finals, the two participants had 10 outs to hit as many homers as possible. Coachman went first and hit two. Edenfield then belted eight out before recording her 10 outs to win the event. 
   
“Just do my thing,” Edenfield said of her approach in the final round. “See the pitch, hit the pitch. Have my own selection (of what I wanted to hit).” 
   
The repeat home run derby winner hopes she can build off Saturday’s success for a strong season this spring playing for Sneads High School. 
   
“It helps me mentally because it shows how much I can rely on my hitting,” Edenfield said. 
   
She added, “It shows I can hit for power. That this is Michaela Edenfield.” 
   
Despite the less than ideal weather conditions, Ford said he was pleased with how things went at the event, a fund-raiser for the Elite Lady Sox. 
   
“This is about the girls,” Ford said. “It is a fund-raiser for us, but I love giving back to the girls in the community in having this event on a big stage. I appreciate the participants because it was cold out there, but they battled through it. These girls showed they didn’t care about the weather. They love the game of softball and they came out here to compete.” 
   
He was especially thankful for those that helped host the event. 
   
“I appreciate Northview and coach (Jessica) Noble for letting us host our event at their school,” Ford said. “I look forward to this event getting bigger in the future and having more girls participate.”</content>
