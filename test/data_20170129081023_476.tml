<TEXT>Our freedom of speech and democracy are at risk

I want to thank you for your recent editorial in this past Sundays newspaper about the attacks on the media.

I have been very concerned about the new administrations constant criticism of the news media. It seems to be a form of bullying to discredit journalists with stellar reputations. This behavior needs to be challenged, and the truth must be told.

Thursdays editorial was also spot-on about the muzzling of government agencies. It is shocking to me that data, facts and science are treated with such disrespect.

We are fortunate that there are brave men and women in the National Park Service, NASA and the EPA who are speaking out on alternative social media to get the truth out for the public.

Its my opinion that our freedom of speech and democracy are at risk. I am especially concerned about our environment. We the people deserve access to clean water and clean air. If the EPA budget is cut as is speculated, we are in imminent danger.

Thank you for the work you do. I am grateful for newspaper journalists who are doing such a good job in being truth tellers. As a result of this election, we now have paid subscriptions to four newspapers and are thinking of adding one more.

Steps must be taken to return religious freedoms to citizens

First of all, I suggest that things be put in their proper perspective by looking at Americas determination to fight for patriotic principles of integrity and truth.

Has it not been obvious that there is an ongoing reaction to the liberal medias desire to force their views, as well as the governments on America and the world?

As a newspaper reporter in 2007-08, during the campaign for president and the beginning of the Obama presidency, I was more aware than many that within a few weeks of the transition of power, and of winning the Senate, Mitch McConnell set forth a budget that gave Obama, Reid, and Pelosi everything they wanted.

This was an obvious betrayal and caused a revolt at the grassroots level.

Our newly inaugurated president, Donald Trump, was obviously aware of that grassroots revolution and ran his campaign on an agenda pledging to enact a whole range of policy changes that would turn Washington upside down, draining the swamp.

And to this ex-Vietnam veteran, who now has renewed hope for America, the expulsion of an oppressive federal government is acceptable, no matter what the liberal media continues to feed and mislead the people by saying.

I am one of many who have felt as though, over the last eight years, we have had to endure someone taking a sledgehammer to our faith, family, and freedom.

We have been threatened with possible punishment and even financial ruin if we dared to show dissent based on religious beliefs. Bills signed into law by a single man sitting in an oval office put Christians, in business, the military and in ministry, on the wrong side of the law if they dared to speak up.

So what needs to be done?

First, to restore our freedom of speech and beliefs, gut the Johnson Amendment, which the far left has used in an attempt to silence Christians. Second, stop policies signed by the ex-president that has allowed the military to push a far-left social agenda.

Third, overturn the bathroom mandate that has forced schools to allow males to invade our daughters and granddaughters school restrooms and locker rooms (I feel strongly about this because I have four daughters and five granddaughters).

And fourth, nominate and confirm a U.S. Supreme Court justice who will help turn around the courts growing judicial dictatorship and return our religious freedoms to us.

In sharing what I have, I feel we are going to become a country again that protects the freedoms our forefathers fought so hard for. God bless America and our new leaders.

The next time you need help, dont call on us

What started as a prank by a group of five high school students ended up destroying the life of the Rev. Paul Monahan. Im sure they were welcomed as heroes in their homes and churches.

My father served in World War I from the very first to the very last, winning numerous medals. My brother-in-law served in the Navy and my father-in-law served in the Marines in World War II. Another brother-in-law fought and froze many long months in Korea.

I served as a combat medic in Vietnam. I spent 14 months dragging men out of harms way. I, gratefully, was given a few awards, including the Bronze Star. My nephew served two tours of duty in Iraq with the Marines.

My point to all of this is that we didnt put in all this hard work only to have our religious freedom trampled on by a few youth who have never had to spend five minutes serving their country in any capacity.

The next time you need help, dont call on us.
