<TITLE>At least three local groups vie for limited number of medical marijuana permits</TITLE>
<TEXT>The Pennsylvania Department of Health wants would-be applicants for permits to grow, process and/or dispense medical marijuana or cannabis to check out the applications they will have to fill out before March 20.

Im excited that this law is finally entering the implementation phase, said state Sen. Pat Stefano, R-Bullskin Township, a co-sponsor of the medical marijuana bill. There are a number of benefits that come from giving doctors the ability to recommend this treatment. Im happy that we were able to get the government out of the way of life-altering treatment.

Stefano, whose district covers all of Fayette County and portions of the Mon Valley in Westmoreland County, said his inspiration for the bill was Sydney Michaels, now 7, who suffers from a rare type of intractable epilepsy called Dravet Syndrome that caused hundreds of seizures a day. Her mother said use of a cannabis oil had reduced that number to a handful each day.

I cant state enough how much their frequent visits to Harrisburg helped moved the needle in the Senate and House, Stefano said of the Connellsville family.

Under the bill signed last April by Gov. Tom Wolf, cannabis can be processed into pills, oils, topical forms such as gels, creams or ointments, forms that could be administered with an inhaler or nebulizer, tinctures or liquids. Smoking is not on that list.

Permit applications went online for review last week on the departments Medical Marijuana Program website. They will be accepted from Feb. 20 to March 20.

Based on surveys and on expressions of interest, Department of Health (DOH) spokeswoman April Hutcheson said her agency is anticipating as many as 900 applications.

The DOH could issue 25 permits for grower/processor operations and 50 for dispensaries. However, the hurdles for would-be permit holders include one that limits primary dispensing operations to five counties in Southwestern Pennsylvania.

The state plans to issue 12 permits for grower/processors, two in each of six regions including the 11 southwestern counties around Pittsburgh, and 27 permits for dispensaries, including five in the southwestern counties.

There is no limitation as to where a grower/processor can locate within a given region, but primary permits for dispensaries will be limited to two for Allegheny County and one each to Butler, Washington and Westmoreland counties.

Hutcheson said those getting a dispensary permit may be able to have operations in three different counties.

Tom Seaman hopes to secure a permit in Upper Tyrone Township, where hed convert a warehouse business to operate the medical cannabis business.

Seaman recently told Scottdale council he had support from Stefano, who was cautious in responding to a question about limits in the permit process.

It is my understanding that the department will be doing the full allotment of permits in phases and this is step one of that process, Stefano said. I dont want to comment on anything beyond that as I dont know what future plans the department has for the permits.

There are at least two would-be permit seekers in Westmoreland County, for entities in Monessen and Rostraver Township.

In Monessen, Shah Dawud El-Bey and his wife Zenobia Nabilia El-Bey are among those planning to seek permits, in their case as both a grower and a dispensary.

Our aspiration for the grow-op are more about being a wholesale distributor within the state, Zenobia El-Bey said. The reality is that dispensaries are going to run out of product, so we intend for that to be our niche. Realistically, until the country goes nationally, the interstate crossing legalities are tricky. So we are hoping to fill that gap for the state.

In Rostraver Township, Maitri Medicinals is seeking permits for both growing and dispensing medical marijuana from a warehouse there. Maitri spokesman Dick Roberts said the company would discuss the specifics of their services if they are granted a permit later this year.

Those seeking both grower/processor and dispensary permits likely wont get both. State health officials said no more than five grower/processors also may be issued a dispensary permit.

Stefano has met with a number of interested parties, including those who have made public their intentions, but he doesnt know about the interest of others who also are considering applying.

I dont want to disclose anything that may not be ready for announcing, Stefano said. My role has been explanatory and I try to support anyone who wants to bring development and jobs to our area. The (DOH) has set up an objective scoring metric to score the applications and Im hopeful that applicants in our area fare well as their proposals are vetted.

Zenobia El-Bey is CEO of Natanni Inc., a for-profit venture and one of two entities Shah Dawud and Zenobia El-Bey have in Monessen.

Natanni Inc has had a key focus in the field on business consultant services, and international trade until now, Zenobia El-Bey said. We are intending to rename the corporation Alternative Organic Solutions Inc. and our key focus will now become organic vegetation and medical marijuana.

The other is The Right Way To Go Inc., under whose banner the couple has gone before city council.

We intend to utilize some of the riverfront warehouse property in Monessen, El-Bey said after the couples appearance at the Jan. 16 council workshop. We have private equity capital and will be making moves to solidify ourselves before the end of January.

El-Bey said the couple will be meeting soon with a key investor.

They have agreed to a private equity position, joint venture agreement, El-Bey said.

They will be expecting a return on their investment. They will not participate in the day to day operation of the business.

Another move made by the El-Beys was to choose registered nurse Christy Allums as medical director for the proposed Monessen operation.

Maitri vaulted its first hurdle Jan. 11 when the Rostraver Township zoning hearing board unanimously approved a special exception for its proposed medical marijuana production and processing facility at 316 Finley Road, in a 37,000-square-foot building owned by Vesely Brothers Properties and zoned for light manufacturing.

Maitri CEO Corinne Ogrodnik told the board that 3,000-5,000 medical cannabis plants would be grown inside the building and processing equipment would extract cannabis oil from the plants. The oil in turn would be placed in capsules and lotions and distributed to dispensaries, where patients with medical marijuana prescriptions could buy it.

She told the board that up to 50 people eventually would be employed, all screened by background checks required under state law.

State law allows cannabis to be prescribed for 17 medical conditions including epilepsy, autism and chronic pain.</TEXT>
