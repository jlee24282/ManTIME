<TEXT type="str">Gorgeous Skin By CosmeSurge  
Is there anything that makes you feel like you can conquer the world ( or at least manage that crazy mama schedule ) AND still feel gorgeous ? Well, yes actually there is. And it comes in the form of beautiful skin that radiates youth and shouts ‘I’ve had 8 hours sleep’ ( even if you haven’t ). 
 
CosmeSurge is the Middle East’s most trusted name in cosmetology and aesthetic medicine , treating patients from around the globe in their world-class facilities. With over 60 unique and innovative treatments, whether you want to go all out ( we’re talking liposuction, breast augmentation and reconstruction ) or are keen to try a few non-invasive treatments including Oxygen Facials, Hydra Facials, PRP or Botox and Fillers to help rejuvenate your skin , these guys do it all in the most professional way. 
 
Scared? Don’t be. We’re not telling you to book a boob job or get a new nose ( unless you want to of course ): there’s so much more to CosmeSurge. Just think of it as your one-stop-shop for everything cosmetic/aesthetic. And here comes the best part. Ever wondered how Kim Kardashian looks so flawless ? We just happen to know that her recent trip to Dubai included a visit to the CosmeSurge state-of-the-art set up in Dubai Marina where German trained Dermatologist Dr. Pegah Ceric-Dhdari treated psoriasis triggered by lack of sleep and stress ( recognise those, mamas? ). And if it’s good enough for Kim, it’s most definitely good enough for us . 
 
If you want to know more or you’re keen to book an appointment then visit the CosmeSurge Clinic, Dubai Marina, 33/F, Al Habtoor Business Tower, opposite Habtoor Grand Hotel
