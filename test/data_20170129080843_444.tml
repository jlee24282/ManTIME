Peter Odemwingie has given his blessing for fellow former Baggie Saido Berahino to take his number nine shirt at Stoke – and to take his song as soon as he starts scoring. 
 
Odemwingie hopes Berahino can enjoy a relationship with the Boothen End like as quickly and strong as the one he established. 
 
Now 35, the forward immediately emerged as a key figure under Mark Hughes after arriving via a disappointing spell at Cardiff and, despite a terrible injury early in the next season, he rates his time in the Potteries as the happiest of his career.

&quot;It was nice to see him hold up that number nine shirt,&quot; he said. &quot;I miss wearing it! 
 
&quot;They were happy days for me, especially at the beginning. I had the biggest injury of my career just after the World Cup but Stoke were still possibly the brightest days of my career. Lille in France and Stoke in my 13 or 14 years of professional football were my happiest moments. 
 
&quot;When my kids grow up I will be happy if they grow up to play for Stoke. That would be nice. 
 
&quot;And if Berahino is scoring goals it would be nice to hear him get the same chant. The surnames are of similar length it can fit into the tune.&quot;

Stoke fans were in a rush to get a chant about Odemwingie scoring goals up front due to the impact he had after arriving in a swap deal with Kenwyne Jones three years ago. If doubters thought he had not been at his best for two years, they were speedily silenced. 
 
He was key to Mark Hughes&apos;s debut year in charge ending with a bang. Having picked up 22 points in 22 games before his first game ended in defeat at Sunderland, the Potters would pick up 28 points from their 15 final games with him in tow. 
 
Now he is looking for a new club himself after ending a short-term deal with Rotherham. 
 
&quot;It was a short contract for three months,&quot; he told Radio Stoke. &quot;I got a few games but got a sending off and missed three games. When I got back there was no time to pick up and now I&apos;ve ran out of time. I&apos;m looking elsewhere now. There are a few things on the line so we&apos;ll see what is next for me.&quot;
