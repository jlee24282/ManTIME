What was your worst show as a performer, and what made it so terrible? 

My worst show was my first feature for The Poets&apos; Asylum ... I wasn&apos;t slamming yet and the venue was pretty loud with ambient noise ... I was nervous and quiet ... after the show an older woman came up to tell me that while my poems were alright, she preferred a dynamic reader. 

What’s song or poem are you most addicted to right now? 

I&apos;m currently addicted to My Bubba, especially the song &quot;Island.&quot; 
 
What’s Next For You? 

I&apos;m working on a collection of pieces that examine the role of the gender in fairy tales, in particular the role of the bitch/witch/evil woman trope and the characteristics that are or are not presented as positive or negative traits relative to the feminine or masculine presentation of the character. 

I&apos;ll also be hosting the slam to decide who will represent Worcester at the 2017 Women of the World Poetry Slam Finals in Dallas. The slam will be held at 7:30 p.m. Jan. 31 at The Raven Music Hall in Worcester.</content>
