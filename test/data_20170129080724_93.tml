<content type="str">Regarding &quot;Trump owes us tax records,&quot; editorial, Jan. 25: President Donald Trump obviously does as he pleases. If it had been to his benefit to release his tax returns before the election, he would have done so. We can assume that it was not. 
 
Now that he is president, it’s not likely that he will change his mind. We may have to forget about seeing his tax returns. That bird has flown.
