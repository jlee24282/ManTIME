<TITLE>Letter: Cancer: Worse than four-letter word</TITLE>
<TEXT>I first heard the word cancer when I was six. I knew it was bad because my mother told me so. Her mother had it. It wasn't until I got older that I really understood. My grandmother died from pancreatic cancer a little more than a year later.

Since then, I've lost too many more friends and family. I hate cancer. A letter to the editor from Jack Carey, "" discouraged me. It criticized Local 4 News Anchor Jim Niedelman and his station for an "endorsed cancer public service announcement (PSA)." I'm the guy behind that PSA.

We didn't endorse cancer. We encouraged people to join the Relay for Life, an organization dedicated to cancer research, education and prevention. Jack Carey complained that I asked for help to "kick the crap out of cancer." Carey hosted a local radio program in the 1970s called "Coffee with Carey" and now runs a ministry.

I called him to express my disappointment about being criticized for something positive. I don't apologize for saying "crap." It got attention. Besides arousing Mr. Carey, the local Relay for Life kickoff event went well and people came after seeing the PSA.

Mr. Carey called our conversation a blessing. We ended with the promise to have coffee. I encouraged him to start a Relay for Life team. I hope he does and you can too at www.relayforlife.org/quadcitiesil.

Help us kick the "whatever you want to call it" out of cancer.

I look forward to "Coffee with Carey." Editors note: Niedelman is a Local 4 News and Fox 18 News anchor</TEXT>
