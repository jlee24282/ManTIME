<TEXT type="str">I first heard the word cancer when I was six. I knew it was bad because my mother told me so. Her mother had it. It wasn&apos;t until I got older that I really understood. My grandmother died from pancreatic cancer a little more than a year later.

Since then, I&apos;ve lost too many more friends and family. I hate cancer. A letter to the editor from Jack Carey, &quot;&quot; discouraged me. It criticized Local 4 News Anchor Jim Niedelman and his station for an &quot;endorsed cancer public service announcement (PSA).&quot; I&apos;m the guy behind that PSA.

We didn&apos;t endorse cancer. We encouraged people to join the Relay for Life, an organization dedicated to cancer research, education and prevention. Jack Carey complained that I asked for help to &quot;kick the crap out of cancer.&quot; Carey hosted a local radio program in the 1970s called &quot;Coffee with Carey&quot; and now runs a ministry.

I called him to express my disappointment about being criticized for something positive. I don&apos;t apologize for saying &quot;crap.&quot; It got attention. Besides arousing Mr. Carey, the local Relay for Life kickoff event went well and people came after seeing the PSA.

Mr. Carey called our conversation a blessing. We ended with the promise to have coffee. I encouraged him to start a Relay for Life team. I hope he does and you can too at www.relayforlife.org/quadcitiesil.

Help us kick the &quot;whatever you want to call it&quot; out of cancer.

I look forward to &quot;Coffee with Carey.&quot; Editorâ€™s note: Niedelman is a Local 4 News and Fox 18 News anchor</TEXT>
