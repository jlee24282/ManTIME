What is the proper style for inserting a person’s nickname into his or her written full name? 
 
Most stylebooks specify placing the nickname after the forename and enclosing it in quotation marks. Some stylebooks say parentheses may be used instead. 
 
Examples of the preferred form: General James &quot;Mad Dog&quot; Mattis, Coach Paul &quot;Bear&quot; Bryant, Prime Minister Margaret &quot;Iron Lady&quot; Thatcher. 
 
Dictionaries say the word &quot;nickname&quot; comes from the Middle English term &quot;eke name.&quot; &quot;Eke&quot; means &quot;addition.&quot; A person with an additional name would have &quot;an eke name.&quot; 
 
The term &quot;an eke name,&quot; when run together in speech, sounds like &quot;a neke name&quot;; thus &quot;nickname.&quot;
