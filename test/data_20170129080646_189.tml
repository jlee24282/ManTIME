<TEXT type="str">After last week, it should be clear to anyone with a pulse and intermittent cable or Internet access that science is now under full assault by the usual suspects. Emboldened by their slim electoral win in the form of popular vote loser Donald Trump, conservative extremists are chomping at the bit and frothing at the mouth at the thought of eliminating research that might produce inconvenient facts, and going full Lysenko on the rest. And when we say science is under assault, what we really mean is scientists, and by extension, all of the rest of us who depend on their work. There may be a science-based demonstration in the early stages of planning:We have not settled on a date yet but will do so as quickly as possible and announce it here. Although this will start with a march, we hope to use this as a starting point to take a stand for science in politics. Slashing funding and restricting scientists from communicating their findings with the public is absurd and cannot be allowed to stand as policy. This is a non-partisan issue that reaches far beyond people in the STEM fields and should concern anyone who values empirical research and science. There are also organizations already up and running that protect science and foster an open, progressive atmosphere. We’re going to need them and more. Because here’s just a few highlights of Trumpco’s first few days in office:Trump admin officials initially decreed that EPA climate science pages would be “scrubbed.” After that was leaked, they appeared to back off. But no one really knows what to do because the Trump administration is, so far, mostly incompetent when it comes setting and implementing even the most basic policy.At NASA there has been no direction, no suggestions, no policy forthcoming of any sort. The new administration stumbled badly over crowd size photos and estimates, allegedly due to Trump’s own raging insecurities. When Trump lashed out via surrogates to the National Park Service, rogue Twitter accounts popped up roasting him even more.More rogue science Twitter accounts then followed suit. The barely announced science march skyrocketed in two days to almost million followers.There is resistance in this nation, a sort of vicious, national immune response to a foreign pathogen invading the body politic. It is already huge, it is at every level and in every community, and it is growing. Join it.</TEXT>
