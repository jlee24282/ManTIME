<TEXT type="str">KINGSTON, R.I. - The Bonnies are back in the thick of the Atlantic 10 Conference championship chase, led by St. Bonaventure men&apos;s basketball head coach and North Attleboro native son Mark Schmidt

St. Bonaventure has been a fixture on the national hardwood over the past four seasons as Schmidt has cultivated a string of successful seasons, recording win totals of 18, 18, 22 and now 13 in his 10th season of leading the Bonnies&apos; bench.

&quot;If you don&apos;t have character guys, tough guys, guys who want to win, you can&apos;t win,&quot; said Schmidt, whose Bonnies left the Ryan Center at URI Saturday with a 71-59 loss as they were held 22 points below their season scoring average.

St. Bonaventure posted a season low of 22 points in the first half where the Bonnies shot only 26 percent (7-for-27). After trailing by as many as 12 points in the half, and 15 points within the first minute of the second half, the Bonnies reeled off 11 straight points down the stretch to make it a one-possession game at 55-52 with four minutes to go.

&quot;We played on our heels, we missed four front ends of one-and-ones, layups they got into us,&quot; said Schmidt, whose Bonnies had a three-game win streak snapped. &quot;We showed some character there coming back. We were down by 18 to St. Joseph&apos;s and came back and won it.

&quot;The Atlantic 10, you have to play well at home or away. You have to play every possession - the level of competition is too high for you just to show up.&quot;

It seems like yesterday, rather than the quarter-century that Schmidt was suited up in the green and gold of Bishop Feehan High (class of 1981) where he finished his career as the Shamrocks&apos; No. 2 all-time leading scorer with 1.450 points.

Earlier this season, Schmidt moved into the No. 2 spot as the all-time winningest coach at St. Bonaventure, surpassing Jimmy Satalin, and second only to Larry Weise (202 wins). Schmidt is currently at 159-139.

The Atlantic 10 Conference&apos;s Coach of the Year last season, Schmidt led the Bonnies to a share of the regular season title with their best-ever league record (14-4) along with a regular-season record 22 wins, marking the first 20-win season for St. Bonaventure since 1976-77.

And yet, despite being deemed a shoo-in as an at-large team for the NCAA, the Bonnies were snubbed and had to settle for their 16th NIT appearance.

Schmidt&apos;s current roster has three seniors and four juniors, including players from six states, as well as from Montreal, Toronto and Nigeria - including five transfer student-athletes.

The Bonnies&apos; backcourt of Jaylen Adams and Matt Mobley is the fourth-highest scoring set of guards in the country, averaging 41.2 points per game. Adams is No. 2 in the A-10 in scoring and No. 16 nationally (21.6), while also leading the league in assists (112). Mobley ranks No. 4 in the A-10 in scoring (19.6) and is second in 3-pointers (57 made, 41 percent shooting) with the duo fueling the A-10&apos;s most prolific offense that averages 80.8 points per game.

Against URI, Adams scored 25 points, but Mobley was reduced to nine points (on 1-for-10 shooting). Not just that, but the Bonnies shot just 30 percent overall for the game (6-for-19 on 3-pointers); committed 15 turnovers; had 15 shots blocked; and surrendered 38 points in the paint to the Rams (13-7).

URI had four players in double-scoring figures with senior forward Hassan Martin (20 points, eight rebounds, four blocked shots), Kuran Iverson (12 points, nine rebounds, six blocked shots), E.C. Matthews (13 points, four rebounds, three assists) and Jared Terrell (12) leading the way. Notably, URI had 18 assists on its 25 field goals.

The Bonnies (13-7, 5-3) had won four of their last five outings, including three straight - averaging 80.8 points per game on 46 percent shooting from the floor. However, the Bonnies are only No. 96 on the RPI Index.

&quot;You have to find a way to win when you&apos;re not playing your best,&quot; said Schmidt. &quot;Those are the days and the games that you need to pull out if you want to have a decent year.

&quot;We were too passive in the first half,&quot; he added. &quot;In this league, if you don&apos;t play with passion, with a sense of urgency, you&apos;re not going to win. You just can&apos;t show up. We have guys who don&apos;t quit.&quot;

Schmidt&apos;s Bonnies have had six seasons with .500 records or better. Over the past four seasons, St. Bonaventure has been a flagship for the A-10.

Not surprisingly, Schmidt&apos;s name has surfaced for other coaching jobs on the East Coast, notably at his alma mater, Boston College, when Steve Donahue was not re-hired, and at Rutgers, after Mike Rice departed.

&quot;If you don&apos;t show up in this league, you&apos;re going to get beat,&quot; added Schmidt, the Bonnies having to play with chips on their shoulders. &quot;That&apos;s how we do it, we don&apos;t have top-100 players, we have guys that are under the radar, kids that love to play, have a passion for it and work hard.

&quot;That&apos;s how we&apos;ve done it, our goal is to stay in the top six (in the A-10). Even after last year, you have to play with confidence, that you can play at this level - we can&apos;t take a back seat to anybody.&quot; The Bonnies are tied for third place in the A-10 while URI team improved to 9-1 at home. ... St. Bonaventure&apos;s defense has improved in A-10 play, primarily over the past three games as the Bonnies allowed an average of only 56 points per game to Fordham, Saint Louis and Saint Joseph&apos;s - in each, limiting those teams to 21 points or less in a half. In their seven A-10 games, the Bonnies have allowed an average of 69 points per game compared to 77 points per game over 12 non-conference games. ... On the glass, the Bonnies rank second in the A-10 in offensive rebounds at 12.5 per game and No. 3 in overall rebounding margin, having won the battle of the boards in 12 of 19 games. ... URI has a 36-29 lead in the series, although St. Bonaventure won five of the last seven games.</TEXT>
