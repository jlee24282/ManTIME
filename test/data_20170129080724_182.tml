<TEXT type="str">PARKERSBURG — Par Mar Stores has reported another successful Giving Back Campaign for the past holiday season. 
 
Par Mar Stores have raised more than $38,000 from its Wednesday Wish Days. 
 
“Our locations raise money all year long for children in our community on Christmas morning. Our team members and our customers make Wednesday Wish Days the success that it is. We couldn’t give back to our community without them,” said Brian Waugh, chief operating officer of Par Mar Oil Co. “We sell WWD tags $1 at a time to bring a smile to a child’s face on Christmas morning. That is what Christmas is all about.” These funds were disbursed back into the county in which they were raised as clothing and toys for children 18 years and younger. 
 
The funds are disbursed by a third party organization such as Secret Santa, The Salvation Army, West Virginia Children’s Home Society, C.A.R.E.S., Community Action, Christmas for the Little Ones and other associations which meet the criteria on disbursing the funds in Ohio, West Virginia, Kentucky and Pennsylvania. 
 
The fundraising efforts were made possible by donations of Par Mar customers purchasing a WWD tag for $1. 
 
“Our team members raise money all year long for the Wednesday Wish Day campaign. Some great creative to raise money, and others are successful selling the tags. The best part of WWD, is the money raised stays in the county where it was raised for children,” says Waugh. 
 
The store raising the most this year was Par Mar Store No. 18, Division Street in Parkersburg. Dana Mossor, Store Manager, and his team have been the sales leader in this campaign for the last two years. 
 
Mossor said his team had success with the Every Child Deserves a Loving Home Campaign with the West Virginia Children’s Home Society for the past three years as well. Dana contributes his success to his team members and customers, 
 
“We appreciate our customer’s helping with the gifts for the kids. It’s wonderful that we support kids right here in our community,” said Mossor. “Having a great team that gets behind our campaigns is the key to our success. We couldn’t help our community without our customers and my great team here.”</TEXT>
