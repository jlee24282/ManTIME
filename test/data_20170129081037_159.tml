<TEXT type="str">WATERLOO — The City Council will hold a public work session Monday to discuss next year’s budget.

The meeting at 5:30 p.m. Monday in City Hall will take advantage of what would normally be a day off, because regular Waterloo council meetings are only held on the first four Mondays of any month. This week is January’s fifth Monday.

Mayor Quentin Hart said the work session is designed to provide some baseline information about the budget for the fiscal year starting July 1 and discuss the process moving forward.

He said additional budget meetings are tentatively slated for Feb. 8 and Feb. 11, the latter being a Saturday. The city must set the budget before March 15 to comply with state law.

This week’s meeting is not designed for public input, but future meetings and the mandatory budget meeting will allow comments.

Meanwhile, the city has put a link on the home page of its website — www.cityofwaterlooiowa.com — where anyone can post ideas on priorities, programs, improvements and organizational processes related to the budget.

Last year, a deeply divided City Council voted 4-3 to approve a budget cutting the property tax rate from $17.76 to about $17.61 per $1,000 of taxable value.

New goals adopted by the City Council in December included reducing “the city’s property tax levies through a responsible balance of cost reduction in city operations and increases in taxable property valuations to ensure that Waterloo is a competitive, affordable and livable city.”</TEXT>
