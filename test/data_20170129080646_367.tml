<content type="str">Aam aadmi contestant Manu Punjabi has quit the show, a day before the grand finale.       
Manu Punjabi has chosen Rs 10 lakh over a place in Top 3, a day before the grand finale of Bigg Boss 10. The offer was made by Bigg Boss to all the finalists, and Manu lapped it up immediately. With Manu gone, his best friend in the house-Manveer, Bani Judge and Lopamudra Raut have become the Top 3 finalists who will compete for the coveted trophy and Rs 40 lakh tonight, in the star-studded BB 10 grand finale. 
 
Manu has made a smart move, considering he had lesser chances of winning the show compared to Manveer, Bani and Lopa. Even in the ticket to finale task, he lost to Manveer after getting way lesser votes than him. In the Mela task, Bani and Manveer got positive feedback from outside, which proves that they are more popular than Lopa and Manu.
