<content type="str">If you read the Highway Code Mr James it states pedestrians &apos;should always show due care and consideration for others&apos;.As a jogger I have encountered this myself mainly on bytheway Wimborne. People would rather block your path than move to one side. I wonder, if you came across someone walking on this narrow path, would you both just mutually allow each other room to pass? I suspect the answer is yes. Oh and I don&apos;t want to run on a running track.

As a fellow pedestrian I have just as much right as you do.
