<content type="str">, 65, passed away Jan. 26, 2017, at Hospice House of Reno County, Hutchinson. A lifelong resident of Hutchinson, she was born May 10, 1951, the daughter of Dennis and Florence Maley.

She was fascinated with reading and watching &quot;true crime&quot; books and shows, and had a particular fancy for watching the ID Channel. A lifelong fan of Elvis and The Beatles, she also loved DQ Blizzards and Nu-Way sandwiches. It was always &quot;dessert first&quot; and take the rest home to eat â€“ &quot;doesn&apos;t everyone do that?&quot;

She married Terrill Graber April 1, 1988. He preceded her in death Nov. 6, 2016. Survivors include: her adopted mother, Verna Jo Smith; a son, Mark Jordan (Lori); a daughter, Amy Black; a sister, Linda Walters (Tom); adopted sister and brother, Myrna and Vic Jordan; close friend and confidant, Margaret Hahn. She was preceded in death by her parents; a sister, Mary Windholtz; and a brother, Dennis Maley Jr.

Per her request, cremation has taken place. The family has established a memorial fund and gifts may be made to the American Cancer Society, in care of Old Mission-Heritage Funeral Home, 528 N. Main, Hutchinson.</content>
