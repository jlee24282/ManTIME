STEUBENVILLE — Franciscan University of Steubenville, in conjunction with the Jefferson County Chamber of Commerce, took time Saturday between the Baron’s men’s and women’s basketball games against the University of Pittsburgh at Bradford to remember Hank Kuzma, Franciscan’s legendary men’s basketball coach. 
  
The second-annual Hank Kuzma Community Day brought together chamber members and the university. 
 
Tricia Maple-Damewood, chamber of commerce president, said the university sports department is involved in the community and the chamber decided to encourage chamber members to attend university athletic events. She said the chamber decided to cosponsor the Hank Kuzma Community Day. 
 
Hollywood City Center, Trinity Health System, EM-Media and Mosti Funeral Home as sponsors provided a financial contribution for the event. 
 
Hank Kuzma died in September 2014 at the age of 86. 
 
Kuzma’s affiliation with the university spanned more than five decades. As an innovative young basketball coach hired by the College of Steubenville in 1954, Kuzma once led his teams to win 56 home games in a row. In 1958, the 24-1 Barons were named the No. 1 Small College Basketball Team in the U.S by the United Press International Board of Coaches. At Midland High School, he had an undefeated season at 29-0 in 1965, and his overall mark from 1960-67 was 141-15. That undefeated team included future pro basketball players Norm Van Lier and Simmie Hill. 
 
Kuzma left the college before the 1959 season, but returned as basketball coach in 1978. When the university dropped intercollegiate athletics in 1981, he channeled his on-court strengths as coach into new endeavors. He served as the university’s alumni director, director of corporate and foundation support and director of development. He was involved in every capital campaign and was instrumental in raising funds for the expansion of the J.C. Williams Center and most of the newer buildings on a campus that has been completely remade since 1981. 
 
“It is so nice of the Franciscan University to do this, and it is really special,” said Kuzma’s wife, Kay. 
 
Kay traveled from Cocoa Beach, Fla., with her grandson, Jordan Kuzma, for the event. 
 
“He would have thought this is fantastic,” she said, sitting in the bleachers at the basketball court named after her husband. 
 
“The university meant everything to him. He loved the priests first of all. He loved the faculty and administration and anyone who worked for the university,” she said. 
 
Kay remembers the day the university dropped intercollegiate athletics. 
 
“I was at home and he called me and said the (university) was going to drop sports. He knew I would hear about it on the radio and wanted me to hear it from him. He then directed his energy into another area, and he did a fantastic job. He was a people person. He had that gift in that regard,” she said. 
 
Mike Florak, university executive director of community relations and interim athletic director, said the Hank Kuzma Community Day is a great way to commemorate Kuzma’s contribution to the university and the community. 
 
“We are thankful to the sponsors and the people of the community that came out. We appreciate partnering with the chamber for this event,” he said. 
 
“Hank left an indelible mark on Franciscan University, the athletic program and the Steubenville community. Hank built a championship basketball program during his tenure, and helped to shape what Franciscan athletics has become today. He was known throughout the Ohio Valley and beyond for his honesty, integrity and willingness to help with a wide range of civic and Catholic causes,” Florak said.</TEXT>
