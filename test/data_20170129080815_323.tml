<TITLE>Governors budget fails disability workers</TITLE>
<TEXT>As noted in The Daily Gazettes article Local legislators weigh in on Cuomos state budget of January 19 [p. A9], Gov. Andrew Cuomos budget reflects a rosy picture of middle class tax cuts, ride-sharing services and infrastructure spending. 
 
As the article states, however, there are apparent deficiencies. 
 
One in particular is that the budget clearly fails to address the low wages of direct care workers  as noted by state Sen. George Amedore and Assemblyman Angelo Santabarbara  a position also supported by other legislators from both sides of the aisle. 
 
These highly dedicated critical care workers have enormous responsibility in caring for New York states physically and mentally disabled citizens, including our children. 
 
An increase of $90 million would provide important progress and would only be a tiny fraction of this over $150 billion budget  a small investment towards adequately compensating these grossly underpaid workers. 
Yet there is an absence of any appreciation or recognition of the most difficult and awesome responsibilities of these workers. 
 
They are responsible, and culpable for, dispensing life-sustaining medications multiple times throughout the day, as well as supporting our children in meeting their essential daily needs. These needs include bathing, toileting, assistance with dressing, cooking, feeding and transporting our family members either to their jobs or day programs, where they receive speech and physical therapies. 
 
Why are these workers forgotten once again? 
 
The article states already a vacancy rate of 10 percent and a turnover rate of over 20 percent. 
 
With all the attention and provision for increases for minimum wage and fast-food workers, the critical care worker is the forgotten step-child once again. 
 
It is completely predictable that those other wage increases will increase vacancies and turnover further and jeopardize the care of our family membersthe most vulnerable in society. 
 
Clearly, significant budget provision is essential for these critical care workers who are grossly underpaid for the incredible responsibilities they have. 
 
We urge the governor and the legislators to fulfill their most fundamental responsibilities to those who are unable to care for themselves and plug this most serious hole in New York states budget. 
 
New Yorks direct care worker wages must be substantially increased so that the profession can attract and retain qualified employees to preserve the public welfare. 
 
Surely there are many places to find this funding given this highest purpose of preserving the public welfare  the most fundamental and greatest obligation of our elected leaders.
