<TITLE>Feodor van den Dool</TITLE>
<TEXT>. He was born on February 19, 1918, in The Hauge, a city located on the western coast of the Netherlands.

Feodor is preceded in death by his parents Leendert Willem Coenraad and Betty Regine Oelrichs van den Dool; his wife and the love of his life, Gertrude, and his second wife, Alice van den Dool; two brothers Case and Lein and one sister, Betty.

Feodor is survived by a daughter, Anita van den Dool and Melody Rountree; a son, Philip van den Dool and his wife Linda; two sisters-in-law, Elly Poelman and Willy van den Born; four grandchildren; great grandchildren, great-great grandchildren, many nieces, nephews, relatives and friends.

In his most recent years, he was particularly fond of his personal staff of assistants, Shamiko Wilson, Terrie Leager and the Friend family, Barbara, Denise and Gerald.

Feodor is eternally grateful to Barbara Friend; neighbor, Antonio Perez, and members of the Tulsa Fire Department who in 2015 rescued him and Barbara from a devastating house fire that destroyed his home.

Feodor was a lifelong member of the Southminster Presbyterian church in Tulsa and at the time of his passing, was the oldest living member of the church where his children were baptized.

Feodor served in the Dutch military in the years leading up to World War II. When Nazi Germany occupied the Netherlands, Feodor led an "underground" resistance movement by providing the allies with vital information to help with the war effort.

Feodor was a radio operator and actually built the radio he used to transmit information of the German activities to the allies. Remarkably, Feodor actually rode a stationary bike to generate power for the radio transmissions. Had Feodor's activities been discovered by the Germans, it would have meant certain death.

After the war, much of the Netherlands lie in ruins from the Nazi bombing campaigns; housing was limited, so Feodor and his new bride made a decision to start a new life and family in America.

Feodor was offered a position as an electronics technician with Magnecord in Chicago in 1955. Magnecord was later acquired by Midwestern Instruments which relocated to Tulsa. Midwestern Instruments was then acquired by Telex, where Feodor retired at age 70.

On October 9, 1963, Feodor and his wife Gertrude, would become citizens of the United States of America. It was to be one of his proudest accomplishments. As a fitting tribute, Feodor cast a vote in the 2016 presidential campaign.

Feodor was an avid ham operator and member of the Broken Arrow Amateur Radio Club. During his life, he repaired and refurbished reel-to-reel recorders for radio stations all over the country. He also enjoyed camping and fishing, and always insisted on leaving the campground cleaner than he found it.

A memorial service will be held on Tuesday, January 31, 2017, at 10:00 a.m., at the Memorial Park Cemetery Chapel. Moore's Southlawn 918-663-2233 share memories at www.moorefuneral.com</TEXT>
