<TITLE>Volvo S90 and V90 score 5 star rating in Euro NCAP crash tests</TITLE>
<TEXT>The new Volvo S90 sedan and V90 estate are the first cars to score a full six points in the Autonomous Emergency Braking for Pedestrians (AEB Pedestrian) test by Euro NCAP. Both these vehicles in fact scored overall five-star rating in the stringent crash tests. 
 
The S90s and V90s results surpass the best overall score of any model tested last year. For the 2017 testing cycle, the vehicles managed to score high thanks in large part to the high level of standard safety equipment. 
 
The Autonomous Emergency Braking tests are a result of the advanced City Safety system which is standard in new Volvo cars. City Safety works by identifying potential hazards on the road ahead, such as vehicles, pedestrians and cyclists in certain situations, day and night. 
 
The AEB Pedestrian tests by Euro NCAP are designed to check performance of pedestrian-detection systems using three road-crossing scenarios, all of which would result in a fatal collision if the AEB system did not intervene. 
 
While the S90 is already on sale in India and doing well, Volvo India will introduce the V90 estate in the pumped up Cross County avatar.</TEXT>
