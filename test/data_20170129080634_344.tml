<TITLE>Tiger Woods heads for Omega Dubai Desert Classic after missed cut at Torrey Pines</TITLE>
<TEXT>The former world No 1 missed the cut at the Farmers Insurance Open on Friday  his first PGA Tour appearance in 17 months. The American golfers next stop? Dubai.

Comeback kid 

Woods, a 14-time major champion, was looking forward to his return to Torrey Pines, a venue in which he had won on eight times previously. But an opening-day 76 left him on four-over par and struggling to make the cut, before Fridays second-round 72 meant he missed out on the weekend by four strokes. Finally fully recovered from back surgery, he tees it up this week at the Omega Dubai Desert Classic.

Classic credentials 

Woods, 41, has a very favourable record at the Dubai event, winning in 2006 and 2008. In fact, in his seven appearances, he has also finished runner-up, tied third and tied fifth, although he did struggle on his last visit to Emirates Golf Club, coming home tied 41st in 2014. On how his body would hold up with the 17-hour flight to Dubai, Woods said: "Flying out here was something I hadnt done in a while. So now weve got a pretty good jaunt."

Comfort factor 

On whether his familiarity with the Dubai tournament gives him some reassurance, Woods said: "I know the golf course, I know the greens, I know the putts, I know how its going to play. And Ive played it under so many different conditions over the years, whether weve had a lot of rough, no rough. Weve had shamals, no shamals. Its nice going to a golf course that I know."

Augusta build-up 

Beginning in Dubai, Woods is playing three times in the next four weeks as he steps up preparation for the Masters on April 6  the years first major. A four-time winner at Augusta, he was generally pleased with his progress at Torrey Pines, saying: "I felt I made some nice strides, just wish I could be playing the weekend because I really love this course. I need to get more rounds under my belt. Just like everybody, Im trying to get ready for that first week in April."
