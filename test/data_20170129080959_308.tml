<TEXT type="str">They still have a lot to teach us.Children’s books are full of wisdom. They contain some of the most important, well said, and beautifully told advice that can be found in the literary world. It sticks with us long after we’ve graduated to chapter books, and it is formative. This advice applies to elementary school, grown-up life, and beyond. It’s true though, after childhood, we tend to leave the children’s books on the shelves to gather dust. That is, until our kids reach for them and we rediscover them once more. Revisit your favorites, from Corduory to The Berenstain Bears, and remember the lessons they taught you growing up. We would do well to reread a kid’s book every now and again. They have lots to teach us at every stage of life. We should treasure their simple lessons, because they always, always apply. Evergreen Hide from dynamic section of channel/sub channel pages.
