They were said to have helped the smugglers fill up between 800 and 1,000 litres of fuel per day. 
 
Its director Datuk Abdul Ghani Harun said the duo, in their 30s, were nabbed at their workplace in Pasir Pekan, Tumpat. 
 
&quot;Both have been detained by our officers around midnight. They were suspected to be in cohort with petrol smugglers in filling up between 800 and 1,000 litres of fuel per day,&quot; he said.
