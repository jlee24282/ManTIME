<TEXT type="str">I always totally denounced people who wrote their memoirs, says Harriet Harman, who has just written her memoir. There is a copy of A Woman’s Work in front of us. A hardback whopper of nearly 400 pages with all kinds of enticing entries in the index: Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers, 18; Association of Metropolitan Authorities, 106; Mothers in Manufacturing Report, 219, 235. One thing I learn about Harriet Harman: she’s not one to shy away from the boring detail. During her time on the frontbench, she says, people would sit in cabinet meetings and literally be writing their diaries in front of her. “And I used to think, ‘We’ve got a country to run!’ I was very moral high ground about it, all the time denouncing them as male vanity projects.” So, this is what? A female vanity project? “Yes!” she says. “It’s a self-consciously female vanity project. When all my colleagues’ autobiographies came out, the first thing you do is to look at the photos and it would all be men. Maybe there’d be their wife and someone who worked for them. And possibly Hillary Clinton and that’s it. And it’s like, where were the 100 women who swept into parliament? Where was the transformation reflected in our politics and the change in women’s lives? You remember Sheila Rowbotham’s Hidden from History? Her thing about unless it’s written about, it’s invisible and then it hasn’t happened? “Well, funnily enough, even though I was in the cabinet at the time, I don’t seem to be in these memoirs either. You might find one reference, ‘Harman, sacking of’. And I thought, ‘Well, stuff that’. So I found it very easy to do my U-turn.” Oh, it’s raining men in the Labour party From someone else, this would be hypocritical self-aggrandisement. But this is Harriet Harman, AKA Harriet Harperson. Her conversation is littered with references to “the cause”, “the struggle”, “the mission” – her whole adult life, and her entire career at Westminster, has been in single-minded pursuit of equal rights. And it’s fair to say that A Woman’s Work is in some ways more about the changing political representation of women than it is about her. It’s just that she defines and embodies that change. We’re in the kitchen of her house in her south London constituency, a warm, comfortable, family home with various piles of clutter and a prowling cat, the kind of fantasy dwelling that would make a millennial’s heart bleed, and she’s telling me how they bought it in 1987 when the area “was all social workers and FE lecturers”. And now? “Now it’s bankers and corporate lawyers.” When Harman first became an MP, at a byelection in 1982, London was a Tory stronghold, a family home was an achievable goal and she was one of only 11 women Labour MPs. And the only one who was pregnant. She was a completely new sight in British politics: a young, pregnant, feminist MP. The photos in the book show her campaigning with a babe in arms and then a toddler and they culminate in the still-record-breaking sight of the 101 Labour women elected during the 1997 landslide: Blair’s Babes. Though she’s still cross about that. The photo. Tutting when I bring it up. Because there they all are, “Folletted” up in jackets all the colours of the rainbow, the prescribed style decreed by the Labour party’s fashion arbiter, the then member for Stevenage, Barbara Follett, massed around a grinning Tony Blair. “It was supposed to be the sisterhood!” says Harman. “It was supposed to be us, the women, doing it for ourselves. Not as the backing group for the great leader.” Even more galling was the fact that it had been her idea. She’d arranged it all, when suddenly at the last minute someone added Blair to the line-up. “It was a complete failure to understand that this was a moment for women.” On the other hand, she says, at least people remember it. Though she backtracks almost immediately. “Though I think they would anyway.” And a lot of it, of them, was down to her. Campaigning and networking and inspiring and ultimately helping to get the highly unpopular but effective all-women shortlists through, a struggle, documented at length, in the book. Alan Clarke’s Diaries this is not, though she does recall how, as Robin Cook’s deputy on the shadow frontbench, she had promised to take her son to the Bromley Odeon and, despite frantic calls to deliver a response to striking ambulance workers, she took him to the Bromley Odeon. Cook was furious. And since she couldn’t think of an excuse, she simply told him: “I was not available.” Cook responded with “conspiratorial... Read more</TEXT>
