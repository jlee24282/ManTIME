<content type="str">England will be looking to wrap up the T20 series with a win in Nagpur today. (Reuters)  
The series against England has been a completely dominated by the home side – till now; it has been a season where first the English Test side led by Alastair Cook &amp; co. were whitewashed 4-0 and later the ODI side led by Eoin Morgan lost a nail-biting high-scoring series 2-1. Until the Test series ended, it was quite predictable that India will win courtesy key roles played by captain Virat Kohli (leading the batting charts) and Ravichandran Ashwin (leading the bowlers pack). 
 
But, things changed as England are now leading the T20 series. Cricket purists clearly indicated that the ODI and T20 series will be more closely fought encounters. That has been proved right, as Team India under the reign of new captain Virat Kohli is under pressure of losing a home series – the T20 series. The match to be played today things have become a bit more tougher, as Team India has a poor record at the VCA stadium in Jamtha, Nagpur; having lost both the previous encounters – to Sri Lanka by 29 runs on Dec. 9, 2009 and New Zealand by 47 runs on March 15, 2016 in the ICC World T20. 
 
If England win today, it will be their first series win against India in India since 2012-13 season. Having won the 1st T20, England is riding high on confidence and will look to take an unassailable 2-0 lead in the 3 match T20 series.
