Hello again, friends! 
 
As a follow-up to my recent Saints Row games reviews, I figured that I would compare the first two games--when the series was still trying to position itself as a GTA-style game, before it started doing it&apos;s own thing. 
 
Here are the highlights, and lowlights, of Saints Row and Saints Row 2 and how these games compare to each other. 
 

 Saints Row  Pros:  characters  music  story  vehicles damage (progressive, realistic)  driving  jacking (being driven)  steering (solid)   Cons:  vehicle camera (no position lock)  locating   weapons aiming  ammunition    Saints Row 2  Pros:  characters creation  personalities   menu system  money (more, sooner)  music  story  vehicles crib garages  durability  locating  Septic Avenger activity   weapons aiming  more ammo  purchaseable ammo   Cons:  character animations (too long, make controls unresponsive)  cheap deaths (too many)  checkpoint system (inconsistent)  vehicles steering (twitchy)  entry (often fails)  camera (no position lock--default aim too high)  Racing re-design  jacking (being driven; often fails)  extraction while driving    

 Summary  
While Saints Row 2 has more pros than Saints Row, it also has more cons. 
 
The original game is definitely more a driving fan&apos;s game. Its vehicle controls and responsiveness are better suited to gamers who like their vehicles to feel more like the real thing. Not to say that the vehicle controls in Saints Row 2 don&apos;t work, but they do feel more arcade-like. 
 
By comparison, Saints Row 2 is more a shooter fan&apos;s game. The supply of guns and ammo is greater and, if you run out, you have the option to buy more (in the original, though, you can run-out of ammo completely). The accuracy of the weapons in Saints Row 2 also are much better for more bullets hitting their targets. 
 
Saints Row 2 looks better, but as an driving adventure game, Saints Row feels better. The story for Saints Row is a little more solid, but the shooting controls in Saints Row 2 are much better. Choose the game that best fits your play-style and you won&apos;t go wrong. 
 
Thanks for reading; game on!
