<TITLE>Comments: Op-ed: We march for justice and equality, and we will not go backwards</TITLE>
<TEXT>President Donald Trump is my president. He was elected, and this is what democracy looks like. He does not, however, stand for the values that are important to me. Nor does he represent the vision that I hold for the future of the United States of America. So I marched in women's marches to show my disapproval for the anti-women rhetoric and actions belonging to the current president of the United States, and those belonging to many politicians in the Utah Legislature. 
 
I marched in Salt Lake City, and I marched in Park City. I march because I aim to be present, to be heard, and to represent those who are unable to march. I march because I am lucky to be an American woman living in the great state of Utah. The United States is a country where my civil liberties allow me the freedom to peacefully assemble, protest in public spaces and photograph anything in plain view. These are the rights that protected the thousands of Utahns who marched through the cascading snow to the Utah State Capitol and descended into the rotunda on the first day of the 2017 legislative session. 
  
I march for women's rights that are inclusive of reproductive justice, clean air, health care, racial equality, LGBTQ rights, gun control, environmental protection, indigenous people's rights, immigrants' rights, education reform, religious freedom, economic justice and more. I march for women's rights as a holistic movement. I march to reaffirm the notions of equality, diversity, intersectionality and social justice. 
 
I march because politicians are attacking basic access to reproductive health care. Political leaders have pledged to introduce legislation attacking Planned Parenthood. Trump has already taken a severely anti-women action by reinstating the anti-health Mexico City Policy (the Global Gag Rule). 
 
Planned Parenthood health centers are essential to the health and wellbeing of thousands of Utahns. In 2016, they provided more than 190,000 services to nearly 46,000 patients. They proudly provide abortion services. However, the vast majority of their work is providing preventative services, including family planning, cancer screenings and STI screenings. Last year, they provided more than 9,000 youth with the tools necessary to make informed decisions through sexual and reproductive health education. 
 
Legislation that "defunds" Planned Parenthood specifically targets patients who rely on federal safety net programs, such as Medicaid or Title X. For many, Planned Parenthood is the only health care provider they can turn to, as nationwide over half of Planned Parenthood health centers are in rural or otherwise medically underserved areas. The people who would be hurt most by "defunding" are those who already face barriers to accessing reproductive health care: people of color, people with low incomes, and people who live in rural areas. 
 
I march, and now, I stand. I stand with many allies prepared and eager to work to protect women's rights. I stand with those who disagree with my priorities, motivated and willing to find common ground. 
 
We must all take a stand and unite around an inclusive women's rights and reproductive justice movement. We will not let legislators take our health care, our education, and our rights away. We will not go backwards. We have the power to protect women's rights. So let's stand up! And let's get to work!
