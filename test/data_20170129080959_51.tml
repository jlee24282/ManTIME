<content type="str">A UK scheme is working to help more young people with learning disabilities get to gigs. 

Access to gigs is improving for people with physical disabilities, but other music fans still struggle to attend concerts. 

Gig Buddies Scotland is an organisation that works to help these people attend gigs. 

They match volunteers with music fans who need to be accompanied to events. 

Campaigner Samuel Maggs helps run Gig Buddies Scotland and he says there is still stigma towards people with learning disabilities. 

He has been going to gigs with his friend Marsaili, who has learning disabilities, for six months. 

&quot;Some people need another person with them at all times,&quot; says 22-year-old Samuel. &quot;Otherwise they can&apos;t get out at events that they really have a passion for. 

&quot;She needs one on one support as she can be very anxious using things like public transport. It helps people get to places. 

&quot;Seeing her every month is a highlight.&quot;

He believe venues would benefit financially by welcoming more music fans with learning disabilities through their doors. 

&quot;People with additional support needs don&apos;t necessarily like different things to you,&quot; he says. &quot;They want to come along to these gigs and they are another consumer base for venues.&quot;

Now Gig Buddies Scotland has arranged a special gig in the city as part of Independent Venue Week at Edinburgh&apos;s Electric Circus, which will feature some performers who have learning disabilities. 

Samual has a background in music himself and he and Marsaili will be opening the show with an acoustic set. 

Also on the line-up are The Humors and UpMo Experience - whose members all have learning disabilities. 

&quot;We aim to help people with conditions such as autism, Down&apos;s Syndrome or anyone with mixed additional support needs,&quot; says Samuel. 

&quot;It&apos;s a blanket term as we don&apos;t want to exclude anyone.&quot; 

Many gigs and festivals can provide a free ticket or concession for a carer if evidence of disability is proven. 

However, you normally need to book directly through the venue, rather than through a ticket agency.
