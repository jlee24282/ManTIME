<TITLE>Crocodile sunbathes under Chinese New Year sun in Bukit Mertajam</TITLE>
<TEXT>Authorities on standby to wave reptile back into Prai River, where it belongs. 
 

 
BUKIT MERTAJAM: Theres a crocodile on the loose at Kampung Guar Jering, 6km north of here, sparking panic among residents here. 
 
The 3m-long buaya tembaga (saltwater crocodile) made its appearance yesterday evening, sparking a buaya-hunt by the civil defence and firemen. 
 

 
Penang Fire and Rescue Department officials say they have yet to catch the crocodile, which was reported by people next to an oil palm estate. 
 
Meanwhile, State Wildlife and National Parks (Perhilitan) director Loo Kean Seong said the sighting of crocodiles in the area was nothing new. 
 
He said the crocodile could have come out for a sun bath after the Prai River burst its banks from a heavy downpour recently. 
 
Do not disturb it. It would usually go back to the river on its own after some time. 
 
When we find it, we will lead it back to the river. No use setting traps as they would mind their own business and eventually go back to the river, Loo told FMT. 
 

 
Loo said the Prai river has been marked as a natural habitat for the crocodiles anyway. 
 
He said there are at least three crocodiles in that river. 
 
We have put up many signs along the river, as it is a haven among anglers here, he told FMT. 
 
Loo reminded the public that it is an offence to kill the crocodile. Those found guilty of causing harm to the reptile can be jailed or fined. 
 
Those who come across the crocodile can contact Perhilitan at its hotline, 1-800-88-5151 or at twitter.com/perhilitan .
