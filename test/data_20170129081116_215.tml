<content type="str">Auckland City FC have beaten Korean club champions FC Seoul in the opening match of an annual four-nation invitation tournament in Hong Kong. 
 
Emiliano Tade finished a slick move he started himself on the stroke of halftime in a keenly-fought clash at the Nike Lunar New Year Cup. 
 
It capped a dominant first-half effort from the Oceania champion club, who came under pressure in the spell from the K-League outfit. 
 
&quot;It&apos;s a fantastic result,&quot; said Auckland City coach Ramon Tribulietx. 
 
&quot;They&apos;re a full time professional team, with a big stadium and big facilities and some guys from Auckland City just a very small club in New Zealand has not only managed to compete but also win the game.&quot; 
 
The celebrations were dampened by an injury to captain Angel Berlanga, the defender taken to hospital for x-rays on a facial injury. 
 
Their opponents in Tuesday&apos;s final will be host club Kitchee SC, who beat Thai champions SCG Muangthong United in a penalty shootout following a 1-1 draw.
