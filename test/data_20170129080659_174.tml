<content type="str">WESTERLY — Cox Communications has announced the availability of Cox Wi-Fi internet access in downtown Westerly for Cox high speed internet customers. The company said the availability of Wi-Fi downtown will provide thousands of customers the ability to access the web reliably and on-the-go. The coverage provides internet accessibility at key locations, from shops and restaurants to Craig Field, Westerly High School and the Westerly Yacht Club. 
 
State Sen. Dennis Algiere, R-Westerly, and Rep. Brian Patrick Kennedy, D-Westerly, joined Jay Allbaugh, Cox senior vice president and regional manager, to announce the new network on Saturday at the Washington Trust Community Skating Center. 
 
Westerly is the third Wi-Fi location Cox has deployed in Rhode Island. Wi-Fi launched in Providence’s Kennedy Plaza in 2015, followed by Upper and Lower Thames Streets in Newport. The hotspots are part of more than 500,000 that are accessible by customers nationwide.

With the explosive growth in usage of smartphones, tablets and other mobile connected devices, Cox said that Wi-Fi adds significant value and reliable internet access. Cox customers with Preferred, Premier or Ultimate Internet packages have free access to Cox Wi-Fi as part of their service. 
 
In addition to the Rhode Island locations, Cox customers also have access when they travel, made possible by a collaboration of communications providers across the country, called CableWiFi. The hotspots are located in high-traffic areas such as restaurants, malls, sports arenas, parks and beaches in cities like New York, Washington D.C., Boston, Richmond, Philadelphia, Los Angeles and Tampa. Customers of Comcast, Time Warner, Bright House and Optimum, in turn, will also be able to access Wi-Fi in Westerly, including Comcast customers in Connecticut.</content>
