<content type="str">Let me just preface this by saying I wasn&apos;t deliberately watching New Zealand grass trots on a Sunday morning - I had it on in the background (I swear). 
Given the unfashionable nature of the race (not exactly the Pegasus World Cup) and the timing, it&apos;s fair to assume that Tutoko Kid&apos;s Motukarara win went largely unnoticed. 

The grey gelding, unplaced in all 12 of his career starts leading up to today, was understandably sent out at $126 for the  2170m standing-start contest. 

The despised outsider, who delayed the start due to some last-minute farrier work, stepped cleanly and settled midfield in the 14-horse race but became pocketed when horses started looping from the back passing the 1000m.  

The progression of the three-wide line meant that Tutoko Kid was trapped in between runners at the top of straight with absolutely no where to go.  

If you took the triple figures on offer you would have been forgiven for returning to your Sunday morning bacon and eggs but Tutoko Kid&apos;s driver Colin DeFilippi was intent on shouldering his way into the clear. 


The grey finally got off heels passing the 200m but still faced a monumental task to reel in the leaders given he had to build momentum again down the outside rail. 

To say he sprouted wings might be a bit of a stretch but it was certainly a boilover worth recognition.  

Tutoko Kid paid $107.30/$19.60 on the NSW tote, with $17-chance The New Man grabbing second ahead of Rozzano ($11).</content>
