<TITLE>Lots of goodwill, excitement at As Jack London Square FanFest</TITLE>
<TEXT>An estimated 15,000 As fans were treated to free food and great weather Saturday at the teams annual FanFest, held at Jack London Square for the first time since 1999, and the good vibes were palpable. 
 
Best FanFest ever , said Debbie Rose , 54, of Castro Valley. The best accessibility, I got to see all my favorite players. It feels like they put As fans first. Im starting to feel hopeful about things. 
 
New team president Dave Kaval earned rave reviews from fans for making the event free and for moving the event from the Coliseum to a location near downtown, and the waterfront site had more than a few in attendance thinking about a stadium nearby. 
 
Just imagining what it could be if there was a ballpark down here, said Michael Schultz , 32, of Alameda. Dave Kaval has brought so much life to the team, I think. Very cool. 
 
Cautiously optimistic, said Schultzs brother, Tom Schultz of Oakland. 
 
Jacqueline Peters , 58, of Watsonville said the first thing she did was head to the food trucks for lunch (chicken) and dessert (vanilla custard). 
 
The fact its all free shows a lot of goodwill toward the fans, Peters said. And no rain! They couldnt have done this two weeks ago, so this is great. Its so nice to be able to walk around here and see friends. 
 
The As players and coaches were just as enthusiastic about the move to Jack London Square, with manager Bob Melvin musing during a Q and A session about how beautiful the waterfront setting might be for the long term. 
 
I think this is awesome, reliever Sean Doolittle said. I think its really, really great the team is embracing Oakland and really reaching out to re-energize the fans and make a commitment to Oakland. 
 
Being right down here near downtown, in Jack London Square, its so fan friendly, As starter Kendall Graveman said. I like it better, I really do. And no rain  maybe thats a good sign for the year. 
 
Kaval told The Chronicle earlier in the week that the team is still evaluating three or four stadium sites, and on Saturday, he had drones surveying FanFest to get an idea of crowd flow and foot traffic for the potential Howard Terminal location. 
 
Its impossible to walk around and see all the energy and enthusiasm and not feel excited, general manager David Forst said. Ultimately, what this leads to remains to be see, but this is a great showing of As fans and As excitement. A huge part of what Dave wants to do is connect to the fans and involve them in the process of what were building in Oakland. 
 
Briefly: There were some humorous moments during the question-and-answer sessions with fans, including one fan pressing Doolittle on when he might propose to his longtime girlfriend, Eireann Dolan (he seemed to have trouble with his microphone just then for some reason) and another asking Doolittle for his favorite Star Wars moment. (He liked Rogue One a lot).  Forst, asked about the As difficulties in keeping top players, said, Everyone was tired of hearing during the playoffs, Look at all these ex-As playing for other teams.  The goal is we get a new building and we hold onto all these guys beyond their first few years and create lifelong Oakland As.  Asked about potentially trading right-hander Sonny Gray at midseason if Gray bounces back strong, Forst said, I want to have Sonny here 10 more years. (As executive) Billy Beane wants to have Sonny here 10 more years.
