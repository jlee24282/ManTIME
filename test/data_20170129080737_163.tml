ROCKFORD 
 
The Iowa Wild (22-19-4-1) scored three goals in the second period to cruise to a 5-1 victory over the Rockford IceHogs (14-23-5-3) in front of a sellout crowd of 5,944 fans on Pink in the Rink night at the BMO Harris Bank Center. 
 
Alex Tuch scored two goals, notching the Wilds first and last tallies of the game, and Zack Mitchell recorded a multi-point effort with a goal and assist. Maxime Fortunus and Teemu Pulkkinen also scored for Iowa. 

Jeremy Langlois notched the IceHogs lone goal for his second tally in as many games, but Rockford was unable to get past the Wilds netminder Alex Stalock, who stopped 34 of the 35 shots he faced. 

With the loss, the IceHogs enter the All-Star break with losses in each of their last five games. The Hogs will return to action on Friday, Feb. 3 at the Milwaukee Admirals. 

Forward Spencer Abbott will represent the IceHogs at the 2017 AHL All-Star Game after tallying a team high-tying 25 points (9g, 16a) in 41 games. The All-Star break kicks off Sunday, Jan. 29 at 6:30 p.m. (CT) with the 2017 AHL All-Star Skills Competition, presented by Giant Food Stores and Velaspan, and the 2017 AHL All-Star Game begins Monday, Jan. 30 at 6 p.m. (CT).</TEXT>
