Oumar Niasse has told the Daily Star that he didn’t leave Everton last summer because he wanted to prove himself in English football. 
 
Niasse left Goodison Park on loan earlier this month, after failing to impress for the Toffees . 
 
The striker was brought to Everton from Lokomotiv Moscow back in January 2016 in an expensive deal, but failed to live up to expectations. 
 

 
And, after Ronald Koeman came in, Niasse’s chance at Everton became very limited. 
 
It was widely expected that Niasse would leave Everton last summer, but he opted to stay and fight for his place. 
 
Niasse scored goals frequently in Everton’s under 23 side, but never broke into Koeman’s plans. 
 
And the 26-year-old claims that he has moved to Hull to show that he can perform in the Premier League. 
 

 
“I didn’t want to leave Everton in the summer, even though I got lots of opportunities to move outside of England,” he said. 
 
“I decided to stay because I wanted to prove myself here. I’m here to score goals and help the team. I have the motivation to show with Hull exactly who I am.” 
 
Niasse has made a promising start to his Hull career, after scoring his first goal in English football in the League Cup against Manchester United. 
 
The Senegalese international has already made three appearances for Hull, and looks to have an important part to play for Marco Silva’s side.
