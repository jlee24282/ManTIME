From January 28 to February 1, the Institute of Management Accountants (IMA) Chair Elect, Alex Eng, CMA, CFM, CPA, will visit four major cities in the Middle East to discuss the effects of fluctuating oil prices and how accounting and finance professionals can help create value for their organizations though their finance and business acumen. 
 
During his 5-day tour, Eng will visit Dubai, Doha, Amman, and Cairo. In Dubai, Eng will be at Zayed University’s 3rd Annual Quantitative Research Symposium on January 28 to discuss the importance of an effective board in SMEs. Eng is also slated to meet selected CFOs in Dubai and Doha for a roundtable discussion on cost and cash flow management in turbulent times. 
 
“Financial and management reporting and the increasingly competitive global environment puts pressure on CFOs to do the right things in the right ways and ensure our organizations are positioned to not only weather but thrive in these turbulent times,” states Eng. 
 
CFOs from the region will hear from Eng’s experience as Vice President for US Corporate Finance at a public Fortune Global 100 Company and the world&apos;s largest power utility. 
 
“Through these roundtable discussions, IMA helps CFOs explore practical action steps they can take to ensure that their organizations are positioned to thrive, not just survive, during this period of volatility and risks,” adds Eng. 
 
The IMA has been instrumental in supporting the changing role of CFOs in today’s business environment. To recognize outstanding CFOs in the region, IMA will be at the CFO Middle East Awards on Sunday, January 29 at the Ritz Carlton Hotel in Jumeirah Beach Residence, Dubai. 
 
IMA’s Chair-Elect will also be in Amman, Jordan and Cairo, Egypt to meet IMA partners and recognize new Certified Management Accountants (CMAs) in these two countries. The CMA® is IMA’s flagship certification program that helps accounting professionals prepare for progressive management accounting roles.
