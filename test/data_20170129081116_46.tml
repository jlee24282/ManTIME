<TITLE>Column: Mary Richards was one of us  uncool and with a heart</TITLE>
<TEXT>In the mid-1970s, the coolest person I knew was Jimmy Walz, who had cool suits and a cool car (Peugeot 504 Diesel with a sunroof), a lucrative job that did not encumber his days and a restless, popping energy that powered his nights. 
 
Jimmy loved going to bars and listening to bands, so much that at one point he bought a bar and at another he started a band. 
 
What he did not do, in those days, was go out on Saturday nights. Saturday night is for amateurs, he would explain. He stayed home and watched the comedy lineup on CBS because it was too good to miss. (This was back when, if you didnt see a TV show, you missed it.) 
 
That says it all. Mary Tyler Moore was not cool. The character she played was not cool. The comedy lineup she anchored  which included The Bob Newhart Show, which she also produced  was not cool. But somehow, Moore and Co. stood the whole idea of watching TV on Saturday night on its head, so it became cool. 
 
Moore, who died Wednesday, played a classic type that we need more of right now. She was part of a long parade of decent do-rights that has also included Alex Reiger (Taxi), Jimmy Stewart as Jeff Smith, Newharts nebbishes, Leslie Knope, Jimmy Stewart as George Bailey, and, right now, Kimmy Schmidt, who might as well be Mary Richards loopy granddaughter, right down to the adorable overbite. 
 
These characters live in the middle, where we live. Theyre not the smartest, the funniest or the hottest. They might not even be the most virtuous, although they generally are surrounded by knaves. 
 
As Laura Petrie of The Dick Van Dyke Show, Moore was a sweetheart, not a siren. She told Fresh Air host Terry Gross that women liked me. They were not envious of the fact that their husbands had a crush on me.  And this was an odd thing because they were also able to identify with me as a friend, as a girlfriend. 
 
Moores ex-husband and producer Grant Tinker, who died two months ago, said the initial audience testing of The Mary Tyler Moore Show reported back that Mary Richards was a loser. 
 
Not a loser. Just one of us. Mike Nichols said there are two reasons for a joke: because its funny and because its you. Comedy works when we see ourselves. 
 
Moore as Richards got an astonishing amount of mileage out of the pure struggle to be a halfway decent person in a world not entirely set up for that. Her most famous performance came in the Death of Chuckles episode, when  at the funeral of a clown  she chastises her snarky co-workers for making dead clown jokes. 
 
But during the eulogy, she gets the giggles. And what follows is three hilarious minutes of eruptions and stiflings. Finally the eulogist tells her its OK to laugh, at which point she wails with grief. And writ large across this legendary performance is the message, This is how hard it is to be good, to be nice! Most people dont even try! Im trying, and this happens! 
 
They dont fill this job anymore. 
 
Veep is full of brilliant writing, but theres no Mary. They stopped putting Marys in these ensemble shows during the 1990s, which should worry us. Its as if TV creators said: You dont need somebody who has a heart, whos gentle and a little shy, whos no dummy, who mostly does the right thing. Youll identify just fine with this crowd of creeps and freaks and wiseasses. 
 
I guess we do. But something nice and very, very funny got lost when we mothballed the heart of Mary Richards. 
 
Every so often, when I think our radio show was pretty good  maybe not our best, but pretty good  I borrow the motto of Chuckles the Clown. 
 
I walk out of the studio and into the newsroom and say, That was a little song, a little dance, a little seltzer down your pants. 
 
Not the coolest thing to say. But who needs to be cool? Right, Mary?
