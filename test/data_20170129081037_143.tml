<content type="str">Jon Hamm is worried about being replaced by a hologram.

The 45-year-old actor plays a hologram of a long-dead man in new movie &apos;Marjorie Prime&apos; but admitted that some technological advances scare him.

He explained to The Wrap: &apos;&apos;Technology tends to only move in one direction. 

&apos;&apos;It&apos;s not like they go, &apos;Oh, this hologram idea was a great idea but, eh, never mind.&apos;&apos;&apos;

&apos;&apos;There always has to be a person at the end of it until we create computers that create computers and then we&apos;re well and truly f****d.&apos;&apos;

And John also admitted that he hates watching himself onscreen.

He told Us Weekly: &apos;&apos;It&apos;s always weird. Because inevitably, you&apos;re gonna think something looks terrible. Or is terrible. And unfortunately, it&apos;s the internet that points those things out.

&apos;&apos;Very often, someone online will tell you that it was [terrible], usually behind an anonymous screen name. I try to stay off the internet as it pertains to me.&apos;&apos;

The &apos;Mad Men&apos; actor will also star in action comedy &apos;Baby Driver&apos; later this year, alongside Ansel Elgort, Jamie Foxx, Kevin Spacey and Lily James, and he can&apos;t wait for the stunts.

He said: &apos;&apos;I get to roll around and crash cars and shoot &apos;em up. Fun stuff.&apos;&apos;</content>
