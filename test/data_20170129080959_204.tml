<content type="str">A bipartisan bill to ban fracking in Florida deserves support, but lawmakers need to take the ongoing threats to our state’s groundwater just as seriously as potential ones.

Last week, five state senators introduced a measure to ban fracking and other risky oil and gas extraction methods. The backing of both Democrats and Republicans — including Sen. Keith Perry, R-Gainesville — is a welcome development that hopefully leads to lawmakers continuing to work across the aisle on what should really be a nonpartisan issue.

Perry previously served in the Florida House and was elected to the Senate after a campaign that featured fracking as a central issue. He received criticism in the campaign for voting for a bill last year that would have put just a temporary moratorium on fracking, so he gets credit for listening to concerns and now supporting an outright ban.

Last year’s legislation would have allowed fracking following a study by the state Department of Environmental Protection. Given the DEP’s failure to protect water quality under Gov. Rick Scott, environmental advocates were rightly worried it would have provided a welcome mat for fracking and also kept secret the chemicals used in the process.

The newly introduced measure, SB 442, which would put an outright ban on fracking and other “advancement well stimulation” methods. Fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, involves forcing a mixture of water, chemicals and sand into the ground at high pressure to extract oil or gas. The chemicals used in the process have been linked to cancer and other serious health problems.

Florida’s karst geology makes it particularly prone to the dangers of fracking. There is no reason to risk poisoning the aquifer that supplies our drinking water and feeds our region&apos;s natural springs.

While fracking presents a potential threat to these resources, they are already being polluted by current practices. Last year’s toxic algae blooms on the Indian River Lagoon received headlines but pollution can also be seen on an ongoing basis in waterways across Florida and in springs and off beaches that attract tourists to the state.

State lawmakers had a chance to do something about the problem with a massive water bill passed last year. Instead, they allowed agricultural polluters to continue to follow voluntary best management practices that have been unsuccessful in reversing the damage done to springs and other water resources.

Certainly other pollution sources such as septic tanks and fertilized lawns share blame for water pollution. State lawmakers need to do more to address these threats as well as excessive groundwater pumping, instead of allowing an even bigger crisis to happen.

Amendment 1, the conservation initiative overwhelmingly approved by voters in 2014, should be funding the land acquisition need to protect environmentally sensitive areas. Lawmakers must ensure the money is dedicated to that purpose this session and not paying for salaries and other ordinary agency expenses, as has been done in the past.

The state DEP’s recent track record includes new standards that allow more cancer-causing chemicals in waterways and initially not notifying the public about a massive sinkhole contaminating groundwater in Polk County. With the recent resignation of the DEP director, lawmakers need to demand the new leadership takes a different course.

A fracking ban is a step in the right direction, stopping the practice before it really gets started in our state. Lawmakers should pass to ban while also working to address the threats to our groundwater that aren’t so theoretical.
