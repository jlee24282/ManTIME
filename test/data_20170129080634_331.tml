Balance, balance, balance. 
 
That theme ran throughout the attack of Caney Valley (Kan.) during Fridays girls game at Neodesha (Kan.). 
 
Kolbi McIntosh ripped the nets for 12 points, followed by Ally Cunningham, 10 points, and Kennedy Nunneley, 10, to lead Caney Valley to the 23-point win. 
 
We were very cold shooting the ball, as we had good shots early but they wouldnt go down, said Caney Valley head coach Tom Nelson. 
 
On the defensive side, Caney Valley shut out Neodesha, 10-0, in the second quarter to set the theme.

Boys: WCS 50, Liberty Christian 37 
 
Talk about your turnarounds! 
 
After trailing by 10 at halftime, 30-20, the Wesleyan Christian Mustangs ran roughshod in the second half, outscoring Liberty Christian, 30-7, to complete the regular season sweep. 
 
Desmond Thompson, Jerrell Martin and Austin Cobb each scored in double figures for WCS. Cobb nailed three three-pointers. 
 
Boys: Bartlesville jayvee 48, Jenks 45 
 
Jaylin Oliver and Caleb Colbert each stuffed the nets with 17 points to pace the Bartlesville Bruins to a thrilling three-point win Friday at the Phillips Fieldhouse. 
 
Bartlesville squandered a 10-point lead  from early in the fourth quarter  to watch Jenks tie the game, 42-42. 
 
The Bruins went back up by three, 45-42, on one free throw by Colbert and two by Olivier. 
 
After Jenks pulled even again, 45-45, Colbert knocked down a 17-footer to elevate Bartlesville back into the lead. 
 
Shane Simpson  who finished with 10 points  added an insurance free throw in the final 15 seconds. 
 
Elijah Baker and Abhi Ayyappan each contributed two points in the game. 
 
Bartlesville had led at the half, 26-20, and had owned a 10-point advantage, 42-32, early in the fourth period. 
 
But, Jenks went on a 10-0 run and the Bruins needed some late heroics to save the win. 
 
Girls: Liberty Christian 49, WCS 42 
 
The WCS Mustangs finished just shy of a season sweep of Liberty Christian. 
 
Two weeks ago, the Mustangs produced a last-second shot to win the first meeting. 
 
But, Liberty Christian came on strong in the final minutes Friday in the rematch. 
 
It kind of became a foul-fest in the fourth quarter, WCS head coach Rocky Clark said. 
 
Liberty Christian scored 13 of its 19 fourth-quarter points from the charity stripe. Three Lady Mustangs fouled out. 
 
Taylor Dickinson and Meghan Clark scored 13 apiece for the Lady Mustangs, followed by Camryn Clark. 
 
Boys: Kiefer 47, Caney Valley 40 
 
The Caney Valley Trojans competed close the entire time against Kiefer, but just didnt quite have the juice on the offensive side to flip-flop the result. 
 
Our defense was good, our rebounding was pretty good, said Caney Valley coach Tug Brinker. We had some turnovers and we missed some putbacks. 
 
Erick McLaughlin and Christian Ballew poured in 11 and nine points, respectively, to lead Caney Valley. 
 
Brinker is pleased freshmen Cheyton Shepherd, Gunner Hawkins and Eli Lucas are getting some good playing minutes.

Erick McLaughlin 11, Christian Ballew 9, Cooper Eden 7, Cheyton Shepherd 3. 
 
Boys: Kansas 54, Dewey 44 
 
With only one player in double-figure scoring (Drew Miller, 23), the Dewey Doggers just didnt generate enough firepower to pull past the Kansas Comets. 
 
Down by as many as 17 points, Dewey whittled the margin all the way down to three points, late in the fourth period  but ran out of time. 
 
Alfredo Lopez added eight points for Dewey, followed by Colton Thornton, five; Blayz Rippy and Caston Frye, three points each; and Kameron Hays, two. 
 
Boys: Copan 69, South Coffeyville 61 
 
Copan Hornets zipped to their 11th win  surpassing last seasons total of 10  thanks to a dominating second quarter, in which they outscored South Coffeyville, 20-4. 
 
Kirk Foreman snapped the cords for 31 points  including 16 (13 free throws, one trey) in the fourth period. Dylan Williams and Cole Raemhild added 17 and 12 points, respectively, for the Hornets (11-7). 
 
I though Joe Phelan and Garrick Askew did a good job on their big man, added Copan coach Kevin Foreman. They held him to nine points.

Girls: Barnsdall 73, Shidler 23 
 
Barnsdall Lady Panther head coach Joe Gilbert would likely rather have a root canal than beat an opponent by 50 points. 
 
We played everybody we had, Gilbert noted. Our first group didnt even play two full quarters. 
 
Kaleigh Townley and Mariah Hatfield erupted for 19 and 13 points, respectively, for Barnsdall (9-9). 
 
Jasmine Shores pulled down a team-best six boards, followed by Townley with five. 
 
Berry contributed six steals.

Girls: Copan 56, South Coffeyville 48 
 
Many factors might have played into the motivation Friday by the Copan Lady Hornets. 
 
But, perhaps one overshadowed them all. 
 
After a nine-game streak of losses, I think the girls are tired of losing, Copan head coach Kristy Bryan said. 
 
Carli Barnett amassed a double-double (13 points, 19 rebounds), as did Winter Williams (18 points, 11 steals) to spark Copan. 
 
Kolbey ORourke added six assists and Rylee Young swatted six shots. 
 
Copan (6-14) accelerated to a 16-8 lead in the first period and never looked back. 
 
Senior Kylie Long (six points) was crowned Homecoming Queen.

Boys: Caney Valley (Kan.) 60, Neodesha 50 
 
Baylor Melchiori poured in 27 points  including five crucial free throws in the final period  to help power the Caney Valley (Kan.) Bullpups past Neodesha (Kan.), by 10 points, in a crucial matchup, in Neodesha. 
 
Trevor Watson contributed four points  but he scored them on all on free throws in the final period. 
 
Camdyn Melchiori chipped in with nine points for game, followed by Grant Richey with eight. 
 
Neodesha surged to a 23-20 halftime lead but then watched Caney Valley scorch the cords for 40 points in the second half. 
 
Tonight was intense, said Caney Valley head coach Josh Wolfe. 
 
During last weeks Wilson County Tournament, Neodesha had knocked off the Pups, 79-78, behind the massive scoring (39 points) of ONeill. 
 
In Fridays rematch, ONeill piled up 15 points by halftime. 
 
I challenged our kids to stop him.  
 
ONeill tallied just one point in the second half. 
 
The key was defensive rebounding, which shut down Neodeshas second-chance scoring and created some fast break opportunities for Caney Valley, Wolfe added. 
 
Richey scored six points in the third quarter to help trigger the Pup rally. 
 
Baylor Melchiori is just 35 points away from becoming the career leading scorer in Caney Valley Pup history, Wolfe added.

Boys: Barnsdall 98, Shidler 34 
 
Not one, but two 20-point scorers graced the Barnsdall Panthers scoresheet in this 64-point rout. 
 
Christian Warford and Derek Wilson netted 29 and 20 points, respectively, to pace the Panthers, who bolted to a 33-4 first quarter lead and never looked back. 
 
The boys came out firing on all cylinders and played our most complete game of the season, said Barnsdall coach Clifton Warford, who noted his squad amassed 22 assists and 16 three-pointers. 
 
All 12 Panthers scored. 
 
Also scoring in double figures were Heath Moles, 14 points, and Michael Marin, 10. 
 
Christian Warford and Wilson each shot five-of-seven from behind the three-point arc. 
 
Christian Warford distributed a team-high eight assists while Moles contributed seven boards and three blocks.
