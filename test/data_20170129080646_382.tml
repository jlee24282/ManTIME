<TEXT type="str">ROME (UPI) -- Panicked residents in a small Italian town ran for safety as an escaped Bengal tiger roamed the streets for several hours Saturday. 
 
The tiger, named Oscar, had escaped from a Swedish circus and took to the streets of Monreale, Italy, for about two hours. Police, with the help of circus trainers, were able to corral the tiger into a cage. It was transported back to the circus without injury. No one in the town of about 38,000 was injured.</TEXT>
