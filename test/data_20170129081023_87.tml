<content type="str">There is nothing quite like reading for Edie Bustle. 

&quot;You just can&apos;t beat reading,&quot; the former member of the Manatee County Public Library System Board of Trustees said Wednesday while sitting in her Palmetto home. &quot;It takes you great places. You meet new people. You experience wonderful things, and it&apos;s all with the book held in your own hand.&quot; 

For Edie Bustle and her husband Larry, reading is an important part of their lives — both volunteer in the community reading to children. In fact, former Manatee County Commissioner Larry Bustle says that in retirement, his occupation is reading. 

&quot;We both love to read,&quot; Edie Bustle said. &quot;This was a wonderful way to pay back and see kids read as opposed to play games on the computer.&quot; 

As a way to ensure more of today&apos;s youth become lifelong learners, the Bustles are hoping that the upcoming &quot;An Evening with Nicholas Sparks&quot; event, which they are co-chairing, will be a success. Proceeds from the Feb. 7 event at Neel Performing Arts Center benefit Manatee Library System&apos;s &quot;I Am a Lifelong Learner&quot; program. 

&quot;It&apos;s a great way to support the library system in Manatee County and I think we are both very supportive of the lifelong learning project that the library foundation and the library is promoting,&quot; Larry Bustle said. 

With tickets still available for the Sparks event, there are some ticket promotions — a 2-for-1 ticket special and a $25 ticket promotion for educators as well as Manatee County high school and Manatee/Sarasota college students. For tickets, call 941-216-8746. 

&quot;The Library Foundation&apos;s fund-raising efforts for this event are aimed at improving literacy in Manatee County through excellent library service,&quot; said Susan Wilcox, foundation event chairwoman. &quot;This year we are delighted to have the opportunity to offer a position of our seating to educators and to other literacy advocates in our community at a reduced rate. It is one small gesture to let these literacy partners and providers know how important they are and how much we appreciate their life&apos;s work.&quot; 

The Sparks event is the third such program, which has previously brought authors Stephen King and John Grisham to town and raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for the county&apos;s library system. 

&quot;The money raised from this event is going to go into the lifelong learner program,&quot; Edie Bustle said. &quot;We strongly support that, and reading is one of the most important things a child ever learns to do because it opens so many doors.&quot; 

The library&apos;s &quot;I Am a Lifelong Learner&quot; literacy program &quot;aims to improve literacy by targeting the area&apos;s youngest readers by providing a Lifelong Learner Campaign Coordinator to meet families at the point-of-need and offer outreach programs to develop literacy skills,&quot; a news release states. 

The focus is getting students to read at grade level by third grade, Larry Bustle said. 

&quot;Prior to third grade, you are learning to read. After grade three, you are reading to learn,&quot; he said. 

As a former commissioner, Larry Bustle said there is just not enough money to do all the things that are needed. 

&quot;That&apos;s going to go a long way to help lifelong learners,&quot; he said of the event. 

Since the announcement that Sparks would be speaking at the event, the Bustles have been diving into his novels as well as watching &quot;The Notebook.&quot; 

On Wednesday morning, three of Sparks&apos; books — &quot;The Last Song,&quot; &quot;A Walk to Remember&quot; and &quot;Message in a Bottle&quot; — were on the Bustles&apos; coffee table. 

&quot;This one is another happy yet sad book,&quot; Edie Bustle said of &quot;Message in a Bottle.&quot; &quot;I really like this one — and the ending was a surprise.&quot; 

For the Bustles, it came as a surprise that they would be co-chairs of the event, which comes just after Larry Bustle finished his time in public service and Edie Bustle ended her time on the Library Board of Trustees. 

&quot;That was a big surprise,&quot; Edie Bustle said. 

Larry added: &quot;It was.&quot;</content>
