In a shocking development, Rajesh Sawant, the strength and conditioning trainer of the India Under-19 and A cricket teams , was found dead in Mumbai on Sunday. Sawant&apos;s room at the team hotel was checked after he failed to turn up for the U-19 team&apos;s training session. Sawant reportedly died in his sleep. 
 
&quot;What I have gathered so far is he did not report for team activities in the morning, so people started looking for him and eventually he was found to have been passed away in his room,&quot; Amitabh Choudhary, the Board of Control for Cricket in India joint secretary, told Sportstar. 
 
&quot;I have asked Prof (Ratnakar) Shetty to visit the site and keep me updated.&quot; 
 
The India U-19 team, which is due to play five 50-over and two four-day games against England Under-19, will take on the visitors in the first limited-overs match on Monday at Mumbai&apos;s Wankhede Stadium. 
 
Sawant was part of the Rest of India backroom staff that recently won the Irani Cup after beating Gujarat by six wickets. 
 
Sawant has also worked with multiple age-group teams of the Mumbai Cricket Association, as well as the Afghanistan national cricket team under head coach Lalchand Rajput. 
 
Former India captain Rahul Dravid is the current coach of the India A and U-19 teams.</content>
