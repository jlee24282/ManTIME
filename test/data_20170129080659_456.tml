<content type="str">ONTARIO — Safety is the primary concern at Kraft Heinz Ontario after a Jan. 19 incident resulted in the partial collapse of a dry storage facility. 
   
Since the collapse, structural engineers have visited the Kraft Heinz facility to evaluate the safety of other buildings, according to an email to the Argus from Michael Mullen, spokesman for Kraft Heinz. 
   
As a result of the heavy snowfall in the area, at-risk areas of the facility have been closed until the safety of workers can be assured, Mullen added. 
   
“We have been working closely with safety teams, local officials and OSHA in an abundance of further caution,” Mullen said in the email. “The compromised areas adjacent to the collapsed storage facility are being stabilized and will be available as continued access points until the new structure can be erected.” 
   
Among other safety precautions and as employees return to the site following the partial collapse, Mullen reports that safety meetings have been held for all of the operational employees in efforts to inform them of the status of all buildings and work areas, as well as to outline safe access/egress points, and any alternate routes that may be required. 
   
Kraft Heinz also conducts regular evacuation drills and incident command protocol trainings to ensure employees understand the proper procedures in the event of an incident, Mullen said. 
   
Following the Jan. 19 incident, Kraft Heinz initiated a comprehensive investigation, in which it was later discovered that eight employees were present in an attached part of the building at the time of the roof collapse. None of those employees were injured, added Mullen.</content>
