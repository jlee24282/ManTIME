<TITLE>Pauline M. Good Kepiro</TITLE>
<TEXT>Pauline (Polly) M. Good Kepiro, 93, of New Holland, PA went home to be with her Lord and Savior Jesus Christ on January 27, 2017 at Christiana Hospital in Newark, DE. She was the wife of the late Ralph L. Good for over 62 years who preceded her in death in 2004, and was currently the wife of Steven Kepiro for approximately 9 years. 
 
Polly loved the Lord and served Him by teaching both children's and women's Sunday School at Salem Bible Church in Voganville, PA where she was a member for over 60 years. Polly enjoyed serving with the Women's Auxiliary at Lancaster Bible College for over 25 years and helped to coordinate their Annual Fundraising Auctions and many other events. She also traveled to churches all over the Central Pennsylvania area speaking at Christian Women's gatherings and sharing the truth of the Gospel of Jesus Christ by using many of her goblets which she loved to collect among other things. Polly loved to laugh, loved to drink her hot tea in the morning, play games, (especially checkers and backgammon), loved restaurants that served what she called "really good bread," loved her friends, and next to Jesus Christ, loved her family deeply. 
 
She is survived by her four sons: Rev. R. Randall Good, married to Carol Mull Good, of Whitehorse, Dr. N. Sanford Good, married to Diane Bentley Good, of Lititz; M. Jesse Good, married to Deb Longer Good, of Middleburg, and Rev. J. Philip Good, married to Sandra Martin Good, of Intercourse. Polly has 18 grandchildren and 17 great grandchildren whom she dearly loved and would never hesitate to visit whenever she had the chance. 
 
A Celebration of Polly's Life service will be held at Beck Funeral Home located at 315 East Main St., New Holland, PA on Wednesday February 1st. There will be a viewing from 9am to 10:30am with a service beginning at 10:30am to celebrate her life. Interment will follow the service at Voganville Cemetery. The family requests that flowers be omitted and that donations be made in Polly's name to either Mill Creek Bible Church; 270 Strasburg Pike, Lancaster, PA 17602 where her son Philip is the Senior Pastor or Live 10:27 Ministries; 932 Buckwalter Rd., Lititz, PA 17543; a Christian non-profit organization which her son Sanford oversees.
