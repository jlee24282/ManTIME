<content type="str">In keeping with the promise of bringing even more arts and entertainment to Coweta County, the Donald W. Nixon Centre for the Performing and Visual Arts recently offered audiences one of the most unique performances ever to be enjoyed locally. 

 
Nearly every seat was filled in the Newnan theatre for the Golden Dragon Acrobats, a Chinese acrobatic touring company that performed at the Centre Jan. 22. Regarded as the only acrobatic company of its kind, the nearly 20 total performers offered audiences everything from traditional Chinese dance to breathtaking balancing acts and awe-inspiring stunts. 
 
The team included groups of both men and women performing in a variety of acts designed to entertain an audience of all ages. Children stood with mouths agape watching seemingly impossible tumbling acts, contortionists, and balancing acts reminiscent of the offerings of Cirque du Soleil. Audience members awarded performers with a standing ovation following the show. 
 
There is more to come at the Nixon Centre this year, including the “Masters of Soul” on Feb. 4 beginning at 7 p.m. A celebration of the early ‘60s popular motown musicians, the performance will feature hits by The Temptations, Gladys Knight &amp; The Pips, Marvin Gaye, The Four Tops, The Supremes and James Brown. 
 
Also in February, the Nixon Centre will offer a theatre production of “The Grapes of Wrath,” performed by the National Players. Tickets are available now for these acts, and can be purchased online at www.thenixoncentre.net. A calendar of events including school performances is also available on the website. For more information, contact the Centre at 770-254-2787.</content>
