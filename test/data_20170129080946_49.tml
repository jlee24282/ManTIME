<content type="str">Noah Allen scored a career-high 34 points and grabbed eight rebounds to help Hawaii roll past UC Santa Barbara 78-56 on Saturday night. 

Allen, a UCLA graduate transfer, made 11 of 14 from the field, 3 of 5 from 3-point range and all nine of his free throws for the Rainbow Warriors (9-11, 3-4 Big West). 

Hawaii pulled away with a 12-0 run in the middle of the second half and led by more than 20 points for most of the final 10 minutes. 

The Gauchos (3-16, 1-6) never led after the first seven minutes but stayed close until a 2-for-23 shooting drought that spanned both halves and lasted until Tide Osifeso&apos;s 3-pointer with 6:17 left made it 63-44. 

The Bows had a 39-27 rebounding edge and shot 49.1 percent from the field compared to 28.6 by the Gauchos. 

Max Heidegger had 10 points to lead UC Santa Barbara.</content>
