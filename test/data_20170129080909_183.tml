<content type="str">MOBILE — Davis Webb looked for Josh Reynolds on his initial third-down play Saturday, found him again on his next pass and a third time for a long touchdown.

It&apos;s just like the California quarterback predicted the night before the Senior Bowl, when that connection with the Texas A&amp;M wide receiver helped the South to a 16-15 victory over the North.

&quot;I told Josh (Friday) night, &apos;You were my favorite outside receiver all week. If we get 1 on 1, I&apos;m going your way, so you&apos;d better win,&apos; &quot; Webb said. &quot;And he did. He won multiple times.&quot;

Webb spread the ball around to other receivers, like Mississippi State&apos;s Fred Ross, as well. The Pac-12 Conference&apos;s leading passer directed scoring drives on all three of his possessions while completing 11 of 16 passes for 165 yards, including a 39-yard touchdown strike on a well-thrown fade to Reynolds. Reynolds had six catches for 96 yards, most of them on that first drive with Webb.

Nate Peterman of Pittsburgh had a similarly strong passing performance for the North in a showcase game for senior NFL prospects that actually featured late drama. Peterman fired a 6-yard scoring pass to East Carolina&apos;s Zay Jones with 1:51 left, but the North went for two points and a potential lead.

Under heavy pressure from Chattanooga&apos;s Keionta Davis, Peterman&apos;s pass was deflected and intercepted by BYU&apos;s Harvey Langi. The South ran out the clock from there.

The week was more about auditioning for NFL teams than winning, but Peterman said he wanted that last completion &quot;very bad.&quot;

&quot;You&apos;re always competitive,&quot; said Peterman, who was 16-of-23 passing for 153 yards and played most of the game. &quot;To say you can drive down and win the Senior Bowl in the last seconds, that would have been pretty cool. We didn&apos;t get it, but it was a great experience still.&quot;

Webb was the game&apos;s overall MVP after passing for 4,295 yards and 37 touchdowns last season as a graduate transfer from Texas Tech.

He led the South to a touchdown and field goal in the final three minutes of the first half. He and Reynolds proved a prolific combination on the touchdown drive, moving downfield on connections of 21 — on a third-and-10 play — and 13 yards before the touchdown.

Game rules require teams to go for two points in the second quarter, and the South&apos;s attempt failed to keep the halftime lead at 9-3. Toledo running back Kareem Hunt ran for 118 yards on 15 carries to earn North Outstanding Player Honors, including a 20-yarder and a 43-yarder on back-to-back plays.

&quot;Honestly, the guys up front did a great job, and I just showed some patience and was able to hit it,&quot; Hunt said. &quot;It opened up. It was pretty clear reads up there. Everybody was going hard. We wanted to win.&quot;

The South&apos;s honoree was Kansas State defensive end Jordan Willis, who forced two fumbles and had a pair of sacks. The South committed five turnovers and turned it over on its first three possessions. That included a pair of interceptions thrown by Antonio Pipkin of Division II Tiffin and another by Tennessee&apos;s Josh Dobbs. Saint Francis linebacker Lorenzo Jerome forced a fumble and made two interceptions for the North.</content>
