<TITLE>Other ways to advertise you are hiring</TITLE>
<TEXT>Two weeks ago, I listed several free methods to spread the word about job openings. All of them can be effective depending on the audience you are attempting to reach. However, some jobs require specific skills or backgrounds that make free advertising ineffective. 
   
Paid advertising is often the necessary channel to let people know you are hiring. Make sure you select the right venues for the type of people you are trying to attract. There are many niche employment sites and specialty job boards where individuals in a specific industry will look for work. 
   
The vast number of online niche job boards is amazing. Many are owned by other, more general job board companies and include job-seeker resumes in multiple databases. To find these niche boards, pretend you are a job seeker and do an online search, using the key words for your industry or the position. The job postings nearest to the top of your list likelywillgenerate the best results for you as well. Now you can set up an account or reach out to the job board about the cost of posting a job. 
   
Traditional job boards such as Careerbuilder and Monster might also help you find local talent. However, there are some new options such as Indeed, Glassdoor, SimplyHired and others that are becoming popular. Before paying for an ad on a job board, find out how much activity they have on their site in the area (zip code). It might be helpful to search what other jobs similar to yours are available on these sites to see how much traffic they generate. 
   
Consider specialty magazines or trade journals as well. Most trade journals have classified advertising in the back or even allow for paid ads on their websites. Even trade associations offer job ads, some may be free to members, but most do charge a fee. The benefit is that your ad will reach people who are in your industry and very qualified. 
   
Social media 
   
LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter, used properly, can also be great sources for finding people. LinkedIn has a jobs section for businesses to post ads and then pay to have them shown to people who qualify for the position. Reaching out to individuals through social media, even if they are not actively looking for work, can potentially set you up with a great new employee. 
   
Staffing firms screen people daily who are looking for work and can match someone who has recently been in their office or has been a great worker on other temporary assignments and send them to you to fill a position immediately. Since they are the employer of record, if the person doesnt work out, let the staffing firm know, and they will counsel the person or replace them immediately. If you need help immediately, contact a staffing firm. While it may seem expensive, ask yourself how much it is costing you to not have the position filled right now? 
   
Specialty recruiters and head hunters 
   
For difficult to fill positions that require more than just a job posting, a help wanted sign or an ad, specialty recruiters take finding people to a different level. These individuals network with other professionals, call into competitors and actively identify and go after top talent for your organization. They are professionals who you can also count on to represent your company very well. 
   
If your company doesnt budget for recruiting, these resources may seem expensive initially. However, if they can help you reach more potential employees in less time, how much less will it cost than not having the position filled?
