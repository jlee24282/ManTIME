<TEXT type="str">School systems in West Virginia have two choices other than propane for their school buses, but so far neither has drawn much interest. 
 
The two fuels are compressed natural gas and gasoline. 
 
“CNG is something that would work and would make a big impact in our state. The problem with CNG is there are no fueling stations. It would take a lot of money to build fueling stations,” said Mike Pickens , executive director of the Office of School Transportation and School Facilities at the West Virginia Department of Education . 
 
“It’s a very attractive product,” he added. “It could be the best of all of them, but it’s so expensive. There’s no way to do a pilot (project) because there are no fueling stations.” 
 
Propane companies will agree to build fueling stations at county bus garages in exchange for vehicle purchase contracts with those companies, so that reduces the cost of refueling infrastructure for counties considering the switch from diesel fuel to propane, Pickens said. 
 
Larry Fowler , director of school bus sales at Matheny Motors at Mineral Wells, said there also is the cost difference. A CNG bus can cost $35,000 more than a diesel bus, Fowler said. Matheny Motors offers buses from Thomas Built Buses that use CNG, but there has been no interest in West Virginia, he said. 
 
One of the three domestic bus manufacturers began selling gasoline-powered buses this school year, and another has announced plans to do so. Schools nationwide moved away from gasoline in the 1980s because diesel engines were more durable and had better fuel economy than gasoline engines. With diesel engines becoming more complicated and requiring the use of an additive to reduce emissions, some school systems in the United States have asked manufacturers to consider building gasoline-powered buses. 
 
Pickens said West Virginia accepts bids for diesel, propane and CNG buses, but not for gasoline. 
 
“We got away from gasoline a few years ago for several reasons,” he said. “It’s not even an acceptable fuel right now.” 
 
However, the state is not ruling out gasoline in the future, he added.</TEXT>
