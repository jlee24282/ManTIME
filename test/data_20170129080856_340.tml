<content type="str">I&apos;ve heard it said that Trump supporters take him seriously, but not literally, while Trump detractors take him literally, but not seriously. There&apos;s a lot of truth in that observation, because the more we know about Trump the more we realize that his bark is worse than his bite. He&apos;s not an inflexible ideologue; he&apos;s a businessman who wants to win.
