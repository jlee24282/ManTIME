<TEXT type="str">Conor McGregor, like I have said before, is a tough competitor, &apos; he said . I believe this is the first billion fight. &quot;I&apos;m trying to make something [the Mayweather fight] that I want to make happen ... happen&quot;. I believe I can make this fight without the UFC with the Ali Act. 
 
He said: &quot;I have my eyes on one thing and that&apos;s Floyd Mayweather&quot;. 
 
&quot;I&apos;m not sure whether the fight is going to happen but most likely a fight with Conor McGregor will happen&quot;, Mayweather told Sky Sports at the Carl Frampton v Leo Santa Cruz event at the MGM Grand. &quot;Enjoy the fans, I get energy from this&quot;. Of course, money is the biggest obstacle and one that won&apos;t be hurdled unless UFC is completely on board. &quot;He&apos;s got the personality, the skills, the talk&quot;, and that he could do just as well as Floyd Mayweather when he fought the Big Show at WrestleMania 24 . 
 
The UFC lightweight champion started this entire dream boxing match talk previous year. Surprisingly, he is also proverbially biting the hand that feeds him, as he also had negative comments about his own UFC promotion. 
 
McGregor claims that he could possibly sidestep the UFC in order to make the scrap happen, but he would prefer to keep them in the mix to alleviate any possible legal red tape. The two have been going at it in public for some time now and fight fans have been starting to question whether the two are ever going to actually come to blows in the end. 
 
I&apos;ve got the reach, I&apos;ve got the youth, I&apos;ve got the confidence, I&apos;ve got the unpredictable style. 
 
After McGregor became a dual champion in November, his agent Audie Attar said: &quot;I think it&apos;s all about business, man&quot;. He is yet to fight since while also having been stripped of the UFC featherweight title, a belt he officially won from Jose Aldo at UFC 194 in December 2015, unifying the title. &quot;F*** Hollywood. And f*** you too pay me&quot;.</TEXT>
