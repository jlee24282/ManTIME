College isn’t cheap, and even though Colorado Mesa is one of the most affordable universities in Colorado, when you’re an international student, the costs add up. 
 
To gain admission to CMU from another country, among the many documents required is proof of financial support of at least $35,272 (U.S.) to cover the first year’s cost of tuition, fees, housing, books and living expenses. The cost of attending CMU ranges from roughly $18,900-$35,000, depending on residency, according to the univeristy’s website. 
 
Student-athletes receive athletic scholarships, but few, if any, of the coaches at CMU can afford a full international scholarship. 
 
All international students who have an incoming grade-point average of 3.0 or higher can qualify for an $8,000 financial scholarship, $4,000 per semester. 
 
“Sadaam (Yousufzai), he’s incredibly, incredibly bright and he wouldn’t be here unless we could kind of package that together,” men’s soccer coach Todd Padgett said of the freshman from Afghanistan, who went to an American high school in Ontario, Canada. 
 
“It helps us tremendously. That’s $8,000 we don’t have to come up with, it’s something they’ve earned and the university awards them. Now that $28,000 figure is brought down to $20,000. 
 
“When we’re looking at an international player, the importance of that player qualifying for that amount of money is almost vital because of where our budget is at and what we have the ability to provide an international player is just simply not $30,000. But we can get the conversation started if you’re able to knock that down to 20. Let’s say out of pocket in your mind is another 10, now suddenly we’re taking about $10,000 as opposed to $30,000.” 
 
Proof of funds isn’t the only step in gaining admission, and working on international student-athlete eligibility can be a long, drawn-out process. 
 
“The most difficult thing I’ve run into with international students is from the transcripts and test scores, and having either one, the original documents, two, a translation, or three, both,” said Austin Kaiser, CMU’s assistant athletic director for compliance and student services. “They have certain eligibility requirements and submissions into the (NCAA) eligibility center, that I can see, and that determines if they’re eligible that first year or not. 
 
“Fortunately, the NCAA does take care of a lot of that, but they have certain requirements for what we have to submit. The challenge comes when a kid comes over from southwest Asia or Europe and they submitted originals to the institution, but that’s all we have. 
 
“Or we have a copy the institution can verify that yes, this is official, but the NCAA asks, we need an official copy, and if you don’t have that, we need a certified, stamped copy of your transcripts, with a certified translation of your transcripts, and that has to be mailed in. There are certain criteria for what they need. It’s difficult.” 
 
Kaiser has an NCAA website bookmarked on his computer that breaks down what’s required. 
 
“You feel for the student-athletes, they don’t necessarily know what’s needed,” he said. “That’s part of the education process, but until they’re here, it’s hard to educate them on that. All of a sudden the clock starts ticking on when to get it all in.” 
 
At CMU, Kaiser and the coaches rely on the admissions department and Annie Gingerich, who handles all international student admissions. Kaiser laughs that when an international student-athlete has a question about his or her status, the first words out of his mouth are often “Go see Annie.” 
 
“She’s phenomenal,” he said. 
 
Along with eligibility and compliance, Kaiser’s duties include student services, whether that’s arranging tutoring, counseling or just being a sounding board for all athletes. 
 
“I have 700 children, so I can’t be the counselor for every single one of them. Something that I do best as I can is refer to the great resources we have on this campus,” Kaiser said. 
 
“It all starts with them oftentimes coming into my office and sitting down and kind of having a heart-to-heart conversation, this is what I need. I’d be lying if I said it’s every single one of them every single day. It’s pretty rare, but nonetheless that’s where it starts. 
 
“They can come in here and shut the door and say whatever needs to be said. From there, I can say I think it is in your best interest to see this person. I’ll help set up appointments, make phone calls, referrals, whatever it is.”</content>
