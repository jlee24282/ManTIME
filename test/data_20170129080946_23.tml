<TEXT type="str">There is nothing, in Trump&apos;s view, Americans cannot accomplish as long as we believe in ourselves and our country. But Christians do not believe in ourselves or our country. We believe in God, but we do more than believe in God. We worship God. Nothing else is to be worshipped.
