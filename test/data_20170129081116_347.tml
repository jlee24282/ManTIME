<TEXT type="str">BAGAN DATUK, Jan 28 (Bernama) -- Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi today regards former Perak Menteri Besar Tan Sri Tajol Rosli Ghazali as the person who gave him &apos;life&apos; in politics. 
Ahmad Zahid said, after being detained under the Internal Security Act (ISA) in 1998, Tajol Rosli, who was at that time Perak UMNO Liaison Committee chief, gave him the chance to contest in the party election in 2000. 

According to Ahmad Zahid, who is also Home Minister, when he was regarded as an uncertainty by others and hated by several UMNO leaders at that time, Tajol Rosli adamantly believed and supported him. 

&quot;When I stepped on a banana peel in 1998 and detained under ISA, the person who gave be back my life in the world of national politics was Tajol Rosli. 

&quot;He allowed me to contest and I received the fourth-highest votes at the Supreme Council election and, second highest votes in the subsequent election,&quot; he said in his speech when opening the Bagan Datuk UMNO Division Veteran Meeting here today. 

In addition, Ahmad Zahid, who is also Bagan Datuk Member of Parliament, recorded his appreciation for Batu Gajah UMNO Division chief Datuk Mohd Yusof Kassim for ensuring he received the support of the other delegates during the elections. 

In the meantime, he also advised youths to always be sincere in their struggle. 

&quot;To those who are still young, the term &apos;sulk&apos; does not exist and we must always be positive on the tests from Allah. 

&quot;I waited for 11 years starting from deputy Tourism Minister in 2004 to Deputy Prime Minister in 2015, I never complained at all because what was essential we must be steadfast and sincere in our struggle,&quot; he said.
