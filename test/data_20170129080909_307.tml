<TITLE>Switch to zone paves way for Kansas comeback against Kentucky</TITLE>
<TEXT>LEXINGTON, Ky.  John Calipari had just finished talking extensively  about how he felt his young Kentucky team was out-toughed by Kansas and not where it needed to be defensively in a 79-73 loss  when he noticed his counterpart holding court with a couple of reporters in a hallway in the bowels of Rupp Arena.

Calipari tapped Jayhawks coach Bill Self on the left shoulder, wishing Self a safe trip back to Kansas. Great job, Calipari said.

And Self went back to answering the question at hand, a question that was worth asking Calipari as well had he lingered just a second longer: Was Self surprised at how effective Kansass zone was against Kentuckys explosive offense?

Yeah, I was, Self said. We dont play it.

But the Jayhawks do practice it quite a bit. They work on their standard 2-3 zone, which they utilized Saturday against Kentucky after facing an early 12-point deficit, and also their triangle-and-two, which they played for a few possessions, too.

MORE HOOPS:

There arent going to be any educational videos on that zone, Self said. But we would not have won the game unless we switched up.

Self said he hasnt changed defenses that much in one game in a while  at least, not without foul trouble dictating the decision, like it did when Kansas played Georgia back in November. But he wanted to do something to shake Kentuckys shooters. Plus, he was dealing with an unusually short rotation after announcing the indefinite suspension of Carlton Bragg Jr. prior to Saturdays game.

I thought our zone won the game for us for one reason: It allowed Frank (Mason III) and Devonte (Graham) to play 37 minutes for us and not be totally gassed, Self said.

Mason and Graham make up one of the nations top backcourts, and they went up against another of the countrys best in Kentuckys. But, as it often does, experience trumped youth. There was no panic or fear in either players eyes as Kansas faced that early hole. They knew theyd been in situations like this before and could turn things around. They understood why and how the zone helped, and how to do whatever was required to leave Rupp with a win. It helped slow down the game, and it helped guard against Kentuckys greatest strength  its transition offense.

It also gave us a chance to catch our breath on the defensive end because we dont have that many guys, Mason said. Hopefully we dont have to do it too much more because we take pride in playing man and defending our man.

MORE HOOPS:

There were myriad other reasons Kansas walked out of this arena with arguably its gutsiest win of the season  coming off a loss at West Virginia, without Bragg and amid a police investigation into an alleged December rape in which five Kansas players are considered witnesses. Freshman Josh Jackson was the best freshman on the court, outshining Malik Monk, DeAaron Fox and the rest of the Kentucky superstars who sputtered down the stretch while Jackson and company took over.

But the best example of all of why Self and his program are so good and, more important, so consistently good is this: That he switched to a zone defense against one of the most dynamic offenses in the country  and it worked. It wasnt notable, it wasnt tricky. But it forced Kentucky to work harder and play differently, and the 'Cats couldnt do it.

It was that simple.
