<TITLE>Sudan expresses regret over Trump's entry restriction</TITLE>
<TEXT>Khartoum - ArabToday   
Sudan expressed regret on Saturday over a decision by U.S. President Donald Trump to restrict the access of the Sudanese into the United States . 
 
"The Foreign Ministry expresses its regret over the executive order issued by President Donald Trump on Jan. 27, regarding the restriction of entry procedures of citizens of some countries, including the Sudanese citizens, into the United States of America," said Sudan's foreign ministry in a statement. 
 
"It is really unfortunate that the decision coincided with the two countries' accomplishment of an important and historical step of lifting the U.S. economic and trade sanctions on Sudan," it noted. 
 
The decision came after Sudan and the U.S. had started a discussion about investment and developing commercial projects to use their huge natural, human and economic resources to benefit the people of the two countries, according to the ministry. 
 
It also pointed to Sudan's firm stance on combating terrorism and reiterated the country's commitment to the constructive engagement and cooperation with the United States, saying "Sudan calls for immediate lifting of its name from the U.S. list of countries sponsoring terrorism." 
 
On Jan. 13, former U.S. President Barack Obama issued a decision to cancel two executive orders imposing economic sanctions on Sudan. 
 
The United States has been imposing sanctions on Sudan since 1997 and putting it on its list of countries sponsoring terrorism since 1993. 
 
Since then, Washington has been renewing its sanctions on Sudan due to the continuing war in Darfur, Blue Nile and South Kordofan regions in addition to a number of outstanding issues with South Sudan, such as the territorial dispute over the oil-rich Abyei area.
