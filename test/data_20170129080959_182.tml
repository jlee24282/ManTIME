<content type="str">In the 1989 movie &quot;Dead Poets Society,&quot; Robin Williams starred as a teacher in a private boys&apos; school. The entire movie was profound, but one powerful scene has stuck with me ever since, when he hopped up on desk while teaching and said, &quot;I stand upon my desk to remind myself that we must constantly look at things in a different way.&quot; 
To be able to look at things from many perspectives is an important life skill.Consider the words of author F. Scott Fitzgerald: &quot;The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function. One should, for example, be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise.&quot;Today&apos;s reviewed books offer different perspectives on three distinct ideas, and that is worth reading about.

&quot; Tuck Everlasting &quot; by Natalie Babbitt , Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 139 pages. Read aloud: age 8 and older. Read yourself: age 9 - 10 and older.Sometime things come together in strange ways with no apparent connection. But, like pieces in a puzzle, one begins to see how they fit. So it is for 10-year-old Winnie Foster, the Tuck family and the strange man in the yellow suit.Winnie Foster is an only child and doted upon by her mother and grandmother. What Winnie really wants is to be by herself for a change, do something interesting. Fed up with being overprotected, Winnie decides to run away, just for a little while, into the woods. It was there that she meets Jesse Tuck.The Tuck family had stumbled upon eternal life after they drank from a magic spring 87 years ago. From that time on they never aged and couldn&apos;t die. They are stuck, exactly the age they were when they drank that water.When Winnie discovers the Tucks&apos; secret, Jesse and his family are frantic. No one must find out about the magic spring, and the Tucks must make Winnie understand why - that living forever is not the blessing one might think. But a strange man in a yellow suit follows Winnie and Jesse and, having a different opinion of eternal life, tries to cash in on the Tucks&apos; long-kept secret. It&apos;s up to Winnie to save the Tucks and ultimately do what she&apos;s longed for, to make a difference in the world.Magnificently written, it is little wonder that this classic story continues to be enthusiastically embraced since it was first published over four decades ago.

&quot; Real Cowboys &quot; by Kate Hoefler , illustrated by Jonathan Bean, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2016, 32 pages, $16.99 hardcover. Read aloud: age 4 - 7. Read yourself: age 7.If someone asked for a description of what a cowboy is like, most of us would probably come up with the stereotype we&apos;ve been exposed to: rough, rowdy, hardened men (or something like that).This beautiful book portrays what real cowboys are like. Real cowboys are gentle, patient, peaceful and sensitive. Real cowboys can be homesick, are &quot;as many different colors as the Earth,&quot; and girls, too.A warm tribute by Hoefler presenting readers with what a real cowboy is (and subsequently teaching kids to be like a real cowboy with the life lessons she imparts), this lovely book is perfectly complemented by the evocative illustrations of Bean.&quot; Are Pirates Polite ?&quot; by Corinne Demas and Artemis Roehrig , illustrated by David Catrow, Orchard Books/Scholastic, 2016, 36 pages, $16.99 hardcover. Read aloud: age 3 - 6. Read yourself: age 6 - 7.Through funny, rhyming text, kids learn that pirates actually have good manners. They say please and thanks, and although they can be rowdy up on the deck of their ship, they use their inside voices when down below. Pirates share their treasure equally, they don&apos;t interrupt one another, and they respect one another&apos;s privacy and don&apos;t go barging in through closed door; they always knock first.Through these and other things pirates do to be polite, kids will laugh along with this zany bunch of pirates that hilariously emphasize that good manners are important.
