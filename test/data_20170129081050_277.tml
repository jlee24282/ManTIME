<content type="str">Milan&apos;s Suso believes former Coach Sinisa Mihajlovic &apos;didn&apos;t like him,&apos; but praises Vincenzo Montella&apos;s style of play. 
 
The 23-year-old arrived at San Siro from Liverpool in 2015 - when Pippo Inzaghi was still in charge of the Diavolo - but was frozen out when the Serbian became boss. He eventually joining Genoa on loan. 
 
However, he has flourished under Montella since his appointment last summer, cementing a place in the Rossoneri starting eleven. 
 
&quot;With Inzaghi at the end I had found a bit of space. I think that if he had stayed, I would have had even more,&quot; Suso told Gazzetta Dello Sport 
 
&quot;Instead, Mihajlovic came in. He uses a trequartista in his teams and I thought that could be a good thing for me. Now I play as a winger, but originally I was a trequartista. 
 
&quot;But I had been out for virtually six months, so during the first days of pre-season I said to the Coach: &apos;If you think that I won&apos;t have chances here, I will go on loan because I need to play to get my form back. 
 
&quot;He said: &apos;No, stay calm, we will play with a trequartista and I only have you in that role.Â  
 
&quot;He played me against Empoli at home. I was dead, I wasn&apos;t fit. My legs were not working, I felt rusty. After an hour, he took me off and I didn&apos;t play anymore from that moment. 
 
&quot;I trained well, maybe better than now, but I didn&apos;t play and I didn&apos;t understand why. 
 
&quot;There wasn&apos;t any argument. He obiously didn&apos;t like me, that&apos;s it. And given that we recently played Torino in the League and Coppa Italia in the space of a few days, I said hello to all his staff who were here at Milan, but I didn&apos;t see Mihajlovic.&quot; 
 
Suso then discussed his relationship with Montella, saying that though he has never had a long conversation with the former Fiorentina boss, he enjoys the style of play being implemented at Milan. 
 
&quot;I will confess one thing. Up until today, I have never had a long conversation with him. He has never said to me, &apos;I want this and that from you.&apos; 
 
&quot;He explained his idea of play to the team - keep the ball and attack with courage. He wants attacks to start with the goalkeeper. 
 
&quot;Then, he put us onto the pitch and watched us train. We always work with the ball and Montella does not miss anything. 
 
&quot;I like him because his style of play is mine. He doesn&apos;t want long balls, he wants us to manouvre the ball. And he isn&apos;t scared to play young players.&quot;
