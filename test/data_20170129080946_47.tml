<content type="str">LEXINGTON, Ky. — Second-ranked Kansas missed all of its three-point attempts in the first half, and still the Jayhawks kept on shooting.

That confidence paid off in one of college basketball’s toughest, loudest environments.

Josh Jackson calmly made consecutive three-pointers to jump-start the Jayhawks, Frank Mason III had 21 points and Kansas beat No. 4 Kentucky 79-73 on Saturday night in the SEC-Big 12 Challenge.

The Challenge’s marquee matchup between college basketball’s two winningest programs ended with the Jayhawks earning their second straight win over the Wildcats on Kentucky’s home floor.

Three-point shooting was critical for Kansas (19-2). It shook off an 0-for-8 first half to make 5 of 11 after halftime, starting with Jackson’s back-to-back makes which provided the first of several leads in a back-and-forth half. Kansas led throughout the final seven minutes.

The Jayhawks shot 59 percent in the second half, and Jackson finished with 20 points and 10 rebounds.

“I find making threes gets kind of contagious,” the freshman said. “I think it kind of opened it up for us a little bit.”

Kansas got this big victory at the end of a tumultuous week for the program.

After the Jayhawks’ 85-69 loss Tuesday night at No. 18 West Virginia, campus police in Lawrence announced they were investigating an alleged rape of a 16-year-old girl at the team’s dormitory. Coach Bill Self said Thursday that the investigation had become a “major distraction.” Self also suspended forward Carlton Bragg Jr. this week for a violation of team rules that he said wasn’t connected to the investigation.

Mason had 13 second-half points, and Landen Lucas contributed 13 points — including a layup with 4:41 remaining to cap an 11-0 run for a 69-59 lead — and five rebounds before fouling out. 

Kentucky (17-4) got within 77-73 before Sviatoslav Mykhailiuk’s two free throws with 16 seconds left sealed the hard-fought win.

“Coach told us to focus on the things we can control and we did a pretty good job of that,” Mason said. “We just have to do that, not get distracted and focus on what we can control.”

Kansas used a variety of defenses, including a zone, to effectively slow Kentucky. Malik Monk and Derek Willis each had 18 points for the Wildcats (17-4), but Monk had just six in the second half as the Wildcats dropped their second straight.

The Jayhawks forced 17 turnovers for 21 points and outscored Kentucky 44-34 in the paint. Devonte’ Graham had 12 points, and Mykhailiuk provided a big lift in place of Bragg with eight points.

“I thought this could get ugly really fast,” Self said. “The key part of the game for us was the last five minutes to get it to five (32-27) at halftime. ... Then Josh’s two threes to start the second half took the lid off, and we were pretty good after that.”
