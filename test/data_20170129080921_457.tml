<content type="str">We&apos;re being told Workplace Bullying is the same as domestic abuse at work.

The message comes from a Weymouth woman who&apos;s launched a special support and counselling service.

Alison Fox is calling on businesses to sponsor help for people who are struggling to pay.

She says she&apos;s been approached by a number of adults to support them through the after effects of workplace bullying.

Research shows that 1 in 2 adults will be affected by bullying at some point in their life time either directly or indirectly, with the most vulnerable in our society being at greatest risk.

&quot;As the amount of referrals for adults affected by bullying increases I will be fundraising to create a bursary fund to provide services for people most severely affected who are unable to for themselves&quot; said Alison.

&quot;Generally employers do not take responsibility to act, often don’t know how to and/or don’t believe the grievances or make excuses ie lots of stress in that department due to the re-structure.

&quot;This is because bullies are very clever manipulators and are often at the top of the organisation or making their way up by mistreating people along the way. In boardrooms they are charming and charismatic. This hides their true character which is weakness, low self- esteem and fear. Truly confident people do not need to belittle others.&quot;

&quot;Very often targets are too fearful to bring grievances and when they do they are often left alone, vulnerable which can lead to isolation, anxiety and depression.

Many people who have come to me for support to recover from Workplace Bullying have a history of domestic abuse, are people pleasers with low self-esteem..the pattern of abuse will continue until the target takes their power back and starts to take care of themselves first. Getting support as soon as possible is fundamental to ensure you start to recover.&quot;
