Admitting he is little wary of the Aam Aadmi Party in Punjab assembly election, Congress chief ministerial candidate Captain Amarinder Singh has said they can&apos;t take Arvind Kejriwal for granted. 
 
&quot;Kejriwal is a sneaky little fellow but I am little wary of him as we can&apos;t take him for granted considering 2014 polls,&quot; Singh told ANI. He said there was resentment and so people thought of a new party - AAP. 
 
&quot;Kejriwal is very ambitious but that&apos;s not the ambition Punjab needs,&quot; he said claiming that the performance of the Delhi CM is coming down which will show in the upcoming election. &quot;He knows nothing about Punjab. He just considers Punjab as a stepping stone he wants to jump from a union territory to a major state,&quot; Singh said against Kejriwal.

AKALIS GIVING STEP-MOTHERLY TREATMENT 
 
Expressing confidence of forming the next government in Punjab, Singh has accused the Shiromani Akali Dal of providing step-motherly treatment to the state. &quot;Akalis are total mismanagement, corruption, trade loss, farmers hanging themselves; it is a total collapse...Badal too old to understand and is busy doing his &apos;sangat darshan&apos;; giving step mother treatment to state,&quot; Captain said. 
 
He also promised to break the drug nexus in the state in a month if voted to power. &quot;Four weeks I want to break drug nexus. We know who does it, it is question of government being willing to do it,&quot; Singh said. 
 
On being asked what if he loses, he quipped: &quot;I never fight an election that I don&apos;t win&quot;.
