JAKARTA: Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi said on Sunday (Jan 29) the Muslim-majority nation deeply regrets President Donald Trump&apos;s plans for &quot;extreme vetting&quot; of people from some Muslim countries entering the United States under new immigration orders. 
 
In a far-reaching order that caused chaos and confusion after it was signed late on Friday, Trump put a four-month hold on allowing refugees into the United States and temporarily barred travellers from Syria and six other Muslim-majority countries. 
 
Indonesia, which has the world&apos;s largest Muslim population, is not among the seven Muslim-majority nations whose citizens face restrictions. However, when asked about Trump&apos;s plans for &quot;extreme vetting&quot;, Marsudi said in social media message sent to Reuters: &quot;We have deep regrets about the policy.
