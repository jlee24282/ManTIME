Sania Mirza and Ivan Dodig failed to clinch their maiden Grand Slam title as the Indo-Croatian pair lost 2-6, 4-6 to Juan Sebastian Cabal and Abigail Spears at the Rod Laver Arena on Sunday. 
 
It was a disappointing start from the Indo-Croatian pair as they lost out on both their initial serves to trail 0-4 at one point in the first set. They did manage to hold on to their next two service games, but the unseeded American-Colombian pair was able to take the set in just 26 minutes. 
 
In the second set however, it was an inspiring start from both Dodig and Sania as they displayed their class and quickly earned a break to take a 4-1 lead. But once Sania failed to hold on to her serve in the seventh game, the second seeded pair lost the momentum and lost five consecutive games to hand over the championship. 
 
After pairing up last season, this was the second Grand Slam final for Sania and Dodig who had lost the French Open to Martina Hingis and Leander Paes last year.</TEXT>
