The Spark network&apos;s Facebook page has been inundated with complaints from customers who are having issues with the network, and are unable to get through via telephone. 
   
The company said there were ongoing mobile connectivity issues as a backlog of customers are &quot;re-authenticated&quot; onto the server. 
   
Customers were asked to keep their phones turned on and not attempt to reconnect themselves. 
   The hardware issue in a data centre caused frustration for thousands of Kiwis.
