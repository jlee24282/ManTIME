<content type="str">U.S. President Donald Trump has assured the Australian government he will honor a deal to take around 2,000 asylum seeker from Australia&apos;s offshore processing centers at Manus Island and Nauru, local media reported on Sunday. 
 
Mr Turnbull struck a &quot;one-off&quot; deal with former U.S. president Barack Obama in November to resettle refugees detained on Manus and Nauru in the US. 
 
Trump reassured Turnbull during a phone call on Sunday the landmark deal made a year ago under President Obama would be honoured. 
 
The Greens leader urged Turnbull to tell Trump: &quot;This is the wrong way, go back, you are a country that holds itself out to be a beacon of values of liberty, of freedom, well then you are not the America that we want to continue to have a relationship with&apos;&quot;. They discussed their shared objective to defeating Islamic State and tackling global instability, including in the Asia-Pacific region. 
 
An executive order released over the weekend by Mr Trump includes a four-month pause on all refugee arrivals, a three-month ban on entry by citizens from seven countries of terrorism concern including Iran, Iraq and Syria, and an indefinite halt on all refugees from Syria. 
 
&apos;But those background checks shouldn&apos;t be based on assumptions based on a person&apos;s country of origin, ethnicity or religion, &apos; she told reporters in Sydney. 
 
Turnbull was the fifth foreign leader Trump spoke with by telephone on Saturday. 
 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Mr Trump are reported to have agreed on the fundamental importance of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation alliance and that all North Atlantic Treaty Organisation members must pay a fair share for their collective security.</content>
