<content type="str">When members of the Maryland State Firemen&apos;s Association plunged into the Chesapeake Bay Friday, they weren&apos;t thinking about the cold, they were thinking about the cause. The team was part of Friday&apos;s Police, Fire &amp; EMS, and Military Plunge. 
 
&quot;No matter the temperature of the water, the warm feeling you feel inside supersedes that,&quot; explained Bruce Bouch, senior deputy state fire marshal and member of the Gamber &amp; Community Fire Department. 
 
The Polar Bear Plunge holds multiple plunges over Friday and Saturday, in addition to the 24-hour Super Plunge. Friday was dedicated to plunges for police officers, firefighters and emergency personnel. There are two public plunges Saturday. 
 
Each participant must pledge at least $75, with Super Plungers aiming to raise $10,000. The money raised goes on to help Special Olympians by funding different competitions and activities, according to the Maryland Special Olympics . 
 
Bouch, who dons an embroidered fire safety cape for the event, said the plunge is &quot;just another way to give back.&quot; This year is the sixth time he has participated. 
 
&quot;Before you go in, you stand outside and acclimate to the air temperature,&quot; Bouch said. &quot;When you enter the water it doesn&apos;t seem as bad. When you get out of the water, that&apos;s when you feel the coldest but you&apos;re at the finish point and all you need to do is change into dry clothes.&quot; 
  
When participants enter the heated tent after the plunge and start high-fiving, Bouch said &quot;you think about doing it again but then go &apos;nah.&apos;&quot; 
 
&quot;I do applaud those that reach the 24-hour plunger level because they are doing so much good for this group of great individuals,&quot; Bouch said. &quot;If you don&apos;t have the time or are that fearful of colder temperatures, you can always donate to the team and bolster our efforts.&quot; 
 
Gamber &amp; Community Fire Company member Shawn Chenoweth, of Gamber, is also a member of the MSFA team. He has participated for five years. 
  
&quot;Special Olympics is a great cause and the money goes to support the athletes,&quot; Chenoweth said. &quot;It&apos;s fun being with a group of friends and raising money for a good cause.&quot; 
 
Chenoweth said the plunge is &quot;something that everybody should do at least once.&quot; 
 
Past president of the MSFA Johnie Roth, of Brookeville, also took the plunge. He has participated with his family for seven years and his son, Eric, is a Special Olympian. 
 
&quot;We&apos;ve always been supportive of Special Olympics,&quot; Roth said. &quot;When you have someone in your family, you put in an extra effort. Last year we plunged twice.&quot; 
 
Roth said being on the beach with hundreds of people helps &quot;psych yourself into it.&quot; 
 
&quot;To see these kids and young adults giving everything they&apos;ve got is inspiring. I get a kick out of cheering the kids on,&quot; Roth said. &quot;It&apos;s all for the Special Olympians.&quot;
