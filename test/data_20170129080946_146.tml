Featured Story 

Luis Enrique mounted a defence of the Chinese Super League&apos;s financial power on Saturday, sticking up for players who have been accused of taking the cash currently on offer in China. 

Chelsea&apos;s Oscar and Villarreal&apos;s Alexandre Pato are among the players who have made the move to Asia this month, while Barcelona&apos;s Arda Turan has been regularly linked with a Guangzhou Evergrande. 

Shanghai SIPG paid over 163;50 million for Oscar and are reportedly paying the Brazilian 163;400,000-a-week. Diego Costa was also reported to be interested in an offer from Tianjin Quanjian and Chelsea coach Antonio Conte has said that &quot;the Chinese market is a danger for all.&quot; 

However, Barcelona boss Luis Enrique doesn&apos;t share his sentiments, telling a news conference: &quot;It seems absolutely perfect to me that [players] are going to China. 

&quot;It&apos;s great if players can go to China and make a lot of money. It happens in all jobs. You, as journalists, also change jobs to earn more money and get together with your friends and they tell you: &apos;Great, you&apos;re a champion!&apos;
