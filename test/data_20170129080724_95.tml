<TEXT type="str">The Providence Journal’s “GLOBAL REBUKE” headline on Jan. 22, in a type and size that should be reserved for “WORLD WAR III BEGINS,” is a reminder that “we have nothing to fear but fear itself.” 
 
I realize that many people are horrified by Donald Trump taking over the presidency of the United States, but let&apos;s get a hold of ourselves. Do Americans know what&apos;s really horrifying? The fact that we are nearly $20 trillion in debt, that the Navy can&apos;t get spare parts and has been put on its knees and buzzed by Russian planes, that we&apos;ve had horrid foreign affairs management (including the Iran deal), that illegal immigration seems to be out of control, that hundreds of innocent people are being shot in our cities (in the kind of carnage that Trump mentioned in his inaugural speech) and that race relations are going backward to the early 1960s. All of these items are leftovers from the previous presidential administration. 
 
The marches and demonstrations last weekend had more to do with people not getting the results they wanted and self dissatisfaction. Trump has become their human piñata. However, it doesn&apos;t appear that he&apos;ll break too easily. Let&apos;s all calm down, grow up and give the man a chance to solve some of the massive problems he&apos;s inherited.
