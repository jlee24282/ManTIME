<TEXT type="str">The Election Commission (EC) has ordered a FIR against Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal for stating bribery remarks in Goa on January 8, 2017. He said, “If Congress or BJP candidates offer money, do not refuse it. Accept it as it is your own money and there is nothing wrong in getting it back. If they do not offer money, go to their offices and ask for it. But, when it comes to voting, press the button against the name of the AAP candidate.” 
(More details awaited)
