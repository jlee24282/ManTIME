<content type="str">LINDSAY Hatch could certainly get used to racing on a Sunday at Clifford Park. 
 
Toowoomba racing had a slight schedule change at the weekend when the weekly meeting at Clifford Park was held on Sunday rather than the usual Saturday twilight timeslot. 
 
It will go down as a memorable meeting for Toowoomba trainer Lindsay Hatch as he was at the forefront of the meeting with four winners from the eight races. 
 
Hatch&apos;s great day started with a commanding six-length win for Rhyme Nor Rhythm in the Key Sun Zinke Class 2 Handicap (1000m). 
 
The four-year-old gelding went into the race on the back of impressive form and started as a $1.35 favourite before repaying the faith of punters with a strong win, the third of his six-race career. 
 
Hatch was back in the winner&apos;s stall in race three when jockey Brad Stewart picked up his second win with the Toowoomba trainer for the meeting on board Helarocity ($1.80fav). 
 
The five-year-old grey proved too strong for We Built This City ($15), winning by two-and-a-half lengths in the Canadian Club Class 3 Handicap over 1300 metres. 
 
The Hatch stable was back in the action the next race as Stewart made it three wins courtesy of a smashing seven-and-a-half length victory to Jadentom in the Jim Beam Three-Year-Old Maiden Plate (1200m). 
 
Jadentom started as $1.60 favourite and proved worthy of that backing with the spacious win over Thumbs Up ($8). 
 
The great run for Hatch didn&apos;t stop there though as the trainer combined with jockey Josh Oliver in Captains Way&apos;s triumph in the Winning Edge Benchmark 58 Handicap (1850m). 
 
Captains Way ($5) edged out Pink Chaperone ($7) by two lengths, with Ruby Guru ($7) a length further back in third. 
 
Hatch then had a fifth win in his sights as Unseemly started as a $1.70 favourite in the Wellcamp Airports Fillies and Mares Class 1 Handicap (1200m). 
 
Red Chandelier ($5) from Doug Duryea&apos;s Beaudesert stable put a stop to that though by posting a three-quarter-length win over Manhattan Muse ($5.50), with Unseemly a further half-length back in third.</content>
