<content type="str">A Jacksonville family is pleading for information that leads to the arrest of the person who shot and killed a member of a local choir, who&apos;s family believes he wasn&apos;t the intended target. 
 
Family and loved ones held a vigil in memory of Jerry Brown, 22 on Saturday night. While it was a celebration of life, it was also a call to action. 
 
&quot;If anybody out there knows anything, please tell us. Come forth and tell us,&quot; Chevie Green, Brown&apos;s aunt, said. 
 
Brown was gunned down in a drive by shooting on Henrietta Street on January 28, 2016. In a year&apos;s time, no arrests have been made. 
 
Brown&apos;s mother died of cancer shortly after his death. Loved ones say they&apos;ll fight for justice on behalf of Brown&apos;s mother. 
 
&quot;He worked, he went to church, he took care of his mom,&quot; Green said. &quot;How can you live and fight cancer, and your son is gone?&quot; 
 
Brown&apos;s aunt also has a message for young people. 
 
&quot;You have a purpose in this life. You have your whole life ahead of you. You can be anything. You literally can be the President,&quot; Green said. &quot;You don&apos;t have to be a murderer. You don&apos;t have to destroy families.&quot; 
 
The reward money for information leading to an arrest has grown to $10,000. The family has raised some of the award money itself.</content>
