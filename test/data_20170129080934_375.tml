<TEXT type="str">Mike Connors, 91, who starred as a hard-hitting private eye on the long-running series Mannix , died Thursday at a Los Angeles hospital from complications of leukemia that had been diagnosed a week earlier. 

Mannix ran for eight years on CBS beginning in 1967. Viewers were intrigued by the tall, smartly dressed, well-spoken detective who could mix it up with the burliest of thugs and leap on the hood of a racing car to prevent an escape. 

&quot;Up until Mannix , most private investigators were hard-nosed, cynical guys who lived in a seedy area and had no emotions,&quot; Mr. Connors theorized in 1997. &quot;Mannix got emotionally involved. He was not above being taken advantage of.&quot; 

Mr. Connors&apos; movie and TV career stretched from the 1950s to 2007, when he had a guest role on Two and a Half Men . 

He made his film debut in 1952&apos;s Sudden Fear , which starred Joan Crawford. Other films included Island in the Sky , The Ten Commandments , and a remake of Stagecoach . 

Mr. Connors, born Krekor Ohanian in 1925, in an Armenian community in Fresno, Calif., served in the Air Force during World War II and attended UCLA on a basketball scholarship, where he played under legendary coach John Wooden. - AP</TEXT>
