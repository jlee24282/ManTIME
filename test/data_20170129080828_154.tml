It’s that time again. Tax season. 
 
Before you run away in panic, take a peek at the IRS’ gallery (https://www.irs.gov/uac/tax-quotes) of humorous and serious tax quotes to put things into perspective. 
 
But don’t fret about getting your taxes done. Help is as close as your local Polk County Library Cooperative (PCLC) library and the United Way of Central Florida. If your income is $64,000 or less, you can take advantage of free tax preparation services offered through United Way of Central Florida (UWCF), which runs through April 18. 
 
The countywide free tax preparation sites and other tax-related resources can be found through UWCF’s website: http://www.uwcf.org/money. Winter Haven Public Library has compiled a handy printout of the 2017 UWCF free tax preparation locations: http://whpl.mywinterhaven.com/IRSFormsStatus_files/UWCF%20Free%20Tax%20Prep%20Sites%202017.pdf. 
 
Three libraries are acting as UWCF free tax preparation sites this tax season. 
 
n Haines City Public Library, 111 N. Sixth St., Haines City 
 
n Larry R. Jackson Branch Library, 1700 N. Florida Ave., Lakeland 
 
n Winter Haven Public Library, 325 Ave. A NW, Winter Haven 
 
Consult the 2017 UWCF free tax preparation list, call 211, or contact the sites directly to find out the hours the tax preparers will be onsite. 
 
Printed tax forms are available for pick up at the following PCLC libraries: 
 
n Dundee Public Library, 202 E. Main St., Dundee

The IRS offers most tax forms for download on their website: https://www.irs.gov/. However, a few forms, such as select information and employer forms, cannot be downloaded. They must be ordered from the IRS (https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/order-products) or picked up at the closest IRS office:
