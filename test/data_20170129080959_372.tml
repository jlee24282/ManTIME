<TITLE>Kendall Jenner Reveals the 'Wildest Thing' She Did in High School</TITLE>
<TEXT>Kendall Jenner is so sneaky! "Because my parents weren't very strict, Ky and I were super responsible", she wrote. 
 
Although Kris Jenner and Caitlyn Jenner allowed Kenny and Kylie Jenner to go to parties, they never misbehaved. "We'd invite a bunch of people over to hang out but it was never a rager, lol". 
 
Kendall, who was homeschooled for a majority of her teens, shared that the craziest thing she ever did "during that time was fib to my parents about where I was at night". 
 
Neither of them are afraid to share all aspects of their life on their reality show, even health scares are the model did when opening up about her sleep paralysis. 
 
Supermodel Kendall Jenner has revealed that she used to keep tight-lipped about her relationships as a teenager because she thought her parents would tell her off for having boyfriends. "I'm glad my parents trusted me enough to let me have a good high school experience". "I know, I was wearing fabric chokers all the time - and it's not to say I don't still love them - but I'm over them right now". Even though my mom had an idea, I was really weird about telling them because I thought I'd get in trouble.</TEXT>
