Although Kris Jenner and Caitlyn Jenner allowed Kenny and Kylie Jenner to go to parties, they never misbehaved. &quot;We&apos;d invite a bunch of people over to hang out but it was never a rager, lol&quot;. 
 
Kendall, who was homeschooled for a majority of her teens, shared that the craziest thing she ever did &quot;during that time was fib to my parents about where I was at night&quot;.
