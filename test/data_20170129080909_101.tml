<TEXT type="str">A 29-year-old woman found in a vacant home in Good Hope was arrested in connection with an armed robbery at one Walmart and a theft at another, authorities said Saturday, Jan. 28.

Deputies from the Lake Elsinore sheriff&apos;s station arrested Patricia Kariey Moreno on Friday while checking a report of trespassers inside a vacant home in the 22000 block of Mountain Avenue, said sheriff&apos;s Sgt. Luke Torres.

Deputies found several firearms in her possession, Torres said.

“Moreno was subsequently linked to an armed robbery and a theft having occurred earlier this month,” he said.

The armed robbery was at the Walmart in the 31700 block of Grape Street in Lake Elsinore, Torres said.

“One of the firearms found in the residence was determined to be the firearm used during the robbery,” he said.

The theft was at the Walmart in the 32200 block of Temecula Parkway in Temecula, he said.

Moreno was booked on suspicion of illegally possessing firearms, armed robbery and theft.

Moreno was released on $10,000 bail and scheduled to appear in a Riverside courtroom March 23.�</TEXT>
