<TEXT type="str">What&apos;s a community newspaper to do?

At the end of this column is an invitation to readers. But first, let&apos;s discuss the past few days.

Last week, I found myself in a running debate on social media with supporters of President Donald Trump over a couple statements the new president made.

First Trump insisted his inauguration attracted the largest crowd ever in Washington, D.C. Various press reports pointed out clear visual evidence that both President Barack Obama&apos;s 2009 inauguration and the women&apos;s protest march in the nation&apos;s capital the day after Trump&apos;s inauguration drew larger crowds than Trump&apos;s inauguration. That led an agitated White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer to hold a no-questions press conference last Saturday night to excoriate the media for &quot;deliberately false reporting.&quot;

On Sunday morning, I challenged a post on Volusia County Republican Party Chair Tony Ledbetter&apos;s Facebook page that repeated the suggestion that the so-called &quot;mainstream media&quot; were publishing false news about Trump&apos;s inaugural crowd. 

Among other things, I pointed out that crowd scientists who studied photos of both events concluded that the women&apos;s protest march was about three times the size of Trump&apos;s inaugural crowd. They also concluded that Obama&apos;s 2009 inaugural crowd was bigger than Trump&apos;s inaugural. That brought a response from Ledbetter, who attended Trump&apos;s inauguration. &quot;Pat, really, crowd scientists. NOW THAT IS REALLY FAKE NEWS,&quot; he wrote. 

On Monday, during a meeting with leaders from both parties of Congress, Trump insisted that he would have won the popular vote if millions of illegal immigrants hadn&apos;t voted for his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. Then, early Wednesday morning, Trump tweeted that he will launch a &quot;major investigation&quot; into voter fraud.

That led me to post on my Facebook page: &quot;Our new president continues to insist that he would have won the popular vote if so many illegal immigrants hadn&apos;t voted. Only no one can find any credible evidence to back that up. But there is significant evidence that it&apos;s not true. Now Trump has promised a &apos;major investigation&apos; into voter fraud. I wonder how much this will cost taxpayers.&quot;

Facebook friend Paul Zimmerman weighed in with a number of comments in favor of an investigation, including: &quot;I believe the reason there is no &apos;credible&apos; evidence is because if it is happening, what party do you think would benefit from the fraud?&quot; (I&apos;m pretty sure he means the Democrats.)

Trump is colorful and charismatic, and some of his goals — leveling the trade playing field with other nations, creating higher-paying American jobs, and securing our borders — resonate with many Americans. 

He is combative — witness last week&apos;s Twitter battle with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto over Trump&apos;s vow to build a wall between the U.S. and Mexico, and make Mexico pay for it. The snit led to Nieto canceling a trip to the U.S.

Above all, Trump and his closest advisers see the media as the enemy. When the media challenge Trump&apos;s &quot;alternative facts,&quot; many of his supporters see nothing wrong with accusing the media of producing &quot;fake news&quot; for doing so.

What&apos;s a community newspaper to do?

Well, for starters we&apos;re going to continue to ensure that The News-Journal&apos;s opinion pages remain politically independent. Our core principles — protecting individual rights; support of free enterprise; championing small government and the belief that most issues should be resolved at the local level; cheering community involvement; and using facts to shape our opinions — will continue to guide us.

Secondly, we&apos;ll continue to report accurately about Trump. If Trump — or any other politician — pushes &quot;alternative facts,&quot; we plan to report it. That&apos;s our job.

Finally, we will maintain an open dialogue about the news with our readers. To that end, consider this an invitation to attend one of our daily morning news meetings, where we discuss stories our reporters are writing as well as the rest of the news. The meetings begin weekdays at 10 a.m. and usually end by 10:45 a.m. To attend, call at least 24 hours in advance so we can be sure to have a chair for you. You can call my cell phone: 386-681-8628.

I look forward to hearing from you, and thanks for reading.
