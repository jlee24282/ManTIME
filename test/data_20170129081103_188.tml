<content type="str">On ​Jan. 21, I had the good fortune of attending the Chico Sisters’ March in downtown Chico. The event was extremely well organized and very well attended by the entire community of Chico. I appreciated that my town took the opportunity to peacefully express themselves regarding basic human rights and the direction we’d like to see our country move toward. 
 
In addition to the march organizers, I would also like to thank the Chico Police Department​ for its efficient road closures as our enormous crowd moved through downtown Chico. 
 
I came away from the march inspired to get more involved politically and, believe or not, somewhat hopeful about our future. It was a wonderful day spent with individuals who value mutual respect, kindness, and the health of our planet. 
 
Thank you again. 
 
— Kerry V. Quevedo, Chico
