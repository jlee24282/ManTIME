<TEXT type="str">The Barton County Relay for Life started the year with a Relay for Life kickoff meeting. 
There were approximately 25 people in attendance at the meeting on Saturday to discuss the event that is in June. 
“We had the meeting to get everyone together, meet the new teams and to get information out for the event,” Event Lead Mariann Shook said. “Even though the event is not until June we have to start planning it ahead of time to make sure everything is in order.” 
According to the Barton County Relay for Life members, they were excited about last year and were pleased with the overall outcome and hope 2017 will be a better year with more teams and they hope to raise more money to help fight cancer. 
“I think we will have a great year with everyone’s help,” Shook said. “Last year we had 23 teams and we hope to increase that to 25 this year with a goal of raising $75,000.” 
This year’s theme for the Barton County Relay For Life event that will be held on June, 9 at the Hoisington Activity Center is “Knock Cancer Off The Board.” 
“We think is a great theme, it allows the teams to be very creative and have fun while doing so.” Shook said. 
Shook also mentioned they are always looking for more teams to join them.
