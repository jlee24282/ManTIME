<content type="str">When Harry teaches the young Frank the powers of mesmerism (hypnotism), he finds that he can use his new-found skill to a particularly libidinous end. With the correct sentence, Frank is able to make those under his spell act out the most provocative of practices and even lewder displays of fornication.Soon he becomes so adept at his skill that the participants freely engage and yearn for the kind of sexual release their subconscious could only yearn for. Frank is indeed intent on providing &apos;fun&apos; for all the family.This bizarre and ribald tale, written anonymously in 1891, bursts at the seems with all manner of naughtiness; a rare gem and worthy addition to any collection, &apos;The Power of Mesmerism&apos; is Victorian Erotica at its very best.</content>
