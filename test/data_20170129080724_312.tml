EL PASO, Texas - EL PASO, Texas – More than 350 families separated by the U.S.-Mexico border reunited Saturday during a special event in the Rio Grande, near downtown El Paso. 

In the third “Hugs Not Walls” event, families were given three minutes to embrace loved ones who live in Mexico. 

Oscar Herrera traveled more than 600 miles to be reunited with him family for the first time in 20 years. 

Herrera said, “I came all the way from Denver just to spend time – three minutes – with them, but it was worth it.” 

Herrera told NewsChannel 9 that he hasn’t seen his daughter since she was a little girl. 

During the embrace, family members tried to forget about politics but ended up sending a message. 

“We talk about walls today be we don’t have about the suffering of families,” said Fernando Garcia, director of the Border Network for Human Rights. 

According to Garcia, the BNHR denounces policies of separation and deportation that have torn families apart and left American communities in a state of suffering. 

Garcia added that today’s event was the biggest turnout so far. He also plan on organizing a fourth event but he doesn’t know when that will be.</content>
