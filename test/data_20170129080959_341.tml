<TITLE>New fund launched to help boost youth social action</TITLE>
<TEXT>Northamptonshire Community Foundation has launched the Youth Social Action Fund designed to give young people the chance to lead change and make a positive contribution to their communities. 
 
Northamptonshire Community Foundation is one of 43 Community Foundations across the country, promoting the #iwill Youth Social Action fund. The fund will offer grants between 1000 and 5000 for projects and activities raising the level and quality of youth social action in an area. Activities must be for young people between the age of 10 and 20 and up to 25 years for disabled young people. 
 
#iwill is a UK-wide campaign aiming to get 6 out 10 young people involved in social action by 2020. Big Lottery Fund and the Department of Culture, Media & Sport have invested 20 million each to the #iwill fund to support young people to access high quality social action opportunities. 
 
Social action involves activities such as campaigning, fundraising and volunteering, all of which enable participants to make a positive difference to their communities and develop skills and knowledge that future employers look for. 
The Wilson Foundation, a charity supporting young people in Northamptonshire, have generously match funded the Youth Social Action programme with a donation of 30,000. 
'We are extremely delighted to be delivering this much needed Youth Social Action Fund on behalf of an extremely strong partnership including the Department for Culture Media and Sport, the Big Lottery and our own local match funder The Wilson Foundation, who are donating 30,000 to enable us to double this fund that will help to raise the quality of and increase youth social action in Northamptonshire." Victoria Miles DL Chief Executive, Northamptonshire Community Foundation.
