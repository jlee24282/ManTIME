Former Barcelona and Brazil superstar Ronaldinho has revealed one of his biggest regrets during the early part of his career with Paris Saint-Germain was not winning a Ligue 1 title. 
 
The magically gifted and skilful forward started out in Europe with PSG in 2001/02 before his superb performances saw him win a move to Barcelona in 2003/04, where he then spent five seasons. 
 
However, despite a glittering career for his many clubs and for Brazil, Ronaldinho is disappointed he did not win French football&apos;s highest honour during his time with the Parisians. 
 
He told PSG&apos;s official website: &quot;What I regret is not having won the French title. That&apos;s what I missed most in my time with Paris. In 2003, we made it to the Coupe de France final, but unfortunately, we lost to Auxerre. It&apos;s always tough to deal with that kind of defeat after having such a good run. 
 
&quot;Paris is a special club for me, as it was here that I launched my European career. I have a lot of respect and love for this club. Of course, it&apos;s special for me to come back to where it all began for me! The fans gave me a lot of affection and respect. I&apos;d like to thank them for that. Each time I run into Paris fans around the world, they told me that I made them very happy. I&apos;m very proud of that.&quot;</TEXT>
