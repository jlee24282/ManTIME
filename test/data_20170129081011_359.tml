<content type="str">A Farnham graduate has high hopes, after receiving an Oscar nomination this week.

The latest film by UCA alumnus Michael Dudok de Wit was nominated the Best Animated Feature Film category. 

The Red Turtle, was co-written and directed by the UCA graduate.

It has no dialogue and is centred on a man who has been shipwrecked on a deserted island and meets a giant red turtle. 

Speaking to the Los Angeles Times, Michael said: “The competition was really strong. I knew our film had a chance. It was unlike any of the other films. But many other films had a huge chance, I think. I was honestly quite nervous.”

The film, which is a co-production between Wild Bunch and Studio Ghibil, premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in May last year.

Michael graduated from one of UCA’s founding colleges – the West Surrey College of Art – in 1978 and has since gone on to enjoy an extremely successful career.

In 2001, he was nominated and subsequently went on to win the Oscar for Best Animated Short Film, for his production Father &amp; Daughter.

In the category for Best Animated Feature Film, The Red Turtle is up against the likes of hit Disney productions Moana and Zootopia.

Hosted by Jimmy Kimmel, the awards ceremony will take place on Sunday 26 February at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood.</content>
