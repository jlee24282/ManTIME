<TITLE>Eric Davis is the hit of Reds Caravan visit in Ashland</TITLE>
<TEXT>ASHLAND - Last season's 68-95 record didn't deter fans of the Cincinnati Reds from showing up and enthusiastically interacting with the team's players, broadcasters and front office officials Saturday. 
   
The Reds Winter Caravan stopped at Fannin Motors, where a line of more than 200 people had gathered an hour before the squad arrived. Decked out in Reds jerseys, caps and shirts, fans brought items to be autographed and eagerly asked questions of pitcher Drew Storen, catcher Chris Okey, former outfielder Eric Davis, broadcasters Jeff Brantley and Jim Kelch, general manager Dick Williams and owner Bob Castellini during the two-hour session. 
   
One fan identified himself only by his first name and his banter with Davis, the star centerfielder on the 1990 Reds World Series championship team, had the crowd boisterously laughing. 
   
"Mr. Davis, I'm Roscoe," the fan said. 
   
"Right on, Roscoe," Davis said. 
   
"I remember when the Reds traded you to the Dodgers," Roscoe said. 
   
"You didn't have to bring that up," Davis responded. 
   
Davis was the hit of the Caravan lineup as fans reminisced about Cincinnati's 4-0 sweep of the the heavily favored Oakland Athletics in the 1990 Fall Classic. Davis homored off A's ace Dave Stewart in his first at bat of the series and the Reds won the game 7-0. 
   
"I still haven't come down," Davis said of his massive blast to center field at Riverfront Stadium. "It was great, but I enjoy it more now than I did at the time because when you're playing, you're playing for such high stakes and you really don't enjoy it as much when it happens." 
   
Oakland was the defending world champion and making its third consecutive appearance in the World Series in 1990. The "Bash Brothers" Mark McGwire and Jose Canseco led the A's. That season the two combined to hit 76 home runs. Oakland featured a batting champion in third baseman Carney Lansford, a Hall of Famer in center field in Rickey Henderson and a one-two starting pitching punch of Stewart and and Bob Welch, who combined to go 49-15. Relief ace Dennis Eckersley saved 48 games as the A's went 99-63 before sweeping Boston 4-0 in the American League Championship Series. 
   
Cincinnati took a 91-71 record into the World Series and had beaten the Pittsburgh Pirates 4 games to 2 in the National League Championship Series. The national media predicted a sweep, but not by the Reds. 
   
"Nobody in green and gold gave us a chance," Davis said of the A's. "All of us in red knew we were going to whip their (tail)." 
   
One of those who was convinced the Reds would beat Oakland was Cincinnati scout Gene Bennett, a Wheelersburg native who put together the scouting report on the A's. Bennett attended Saturday's Caravan stop and grinned as Davis recalled the shocking triumph. 
   
Davis is a Reds legend, but he said there was a time he didn't like the team. A native of Los Angeles, where he grew up with former New York Mets great Daryl Strawberry, Davis went to two Dodgers games in person and both were against the Reds. Davis said he didn't like what he saw from the powerful Big Red Machine of the 1970s. 
   
"They wore all black shoes," Davis said, wearing his familiar No. 44 jersey. "They had no insignia or color or stripe on them. I was sitting way up high, but I could see the insignia on the Dodgers shoes, but nothing on the Reds. I didn't like that. I thought, I don't want to play for those guys." 
   
The comments drew laughter, which continued as Davis said because of the shoes he was upset he was drafted by the Reds in 1980. His attitude quickly changed once he went to spring training in 1981. 
   
"We trained at Al Lopez Field in Tampa," Davis said. "Sometime the big league guys would come down to the minor league games. We didn't have all the jerseys and stuff you have today. They'd come down in their game uniforms and they were the whitest white and the reddest red. I just loved them. I told myself i was going to wear that uniform some day." 
   
Wear it, he did. Davis spent nine of his 17 seasons with Cincinnati and retired after the 2001 season. For his career, Davis hit 282 home runs, drove in 934 run, batted .269, reached base at a .359 clip and slugged .482. Davis stole 349 bases and won 10 gold gloves.</TEXT>
