<TEXT type="str">I recently booked a flight through American Airlines&apos; website for my son to fly from Los Angeles to Madrid. Within 24 hours, I canceled the flight. My son spoke to American on the phone, and was told that the refund would be credited to my credit card &quot;soon.&quot; 

It&apos;s been more than a month. My credit-card payment is due in three days, and the charge still shows as &quot;pending review.&quot; Can you help? 

— Sampath Radhakrishna, Cupertino, Calif. 

A: Your son&apos;s reservation fell under the &quot;24-hour rule,&quot; which says that if you cancel an airline ticket within a day of making the reservation, you&apos;re entitled to a full and prompt refund. (Certain restrictions apply for last-minute tickets.) 

How prompt? Well, that&apos;s the problem. When a refund is due, the airline must forward a credit to your card company within seven business days after receiving a complete refund application, according to the Department of Transportation. But the credit may take a month or two to appear on your statement. 

Your son was at about the one-month mark. He&apos;d been left with the impression that the refund would be issued &quot;soon,&quot; and had interpreted that as &quot;less than a month.&quot; In fact, American would have been well within its rights to wait two months before returning the money. 

Let&apos;s pause for a moment to consider the absurdity of this situation. An airline is allowed to keep your money for two months — can you say &quot;interest-free loan&quot;? — while the rest of us must pay our bills promptly. Oh, and how long does it take American to withdraw the money from your account? Seconds. 

Something just isn&apos;t right with this. American should have returned the money — in seconds. 

This isn&apos;t an American Airlines problem, or even an airline problem. Corporate America creates rules in its favor that allow it to benefit from holding on to your money for a few extra weeks. I&apos;ve asked executives about the sluggish refund process, and they&apos;ve told me, with a straight face, that the problem is exacerbated by credit-card billing cycles and overly cautious accounting processes. I think that&apos;s nonsense. If they benefited from speedy refunds, they would have figured out a way to send you the money instantly. But they have no motive, so here we are. 

A brief, polite email to one of American&apos;s customer-service executives might have shaken a check loose from the accounting department. I list their names, numbers and emails on my consumer-advocacy site: http://elliott.org/company-contacts/American. 

I contacted American, and it informed me that your refund has been processed — hopefully in time for you to avoid paying a big credit-card bill.
