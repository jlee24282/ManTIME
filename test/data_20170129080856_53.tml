<TEXT type="str">Drew Barrymore walks into the hotel room in Berlin flanked by assistants, caked in heavy TV make-up and wrapped in a brown fluffy jacket that makes her look like a very glamorous teddy bear. Within seconds, the entourage has disappeared, she’s wiped every last scrap of foundation from her face and she’s rummaging around underneath her dress, a kind of earth mother hippy smock, regretting her decision to wear tights on this sub-freezing day. “Why does anyone wear pantyhose?” she exclaims, barefaced, faux-exasperated, shifting in her armchair, trying to get comfortable. “They’re so fucking sadistic! They’re not even control pants,” she says, conspiratorially, “but I’m forcing them to be.” I was so much more brassy when I was younger. I’m like: ‘Where did you get those balls, kid?’ For a lot of women, especially women who grew up between 1982 and the early 2000s, Barrymore is a particular kind of icon.

It’s a warrior trophy. It’s not hippy,” she insists. “I’m like, fight. Fight to the death to be happy, and don’t kill anyone along the way.” We’re in Germany to talk... Read more</TEXT>
