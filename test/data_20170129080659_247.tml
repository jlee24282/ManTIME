<TEXT type="str">Geri Horner says it is a &apos;&apos;miracle&apos;&apos; she conceived naturally.

The 44-year-old singer recently welcomed son Montague George Hector Horner with her husband Christian Horner and Geri admitted she feels &apos;&apos;incredibly lucky&apos;&apos; that she didn&apos;t need any medical help in order to get pregnant.

She told The Sunday Times: &apos;&apos;I feel incredibly lucky to have conceived naturally at my age, 44. I see it as a miracle. Trust me, I can still moan like the rest them but, equally, I remind myself every day that this is an absolute gift.&apos;&apos;

And Geri, who battled bulimia when she was younger, insisted that she will not be a &apos;&apos;fanatic&apos;&apos; about losing the baby weight.

She said: &apos;&apos;When it comes to losing my baby weight I am not going to be a fanatic about it. At the moment the stairs in my house are exercise enough. Trust me, I have been there, done it, with all that perfect clean eating, but sometimes it is not sustainable or manageable.

&apos;&apos;For a long time now I have tried to have a balanced attitude towards food and dieting. I am like any other woman, I&apos;ll scoff a few chocolates and then I&apos;ll think, &apos;Ooh, I&apos;d better keep an eye on that.&apos; But the important thing to me is trying to give yourself a break and say, &apos;&apos;It&apos;s OK to have the chocolate and eat the cake, just find a balance.&apos;&apos;

&apos;&apos;I think that restriction tends to lead you in the opposite direction and you just want more. I used to have so much restriction around food. Now I find if I allow myself to have a bit, I am less likely to overindulge.

Geri also has a 10-year-old daughter Bluebell with her ex Sacha Gervasi and revealed that the youngster keeps her so busy she didn&apos;t have time to worry about getting everything ready for the new baby.

She explained: &apos;&apos;Only as my birth began to get close did I start to think about the reality of it, the preparation, the practical things, getting a nursery ready, and the things that one needs. But to be honest, as a mother to a 10-year-old already, I was thinking more about things like, &apos;&apos;Has my daughter done her homework?&apos;&apos;&apos;</TEXT>
