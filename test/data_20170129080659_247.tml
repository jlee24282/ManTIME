<TITLE>Geri Halliwell's miracle pregnancy</TITLE>
<TEXT>Geri Horner says it is a ''miracle'' she conceived naturally.

The 44-year-old singer recently welcomed son Montague George Hector Horner with her husband Christian Horner and Geri admitted she feels ''incredibly lucky'' that she didn't need any medical help in order to get pregnant.

She told The Sunday Times: ''I feel incredibly lucky to have conceived naturally at my age, 44. I see it as a miracle. Trust me, I can still moan like the rest them but, equally, I remind myself every day that this is an absolute gift.''

And Geri, who battled bulimia when she was younger, insisted that she will not be a ''fanatic'' about losing the baby weight.

She said: ''When it comes to losing my baby weight I am not going to be a fanatic about it. At the moment the stairs in my house are exercise enough. Trust me, I have been there, done it, with all that perfect clean eating, but sometimes it is not sustainable or manageable.

''For a long time now I have tried to have a balanced attitude towards food and dieting. I am like any other woman, I'll scoff a few chocolates and then I'll think, 'Ooh, I'd better keep an eye on that.' But the important thing to me is trying to give yourself a break and say, ''It's OK to have the chocolate and eat the cake, just find a balance.''

''I think that restriction tends to lead you in the opposite direction and you just want more. I used to have so much restriction around food. Now I find if I allow myself to have a bit, I am less likely to overindulge.

Geri also has a 10-year-old daughter Bluebell with her ex Sacha Gervasi and revealed that the youngster keeps her so busy she didn't have time to worry about getting everything ready for the new baby.

She explained: ''Only as my birth began to get close did I start to think about the reality of it, the preparation, the practical things, getting a nursery ready, and the things that one needs. But to be honest, as a mother to a 10-year-old already, I was thinking more about things like, ''Has my daughter done her homework?'''</TEXT>
