LEWISBURG — Brushstrokes art supplies store is staging its annual “Warm Your Heart” fundraiser, an event that benefits local animal shelters and nonprofits during the Heart of Lewisburg Ice Festival. 
 
Since 2009, store co-owners Kathy and Randy Snyder have encouraged the community to bring in pet care supplies and monetary donations to their Market Street shop during the Ice Festival, scheduled this year from Feb. 3 through 5. Proceeds from the sale of paintings by local artists are also donated to the cause.  
 
“We’re all small businesses so we can’t do big things, but we can do this,” said Kathy Snyder. 
 
Over the past eight years, Brushstrokes has raised more than $8,700 for Valley organizations. This year, they are accepting donations for the Danville SPCA, Mostly Mutts, Haven to Home, the Far Point Collie Rescue, the Lycoming Animal Protection Society, Arthur’s Pet Pantry, and the Far Point Animal Rescue.  
 
“I call them [the beneficiaries] ahead of time and ask them what they need,” Mrs. Snyder said. 
 
She added they post the donation needs on the store’s windows for people to learn what to donate. In the past, she recalls blankets, crates, dry cat food, and even homemade dog beds being donated to the drive.  
 
“People come back every year and I really appreciate that,” she added. “It shows me there are far more caring people than you hear about.”  
 
Abby Erdley, of Arthur’s Pet Pantry in Lewisburg, said, “The more people help, the more animals we can help.” She said the fundraiser is “a huge, huge help” for her organization, which gives pet food to financially distressed owners. 
 
The Pet Pantry has benefited from Brushstrokes’ fundraiser for the past two years and each time, Erdley said, her Jeep is filled with dog and cat food by the time the fundraiser ends. 
 
“A lot of my clients are elderly,” Erdley said. “No one wants to see them give up their pets because they can’t feed them. Because of their help, we feed 200 pets per month. I can’t speak highly enough of her [Kathy Snyder].”  
 
Cheryl Hill, the owner of the Mostly Mutts shelter near Sunbury, said her organization also gets a boost from the “Warm Your Heart” drive. “The fundraiser brings in items we would not usually get,” she said. Hill added the shelter receives dog beds, different types of dog food, and other items they cannot usually afford.  
 
“People don’t realize there are so many dogs and cats in need in this area,” she continued.  
 
Kathy Snyder said the store does the drive annually because she and her husband have always loved animals.  
 
“I was the little kid who would have a little cat and dog under each arm,” she explained. “They’re just good company, whether it is a good or a bad day.”  
 
Brushstrokes is open Monday though Thursday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., Friday from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m., and Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. The store will also have special hours during the “Warm Your Heart” fundraiser on Sunday from noon to 4 p.m.
