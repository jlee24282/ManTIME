<TEXT>On Jan. 20, an event was held at the Vienna Community Building to honor one of Wood Countys finest citizens, Mr. Clyde Brewer, who has been suffering from a long and egregious illness. Over 175 people gathered to honor a man who has given most of his life to the Wood County Schools as a teacher and coach. Many of you may remember Coach Brewer as a head boys basketball coach from 1982 to 2008. He has an outstanding record, and helped many athletes get scholarships, mature and become fine young men in the community. The event was emceed by John Coe. The roasters were Dike Goff and Doug Kiger, who shared many amusing memories about Mr. Brewer. The stories covered the period from his days at Glenville State College to his time with Wood County Schools. 
  
Many people and businesses were involved in making this event a reality. Former delegate Tom Azinger and Mr. Jim Hameric, former AD at Parkersburg High School, worked very hard promoting the event. Colombos Restaurant provided the meat; Jim Oppe from Foodland provided the utensils, and the local Pepsi Cola Company provided the drinks. The Great Steak Grill in the Grand Central Mall donated the bread and the manpower to help serve the dinner. The food was prepared by Officer Chris Jackson, a state trooper for the West Virginia State Police. 
 
People came from as far away as Mingo and McDowell counties to attend Clydes roast. Mayor Joyce and Mayor Rapp were in attendance as well as a state senator and two circuit judges. The outpouring of respect and honor for this man shows what a compassionate and generous community we live in. We should all be happy that we live in the Mid Ohio Valley that honors and respects those who have worked to make our community a better place in which to live. We are proud of our teachers, policemen and public servants. 
 
At the conclusion of the event, several door prizes were given away, one of which was a basketball signed by Bob Huggins of WVU, provided by Shane Lyons of WVU, who was one of Clydes former players. The ball was won by Mike Hayden, who graciously donated it back to Mrs. Brewer. What a wonderful outpouring of support and appreciation this event was! 
 
It was my great pleasure to have worked many years with Clyde and his wife at Wood County Schools. My very best to you and your family.
