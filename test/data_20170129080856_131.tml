<TITLE>What Types Of Movies Will Hollywood Make During The Trump Era? PGA Honorees & Nominees Have Answers</TITLE>
<TEXT>Nu Image 
 
Every presidency comes with its own type of cinema. The Ronald Reagan administration of 1981-1989 which lead into the tail end of the Cold War saw a number of raunchy escapist comedies like Porkys and National Lampoons Vacation, as well as the rise of the American action hero in Arnold Schwarzeneggers canon and, of course, Rambo. The Barack Obama years of 2009-2017 saw a number of tentpoles with multicultural casts, i.e. The Hunger Games, Furious 7, Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Star Wars: Rogue One. 
 
So in these divided political times of President Donald Trump where there are a number of inflammatory policies and rhetoric, what type of movies will Hollywood make?

Said Deadpool  producer Simon Kinberg who is nominated in the theatrical motion picture feature category for his R-rated iconoclastic superhero movie, Mygut would say that there will be more escapist entertainment because theyll be enough rise up drama on CNN. 
 
The writer/producer pointed to hopeful political dramas, referencing NBCs The West Wing which ran during the bulk of George W. Bushs presidency. 
 
It was like the president you wish you had as opposed to the president you have. Theyll be some of that whether its an escapist comedy, adventure, action, or superhero movie. In some way, the movies will have to be more outrageous because the reality were living in is the craziest its ever been in my lifetime, said Kinberg. 
 
Producer Aaron Ryder believes that one of the reasons why his feature PGA and Oscar nominated sci-fi pic Arrival  resonated so much with the masses (its bound to cross $100M by Oscar night) is because it emotionally connected with people at just the right moment when society seemed to be falling apart.

You have to look when Arrival was first released. It was the week of the election. It was a moment when people wanted go out, and this provided an incredibly timely message about communication and miscommunication, and people working well together. Timing helped us in some ways. It felt like Arrival hit the zeitgeist.

Bill Mechanic who produced this years Oscar and PGA nominee Hacksaw Ridge  and ranFox Filmed Entertainment from 1994-2000 as chairman and CEO had a more pragmatic take on the types of cinematic genres that get greenlit against a political climate: I never made pictures for a presidency. Its nothing I ever paid attention to. If youre playing in the currency, that currency can always change. For Me, I just dont make movies for that moment in time; you want them to last.Things can change too quickly. The job isnt to make the culture of the moment. The job is to make culture come to you. 
 
Mechanics fellow Hacksaw Ridge producer David Permut finds hope in the words of Harry Warner during calamitous times. 
 
Harry Warner, Jack Warners older brother said the power of the movieshad to do three things: educate, enlighten and entertain. If you can do all that, thats the power of the movies, and a lot of tonights nominated films speak to that, said Permut. 
 
I think escapism is always good, comedies are always king; you want to get away from harsh realities of our world. Somebody said to me the other day, Its a tragedy whats happened to this country politically. I dont think its a tragedy; a tragedy is when you stop breathing. The fact that were still here in the entertainment community because were still breathing, so you become proactive, adds the Hacksaw Ridge producer.

Providing a specific example of a movie thats in the works at his studio which couldnt be more ripe during the Trump presidency, Sony Pictures Entertainment Motion Group Chairman Tom Rothman , who is also receiving the PGA Milestone award tonight, beamed, Were making a film thats a co-production with Warner Bros. called The Phantom Tollboth baed on the Norton Juster book. In that book, rhyme and reason disappear and chaos takes over. All I will say is that suddenly that script feels more relevant today than it did in September.</TEXT>
