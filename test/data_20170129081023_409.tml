Allman Brothers&apos; Butch Trucks Reportedly Committed Suicide was a Top 3 story on Friday: (hennemusic) The death of 69-year old legendary Allman Brothers Band drummer Butch Trucks at his home in West Palm Beach on January 24 was allegedly a suicide, according to media reports about the police records. 
 
The Miami Herald reports the records show Trucks shot himself in the head with a pistol as his wife of 25 years - painter Melinda Trucks - stood near him and witnessed the incident in their downtown condo. 
 
The media outlet has reviewed the transcripts of a frantic 911 call Melinda made to West Palm Beach Police about 6:00 p.m. Tuesday, telling the dispatcher her &quot;husband just shot himself&quot; with a pistol. 
 
The drummer was still breathing when police arrived at the residence but passed away on site soon after. The Palm Beach County Medical Examiner&apos;s Office performed an autopsy Wednesday, but the results won&apos;t be known for weeks.
