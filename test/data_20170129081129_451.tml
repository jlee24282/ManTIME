Lauding the Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal, who is contesting against Captain Amarinder Singh in upcoming Punjab Assembly elections, PM Modi said: “Parkash Badal worked for Hindu-Sikh unity at a time when there was mistrust between the two communities.” 
 
“Badal worked hard for the people of Punjab and the state needs Badals to be in power again,” Modi was quoted as saying. 
 
Meanwhile on Saturday, Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi, in his Jalalabad rally, stepped up his attack against the ruling Badals while calling Deputy CM Sukhbir Singh Badal a “symbol of corruption”. He asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to clear the air on why he was seeking votes for the “corrupt” if he was fighting against the menace ahead of elections in Punjab on February 4.</content>
