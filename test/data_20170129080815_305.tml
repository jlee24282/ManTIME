<TEXT type="str">Sports compression wear leader SKINS is aiming to push the boundaries of performance sportswear with their all-new K-PROPRIUM men’s and women’s long tights. 
 
Launching globally in February, SKINS’ K-PROPRIUM combine the world’s best Dynamic Gradient Compression with strategically placed Proprioceptive Power Bands (PPBs) to fight fatigue, reduce the risk of injury and improve performance by enhancing proprioception. 
 
A SKINS statement describes proprioception as “the unconscious perception of motion and spatial awareness ... the body’s ability to sense movement in the joints, so you’re aware of where your limbs are without having to look.” 
 
SKINS suggest that proprioception “is important for everyday activities like standing and walking, but it’s even more important during physical activity where dynamic movements and co-ordination are vital for optimal performance. 
 
“When you’re active for long periods of time, the body’s ability to perform at a sustained intensity drops as the muscles become fatigued. This reduces the joint support that controls normal motion effectively, and can lead to poor form and increased risk of injury.” 
 
Built using SKINS’ Dynamic Gradient Compression, K-PROPRIUM claims to help improve wearer’s performance by getting more oxygen to active muscles and removing waste products from the body faster. </TEXT>
