<content type="str">Several people were injured after a fight broke out following a boxing event at the Bell Centre Saturday night. 
 
The brawl began after Toronto&apos;s Brandon Cook defeated Montreal&apos;s Steven Butler in the seventh round of the main event. Several objects were thrown towards the ring, including an ice bucket which struck Cook in the head. 
 
Bell Centre security and Montreal police were able to get the brawl under control relatively quickly. Among the injured are two security guards, a man in his fifties as well as a 49 year old woman who was hit in the face with a flying object. 
 
Montreal police spokesman Raphael Bergeron says authorities were able to arrest two men thanks to eyewitness accounts. They are expected to be questioned by police later Sunday. 
 
The police investigation is ongoing.</content>
