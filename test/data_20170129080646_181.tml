<content type="str">I’m not a Donald Trump fan. But I could do without the bumper-sticker vitriol I saw directed at Barack Obama. 
 
Some had profanities. Some were crude. Still, free speech protects bumper stickers. Just because somebody is elected president doesn’t mean you have to like it. 
 
The bumper sticker I remember read: “I love my country. I hate the government.” I saw it on a pickup truck at Five Points about two years ago. It’s now available to Prius owners. 
 
My memory of presidents goes back to Dwight Eisenhower. Dwight was probably a popular name at the time. But I can’t see another president named Dwight on the horizon, though it’s probably a better bet than Barack. 
 
I first saw Eisenhower in a movie newsreel. I might have been 5 or 6. That’s a detail lost to time. Four words stuck with me that day. President. Golf. Heart attack. The newsreel showed Eisenhower on a golf course. OK, I thought. This was what presidents did. 
 
The announcer said the president had had a heart attack. It sounded bad. Not that I was bothered. Heart attacks were something grownups had. 
 
Now I’m 66. Grownup enough, I guess. 
 
I didn’t give a thought to Eisenhower’s political party. I didn’t know anything about Republicans or Democrats. Only that we beat the Nazis, and commies were bad. And that Eisenhower was a kindly old man who smiled and waved to the camera. 
 
Then came John Kennedy. I remembered he smiled and waved. He looked serious, though, when talking about the Cuban Missile Crisis. He was on TV. Movie newsreels were on their way out. 
 
We lived next to the Air Force base where my dad worked. I’m sure the Russians had an ICBM or two aimed at it. But Kennedy was reassuring. We didn’t get blown to dust. I learned later it was a very close call. 
 
Other than that, Kennedy didn’t stay around long enough to make an impression. His death was shocking. In hindsight, I’d say he was inspiring but fell short on accomplishments. When it came to civil rights and voting rights, Lyndon Johnson did the heavy lifting. 
 
These are things that I appreciate now. I probably didn’t at the time. His Great Society, in any case, was eclipsed by the Vietnam War. It played out every night on the evening news. The smiling and waving president had been replaced by soldiers returning in body bags. By scenes of thatched-roof villages in flames. 
 
Richard Nixon followed. The month after his election, in 1968, I attended a Doors concert in Phoenix. Jim Morrison went on something of a tirade during “The End,” which has a long interlude. 
 
“I hear we got a new president,” he said. “He ain’t done nothing wrong yet. But when he does, we’re gonna get him!” 
 
Jim Morrison the prophet, it turned out. Six years later, facing impeachment over Watergate, Nixon resigned. Newspapers played a big role in uncovering the facts. 
 
Now, of course, we have alternative facts. And fake news. If you heard something awful about Hillary Clinton, it was probably fake news. 
 
Except for Anthony Weiner. He wasn’t fake. Too bad for Clinton. 
 
I went with her anyway. Losing, though, had its upside. 
 
I’m thinking about her dogs. The day after the election Clinton took them for a walk in the woods. A walk in the woods? What more could a dog want? It’s every dog’s dream. And now, with Citizen Hillary, every day is a walk in the woods. 
 
Trump doesn’t have dogs, as far as I know. If he did, they’d probably be golden retrievers. They’re nice dogs. And they wouldn’t clash with the new drapes. Which, I understand, are gold. Or gold colored. So I heard on NPR. 
 
And Trump would always be gold in his dog’s eyes. His dog would love his alternative facts — like the massive fraud Trump said deprived him of the popular vote. 
 
Who’s to say 5 million dead people didn’t claw their way out of the ground on Nov. 8 and head to the polls? And maybe stop for a few brains along the way. 
 
Most people might roll their eyes. But Trump would always have his dog’s vote. I think he’d name his dog Midas. 
 
Trump could give Midas a pat. “Who’s the greatest jobs president God ever created?” 
 
You know what the dog’s thinking: “You are! You are! You’re the greatest! The greatest ever! I’m hungry!” 
 
That’s why I have dogs. They like you no matter how bad your day was. And presidents are going to have some bad days, to be sure. So Trump could follow in Bill Clinton’s and Obama’s footsteps. 
 
They didn’t need Fox News to show the love. They had Buddy and Bo.
