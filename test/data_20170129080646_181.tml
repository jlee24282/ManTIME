<TITLE>Coates: Bumper stickers, Jim Morrison and Hillarys dogs  but I digress</TITLE>
<TEXT>Im not a Donald Trump fan. But I could do without the bumper-sticker vitriol I saw directed at Barack Obama. 
 
Some had profanities. Some were crude. Still, free speech protects bumper stickers. Just because somebody is elected president doesnt mean you have to like it. 
 
The bumper sticker I remember read: I love my country. I hate the government. I saw it on a pickup truck at Five Points about two years ago. Its now available to Prius owners. 
 
My memory of presidents goes back to Dwight Eisenhower. Dwight was probably a popular name at the time. But I cant see another president named Dwight on the horizon, though its probably a better bet than Barack. 
 
I first saw Eisenhower in a movie newsreel. I might have been 5 or 6. Thats a detail lost to time. Four words stuck with me that day. President. Golf. Heart attack. The newsreel showed Eisenhower on a golf course. OK, I thought. This was what presidents did. 
 
The announcer said the president had had a heart attack. It sounded bad. Not that I was bothered. Heart attacks were something grownups had. 
 
Now Im 66. Grownup enough, I guess. 
 
I didnt give a thought to Eisenhowers political party. I didnt know anything about Republicans or Democrats. Only that we beat the Nazis, and commies were bad. And that Eisenhower was a kindly old man who smiled and waved to the camera. 
 
Then came John Kennedy. I remembered he smiled and waved. He looked serious, though, when talking about the Cuban Missile Crisis. He was on TV. Movie newsreels were on their way out. 
 
We lived next to the Air Force base where my dad worked. Im sure the Russians had an ICBM or two aimed at it. But Kennedy was reassuring. We didnt get blown to dust. I learned later it was a very close call. 
 
Other than that, Kennedy didnt stay around long enough to make an impression. His death was shocking. In hindsight, Id say he was inspiring but fell short on accomplishments. When it came to civil rights and voting rights, Lyndon Johnson did the heavy lifting. 
 
These are things that I appreciate now. I probably didnt at the time. His Great Society, in any case, was eclipsed by the Vietnam War. It played out every night on the evening news. The smiling and waving president had been replaced by soldiers returning in body bags. By scenes of thatched-roof villages in flames. 
 
Richard Nixon followed. The month after his election, in 1968, I attended a Doors concert in Phoenix. Jim Morrison went on something of a tirade during The End, which has a long interlude. 
 
I hear we got a new president, he said. He aint done nothing wrong yet. But when he does, were gonna get him! 
 
Jim Morrison the prophet, it turned out. Six years later, facing impeachment over Watergate, Nixon resigned. Newspapers played a big role in uncovering the facts. 
 
Now, of course, we have alternative facts. And fake news. If you heard something awful about Hillary Clinton, it was probably fake news. 
 
Except for Anthony Weiner. He wasnt fake. Too bad for Clinton. 
 
I went with her anyway. Losing, though, had its upside. 
 
Im thinking about her dogs. The day after the election Clinton took them for a walk in the woods. A walk in the woods? What more could a dog want? Its every dogs dream. And now, with Citizen Hillary, every day is a walk in the woods. 
 
Trump doesnt have dogs, as far as I know. If he did, theyd probably be golden retrievers. Theyre nice dogs. And they wouldnt clash with the new drapes. Which, I understand, are gold. Or gold colored. So I heard on NPR. 
 
And Trump would always be gold in his dogs eyes. His dog would love his alternative facts  like the massive fraud Trump said deprived him of the popular vote. 
 
Whos to say 5 million dead people didnt claw their way out of the ground on Nov. 8 and head to the polls? And maybe stop for a few brains along the way. 
 
Most people might roll their eyes. But Trump would always have his dogs vote. I think hed name his dog Midas. 
 
Trump could give Midas a pat. Whos the greatest jobs president God ever created? 
 
You know what the dogs thinking: You are! You are! Youre the greatest! The greatest ever! Im hungry! 
 
Thats why I have dogs. They like you no matter how bad your day was. And presidents are going to have some bad days, to be sure. So Trump could follow in Bill Clintons and Obamas footsteps. 
 
They didnt need Fox News to show the love. They had Buddy and Bo.
