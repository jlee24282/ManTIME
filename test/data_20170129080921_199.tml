<TEXT type="str">NORTHAMPTON - Old friends know you. 
 
They know your stories, your jokes and all the things that make you who you are. 
 
Listening to Lyle Lovett and John Hiatt talk with each other in between songs at the Calvin Theater on Saturday night, you often felt like you were eavesdropping on a conversation between two, great friends. 
 
They joked around a lot, especially about Hiatt&apos;s incredible whistling talent. After Hiatt whistled his way through parts of &quot;Marlene,&quot; Lovett said he thinks Hiatt should be king of the WWF - the World Whistling Federation. 
 
But they also talked a lot about each other&apos;s music. And listening to them talk, you could tell they had really listened to each other&apos;s songs. 
 
They talked about specific lines in each other&apos;s songs. After Hiatt played &quot;Icy Blue Heart&quot; from his brilliant 1988 album, &quot;Slow Turning,&quot; Lovett joked about the drink the woman orders in the song. 
 
In the song, when asked by a man in a bar what she wants, the woman replies, &quot;Give me a love that don&apos;t freeze up inside.&quot; 
 
Hiatt and the audience laughed. But such banter also revealed why they&apos;re both such great songwriters. It&apos;s because they&apos;re both great listeners, great observers. They take the time to really get to know other people&apos;s songs and the songwriters who wrote them. 
 
And that&apos;s probably why Lovett and Hiatt exist in such a rare, special place in the music world. 
 
Neither one has ever had a huge, hit record. They don&apos;t sell out stadiums or perform at the Super Bowl. 
 
But such megastars often come and go faster than real shooting stars, their careers flaming out in the wake of the next big thing. 
 
In contrast, Lovett and Hiatt are marathon runners of the music world. 
 
Instead of chasing hits or instant stardom, they&apos;re in it for the long haul. For decades, they have been producing piercing songs that cut through the noise and reveal truths about ourselves we always suspected but could never quite put into words. 
 
That&apos;s why they don&apos;t need to worry about whether they have a flashy, new record before they hit the road. Like The Grateful Dead during their heyday, they know their fans will be there for them, no matter where they are on their musical journey. 
 
On Saturday, dressed in dark suits and ties, they took turns playing their songs for two and a half hours seated side-by-side on stage. They also often joined in on each other&apos;s songs, often to sing the chorus or an entire verse. Other times, they joined in on harmonica, including when Hiatt did so while Lovett sang &quot;White Boy Lost In The Blues.&quot; 
 
Many of the songs were familiar ones loved by fans. In fact, some fans shouted out their requests, especially for Hiatt, who seemed happy to oblige. 
 
Hiatt has always had a subtle touch. Born and raised in Indiana, he cut his songwriting teeth in Nashville, where he wrote songs for many other performers for years in the 1970s. He eventually carved out his own, unique niche writing and performing his own songs. 
 
Hiatt writes with laser-like precision about everyday people. Like characters in a Raymond Carver story, the people in Hiatt&apos;s songs are often teetering on the margins, struggling with issues that never make the headlines. Although it would be easy to miss such serious undertones since many of his down-to-earth songs are so damn catchy. 
 
Decades later, albums like &quot;Slow Turning&quot; and &quot;Bring The Family&quot; still resonate. And on Saturday, several songs from both these albums from the 1980s brought the crowd to their feet. But Hiatt isn&apos;t coasting on his old hits. He can still write great tunes and played several from his sensational 2014 album, &quot;Terms of My Surrender.&quot; 
 
Lovett seems to defy classification. A Texas-troubadour who looks like he stepped out of a sepia-toned photograph, he can turn an everyday occurrence, like reading over someone&apos;s shoulder or wishing he had a boat, into something magical. 
 
Lovett briefly entered the entertainment stratosphere in the 1990s when he married the movie star Julia Roberts. But even since returning to earth, nothing seems to faze him. Whether he&apos;s playing with a few musicians or a &quot;large band&quot; or solo acoustic shows with Hiatt, he always seems to keep his cards close to his vest. 
 
But don&apos;t let Lovett&apos;s poker face fool you. Beneath his wry banter and stone-faced jokes, he knows how to keep an audience enraptured with his spellbinding songs about life on the prairies or the wide-open spaces in south Texas, where Lovett still lives in the small town of Klein, where he was born and raised. 
 
On Saturday, Lovett played several of his best-known works from albums like &quot;The Road to Ensenada&quot; and haunting songs like &quot;Nobody Knows Me&quot; or &quot;North Dakota.&quot; 
 
But you don&apos;t have to be from North Dakota or Klein to appreciate Lovett&apos;s talent. And that&apos;s probably why he and Hiatt continue to pack theaters with adoring fans around the world, year after year. 
 
Their songs defy boundaries, defy classifications. They&apos;re timeless and perfect for our imperfect times.
