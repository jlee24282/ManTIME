<content type="str">The team of &quot;Raees&quot; -- which features Shah Rukh Khan as a bootlegger and has liquor prohibition as the backdrop -- will ironically celebrate the movie&apos;s success with a party sans alcohol. To celebrate the occasion, the film&apos;s team, along with Shah Rukh, will gather on Monday here. It being January 30 -- Martyr&apos;s Day that marks Mahatma Gandhi&apos;s assassination -- it also happens to be a dry day, said a source close to the filmmakers. Producer Ritesh Sidhwani of Excel Entertainment said in a statement: &quot;The entire team is very happy with the critical acclaim and audience reaction to the film. It has been a perfect combination. It seems that all efforts have come to fruition.&quot;</content>
