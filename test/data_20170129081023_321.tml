<TITLE>Thanks for Equitable event, prize</TITLE>
<TEXT>On Thursday evening, Jan. 19, I attended Equitable Banks Trail Blazers Dinner at the Platt Duetsche. 
 
I won a prize, a set of four glasses and coasters, for having the correct answer to what year Equitable Bank started  1882. 
  
Thank you. It was enjoyable.
