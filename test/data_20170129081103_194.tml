<TITLE>Letter: 'Share the Love' project sends valuable message</TITLE>
<TEXT>In response to current events, I want to commend local fine art sculpture artist, Sten Hoiland, for responding by crafting a hand sculpted Love with a card attached: Share the Love. Love is something if you give it away you end up having more! Please pass the love (sculpture) on within the next 2 days. So far hes made 400 with a goal of 1,000. 
 
Well done, Sten.
