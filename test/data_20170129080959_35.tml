It is unclear who is behind the posts, although according to the messages and photos, Moimoi has allegedly been spending time with another woman in his time overseas. 
 

 
The 37-year-old is currently contracted to the Toronto Wolfpack, a professional rugby league club based in Toronto who play in England. 
 
The posts include messages from the alleged &apos;paramour&apos;, apologising for her actions. 
 

 
And then the rant went on... 
 

 

 

 
The details of the alleged affair are sketchy, although you can definitely tell someone is not happy. 
 

 
The hacker posted images of Fui with another woman. 
 

 
The posts are yet to be deleted and still on his Twitter account at the time of publication.</TEXT>
