<TEXT type="str">JUST days after three people lost their lives crossing a flooded river crossing, another group has been swept off a road near Jabiru.

Police expressed their frustration on Facebook after a Toyota Prado with six people on board was washed off Magela Crossing on the Oenpelli Road just before midday Sunday after trying to cross the flooded path.

All passengers managed to get to shore safely.“The Toyota Prado attempted to cross the creek, which was running at just below 1.4m with a fast flow, but got into trouble about halfway across,” the Facebook post stated.

“Police continue to urge all drivers not to take the risk. If it is flooded — forget it.”

Magela Crossing is listed as ‘Impassable’ on the Secure NT website.
