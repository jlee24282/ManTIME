<TEXT type="str">OK, enough is enough. All you folks with Yule and Christmas wreathes on your door, take &apos;em off.

Don&apos;t you know it&apos;s bad luck?

My wife and I were driving someplace the other day and on the way she counted 30-something wreathes still adorning doors and windows.

First of all, common lore say that wreathes still hung in the new year prolong winter.

Look it up.

Years ago when I heard that, I took the wreath off my door and tossed it off the porch into my snowy front yard.

When I moved years later, there was a brilliant 30-foot holly tree in the spot.

Now, unless you&apos;re like Debbie Reynolds and Carrie Fisher - who kept Christmas trees up and decorated all year long - it&apos;s time for the greenery to go.

Christmas trees, by the way, were banned in all Christian religions and in the Bible (Jeremiah 10:1-5) until Queen Victoria (see Masterpiece on Channel 2) had one after returning from a trip to Germany.

Trees in Germany, and other pagan places, were decorated with what people wanted the new year to bring:

Coins, corn and other crops, flowers, lights for the return of the sun.

Back to the wreathes - the name, by the way, comes from the Old English word &quot;to twist,&quot; like in a circle - they were hung on doors in ancient Rome to represent victory and frequently laid on graves to honor the dead.

The wreathes&apos; circular shape represents eternity, or life never ending, or the reincarnation of Jesus.

Traditionally, wreaths and other greens were taken down on Twelfth Night, the eve of Epiphany, or Jan. 6.

In an Old English tradition you would have on this night a bonfire to burn the greens of Yule.

Hey, wreathes and trees still up after Jan. 6 bring bad luck.

And some hardliners believe greens not taken down on New Year&apos;s Eve take all the woes and troubles of the old year into the new.

That might be a little rash, but I can see their point.

The Coptics, and there&apos;s a Coptic church in Attleboro, celebrate Christmas as late as Jan. 27, but in any case, we are past just about all of these dates.

So, take down those wreathes.

I&apos;m going to be driving around looking for them.

I don&apos;t want to be shoveling snow next week just because you&apos;ve been procrastinating ... &quot;Opinions founded on prejudice are always sustained with the greatest of violence.&quot;

Paraprosdokians of the week

Artificial intelligence is no match for natural stupidity.

My wife and I were happy for 20 years; then we met.

Hospitality is the art of making guests feel like they&apos;re at home when they wish they were.

Money is the root of all wealth.

So you&apos;re so smart...

Last week I bet you that you couldn&apos;t tell me what new fraud-fighting technology major credit card companies have given gas stations three years to accommodate.

Answer: Installing equipment to accept chip-embedded credit and debit cards.

Now, I bet you can&apos;t tell me what U.S. state with a two-word name also has a capital city with a two-word name.

See you next week.
