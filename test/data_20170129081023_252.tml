Pep Guardiola said he had seen a vision of Manchester City&apos;s future after 19-year-old Gabriel Jesus inspired his side to a 3-0 FA Cup victory at Crystal Palace. 
 
Making his full debut, Jesus set up Raheem Sterling, 22, for City&apos;s opener in Saturday&apos;s fourth-round tie, with 21-year-old Leroy Sane adding a second before Yaya Toure curled in a late free-kick. 
 
Jesus&apos;s 43rd-minute assist, a neat spin and piercing pass, was the first return on his £27 million ($33.9 million, 31.7 million euros) move from Palmeiras and his display delighted the City manager. 
 
&quot;He helped us a lot. He&apos;s so aggressive, even if he&apos;s not a tall guy,&quot; Guardiola told his post-match press conference. 
 
&quot;It&apos;s the first game, so it&apos;s not easy for him to communicate. He doesn&apos;t speak English. He will need time. But he makes a lot of movements. The pass for the first goal is outstanding. 
 
&quot;We cannot forget, we play with 21, 20 and 21 (sic) – three strikers so, so young. It&apos;s the future for Man City and all three played good.&quot; 
 
Sane made a slow start to his City career following his close-season move from Schalke, but the Germany winger has now scored three goals in his last three appearances. 
 
&quot;He arrived a little bit scared, but it&apos;s normal when you arrive in a new country,&quot; Guardiola said. 
 
&quot;After the game against Arsenal (a 2-1 win on December 18) and his injury, they had four or five days off and he realised he had to make a step forward and he did it. 
 
&quot;Not just in terms of the goal, but his involvement in our game. Not just the actions, but the runs in behind, the quality and fighting. 
 
&quot;It&apos;s not easy for a player from another country coming here at 20, 21 years old and playing in a big club. Always he has to learn it&apos;s no option but to win, win, win.&quot; 
 
Guardiola was also pleased to see captain Vincent Kompany complete 90 minutes on his first outing since sustaining a knee injury during City&apos;s 2-1 win at Palace on November 19. 
 
VAN AANHOLT &apos;CLOSE&apos; 
 
&quot;That is maybe one of the better news tonight,&quot; said the City manager. 
 
&quot;He was a long time injured and every time he came back he could not finish 90 minutes. 
 
&quot;He was two years injured, but the doctors and the physios and (surgeon) Ramon Cugat made an exceptional job.&quot; 
 
Sergio Aguero was absent for City with a leg problem and Guardiola said he would be assessed before Wednesday&apos;s Premier League trip to West Ham United. 
 
Guardiola said Toure, who arced a free-kick into the top-left corner in injury time, had been &quot;perfect&quot; since returning to the team in the November win at Selhurst Park, in which he scored twice. 
 
But Palace manager Sam Allardyce took a dimmer view of the Ivorian&apos;s contribution, arguing he should have been shown a second yellow card for tripping Jordon Mutch midway through the first half. 
 
&quot;They should have been down to 10 men,&quot; Allardyce said. 
 
&quot;Mutchy had been booked for much less a couple of minutes before. So the referee has not done his job for me, on the incident that Yaya did there. 
 
&quot;On the consistency of what the referee was doing in the game, it was an absolute certain yellow card. But I&apos;m much more concerned about the goals we are conceding at the moment, rather than the referee.&quot; 
 
Allardyce confirmed Palace were close to completing a move for Sunderland left-back Patrick van Aanholt, but played down reports winger Andros Townsend is poised to rejoin Newcastle United. 
 
&quot;I think Van Aanholt is close,&quot; he said. &quot;Hopefully he will be involved (at Bournemouth) on Tuesday. 
 
&quot;I&apos;ve no idea what the situation is with Andros other than the chairman has told me there has not been any type of bid whatsoever from Newcastle. So that&apos;s not even in the back of my mind.&quot;</content>
