<TEXT type="str">LOS ANGELES Jan 28 (Reuters) - Hollywood producers named
the musical &quot;La La Land&quot; the best film of 2016 on Saturday at a
ceremony marked by criticism of President Donald Trump&apos;s
immigration policies. 
    
The big win by &quot;La La Land&quot; at the 28th annual awards set up
 the film, which stars Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, as an
odds-on Oscar favorite, after it scored a record-tying 14 Oscar
nominations earlier this month. 
    
The Producers Guild of America (PGA), which is among the
leading industry organizations representing makers of movies and
TV shows, also named its best animated film which went to
&quot;Zootopia,&quot; favorite documentary, won by &quot;O.J.: Made in America&quot;
 and honored Netflix&apos;s &quot;Stranger Things&quot; as the top television
drama. 
    
Musician John Legend, a star of &quot;La La Land&quot;, criticized the
new president&apos;s executive order placing curbs on people arriving
in the United States from certain Muslim-majority countries,
which spawned protests and confusion at several U.S. airports on
Saturday. &quot;We encourage everybody out there to speak out against
it,&quot; Legend said. 
    
Later, introducing the splashy, colorful musical film,
Legend said &quot;Our vision of America is directly antithetical to
that of President Trump. I want to specifically tonight reject
his vision and affirm that America has to be better than that.&quot; 
    
Accepting the award, &quot;La La Land&quot; producer Marc Platt
continued in a similar vein, saying &quot;It is the power of cinema
fueled by free artistic expression that cannot be denied, that
has no borders, and will never be banned from our hearts, our
minds and our souls.&quot; 
    
In past years, PGA best film winners have often gone on to
win the best picture Oscar, Hollywood&apos;s big prize. 
    
Among other honors for television productions, two FX shows
prevailed, as another look at the famous O.J. Simpson murder
case, &quot;The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story,&quot; won
the producers&apos; award for long-form television and the comedy
series award was won by &quot;Atlanta.&quot; 
    
Netflix&apos;s &quot;Making a Murderer&quot; won for non-fiction
television, while NBC&apos;s &quot;The Voice&quot; took home the prize for
reality competition series and PBS&apos; &quot;Sesame Street&quot; scored for
children&apos;s program. 
    
Outstanding sports program went to &quot;World of Sports,&quot; while
&quot;Last Week Tonight with John Oliver&quot; won the live entertainment
and talk television award. 
    
The Academy Awards will be bestowed on Feb. 26 to producers,
directors, actors and actresses by the Academy of Motion Picture
Arts and Sciences.
