<TEXT type="str">Donald Trump’s executive order prohibiting travelers into America from seven Muslim-majority nations triggered an astounding, spontaneous national protest from sea to sea. Thousands of demonstrators converged on airports where travelers were being detained in New York and Boston, Washington D.C., Philadelphia and Miami, to middle America in Minneapolis, Chicago, Denver and Dallas, and to the West Coast’s Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego.  
 
“Let them in!” protesters chanted, and “No hate, no fear, everyone is welcome here.” They waved signs complaining of “facists” and demanding “No ban, no wall,” and sang “This land is your land.” 
 
Trump’s edict had an unexpected positive outcome: not only a temporary stay blocking his order by a Brooklyn judge, but an America rising up together, captured in these photos and videos.
