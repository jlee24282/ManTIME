The cops, officers Jean Milord and Thomas Mercado, responded to a 911 call about a 32-year-old woman unconscious in her bathroom inside a Bensonhurst apartment at 15th Avenue and 80th Street at about 9:45 a.m., according to police. 
 
When they arrived, they found the woman on the bathroom floor with the belt around her neck, the sources said. 
 
The officers began chest compressions and the woman soon regained consciousness, cops said. 
 
Paramedics brought the unnamed woman to a hospital, where she is in stable condition.
