<content type="str">In line with his signature slogan Oti See Se , meaning (it has been made possible), His Imperial Majesty Oba Dr Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi, Ojaja II, revived a revered traditional festival. 
 
The Olojo Festival is celebrated in grand style from October 14 through 17 in Ile-Ife, Osun State. 
 
Since he was sworn in in December 2015, King Ogunwusi&apos;s footprints have covered thousands of miles from his palace in Ile-Ife to other countries in Africa, the United States, Europe, and in cyberspace, where he has generated hundreds of thousands of fans on Facebook, Twitter, and other social media platforms. 
 
His message of peace, harmony, economic justice, and youth emancipation resonates with millions of millennials. King Ogunwusi&apos;s winning attributes are his genuine openness and inclusiveness. 
 
I was among the 50,000, plus participants from Nigeria and the international community who flooded the streets of Ile-Ife to show our love and support and to celebrate the Olojo Festival with King Ogunwusi. 
 what is the Olojo Festival?  
It was the first festival I attended since I relocated to the United States 30 years ago. I was accompanied by New York State Senator Kevin Parker and Sekou Olayinka from Philadelphia. 
 
The Olojo Festival is the celebration of the God of Iron &apos;Ogun,&apos; whose representative is believed to be the first son of Oduduwa, progenitor of the Yoruba people. 
 
It is a historical festival that has remained popular in Ile-Ife due to the belief that it is a day in the year specially blessed by Olodumare (the creator of the Universe). 
 
Olojo in Yoruba also translates to &apos;The Owner for the Day.&apos; 
 
Prayers are offered for peace and tranquillity in Yoruba. All age groups are invited to participate, and the festival also signifies the unification of the Yorubas throughout the world. Tradition holds that Ile-Ife is the cradle of civilisation, the city of survivors, the spiritual seat of the Yorubas, and the land of the ancients. 
 
We arrived at Lagos airport and travelled six hours to Ile-Ife through a town called Ede. We finally arrived at the palace around 4 p.m. 
 
His Imperial Majesty&apos;s several days of prayerful seclusion communing with the ancestors on behalf of his people had just ended, and though he wasn&apos;t ready for public appearance, he welcomed us. 
 
This ritual ensured his purity and the efficacy of his prayers. Before the Ooni emerged, women from his maternal and paternal families swept the palace, symbolising the removal of evil. 
 
Later, the Ooni would appear in public with the Aare crown (King&apos;s Crown), said to be the original crown used by Oduduwa. He led a procession of traditional chiefs and priests to perform rituals at the Shrine of Ogun. 
 
The crowd was then led to Okemogun&apos;s shrine, where the king performed rituals that included the renewal of oath and divination at the foot of Oketage hill by Araba (chief priests). Visiting places of historical importance followed. 
 
Throughout the day, there was something magical about the atmosphere. I vividly recall the swarming crowds that made it impassable for vehicles. 
 
Thousands of people, shoulder-to-shoulder, anxiously awaited the emergence of the king. 
 
Drums were talking in rhythm, a score of bare-chested young men with their heads half-shaved and their faces painted in white and red were marching back and forth through the crowd, whipping long sticks in the air to keep the crowd from stepping into the pathway that had been cleared for the King&apos;s passage. 
 talking drums  
About 30 minutes later, we heard the rapid succession of the talking drums and a high-pitch chanting in Yoruba, honouring the king. 
 
The energy never ebbed. It was palpable, becoming volcanic when we spotted the tip of the colourfully beaded sacred crown, &apos;Aare,&apos; said to house a spiritual deity that can only be seen once a year. 
 
As customary, upon viewing the crown, spectators made a wish, hoping that it would be granted. This explained why thousands of Ife indigenes had camped out for days to catch a glimpse of the crown and their beloved king. 
 
They were all praying in solemnity with the hope of having their solemn prayers answered. As a Nigerian with unswerving belief in the traditions, I bowed my head and made by wish. 
 
As the king walked along the clear path, guarded closely by his traditional men know as &apos;Emese,&apos; the crowds surged. All I remembered was being shuffled along. There was no room to look left, right, or down. 
 
The crowd reminded me of the West Indian Day Parade in New York, but purpose and intention were different. There is an indescribable sacredness to the Olojo Festival that should be experienced by Yoruba people in the diaspora. It is an experience like no other.
