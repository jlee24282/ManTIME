<TEXT type="str">The Deputy National Organizer of the largest opposition party NDC, Mahdi Gibril, has stated that it won&apos;t be too long away when Ghanaians would come to realise the true development legacy of former President John Dramani Mahama and the ruling NPP&apos;s continuous &apos;Tongue fooling&apos; of Ghanaians.

According to the NDC scribe, nobody can take away the fact that former President Mahama has been Ghana&apos;s best bet in history for massive infrastructural development in Ghana.

Mahdi Gibril was speaking to popular and controversial political journalist, Daniel Benin, aka Ohim on TV7 flagship program Monitoring Agenda.

In his remarks during the interview, he made it clear that the good people of Ghana are already missing major porjects by John Mahama and the NDC

&quot;The NPP has made unreasonable luminous promises and those promises are already haunting them because expectations are high and they are in a fix to deliver,&quot; Mr. Gibril stated.

He added that former President Mahama was able to slash 10% of his salary for chip compounds in our local areas and the NDC government was able to build 80% of the 200 Community Day Senior High Schools.

&quot;We made a lot of progress for Ghanaians, talk of restoration of student loans, major interventions in the road sector, the Circle Interchange, Kasoa interchange, just to mention few; the expansion of the Accra Ridge Hospital, provision of school sandals for the benefit of students,&quot; Mahdi Gibril indicated.

&quot;Also during last year&apos;s elections, the people of Ghana said that the NPP was what they wanted and they voted for them so we should be watchful of their doings and push them to deliver their promises because their policies, whether good or bad will affect all of us,&quot; he said.

He, was however confident, that the NDC will bounce back in a grand style by the year 2020 to rule Ghana again.</TEXT>
