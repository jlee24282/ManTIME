According to  Mirror Online , Hussein soon realized his wife had returned home, and placed a bamboo basket over his daughter’s head to hide her. Hussein’s wife became suspicious as to the girl’s whereabouts and alerted neighbors. The neighbors started searching and soon discovered the girl hidden under the basket and buried from the chest down. 
 
The father was allegedly beaten before he was turned over to the police. It was later determined that he had intended to completely bury his daughter but stopped when he heard his wife. Authorities said Hussein was attempting to kill her simply because she was a girl.
