If you notice any errors in the below information, please contact our Webmaster  28  There will be extensive flooding of timber land and farm land along the river. Access roads may be damaged by the flood waters and operations at industrial plants along the river will be affected.  25  Flood waters will continue to affect logging operations upstream and downstream from Pee Dee. Flooding of farmlands adjacent to the river will worsen.  23  Flooding will affect swamp and timberlands while also disrupting logging operations. Operations will likely cease and equipment not previously moved will remain trapped. Some farmland will have minor flooding especially around Britton Neck.  20  Flood waters will affect swamplands and logging interests. Flood waters will affect timberland as far downstream as Yauhannah two weeks after the crest passes Pee Dee. Logging equipment needs to be moved.  19  Flood waters will affect swamplands adjacent to the river.
