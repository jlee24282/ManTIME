(PRWEB)  January 29, 2017 
 
Polin Waterparks has advanced its role as a leading waterpark designer and supplier in France with the opening of the new O'Gliss Waterpark in Le Bernard last June (June 2016). Polin Waterparks' proud partnership with Edsun Loisirs, a leisure park and outdoor recreation design firm, led to the development of the 12 million (US$13.5 million) facility that features an impressive 12 waterslides, including several of Polin's most-popular waterslides: the Kamikaze, Freefall, Turbo Lance and Looping Rocket. With a size of 60,000 square meters (196,850 square feet), O'Gliss waterpark also sets a record as the third-largest waterpark in France. 
 
An Oasis Next to an Oasis 
The coast of the Vende area of France extends along more than 200 kilometers (120 miles) of mostly sandy beaches that attract tourists from near and far. Edged with dunes and pine woods, along with coastal mudflats and marshes that attract unusual birds, the beaches are considered an oasis for nature lovers. 

 Ludo Park. Focused on little ones, this unique setting offers fun activities and games in a pool area dedicated to children's use.  Sunset Playa. The wave pool is the focal point of this relaxing space edged with palm trees and lounging chaises.  Exploral O. A lush world of "wild rivers" allows guests to free float in ultimate relaxation or test themselves against an intense current. The options extend along more than 400 meters (1,312 feet).  Dlir Space. This section of the park is devoted to thrills with a wide variety of slides that test guests' limits for adrenaline-building excitement.
