<content type="str">Liverpool sunk deeper into their mid-season rut as Championship side Wolverhampton Wanderers shocked them with a 2-1 FA Cup triumph at Anfield. 
 
Indeed it was a day for the underdogs, with non-league Lincoln besting Championship leaders Brighton Hove &amp; Albion to advance to the final 16. 
 
And Tottenham Hotspur needed injury time heroics to get past League Two Wycombe Wanderers, who twice blew a late game lead. 
 
Goals by Richard Stearman and Andreas Weimann proved enough for Wolves, 18th in the second tier, to inflict a third home defeat in a week on Juergen Klopp&apos;s faltering side. 
 
The loss left Klopp steaming, the German admitting that Liverpool can&apos;t get any lower than where they are currently at. 
 
&quot;If someone asks if this is the lowest point of my Liverpool time until now, I don&apos;t know,&quot; Klopp told reporters. 
 
&quot;I don&apos;t think it is the right time to talk about being positive or optimistic. In this moment we feel really bad.&quot; 
 
Liverpool, fourth in the Premier League, have won only one game out of eight in January and their chances of lifting a trophy this season look bleak. 
 
&quot;It is a perfect moment to turn because it is not possible to go lower,&quot; Klopp said. 
 
Wycombe were on course to trump Wolves, with a genuine giant-killing away to Premier League title hopefuls Tottenham Hotspur as two goals by Paul Hayes gave them a 2-0 halftime lead at White Hart Lane. 
 
Garry Thompson then restored their lead seven minutes from time after Tottenham had battled back but Dele Alli equalised and an own goal salvaged a 4-3 victory for Tottenham. 
 
Lincoln did hold on for an upset though. They went doen 1-o to brighton before coming back to take a 3-1 victory. 
 
Brighton weren&apos;t the only Championship high-flyer brought undone with Newcastle United succumbing to a humbling 3-0 defeat at League One&apos;s Oxford United. 
 
While those two slipped, Aaron Mooy came off the bench for Huddersfield Town to give a late assist as they ran out 4-0 winners over lowly Rochdale. 
 
There was precious little drama at Stamford Bridge though as Premier League leaders Chelsea beat second tier Brentford 4-0, or at Selhurst Park where Manchester City outclassed Crystal Palace 3-0 in an all Premier League clash. 
 
Two other Premier League sides made progress with Middlesbrough beating Accrington Stanley 1-0 and Burnley seeing off Bristol City 2-0. 
 
Blackburn Rovers won a north west derby 2-0 against Blackpool in a game memorable for protests against their clubs&apos; respective owners by both sets of fans.
