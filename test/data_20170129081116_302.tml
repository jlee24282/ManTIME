No specific platforms or release date are specified, with the site only saying that Lord of Vermilion IV is &quot;coming soon.&quot; The original game released in Japanese arcades back in 2008 and has since received a couple sequels, as well as a few spinoff action-RPGs for PlayStation Portable and PS Vita. 
Additionally, a free-to-play MOBA, titled Lord of Vermilion Arena, released in 2015, only to have its servers shut down the following year.
