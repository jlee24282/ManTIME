Hello and welcome to the latest edition of the Giant Bomb Community Spotlight and I, ZombiePie, am once again honored to be your host this week. As the first month of the already chaotic year we call 2017 comes to a close, a number of you managed to start the year off with a bang. Many of you fastidiously tackled your gaming backlogs, and others are participating in community events which tap into your creative skills. If anything, this all warms the heart of this respective cantankerous moderator rather personally. With this heart-to-heart complete, let&apos;s move on to the site related housekeeping:
