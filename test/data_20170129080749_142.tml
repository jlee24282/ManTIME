<content type="str">Coach Matt Hoops&apos; Unioto Shermans have owned the SVC In basketball in recent years. The run of championships now includes the 2016-17 Shermans. 

Unioto clinched the crown with a 62-39 win over Adena, while second place Piketon fell to Zane Trace on Saturday night. 

Unioto is now 11-0 and has a four game advantage with just three league games left.

The Adena match up started out with the Warriors riding Senior Trey Postage and five first quarter Sherman turnovers to a 14-7 first period advantage for the visitors. Payton Hill scored all seven first period points for Unioto.

The second quarter saw the Shermans pick up the defensive intensity and begin to control the boards. Adena scored only four points in the period and did not convert any field goals. Trey Postage had 14 of the Warrior&apos;s 18 first half points.

Unioto&apos;s inside game dominated the second half. Payton Hill poured in 15 second half points and received great support from senior Gavin Ogan who came off the bench with 9 second half markers. The two 6&apos;5&quot; towers also led Unioto to a 32-15 rebounding advantage on the night.

Jeff Postage finished the game with 21 of Adena&apos;s 39 points. The Warriors shot 34% from the floor and committed 17 turnovers. Adena now stands 6-5 in conference play.

The Shermans shot 49 % from the floor despite going only 1 of 14 from the three point line for the game. Unioto was a blistering 13 of 15 from the foul line.

Hill led the way with 24 points. Ogan notched 9 off the bench while Tre Ivey put in 7 as a sub. Logan Swackhammer added 9 for the SVC Champs.

Unioto has three conference games remaining with their consecutive conference winning streak now at 52 in a row. The Shermans have some big non-conference games coming up with SCOL leaders Miami Trace and Chillicothe.
