Shamrocks again top Observerland field

Catholic Central's so-called 'B team' proves too much for Observerland rivals

From one year to the next, Novi Detroit Catholic Central seemingly has a headlock on opponents at the Observerland Wrestling Tournament. 

Last year, the Shamrocks top-flight squad (Blue) prevailed and Saturday it was the White team  considered just a notch below the A team  to wreak havoc at Livonia Churchill High School. 

Catholic Central registered 304.5 points, far ahead of runner-up Salems 132.5, for another championship trophy. 

Theyre E team is good, Wayne Memorial co-coach Jason Crothers said. Every (Catholic Central) team is good, you go there for a reason. Those kids are well-trained, you cant take anything away from a B team, a C team, it doesnt matter. Theyre all tough. 

In third place was Plymouth (130), a last-minute addition to the tournament, with Farmington (124.5), Wayne Memorial (124), Canton (120), Livonia Stevenson (113), Novi (112.5), Livonia Churchill and Lutheran Westland (112 each) rounding out the top 10. 

Earning MVP honors for the lower weights was Cantons Justin Winnie, who won the 135-pound championship. Salems Bruce Haslitt took home the prize for upper weights MVP after winning at 145 with his 17th consecutive pin of the season.

Because of fewer teams participating, the tourney was changed from a 16-man bracket to to a round-robin affair. 

It was a last minute thing once we saw the numbers in the weight classes, said Livonia Churchill head wrestling coach Marty Altounian, the event organizer. Instead of having someone getting two matches most of them got four or five doing it this way. 

It was a little confusing, yes, but it paid off for the quality of wrestling they got. 

Livonia Stevenson head coach Dan Vaughan said the format change took some getting used to, but for the most part the overall tournament quality remained good. 

I think there were some weight classes that were really packed full of good kids, 125 pops out in my mind, 140 was not bad, Vaughan said. Heavyweight seemed pretty deep.

On the podium 

Of course, Catholic Central wrestlers were often in the mix for medals and points (the top six per weight class reached the podium). 

Im just really pleased with the way our guys wrestled, Ianni said. They practiced, they worked their butts off day in and day out. They have for the last few months, so its good they get to come here and show it in front of everybody. 

Capturing first place in their weights for the Shamrocks were Dan Rehfeldt (103 pounds), Davis Rastigue (125), Brody Burke (152), Brendin Yatooma (160) and Dane Flynn (189). 

Another four lost in the spotlight finals, when Churchill gymnasium lights were dimmed so fans couldfocus on the one bout taking place. 

Earlier in the tourney, as many as four matches took place simultaneously. 

For Ianni, a Catholic Central alum who wrestled his senior year at Observerland, it always is a plus to bring a contingent to the tourney. 

Its just kind of a tradition for us, Ianni said. I graduated in 2007 and this was a huge tournament for us then and we still like to come back and have a presence here. Were happy coming back. 

Ianni, meanwhile, said there is a pretty good difference between the Blue and White teams, but that didnt provide much solace for the 13 other high schoolsthere (another team, Salems B squad, also competed). 

We got a few guys on the White team who even though theyre teammates they like to get after the guys ahead of them, he continued. They like to push them pretty hard, thats what makes the whole program better. 

... Brendin Yatoomas had time on the Blue team, Dane Flynn. Its really next man up, so whenever somebody needs to fill in, were happy putting anybody out there. 

Rock solid 

Earning second-place honors in the team standings was Salem, spearheaded by senior Haslitts pin in 1:59 against CCs Robert Walston. It gave Haslitt 98 career pins and plenty of momentum as he takes a run at the school mark of 104 set in 1986 by state champion Dave Dameron. 

This tournaments come down a little bit, said Salem head coach Jeremy Henderson, a former Observerland and state champion. But to be able to pin your way all the way through the finals at this thing is still something to be proud of. 

Bruce has turned it on at the right time of the season, hes going to be tough to beat the next couple weeks. 

Cantons Winnie, a senior, won 11-6 in the 135 final against Northville freshman Nick Gattoni. 

I knew I just had to keep my pace high, Winnie said. I knew he was a freshman, I just had to go out and wrestle my match. 

Haslitt, Winnie and Farmingtons Jake Justice (who won at 130 with a pin over the Shamrocks Kale Kazyak) all said they were pumped up to wrestle in the spotlight finals. 

You never get to feel the same type of experience as this, said Haslitt, adding with a laugh that I feel like Im about to have a heart attack every match. 

Justice said the success he and teammates had Saturday (also winning was heavyweight Donovan King, with Anthony Averiette reaching the finals at 103) will help the Falcons overall team confidence moving forward into state tournament time. 

I feel a lot of the guys are going to want to keep going in the room as hard as they can now, now that they know weve had some wrestlers that were placing, Justice continued. 

Full marks 

Plymouth came home with one championship win in 112-pounder Tyler Campbell. 

For him to get first today is pretty awesome for him, Plymouth head coach Josh Leege said. Hes a junior, so this is definitely the year hes seeing his hard work pay off.

Other firsts were turned in by Livonia Churchills Ethan Englehart (119), Livonia Stevensons Tarik Alcodray (140), Novis Corey Grassmeyer (171) and Lutheran Westlands Nick Glinn (215). 

Some of the kids didnt come out on the winning end like they should have, Churchills Altounian said. Others worked their butts off to get what they got, and it was well noted. They all wrestled really well. 

Vaughan said Alcodray did what he was supposed to do and win the tournament and were looking forward to districts. 

Wayne Memorial didnt win any first-place medals, but the Zebras did have five finalists in Nick Daniels (125), Jalen Adams (152), Kevaughn Henderson (171), Chris Fletcher (215) and Anthony Calloway (285). 

We took seven today so five of them made the finals, Crothers said. So thats a pretty good day for us.
