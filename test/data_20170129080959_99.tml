<TEXT type="str">Hi everyone. Spare time for reading is not a luxury all folks have, so with that in mind and a desire to accommodate all, I have re-written my book &quot;Reflections Of A Sheep&quot; into a &quot;Series Format&quot; under the new title, &quot;Reflections Of A Sheep - The Series&quot;. The original will remain intact and available as usual. With sincere thanks for your support and blessings to all. Bill Taylor.</TEXT>
