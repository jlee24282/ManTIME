A THIRD country is set to join the Philippines and Indonesia in the bid to co-host the 2023 Fiba World Cup. 
 
Former Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas (SBP) president Manny V. Pangilinan bared a third country will likely join in to fortify the Asian bid for the 2023 Fiba World Cup. 
 
“FIBA knows we&apos;re bidding for 2023 World Cup. With Indonesia. Maybe now with a 3rd Asian country. Abangan,” wrote Pangilinan on his @iamMVP Twitter account.
