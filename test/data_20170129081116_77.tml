<content type="str">Actress Shriya Pilgaonkar, who made her Bollywood debut with Shah Rukh Khan starrer &quot;Fan&quot;, says observing his style of work remains one of her best experiences.

&quot;Shah Rukh Khan is amazing... Anybody asks me about him, and the first thing I say that he is a great co-actor. Yes, he is a big star and it is amazingly surreal to work with him, but I was so happy to see the respect he gave me even though I was a newcomer,&quot; Shriya told IANS. Shriya, daughter of actors Sachin and Supriya Pilgaonkar, was very comfortable with SRK.

She said: &quot;He wanted to sort of discuss the scenes, we spoke about so many things. He just made me feel very comfortable. The spirit of learning and to do well...For me he was just this person, who wants to do a good job,&quot; she added.

&quot;It will always be one of my most special experiences to observe and to learn from him...It was a wonderful feeling.&quot;
