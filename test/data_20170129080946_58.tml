<TITLE>Earth's orbital variations and sea ice synch glacial periods</TITLE>
<TEXT>Earth is currently in what climatologists call an interglacial period, a warm pulse between long, cold ice ages when glaciers dominate our planet's higher latitudes. For the past million years, these glacial-interglacial cycles have repeated roughly on a 100,000-year cycle. Now a team of Brown University researchers has a new explanation for that timing and why the cycle was different before a million years ago. Using a set of computer simulations, the researchers show that two periodic varia...</TEXT>
