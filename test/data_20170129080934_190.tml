<content type="str">George Ezra stayed in a cabin without electricity to work on his new album.

The &apos;Budapest&apos; hitmaker famously went inter-railing around Europe to seek inspiration for his debut LP &apos;Wanted On Voyage&apos; and has been on a variety of other adventures in order to shape his next LP, even though his original ideas were quashed.

He said: &apos;&apos;I spent last January in a cottage in Cornwall, writing.

&apos;&apos;My first plan had been to travel alone on industrial shipping between London and New York but I was talked out of it - &apos;The Atlantic, in January&apos; - so I went to Cornwall instead.

&apos;&apos;Then I did a month in Barcelona. I did Airbnb and deliberately stayed with the owner, who I didn&apos;t know.

&apos;&apos;It was a risk, but she showed me the city.

&apos;&apos;Then I did 10 days in a cabin in Norfolk without any electricity.

&apos;&apos;Everyone went, &apos;No, think about what runs on electricity&apos;, but I booked it.

&apos;&apos;The shower was outside. You had to wake up at 6am to get the fire going but there was something amazing about showering in a field.&apos;&apos;

And George believes his experiences cut off from friends and family helped to focus his mind more.

He explained: &apos;&apos;I think something happens to your mind when you&apos;re away for a prolonged amount of time by yourself.

&apos;&apos;You start to see things a little differently. Everything is more intense.&apos;&apos;

As a result of his travels, &apos;&apos;turning off&apos;&apos; became a big talking point in the 23-year-old star&apos;s new songs.

He told Q magazine: &apos;&apos;One of the main topics on the record is how to get away from everything.

2I know everyone has said it, but 2016 was a really weird year, so I&apos;ve written songs about turning off.

&apos;&apos;I know as part of my job I have to go on to Twitter, it&apos;s a free way of connecting but... I know full well if it wasn&apos;t part of my job I wouldn&apos;t do it. It&apos;s suffocating.&apos;&apos;</content>
