<TITLE>Rick Morris named Waseca's Don Eustice Award winner</TITLE>
<TEXT>It didn't take long for the crowd to figure out who the 2016 Don Eustice Community Service Award winner was. 
   
The longer 2015 winner, Trevor Kanewischer, read of Rick Morris' bio and list of accomplishments Saturday, the clearer it became. The honor, given at the annual Waseca Area Chamber of Commerce Community Awards banquet, is a surprise announcement and the highlight of an evening feting community members who have given their time and talent to better the city. 
   
Morris, who has owned Waseca Floral for more than 40 years, has served as a Waseca County commissioner and on boards from the Waseca County Planning Commission to the Waseca Area Neighborhood Service Center to the Waseca Le Sueur Regional Library Board. 
   
And while Morris' selection was a popular choice, particularly at his table, which included three other Eustice Award winners: Peter Madel Sr, Charlie Mathern and Morris' wife, Sheila, Morris seemed taken aback. Other than a brief speech and a simple thank you, Morris let a smile do his talking. 
   
The award is named for the late Waseca County sheriff, Don Eustice, who was a local icon and volunteer who was well-known as a community booster. It recognizes an individual who is involved in a number of local organizations and projects and has made a difference in the Waseca area. 
   
Other winners honored Saturday, but named earlier this year were 
   
Rotary Service Above Self: Ann Gaytko 
   
Waseca County Distinguished Agricultural Leadership Award: Scott Singlestad 
   
Community Development Award: Waseca Public Library and Friends of the Waseca Public Library 
   
Exchange Club Book of Golden Deeds Award: Duane Rathmann
