<TEXT type="str">About Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones  
Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones (1899–1981) has been described as &quot;a great pillar of the 20th century Evangelical Church&quot;. Born in Wales, and educated in London, he was a brilliant student who embarked upon a short, but successful, career as a medical doctor at the famous St Bartholemew&apos;s Hospital. However, the call of Gospel ministry was so strong that he left medicine in order to become minister of a mission hall in Port Talbot, South Wales. Eventually he was called to Westminster Chapel in London, where thousands flocked to hear his &quot;full-blooded&quot; Gospel preaching, described by one hearer as &quot;logic on fire&quot;. With some 1600 of his sermons recorded and digitally restored, this has left a legacy which is now available for the blessing of another generation of Christians around the world — &quot;Though being dead he still speaks&quot;.</TEXT>
