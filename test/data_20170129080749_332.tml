<TEXT type="str">British prime ministers have become accustomed to being the junior partner in relationships with US presidents and this was clearly underlined once again at Donald Trump&apos;s press conference alongside Theresa May on Friday. I thought that the president was both rude and rather indifferent to his British guest. When asked her opinion about the US spat with Mexico, Trump said &quot;the British prime minister has bigger thinks to worry about.&quot;. This may be the case but it is for Theresa May to say and not him. When a British reporter picked by May asked a perfectly legitimate question which may not have been to Trump&apos;s liking, he replied: &quot;Well, there goes that relationship.&quot; 

Trump backed Britain on Brexit but he has his own agenda: he is no fan of the European Union. There was no word on the trade deal which Britain so desperately needs and perhaps too much emphasis on Winston Churchill. I thought, though, that May was excellent. She is not a great orator but she certainly got the exposure she needed. So what of the special relationship? I was hoping that May was going to burst into that now famous speech by Hugh Grant in Love Actually : &quot;We may be a small country but we’re a great one, too. The country of Shakespeare, Churchill, the Beatles, Sean Connery, Harry Potter, David Beckham’s right foot, David Beckham’s left foot, come to that. And a friend who bullies us is no longer a friend. And since bullies only respond to strength, from now onward I will be prepared to be much stronger. And the president should be prepared for that.&quot; 

But no, May was polite and said little. There is no doubt that Trump is a bully and I can see May being strong when required. But I doubt that this relationship is going to be special. A marriage of convenience after a divorce from a long relationship with Europe, I think is the case.</TEXT>
