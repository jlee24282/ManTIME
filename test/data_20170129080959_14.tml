WELLINGTON, New Zealand — Canada finished fourth in the Wellington Sevens after a 28-22 loss to Scotland in the bronze-medal match on Sunday. 
 
Earlier in the day, Canada had beaten Argentina 17-12 to advance to the semifinals where they were beaten by South Africa 21-5. 
 
It was Canada&apos;s first cup semifinal since the 2015 Japan Sevens. Canada had gone 3-0 on Day 1 of the Wellington Sevens. 
 
Adam Zaruba had three tries in the bronze-medal match against Scotland. 
 
An exciting first half saw the sides alternate tries as Zaruba (2) touched down for Canada while James Fleming and George Horne had Scotland&apos;s tries, who took a 14-12 edge into the break. 
 
Fleming added his name to the scoresheet to open the second half but Canada came flying back as Zaruba completed his hat-trick to cut the Scottish lead to 21-17. 
 
Canada would regain the lead with a little over a minute left as Isaac Kaay scored his first World Rugby Sevens Series try but Fleming stole victory with a try 20 seconds from the end giving Scotland the bronze medal.
