<TITLE>Preview: Egypt v Morocco</TITLE>
<TEXT>The seaport city of Port Gentil will explode in excitement tonight with a North African derby pitting Egypt and Morocco against each other for a place in the 2017 African Nations Cup semi-finals.

Stade Port Gentil is the venue for this contest, with kick-off at 21h00 SA time and live on SuperSport 4.

While the Pharaohs have been crowned continental champions in their last three successive appearances at the showpiece - 2006, 2008 and 2010 - and hold the overall record of most AFCON titles with seven, they have not won against Morocco since 1986.

Head coach Hector Cuper is now tasked with bringing an end to their wait for victory over the Atlas Lions, although his side will have to deal with the deplorable pitch in this awkward seaport city, which remains largely disconnected from the rest of the country as its remote forests and wetlands mean the venue is only reachable by a 25 minute flight from Libreville.

As usual, the pressure is on for the Egyptians, who have now gone 22 AFCON games without defeat.

Mohamed Salah must stand up again like he has done so far in Gabon, having been involved in both of the goals scored in their two group-stage wins - 1-0 victories over Ghana and Uganda - while Arsenal midfielder Mohamed Elneny should still conduct the orchestra from midfield.

Trouble for the Pharaohs, though, is that this is an Atlas Lions squad led by no average coach.

Herve Renard has already twice lifted this trophy with two different countries, Zambia in 2012 and Ivory Coast three years later, and has only lost twice in his last 22 Nations Cup games.

He knows all too well how to get the job done, and has Deportivo La Corunas Faycal Fajr to carry the weight for him.

Any North African derby is sure to provide thrills, and Sunday evenings clash between Morocco and Egypt should be no different.

The Pharaohs are back in the tournament after missing out on the last three editions, mainly due to the political instability in the country, and will be looking to return with a bang.

The Egyptians understand tournament football and know how to play for a result, which is why they have been so frugal at the back, where they are the only team to emerge from this years group stages without conceding.

They have also made the most appearances at the AFCON finals, having missed just nine of the 31 editions that have been played to date, and have scored 156 goals in the 93 tournament games that they have played to date.
