Aerosmith Star Not Sure Of Reason For &apos;Farewell&apos; Tour was a Top 3 story on Thursday: Aerosmith star Brad Whitford says in a new interview that he is not really sure why the veteran band has decided to embark on what is being billed as a farewell tour. 
 
Whitford was asked by NME about the reasoning behind a farewell tour and he responded, &quot;Oh gosh, I&apos;m not really sure. I don&apos;t know, I think it was a general business decision, between the promoters to the management to the band. 
 
&quot;I don&apos;t actually feel like we&apos;re gonna be shutting the whole thing down at the end of it, but I think there&apos;s a lot more life in the band. But, I guess you&apos;ve got to start somewhere. So, we&apos;re just starting to put the farewell label on things.&quot; - here.
