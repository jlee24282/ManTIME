<TITLE>Out-of-state banks face big challenge trying to crack N.C. marketplace</TITLE>
<TEXT>Two out-of-state regional banks are preparing for perhaps their biggest marketing and growth challenge  attracting and keeping North Carolina banking customers. 
   
F.N.B. Corp of Pittsburgh is in the final steps of closing on its $1.4 billion deal for Yadkin Financial Corp., which was founded in Elkin and is now based in Raleigh. Yadkin is the states seventh largest bank in terms of deposits at $5.3 billion. 
   
Meanwhile, on Jan. 22, Pinnacle Financial Partners Inc. of Nashville, Tenn., launched its bid to gain regulatory and shareholders approval for its $1.9 billion offer for BNC Bancorp of High Point, which is 10th in N.C. deposits at nearly $4 billion. The deal is projected to close in the third quarter. 
   
Vincent Delie Jr., president and chief executive of F.N.B., said gaining Yadkins market share and 98 branches convinced him to leapfrog over Virginia into the nations ninth largest state. 
   
Terry Turner, Pinnacles president and chief executive, said taking over BNCs 75 branches in the Carolinas and Virginia positions his bank to be a strong Southeast regional bank. 
   
If those deals are completed, out-of-state banks would represent six of the top-10 banks in North Carolina as measured by deposits. 
   
However, the reality that F.N.B. and Pinnacle face is that all of their predecessors in buying N.C.-based banks have struggled to gain or maintain market share and deposits beyond what they bought. Thats based on reviewing annual North Carolina deposits data from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. 
   
Over the past 12 years, those banks include: Wells Fargo & Co. (San Francisco); SunTrust Banks Inc. (Atlanta); PNC Financial Services Group Inc. (Pittsburgh); Fifth Third Bancorp (Cincinnati); Pacific Western Bancorp (Los Angeles); Capital Bank Financial Corp. (Miami, now Charlotte); Bank of the Ozarks Inc. (Little Rock, Ark.); and First Horizon National Corp. (Memphis). 
   
In some instances, lost deposits and market share came from removing headquarters deposits from the bank they bought, such as Wells Fargo with Wachovia Corp., SunTrust with National Commerce Bancorps Central Carolina Bank subsidiary, Fifth Third with First Charter Bank, and PNC Financial with RBC Bank of Raleigh. 
   
For example, Wells Fargo gained in late 2008 Wachovias top deposits market share of $111 billion. Since then, Wells Fargos N.C. deposits have ranged from $51 billion to $60 billion. Wells Fargo slipped to third behind BB&T Corp. in the 2016 FDIC data report. 
  
 Opportunity  
  
Tony Plath, a finance professor at UNC Charlotte, said the soaring economic growth in Charlotte and the Triangle, coupled with steady growth in the Triad, is too good of an opportunity for the out-of-state banks to pass up. 
   
Were simply running out of banks here in North Carolina in the mad rush to consolidate these things into bigger, and not-necessarily-better, regional franchises, Plath said. 
   
Yadkin Financial, NewBridge Bancorp and BNC, found it necessary to attract private-equity ownership during the 2007-11 financial crisis. 
   
With that funding in hand, the banks were able to employ a growth-by-acquisition strategy over the past five years. Between the three of them, they bought a combined 19 community banks, the majority in N.C. 
   
Its all about putting a shine on the business to make it more marketable, and then taking advantage of the relative attractiveness of the N.C. market to sell these banks to out-of-state banks that operate in less attractive markets, such as Pennsylvania and Tennessee, Plath said. 
  
 A new trend  
  
The out-of-state buying trend runs counter to what had been the pattern of N.C.-based banks being preferred acquirers in Southeast markets. 
   
Bank of America Corp. is the top bank in Florida and Maryland, and second in South Carolina, while BB&T is first in West Virginia, second in Kentucky and third in South Carolina. 
   
Of BNCs $7.4 billion in assets, $4.7 billion were bought or acquired since 2009, including taking over five South Carolina banks and one Virginia bank. 
   
Were used to having a solid number of strong homegrown community, regional and national banks in North Carolina, said Peter Gwaltney, president of the N.C. Bankers Association. So when you see this many go away in recent years, it doesnt feel good and its not what we would prefer. 
   
However, Gwaltney said its not surprising that North Carolina would experience the loss of banking headquarters as part of the consolidation trend. 
  
 Starting anew  
  
Both Gwaltney and Plath said that while they are hopeful that there are investors willing and able to begin another round of startup banks to replace those being bought, they said the cost is getting nearly prohibitive in the current regulatory environment. 
   
The motivation for startup banks tends to come from three sources: high-level executives at major banks wanting to run their own bank before they retire; investors hoping for a cash cow in five to seven years; and industry officials certain they can mine a particular market niche. 
   
When TriStone Community Bank debuted in 2004 in Winston-Salem, it had raised $16.5 million through a public stock offering of $11 a share. 
   
By comparison, analysts said a startup bank now likely would be required to raise $25 million to $30 million to get state regulators approval. 
   
The startup business model just isnt viable in a post-Dodd-Frank regulatory environment where banks are limited in the number of commercial real-estate loans they can make, Plath said. 
   
Still, Plath said he could see North Carolina gaining one or two startup banks in the next year or two, more likely in Charlotte and the Triangle. 
   
We need stronger loan demand before were going to see any new banks, and interest rates get back to a more normal level where banks can actually make a few bucks through lending, Plath said.</TEXT>
