<content type="str">BOULDER, Colo. — Derrick White scored 17 of his 23 points in the second half, keying Colorado’s 74-65 upset of No. 10 Oregon that snapped the Ducks’ 17-game winning streak on Saturday night. 
 
Xavier Johnson added 13 points as the Buffaloes (12-10, 2-7 Pac-12) kept the Ducks winless in seven trips all-time in Boulder. 
 
Payton Pritchard’s 19 points led the Ducks (19-3, 8-1), who lost for the first time since Nov. 21 against Georgetown. 
 
White had a pair of 3-pointers early in the second half that put the Buffaloes ahead 45-39 while Colorado’s stifling defense was keeping the Ducks out of rhythm at the other end of the court. And he had a 3-pointer, a three-point play and two free throws in an 11-1 run that gave Colorado a 64-52 lead. 
 
The Buffs are just the third team to top 70 points against the Oregon this season. 
 
The Ducks trailed 35-34 at halftime, just the fourth time they’ve trailed at the break this season. All the other times came back in November, in losses to Baylor and Georgetown and in an overtime win against Boise State. 
 
BIG PICTURE 
 
Oregon: Unable to shake off their dry spells, the Ducks failed to close out a perfect January to go with their perfect December and in doing so probably blew a chance to rise in the rankings. 
 
Colorado: After snapping their seven-game skid — their longest of the Tad Boyle era — with an 85-78 win over Oregon State, the Buffs played an inspired game that left the Pac-12 with just one unbeaten team in league play: Arizona. 
 
Rams edge San Diego State 
 
Gian Clavell scored a career-high 37 points and made a driving layup with 3.8 seconds remaining to lift Colorado State past San Diego State, 78-77, on Saturday. 
 
Trey Kell sank two free throws with 11 seconds left to give the Aztecs the lead before Clavell drove through traffic for the game-winner. Jeremy Hemsley immediately took the inbounds pass and his 3-point attempt from the top of the arc hit the back of the rim at the buzzer. 
 
Malik Pope scored 19 points and Hemsley added 17 to pace San Diego State, which missed its final four field goals over the last 3:11. 
 
Colorado State (14-8, 6-3 Mountain West) erased a 13-point second-half deficit in winning its third straight game. Emmanuel Omogbo added a career-best 24 points for the Rams. 
 
The Aztecs (11-9, 3-5) saw their 13-game home winning streak against Colorado State snapped.</content>
