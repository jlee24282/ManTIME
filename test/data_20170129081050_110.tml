A-League side Perth Glory will play host to English Premier League giants Chelsea in a friendly to mark the opening of Perth&apos;s new multi-purpose venue next yar.

It will be the second time the Blues have toured Australia in three years, the then Jose Mourinho-coached Chelsea having travelled to NSW to play Sydney in a friendly in 2015 in front of 83,598 fans at the ANZ Stadium. Chelsea won that game 1-0.

Tourism WA and the new stadium operator, VenuesLive, have put the Glory deal together, with the WA Government claiming that the London club, who are favourites to win this year&apos;s Premier League title, will attract huge crowds from not just the rest of Australia but also Asia.

&quot;This is an enormous opportunity for not only football fans, but sport fans in general, from around the nation and the Asia-Pacific region, to witness one of the best and biggest clubs in the world to play in our own backyard,&quot; Glory CEO Peter Filopoulos said.

&quot;This will not only help grow and foster football in Western Australia but will expose Perth Glory&apos;s brand to a new market and millions of viewers.

&quot;This will be Chelsea&apos;s only match in Australia during the A-League pre-season campaign and will play an important role in Perth Glory&apos;s preparations for the 2018/19 season.&quot;

WA Premier and Tourism Minister Colin Barnett made the announcement at the new Perth Stadium in Burswood and said the presence of a team like Chelsea would draw fans from Singapore, Malaysia and China as well as Australian soccer supporters.

He predicted 15,000 interstate and overseas visitors and said that could generate around $15 million for the WA tourism industry.

Glory&apos;s next assignment is rather more mundane, as, having lost at the weekend to the A-League&apos;s bottom team, Central Coast, they now return to their nib Stadium next Saturday night to host the Newcastle Jets. The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.</content>
