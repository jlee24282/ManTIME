<TEXT type="str">POCATELLO — A lost mountain lion kitten will soon be reunited with her mother and siblings after more than a week apart thanks to the Idaho Department of Fish and Game, a hound and a little patience. 
   
Fish and Game became aware of the mountain lion family — located in the Johnny Creek area of Pocatello — last week after mama mountain lion, and what was originally thought to be just three kittens, were taking advantage of the urban deer and other wildlife living in the area. They were using peoples’ yards as their personal pantry for caching their kills. 
   
“What made this situation unusual wasn’t that we had mountain lions coming down into the foothills, because we’ve had this going on for a number of years,” said Jennifer Jackson, regional conservation educator for the Idaho Department of Fish and Game. “What was unusual was this mother mountain lion had multiple kittens with her and they were truly setting up a household.”

Jackson added that these caching behaviors are much different than the animals simply traveling through. And because of these factors, removing and transporting the female and her other three kittens to suitable and more remote habitat occurred on the afternoon of Jan. 20. 
   
“We wanted to put her in a place where she could still take care of her kids but not be in any conflicts with people,” Jackson said. 
   
However, Fish and Game received a report on Jan. 25, that a mountain lion kitten was spotted in the same area of the previous captures. It was apparent that this kitten was part of the same family, so attempts were made to capture the young cat using a hound and dog handler. 
   
It was successfully treed by Wednesday afternoon, but not in a location that allowed for safe retrieval. 
   
The risks to the kitten and staff were too great. 
   
By 8 p.m. that evening, the kitten was still treed when Fish and Game personnel placed parts of a road-killed deer down the hill from the tree. Personnel hoped that when the kitten came down during the night, it would stop to feed and then leave tracks for Fish and Game to follow. 
   
The little mountain lion cub did just that. 
   
The next morning, Fish and Game, with help from the hound and dog handler, tracked the paw prints left in the snow from the food site to the original residence where the mountain lion family was first observed the week before. 
   
The kitten was sheltered under the same part of the home’s deck where its mom and siblings had been at one time. A catch pole was used to remove the kitten from under the deck before placing it in a crate. 
   
Fish and Game intends to reunite the lost kitten with its family, as soon as their locations are pinpointed. The mother cat is wearing a radio collar, but Fish and Game has not received a recent signal. 
   
“The kitten’s best chance of survival is to release it as close to mom as possible,” Jackson said. “It would be difficult for the young cat to live on its own and feed itself with the kind of harsh winter we are having.” 
   
Jackson added that it’s likely the animals ended up where they did because mountain lions and other predatory animals follow their food. 
   
“In the wintertime, deer move down to escape deep snow or colder temperatures so it only makes sense that their predators will also move down,” she said. “Keep in mind, though, we always have an urban population of deer living in the Johnny Creek area. That’s one reason why we ask people to please not feed the deer that live in their backyards. Not only do they not need it, but you can also create a situation where you can draw predators down into the neighborhood.” 
   
This year in particular, with Pocatello’s deep snow and the extreme weather, Jackson said people are certainly going to see more of the wild deer, elk and other animals moving down, and with them come the predators. 
   
Mountain lions are usually very secretive and wary and their usual response around people or a perceived danger is to run. If they have kittens, they often stash them, and then take off to draw the danger away from their young, according to Jackson. 
   
“Attacks on humans by mountain lions are very rare,” she said. “And we aren’t aware of any attacks from mountain lions on humans that are of a defensive nature — whereas we certainly can cite several examples of attacks by bears and moose defending young. That being said, it makes sense that if a mother mountain lion was cornered with her young with no escape route she might attack.” 
   
She continued, “As a reminder, this mother cat was behaving just as a mountain lion should. Her behavior was not abnormal. She was hunting deer, caching her kills and taking care of her kittens, but doing so right on top of people. It is for that reason she was moved with her kittens to a more suitable and more remote habitat.”</TEXT>
