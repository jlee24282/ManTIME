<content type="str">Warder - Ethiopia is struggling to counter a new drought in its east that authorities say has left 5.6 million people in urgent need of assistance. 
 
The UN humanitarian chief Stephen O&apos;Brien visited the remote region on Saturday, saying that &quot;these people are really struggling to survive.&quot; He cautioned, however, against &quot;dramatising by saying this may degenerate into famine.&quot; 
 
Last year&apos;s drought left 10.2 million people hungry and killed several hundred thousand of the animals that the local pastoralists depend on for their livelihood. 
 
For this drought, Ethiopia&apos;s government is appealing for $948m from the international community. The country&apos;s disaster prevention chief, Mitiku Kassa, says the government has allocated than $47m. 
     
The charity Save the Children warns that malnourished refugees are arriving from neighboring Somalia as well, compounding the crisis.</content>
