<TEXT type="str">The Australian Rugby Union has promised to &quot;strike a better balance&quot; on match scheduling at next year&apos;s Sydney Sevens after it emerged the Olympic champion women would play their quarter-final on a training field outside Allianz Stadium to make way for the men&apos;s group stages. 

The ARU and World Rugby blamed &quot;contractual commitments&quot; for the embarrassing scenario, , with enough room to accommodate about 1000 spectators, across the road from the 45,000 capacity stadium. 

The women will play all of their group matches on the main pitch during day one of the tournament on Friday, but Australia&apos;s golden girls, who were honoured with Order of Australia Medals last Thursday, will play their first knock-out game on Kippax Oval across the road while the men&apos;s tournament wades through their opening rounds.

It is a bad look for the ARU, which has leveraged heavily the women&apos;s success at the Rio Olympics to sell tickets to the first combined men&apos;s and women&apos;s Sydney Sevens. While sales to the women&apos;s-only Friday session have been slow, Saturday – the only combined day – has sold out and the all-men&apos;s Sunday has all but done the same. 

Should they make it through the quarters, the Australian women will play their semi-final at Allianz just after 2pm. The final and third and fifth-place matches will also be on the main arena.

&quot;There are scheduling challenges associated with hosting two tournaments simultaneously, which will happen for the first time at this year&apos;s Sydney Sevens,&quot; an ARU spokesman said. 

&quot;While it was not possible to strike a better balance this year owing to player welfare and contractual commitments, we will be discussing with all parties to see how the schedule can be enhanced next year.&quot;

World Rugby made a similar pledge, citing the same contractual obligations. World Rugby controls all sevens world series tournament scheduling, but it is not clear why the ARU did not make greater efforts to request moving some men&apos;s pool matches to Kippax instead to ensure maximum exposure for their high-profile and highly-successful women&apos;s team.

&quot;The marquee women&apos;s matches, the cup semi-finals and final, will be played on Allianz Stadium on Saturday and every effort has been made to ensure that a world-class playing surface and match environment is provided on Kippax Oval for the 10 matches that will be staged there,&quot; the spokesman said.

&quot;The Australian women&apos;s sevens team will take centre stage when the tournament kicks off on Friday at Allianz Stadium.&quot;</TEXT>
