<TITLE>Cohasset boys basketball downed 69-62 by Mashpee in 2 OT</TITLE>
<TEXT>The Cohasset boys basketball team may not have won the game, but gave visiting Mashpee a tremendous battle in a 69-62 loss Saturday Jan. 28 at Cohasset High School. 
 
In a battle of two of the top teams in the South Shore League Tobin Division, it was no surprise that the game would be a tight battle, even if the last meeting wasnt. 
 
Two weeks ago, Mashpee beat Cohasset 59-34 at Mashpee, but the Skippers played that game without leading scorer Chase Bomeisler, and had a 27-22 halftime lead before the Falcons outscored Cohasset 27-2 in the third quarter on the way to the win. 
 
This time, Bomeisler was back and Cohasset was on a four-game win streak heading into the game. 
 
The game did not disappoint. 
 
The Skippers gave Mashpee everything it had, but in the end, a few mistakes, misses and even a bit of luck going the other way were the difference. 
 
The biggest misses were on the free throw line when Cohasset had two shots in a tie game with 7 second to play in regulation. 
 
Both shots missed, sending the game to overtime. 
 
In the first overtime, the Skippers had the ball with 10 seconds to play, but werent able to score, forcing a second overtime, where Mashpee took control. 
 
Still, getting to the first overtime was impressive, with Cohasset coming back from a five-point deficit keyed by a three-pointer from Thatcher Stone and a turnaround jumper from Bomeisler (off a beautiful pass inside from Sam Lelio) in the closing minute to force the tie. 
 
Stone had a big game, scoring a team-high 23 points, including five three-pointers, while Bomeisler added a solid 21 points with 12 rebounds. 
 
Liam OConnell had 9 pts and Lelio had 7 points 
 
I told my team They all received A + for effort and passion and competiveness but our offense on special situation plays was not honor roll material, Cohasset coach Bo Ruggiero said. Terrific game to take Mashpee to double overtime after getting destroyed in our first game early in the season shows the tremendous improvement the team has made with the way they are approaching practice sessions getting bettereach day, but we need to learn to execute in close games if we are going to be considered an Elite team. 
 
Going back to some of the luck, in the closing seconds of the first quarter, Stone hit a three-pointer to tie the game 15-15 with two seconds on the clock, but Mashpee tossed up a bomb that dropped from about three-quarter court for an 18-15 lead. 
 
It wasnt all luck though, as Mashpees Devan Ford had a game high 32 points to lead all scorers. 
 
For Cohasset, the game is already just a memory. 
 
We are already on to Norwell, Ruggiero said. This game is over. Tough loss, but its unique about basketball. We play on Tuesday and will need to regroup. I am looking forward as they are to improving reach day.</TEXT>
