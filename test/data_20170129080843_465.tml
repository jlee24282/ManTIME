Carl Frampton has called on Leo Santa Cruz to complete the trilogy with a final showdown in Belfast after losing his WBA featherweight title in Las Vegas. Frampton was beaten for the first time in his career on a majority points decision at the MGM Grand as Santa Cruz regained the belt he lost to the Northern Irishman in July. Santa Cruz is open to the idea of a decider and Frampton wants the fight in his backyard.

&quot;I hope so, I hope he is a man of his word and we can do it in Belfast,&quot; he said on Sky Sports 1. &quot;I have come to the States twice. We could do it four, five, six times. I hope we do it again. &quot;I am deeply disappointed but let&apos;s have a trilogy and have our names linked together forever and hopefully I can win 2-1.&quot;

One judge scored the contest at 114-114, but the other two gave it 115-113 in Santa Cruz&apos;s favour and the Mexican took a deserved victory. It was a smart performance by Santa Cruz, who improved immeasurably from the first bout in New York last summer, and his tactics shocked Frampton.

&quot;I think it was the right decision, I thought it was close,&quot; the Northern Irishman added. &quot;He frustrated me at times, I didn&apos;t expect that game plan, the boxer got out-boxed by the brawler. I thought it was the right decision, I hope we can do it again, it was a close fight. &quot;I have got no excuses, I feel I want to say sorry, I feel like I have let everyone down. The best man won on the night. I am gutted. It was my fault.&quot;

Santa Cruz admits he had to fight against his instinct as well as Frampton. &quot;I worked hard and did what I had t,&quot; he said. &quot;I fought a great fighter and let&apos;s make a third fight. He is a great fighter and a great counter-puncher. It was tough to change my style, in my head I wanted to go for it, but I was told to box him and that&apos;s what I did.

&quot;I am a man of my word. We are both great fighters, we deserve it and let&apos;s go again.&quot;</content>
