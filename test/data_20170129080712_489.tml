<TITLE>WW3 - The World At War - A Full List Of Countries Involved In Syrian Conflict Plus Other Boiling Points Of 2015</TITLE>
<TEXT>This is typically famous for everyone, especially the story about the nuclear confrontation taking place in the Middle East. Actually, following the predictions of Nostradamus, one assumedly major nuclear confrontation will possibly happen in the area in which the aggressor is the one breaking the promise of not using the nuclear weapons or its violent power in any warfare. The sad tidings here would be how the naval fleets would go kept by other powers, and then they could get scattered due to the violence of the powerful blast.

During the course of 2014 to present day 2015 we have seen a huge up-tick in global military action, in some countries we have even seen military personnel on the streets and in the homes and businesses of the people who they are paid to protect. We have seen global governments pushing and prodding each other into position of war via proxy wars, economic wars, as the war on humanity is what takes centre stage Enchanted LifePath Alternate Media Reports takes a closer look at exactly what countries are invoked in military procedures at home or abroad throughout the world.

LETS LOOK AT THE BIG PICTURE IN MORE DETAIL

With the world inching closer to war, many historians, Biblical scholars and fans of Nostradamus are pointing to the current Middle East conflict between Israel and Iran. Global alliances could quickly turn a 2-nation war into a regional war, and then into a world war. How would the US fair and who would be on our side? We divided the world based on current alliances to see how the two sides match up and who has the edge.

The following battle lines were researched and chosen exclusively by Whiteout Press. We used a number of criteria to make our decision for each nation. Among the items we considered were; current military alliances, religious affiliations, historical alliances, ethnic ties, trade relations and statements by national leaders right out of todays headlines.

Judaism vs. Islam, Christian civil war

As the world map is laid out, one of the trends we immediately notice is that the former Soviet nations and their Eastern Orthodox Christian faith will follow-up on their current promise and come to the aid of their Islamic allies in any war against the United States. With the Soviets come the global Communists, including some right in Americas backyard.

The Neutrals

It is inevitable that many nations will attempt to remain neutral. But in the global world we live in, there is no such thing as neutrality. Nations that cant fight for or buy their neutrality, like India and Switzerland, will simply be used like pawns in a chess game by the worlds superpowers. We did take history into account and countries like Nepal, Nigeria and Sweden who have always fought for and won their neutrality during regional wars are labeled as neutral again here.

Other neutral countries are marked that way for a different reason. Some countries around the globe are so devastated and disoriented by current civil wars, they have no functioning government able to take any side. Some might conclude that a few of these civil wars are the first wave of the possible coming World War 3. In many instances, the wars are between militant Christians and Islamic Jihadists.

The numbers and statistics

Weve left out nuclear weapons capabilities, as well as chemical and biological weapons. Nations dont typically disclose their actual arsenal and half the nuclear-armed countries still dont acknowledge they have the weapons of mass destruction. Another reason to leave them off the list is pure wishful thinking. For if World War 3 is in fact a nuclear war instead of a conventional war, there will be nobody left to read these words anyway.

In the cases of some small nations without any military or published information, we had to make our best guess. Most all statistics however come from each respective nations published data or one of the following sources</TEXT>
