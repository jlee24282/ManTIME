<content type="str">It’s time for the big presentation at work. Or maybe you’re trying to nail that important client. Hey, you could even be trying to impress a significant other’s parents. Regardless, you need a new suit or, at the very least, a new sportcoat. 
 
But not just any suit. You need a custom suit — you’re trying to blow them away, right? But this is a new experience. Where do you start? 
 
B.spoke  clothier and stylist Paige Hutt has tips to help you craft the perfect suit  — and take care of it. Hutt works exclusively with men, but the advice is also solid for women considering custom threads. 
 
Go for the classic 
 
These days shorter pants and skinny lapels are all the rage but for how long? Hutt said she warns clients that going trendy means they may be investing $2,000 in a suit that looks dated after a year or two. At the end of the day, the best bet is a classic cut. 
 
Build your basics 
 
Although flamboyant prints can be exciting, Hutt said it’s good to start with a good baseline color. She recommended medium gray, charcoal or navy. 
 
Do a little advance research 
 
It’s helpful if clients walk in know what they’re looking for. The main question you need to be able to answer: What are you dressing for? A wedding, honeymoon, new job? Knowing this helps a clothier make a suit that fits your needs. 
 
Don’t dry clean too often 
 
If you send your suit off to the dry cleaner every month you risk breaking down the fabric’s fibers, Hutt said. She recommends dry cleaning only when something is spilled on it, perhaps three or four times a year. Instead, press the suit to give it the crisp look without the harshness of dry cleaning. 
 
Invest in a good hanger 
 
A nice jacket needs a good quality hanger that will support the shoulders.</content>
