<content type="str">A Plea for Constant Motion , the second collection of short stories from Ottawa writer Paul Carlucci, opens with “My New Best Friend in Exile”. The story seems, initially, to be one of connection, of a loner, Wes, a former high school art teacher forced out of his job and trying, unsuccessfully, to build a life in the city. Despite the ghosts of the past hanging over him, his neighbour Randy seems to be a steadying influence, perhaps even a friend. They work together, building a new porch for Wes’s house, and drink together once construction is done, “lounging like gods after a long epic act of creation.” 
 
Wes reflects on his neighbour: “I liked Randy’s thoughtful nature. I liked to imagine him shrunk down to adolescence, his brawny arms across the desks of one of my art classes, a bad kid in some people’s eyes, but not in mine.” As the story twists to a close, though, it becomes clear that Randy is, in fact, bad (this is a crushing understatement), a truth which Wes remains somehow unable to fully see. 
 
It’s a shocking and haunting story and in many ways “My New Best Friend in Exile” is characteristic of the collection as a whole. These are stories of heartbreak and betrayal, of limited vision and wilful blindness, stories laced with booze, drugs, sex, secrets and unemployment, with casual (and caustic) misogyny, racism, classism and violence. The stories are, as a rule, devoid of outer commentary or narrative distancing, forcing the reader to confront and reconcile the often disturbing mindsets and occurrences which mark the work. 
 
It doesn’t make for easy reading, but A Plea for Constant Motion has an air of urgency to it, a sense of relevance which is at once odd for a collection of short stories and disturbing in and of itself. 
 
Carlucci, whose first collection The Secret Life of Fission was awarded the Danuta Gleed Award, writes beautifully of ugliness, immersing the reader in the minds and hearts of characters most of us would like to avoid, or, more critically, would prefer to believe didn’t exist. It’s a perfect collection for a world which confronts us with increasing violence and ugliness every day.
