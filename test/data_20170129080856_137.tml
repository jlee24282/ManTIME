<TEXT type="str">Johannesburg - Uganda coach Milutin Micho Sredojevic could be coming to our shores soon. 
 
Sredojevic could be heading to his former club Orlando Pirates or Bafana Bafana. 
 
City Press has learnt that Sredojevic has received several offers from national teams and clubs, including PSL sides. 
 
“Uganda and seven different countries and clubs are chasing my services,” said Sredojevic. 
 
When asked about the possibility of rejoining Pirates he said: “I don’t know where that comes from, nobody approached me.” 
 
He said he was still cooling off before deciding on his next move. 
 
“My mind will go somewhere with [the] right football project. My second homecoming to South Africa must be properly done.” 
 
The Serb, who recently guided the Cranes in the Africa Cup of Nations in Gabon where they were the first side to be eliminated in the group stages, has unfinished business in the country. 
 
He left Orlando Pirates in a huff in 2006 and was replaced by the late Bibey Mutombo. 
 
But Sredojevic has since grown in stature, taking Uganda to the Africa Cup of Nations finals after 38 years. 
 
Others who are on Safa’s radar include Frenchman Hervé Renard, Carlos Queiroz and Gavin Hunt. 
 
Meanwhile, after losing the services of Keagan Dolly to French side Montpellier HSC, Mamelodi Sundowns could unveil Farès Hachi this week. On Friday Montpellier officially announced the arrival of Dolly after his R25 million deal was completed. 
 
A top Sundowns official said coach Pitso Mosimane was impressed with the 27-year-old Algeria left back, who is on the books of ES Sétif. 
 
Hachi is likely to be signed before the close of the transfer window period on Tuesday.</TEXT>
