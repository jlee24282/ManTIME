The veteran actress was nominated alongside big-name stars like Jessica Chastain , Jennifer Lawrence , Naomi Watts and Quvenzhane Wallis for her riveting turn in 2012’s Amour , which she described to The Guardian in 2012 as a “wonderful, marvelous, extraordinary gift.” Amour  followed the story of an elderly couple facing the reality of aging and death, a fitting cap on her impressive body of work.

Riva got her start in 1959’s Hiroshima Mon Amour , about a failing romance between a French actor and a Japanese architect. The film was directed by Alain Resnais and has long been considered one of the most important films in modern cinema.
