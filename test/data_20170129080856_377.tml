The veteran actress was nominated alongside big-name stars like Jessica Chastain , Jennifer Lawrence , Naomi Watts and Quvenzhane Wallis for her riveting turn in 2012s Amour , which she described to The Guardian in 2012 as a wonderful, marvelous, extraordinary gift. Amour followed the story of an elderly couple facing the reality of aging and death, a fitting cap on her impressive body of work.
