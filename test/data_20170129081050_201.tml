Online PR News – 29-January-2017 – Culver City CA – New York, NY - Enplug and FunWall today announced a partnership to bring FunWall&apos;s proprietary mobile social gaming platform to Enplug&apos;s class leading digital display technology. This partnership will instantly give Enplug&apos;s network the ability to participate in multiplayer tournaments with other gamers in any public location. To participate, the only thing the consumer needs to bring is their mobile phone. 
 
Enplug&apos;s next generation digital displays are in popular social venues including restaurants, bars, gyms, retail stores, cafes, shopping malls, and office buildings, transforming today&apos;s digital displays from one-way communication channels to intelligent, two-way communication platforms. 
 
Enplug will be the first distributed digital display network able to offer social mobile gaming at every one of their managed locations. 
 
&quot;Enplug is always pushing the boundaries of what&apos;s possible with digital displays in public spaces. We&apos;re excited about FunWall&apos;s proven capabilities of bringing audience engagement to the next level,&quot; said Nanxi Liu, CEO of Enplug. 
 
The unique FunWall platform takes the buzz around eSports and places it at everyone&apos;s fingertips whenever and wherever they are. FunWall is the only way to turn your favorite mobile game into anything from a &quot;one on one&quot; challenge to &quot;playing the entire world&quot; in a global tournament. 
 
The ability to harness the ubiquity of mobile games provides social infrastructure owners (retailers, bars, restaurants, QSR&apos;s, malls and stadiums) with a radically new and powerful tool to influence both short-term behavior and to build long-term relationship with its consumers. Social mobile games provide the perfect vehicle to engage, entertain, capture and incentivize an audience. 
 
The FunWall platform also provides a vital link between cloud and place based gaming. Using the power of &quot;place&quot; to fill the cloud - then using the power of the &quot;cloud&quot; to populate the place. 
 
&quot;FunWall makes that vital audience connection by combining fun and incentive into the same experience. We identified Enplug to launch because of its ease of use and future-thinking product,&quot; said Steve Ridley, CEO of FunWall. Ridley was a founder and Global CEO of Kinetic Worldwide, the largest media company of its kind in the world. 
 
FunWall&apos;s unique platform will feature in the Enplug app store, making social mobile gaming at any location just a click away. 
 
This unique partnership builds on the Enplug and FunWall ability to transform the traditional one way push communication of digital displays into a dynamic positive two-way conversation with the consumer.
