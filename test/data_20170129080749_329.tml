<content type="str">A HANG glider who crashed into a hillside has been rescued by the Toowoomba-based RACQ LifeFlight Rescue crew.  
 
The woman, in her late 30s, had to be winched to safety by the crew following the incident in Numinbah Valley, in the Gold Coast Hinterland.  
 
The helicopter arrived about 12.40pm to perform the winch rescue which was in an inaccessible location.  
 
A critical care doctor and paramedic were lowered down into the bush, where the hang glider crashed, with a stretcher to retrieve her.  
 
The woman was treated for suspected spinal and minor head injuries and was airlifted to the Gold Coast University Hospital in a stable condition. </content>
