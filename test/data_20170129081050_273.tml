Authorities are appealing for help after a man&apos;s body was found in Nyah West, near the Murray River, on Sunday morning in what police believe was a hit-and-run accident.

Victoria Police spokeswoman Kelly Grindley said the man was yet to be formally identified.

&quot;A passer-by discovered the man&apos;s body on Nyah West Road, near the intersection with Matson Lane, about 4.30am,&quot;

&quot;It is believed he was run over by an unknown vehicle.&quot;

Ms Grindley said Major Collision Investigation Unit detectives were keen to speak to anyone who may have information about the man&apos;s death.

&quot;In particular [police] would like to speak to anyone who may have been driving in the area in the early hours of Sunday morning,&quot; she said.

The death brings the total number of lives lost on Victorian roads in 2017 to 18, two less than this time last year.

Anyone with information is urged to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or submit a confidential crime report at www.crimestoppersvic.com.au. The story first appeared on The Age.</content>
