<content type="str">Winter break is great. That is, until it&apos;s time to go back to school and you realize just how fucked up your sleep schedule, diet, drinking habits and priorities are. Can&apos;t we just hibernate until summer? Read below for 15 things that prove your priorities have  never  been more wrong. 
 

 1. You stay up until 2 a.m. each night  

 
…and wake up at 12 the next day. Brunch exists for a reason, right?  
 2. &quot;I&apos;m definitely not blacking out tonight.&quot;  

 
You&apos;re definitely blacking out tonight. 
 3. In theory, you want to eat healthy  

 
But in reality, ain&apos;t nobody got time for a diet! Bring on the pizza. 
 4. Your bar tabs are going up  
And your bank account is going down. 
 5. You can&apos;t even fake motivation for class at this point  

 
It&apos;s even a struggle to sit through class during syllabus week. 
 6. You peaked last year  

 
And you are now on a slow decline to total self-sabotage. 
 7. The Netflix binges are at an all-time high  

 
Don&apos;t blame us, though! There are too many good shows out there right now to resist.  
 8. Your roots are growing in and your ends are split  

 
&quot;Take me as I am or watch me as I go.&quot; 
 9. Taking L&apos;s doesn&apos;t even surprise you anymore  

 
Oh, I failed a test? Whatever. Oh, I got a flat tire? Whatever. Oh, the guy I like just ghosted me? What-fucking-ever. 
 10. Swimsuit season is coming up soon  

 
But dinner is even sooner. Pass us a buttered roll pls.  
 11. &quot;I&apos;m never drinking again.&quot;  

 
You tell yourself. Repeatedly. Only to drink again a few hours later. 
 12. You wait to schedule your classes until the last possible second  

 
*Two weeks into class* &quot;Did you make your schedule yet?&quot; &quot;Nah dude, I gotta go to advising tomorrow.&quot; 
 13. You barely even remember to take your birth control on time  

 
Seriously, it can&apos;t get much worse than this. 
 14. &quot;I&apos;ll try again next week...&quot;   
We doubt it. </content>
