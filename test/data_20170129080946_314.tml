<TITLE>Miners put away Herd</TITLE>
<TEXT>HUNTINGTON - UTEP had one of those nights, and so did the Marshall Thundering Herd. 
   
UTEP made 57.8 of its shots while Marshall had its poorest shooting night this season at 34.5 percent. Matt Willms of the Miners tossed in 25 points, the same as Terrence Thompson for Marshall, and the Miners rolled to a 91-68 men's basketball victory Saturday night before a Cam Henderson Center crowd of 6,781 spectators. 
   
Willms, a 7-foot-1 junior, sank 11 of his 15 shots and led UTEP (6-14 season, 4-4 Conference USA) to a whopping 60-32 advantage on points in the paint. UTEP also got backcourt scoring from guards Dominic Artis (24) and Omega Harris (13). Artis, a 6-3 senior, also had 11 rebounds. 
   
"They probably looked at our record and thought we stunk, which for the most part we have this year," said UTEP head coach Tim Floyd. 
   
Marshall's season win streak at home ended at 11 games. The Herd fell to a 13-9 season record and a 6-3 conference mark that is tied for third place with Louisiana Tech and Old Dominion. 
   
Thompson, a 6-7 junior, established career highs for points and rebounds with 10. Marshall forward Ryan Taylor scored 14 before fouling out with 5:36 left in the game and collected eight rebounds. Junior point guard Jon Elmore scored 11, grabbed five rebounds and delivered six assists. 
   
Senior guard Stevie Browning was 0-for-7 and scored his only three points at the foul line. 
   
The Herd's highlight was senior guard Austin Loop breaking the school career record for 3-point field goals. 
   
Loop tied Tamar Slay's record of 251 the first time he touched the basketball. He became the all-time leader with 252 with a shot from the top of the foul circle at 1:40 of the first half. A recorded video of Slay, who played from 1998 to 2002, was played on the big screen with him saying he was proud and happy for Loop. 
   
"It felt good at the time," said Loop, who scored seven and was 2-for-5 shooting 3-pointers. "It was a big relief off my shoulders. 
   
"Honestly, right now it's not on my mind." 
   
UTEP hit 60.6 percent of its field goals in the first half (20 of 33) and pulled away, 45-35. Willms had 12 points in the first six minutes. 
   
Some confusion arose late in the first half with UTEP leading, 39-26. Taylor took the ball inside and was knocked down by Kelvin Jones of the Miners. Taylor made two free throws on the foul and the referees came away from the play with a technical foul call against the Herd forward. Jake Flaggert shot for UTEP and also made two free throws. 
   
Marshall head coach Dan D'Antoni didn't like the call and argued. Before the teams returned to the court for the second half D'Antoni came out of the locker room before the players to continue making his point with the officials. 
   
Marshall, the nation's eighth-highest scoring team with 88 points a game, connected on 32.3 percent in the first half and 34.5 percent in the second period. The Herd made a season-low three 3-point baskets in 25 attempts for 12.0 percent, which was also a season low. 
   
"Obviously it wasn't a great shooting night for us," D'Antoni said. "We shot 12 percent from three, so all of you who say we shoot too many threes you have your ammo. I don't know what the deal was. I feel like we got the same kind of shots we've always gotten. 
   
"They made it tough on Loop, but a lot of that was with what we were doing with the pick-and-rolls trying to get to the rim." 
   
Thompson's free throws with 17:00 left to play pulled Marshall as close as 46-44. Thompson scored inside to keep the Herd within 52-49 with 14:28 to go, but UTEP reeled off the next 12 points to take a 64-49 with 11:19 remaining. UTEP stretched the margin to 25 points in the final minutes. 
   
With UTEP ahead, 48-44, with 16:03 left Paul Thomas of the Miners fouled out on a technical call that brought Floyd off the bench and out past half-court to protest. 
   
Marshall's next game is Thursday at Southern Miss (6-15, 3-6). UAB won at home Saturday against Southern Miss, 87-43.</TEXT>
