I&apos;m David McConaughey is what stranded now on WEEI. And WEEI. Dot com. The patriots travel to Houston on Monday for Super Bowl 51 a Stephen Gostkowski and innate Evan a ball returned to practice today at Gillette Stadium. The pats had perfect attendance at practice for the first time all week. The big game is one week from tomorrow the patriots are three point favorite over the Atlanta Falcons . And for those not in the Super Bowl approval kicks off tomorrow night at 8 o&apos;clock on ESPN. The Celtics won their second straight game last night crush in the Orlando Magic 128 and 98 at the TV got him. Isiah Thomas had a game high 21 points. Al Horford missed last nights game with a groin injury but he did travel with the team to Milwaukee where the seas will take on the box tonight at 8 o&apos;clock. The Bruins are off until Tuesday night thanks to NHL all star weekend this weekend in Los Angeles. Tonight is these skills competition at 7 o&apos;clock he also again is tomorrow. And the third round of the Farmers Insurance open is underway at Torrey Pines Patrick Rogers and Brandt Snedeker a tied for the lead at nine under. Tiger Woods did not make the cut. It is 39 degrees and cloudy in Boston clip tonight with a low of 320. And that&apos;s what struck enough. Rich ducks Bruins patriots Celtics. About them all yeah. Twin forces and the new England sports continues so it&apos;s getting going there. The card. Network. All of number two line here until 6 o&apos;clock and I&apos;m taking your phone calls. 61777979837. 61777979837. I do have the Farmers Insurance open. On the TV and brought me. And it is amazing to see some of the game is there early in the season that did not make the cut. Tiger Woods. Jason Day Dustin Johnson. Ricky followed but Tiger Woods is the guy that everybody&apos;s watching Macon is retarded he&apos;s shooting 76. So for all the pie yesterday. Odds union in the first on the first day on Thursday and yes they shot a 72. Nominee even 72 itself. A title would not make the cut that seems to be the biggest story line sulphide these Farmers Insurance open and fun to see him make the cut. And it up again his retirement. With an exciting tournament but that obviously is not the case. My attention. I&apos;m 110%. Though is on this show bubble a week from tomorrow. I&apos;ve the patriots when not in it you know that probably would not be the case and I was trying to think earlier while the pitcher Warren and miserable what would be. You know the top Boston sports story line today and I would think but caused the Bruins are at the break. You could do one of those win the Bruins stand at the all star break I&apos;d sorry I just. For the first half of the season or at least the free all star break. Version of the Boston Bruins. I just the way I would describe them. Tough to watch that&apos;s the way I would describe them. They went into the all star break on a high note put. Tough to watch the Celtics like and put &apos;cause. They blow all the Orlando Magic last night they had a huge win against the Houston Rockets before that after a brutal lots. So Washington Wizards tonight before that. That lost the wizards it was embarrassing if that was just an embarrassing loss the wizards were talking trash you know the I don&apos;t wanna say rivalry between those two teams but recently there have been some things going on with the wizards in the Celtics where it for God&apos;s. You know some bad blood if you wanna call it that and some pushing and shoving after the whistles or after games. You know there was out storyline it all along with that wizards Celtics game and the wizards just we&apos;re talking trash. Lancing and are gonna Wear all black like it was the Celtics funeral and they want to sell itself to the job but again. They did show up against. A damn good rockets team that out of that may be Houston. And that was a big time when for the Celtics showed a lot about Eminem may have Al Horford missed at last night&apos;s damage still warp. The Orlando Magic and of course Avery Bradley is out as well. He could need I believe may be another week we&apos;ll see what&apos;s allowing ten Al Horford did make the trip. Tonight to Milwaukee but maybe that would be the store on but. You know that&apos;s those are what it&apos;s the reality is the patriots aren&apos;t Super Bowl and other top story on. Right no soul. The question is he had all week this past week in everybody on national TV bring it up deflated again. Now these teams are gonna show up to Houston on Monday an immediate night on Monday night. When you look at all the potential story lines. You know the question I asked myself is what is the top story. Edmonton his game right pushed the top story. Is at the plate gate is at the fact that Brady began the season. Suspended. The first four games for his deflate paid punishment. Is today at the fact that the patriots traded Jamie colleges that Rob Gronkowski he&apos;s not playing in this camp is at. All right two quarterback league you gotta have one too wet. On her neighbors Matt Ryan we&apos;re talking about elite guys when it comes to put up big numbers in this league. Isn&apos;t the major difference. Rich statistically. Has been one of the best defenses and. A ball all you along and only improved as the season went on but. People would still. Look at those stats and not give the Patriots defense enough credits and I haven&apos;t been tested by an elite quarterback they haven&apos;t been tested. Finally offense I don&apos;t think you can say that any law. After the way they played against Big Ben Roethlisberger and Antonio Brown last week. Right but but that&apos;s another story line you know people got to get in tip of course they&apos;re gonna get into the relationship. Between Brady. Ballot check. And trump of course they gonna get into that you know that&apos;s going to be storyline. The storyline that I wrote about in a pomp and BC Boston yesterday check it out and NBC boston.com a story on. Is that at the beginning of the season if you do want to mention to placate what you have to acknowledge that aren&apos;t the patriots put out already won three in what. And it. The first two games. It was Jimmy grapple now I know Rob Lowe got hurt in in week two against Miami. But he left the game that anyone not that we know Miami came back in the second half made that close made got a ballgame right there in what are patrons don&apos;t want. I would like that they don&apos;t drop below it that week to win over Miami was moving the football if they did better at managing him. Of that game would not have been close. A drop below in the first game. A big land Arizona. And that net aegis cop got the dolphins defense for a quarter and half and we true. And and jumped out to a 21 up we needed. You know I think you&apos;re below is a story on him because he have immediate access at some point next week. And when people look at port has Vick did do the Brady story line Sunnis 39 years old he has the patriots. Magical round at a bella checker on how much time is Brady have deflate it well when he was out they showed that they had a quarterback that might be the next. The next big thing you know England. And just to Rob Lowe will have the people will have media access to drop load they&apos;ll ask him some questions about his future. And that I&apos;m sure was some other people on the patriots organization going to be asked about her Apple&apos;s friction I mean we about an a hole of the week to talk about this game. It&apos;s not just got to be x.s and o.s as you well when you watch Super Bowl coverage there are going to be saw this story. And if we&apos;re gonna look at some of the story lines outside of X isn&apos;t always that might be juicy to a point where. May at a night got to catch somebody says this game. The wrong paying not and Iran things got a cut on anyone&apos;s mall in the patriots locker room what. Again this story line is there for the taking. For somebody. To come out with the idea of a lot of the patrons do we Jimmy Europe. And is Donna as the back up. He&apos;s a one boy eras contract next year. Patriots right now. No they already the favorite to win next year&apos;s super little. It&apos;s not because they expect or apple ought to be the quarterback aides meg pretty good quarterback and expect them the blank at a high level. Right CO all is story lines I&apos;m sure there a couple long that I haven&apos;t mentioned that I&apos;m not thinking about that will come up. I&apos;m sure there. But. Eight the top story line is this season as a whole. What the patriots was still able to do with everything I didn&apos;t gold away from the deflated suspension. To trade in its one of their best defense of play is for compensation draft pick to gronkowski missed in the beginning of the season and then. And being placed on season ending injured reserve. Did you know a big day battle everything that the people who hit the patriots were above to see them try to battle and if the patriots whether the stalled. And hitting is whether the stalled. They came out with the best record in football. And they Al Roland into the Super Bowls at three point favorite and that if you take a step back and ask me why it&apos;s gonna happen in the Super Bowl I think the patriots in an overall on the Atlanta Falcons . Because I do not and warned not put money on the falcons&apos; defense in a neutral site to slowdown Tom Brady and his Patriots offense. And in fact. The Patriots defense. I sure haven&apos;t regional last couple weeks that cannot get the credit that they should be yet. And net I understand people wanna do that. After a win against rock us while. Orders us Lila Madonna I understand they wanna do that against on the quarterbacks but the patriots faced in the regular season. I take you sought after at this consider and act. If you&apos;re a critic of the Patriots defense got to consider given them some praise for stopping Roethlisberger and around the last re. You have to. And I just. What I expect to happen next Sunday is I expected cannot be pretty mean you think of the patriots in the Super Bowl . Yeah that it Tom Brady in the super ball in the four championships that he has. This six appearances. That he&apos;s made it in this big damn. And net you know you look at the scores of these games you&apos;ll look at the nail bite is that they had bad. I&apos;m not saying and that is due to be an issue global Brady drew for a for a ball but I will say. Out of the teams that have given. Let&apos;s say in a leaked Tom Brady trouble. Or at least made it close in a Super Bowl goes have been defense is that don&apos;t match up. United is different doesn&apos;t match up at a deeper into the federal. And you can point out the last two playoff games are a lot like some calls have tried to door but the bottom line is yes. When you are one of the worst pass defense is in football. And you are going up against. A quarterback who clearly. Is playing right now at a level. That. People around the league a lot in the play act anymore is a real thing with this revenge to. And you look at the weapons that Brady asks. Eva when I&apos;ll rock. It just to me the patriots have set themselves up to not just be successful in the Super Bowl and win it but to win it big. I just don&apos;t think this Atlanta defense stands a chance against Tom Brady and in a neutral site I really don&apos;t Sam is in the college attempt. And again you elicit your show that you&apos;re you know rabble are brought up what&apos;s happening to opt out. Great job and no doubt it got better earlier for the brick right. What&apos;s it all odds right now odds but does Brad Hogg. That is get you know. I know I just see mine eyes have modest rate I have to we have to look up I don&apos;t know. Yeah Ali get those odds or something like. You know I did two or something like. Oh. Think about it data like treasury bonds like the yield goes opt opposite the is to cut away. The spread out to be read that the odds are so. This is this was three I mean big. The guys in the patriots in this game to be a three point favorite of any NFC team. Please three point favorite of any and a CT right. I think of blacks like how all the game is going to date right there are trying to make it has yelled back yes. Right that propelled the blog site. The patriots. I but the odds are tied to your wedding I mean you got to put. Yet but right now without debate so basic. Oh forget the flat that is spread those who also pages. You know they&apos;ve urged against. But obviously that&apos;s the case of your favorite I mean if you don&apos;t put money in a favorite like that. Then obviously. What they got it they got that they&apos;ve got to get the they got it at the people&apos;s comfort. I gotta go what&apos;s your point I mean you trying to relate as anybody that&apos;s going on again. You&apos;re not you&apos;re talking about the spread you&apos;re wondering why why this spread salt wall ought to tell you what does that help law because everybody&apos;s floating. They&apos;ve got to get. Party&apos;s right to organize not that it gases where it is using a laptop you&apos;re put through box down in like nine dollars. Right with a three point spread out on the take Atlanta make levels but it. Right regardless in this it&apos;s the odd that you&apos;re talking about that you&apos;re you&apos;re you&apos;re talking he has property called I don&apos;t know why this red cell law. All started over one call made a good point you expected to go up a couple points and in the next couple days. We get it out in Seattle so you don&apos;t get so. If you get everybody kind of called no weapon itself based on hot. Like the spread buck and change the law. Go what would you pick I keep waiting for you to give up I can&apos;t let. I would bet I bet the patriots are. If there&apos;s not a robot each team I think the paper&apos;s web. Thirty or are. Seventeen you know maybe a late field or touchdown or Bob Bartlett up it is eleven has two turnovers. Okay just don&apos;t source and I don&apos;t care what are still there are better look at it like it or art and. There are no matter iMac righty Matt Ryan is that the perfect and it to keep up need to keep up adding this is. Speak to put money down I&apos;m not gonna put money on Matt Bryant and a perfect game against a Bill Belichick map treasurer on defense that has. An extra week to prepare for I just. I&apos;m not gonna do. And you talk about ramble on all Baja. Paul&apos;s in Cambridge it&apos;s up well. They did it. I wanted to target this Ouattara both done what did you have blood lines point so. I I was informant to pick on just waiting for it to happen and laws and not OK fine that&apos;s why it happened lets you pick. You know and it didn&apos;t happen absolutely trying to tell Vanya. OK so. Maybe luck involved. It&apos;s going to be attract the patriots and score every possession Ryan probably were reopened action so like which in his. That thing swapping were people control. Clock control time of possession keep in mind not the field. Power running game you know like why he was shut down during Houston&apos;s drug that you and in that credit he uses sequence but things like that I. That we did you isn&apos;t so much in Pittsburgh game that the plot is only Keogh but I just like to keep ball control problem running a yacht was without that and that&apos;s when he great some not not been. You know just Lisa will hole. He&apos;s eight. Nine and yards. And so. I just want to opinion on that. Yeah I mean to be honest with this I had a game plan I have based on what just what I&apos;ve seen. Is. You just talked about Brady being able to throw against Pittsburg. And and I felt that he was gonna be able to do baccalaureate and act game I told you that. And I feel. Even more strongly about that against Atlanta&apos;s pass defense is that Brady&apos;s going to be able to throw. Against Atlanta&apos;s defense. And will and I just I don&apos;t think he&apos;s gonna have any problem at all iffy guns. Atlanta&apos;s gonna need to do something in to give Brady. Some fits. To get him to throw some bad passes and and then come up with Terrell but again it&apos;s can Atlanta do that. Now. Like I told him in the last dollar that. Atlanta&apos;s defense has done some things defensively. To get the cornerback that impressed me with some of the big guys up front. Without having to send the house to get some and to get Rogers and and Wilson some fits but I just trust the patriots offensive line and the job that they&apos;ve been able. To doom. And you go I Houston right. Did Davy and cloudy Whitney commercial is busting up the middle early in that game a little too much. Anybody&apos;s liking haren went. And that big of Tom Brady some Fitz did gotten his face they&apos;ve forced predator throw some bad passes. What I didn&apos;t think is the game went on the patriots offensive line made some adjustments and they fixed the issue. And I think what are your shower and again against someone like clout. Especially when he came up the middle. Forget about coming on the outside either against shoulder cannon coming up the middle that seems to be where maybe if Atlanta&apos;s got to have success against the patriots opens a lot Bedford going to be out. It&apos;s a bust up the metal. But. What. I just think that the patriots have two weeks to prepare for this item they&apos;re gonna come up with shop and they&apos;re gonna use that Iran backs. You know to stab pop and maybe give even more protection for Tom Brady and the more protection of data because the longer Brady has now pocket there isn&apos;t anybody and that Atlanta&apos;s secondary that is gonna stop him. And that prevent Brady from economic pot I mean the falcons they lost their best cornerback. For the season I think that&apos;s a story line no one&apos;s talking about right Trufant. Give us back right in the secondary. All of these open season what do you have shirt he had surgery but a look at the he&apos;s playing in this scam to get better as a secondary that&apos;s bad in the first place. And better get to convert if they&apos;re gonna have a shot and give Matt Ryan a shot to keep up with him. They get to Tom Brady . And Mitt. I would you still put my money and the fact that&apos;s not gonna happen because. I think there are some factors in the last two games. That benefit Atlanta that won&apos;t benefit benefit them and this one I think the biggest one might be the home field. Home field advantage. I&apos;m when he does not that I have got a three and I think that that&apos;s something that. Really help them out. Against Rogers and Wilson and the Seattle and Green Bay offense is they were affected by that noise they weren&apos;t they are affected by it by IBM  (WSJ) . The road team in a hostile environment this is not going to be a hostile environment. And Tom Brady is not going to be affected by any crowd noise and by being in any type of road team and somebody else&apos;s building an Atlanta certainly. You know they love planet all and they won&apos;t be at home next week and so I just don&apos;t think. They&apos;re going to be able to get to Brady and if they can&apos;t get the Brady they have no shot stop in. Brady from throwing the ball downfield and you talk about game plan ask me with a game plan a big day of did Tom Brady time of the pocket and he is gonna talk about this Atlanta defense 617779. 79837. Back at this time all. Hello there. Get a touch wood Danny right now 617 sevenths. We Saturday. Car fund sports real good. I&apos;m back to your phone calls and then. Just a second but I&apos;m written this on Twitter from the Steve Conroy the Boston Harold becomes the Bruins the Boston Harold Steve Conroy tweets. Brad marsh and has pulled out of the fastest skater competition. At NHL all star weekend skills competition is tonight at 7 o&apos;clock in Los Angeles. My Shannon to grass kind of represented the Bruins Masha and according to Steve Conroy the Harold has pulled out of the fastest skater competition tonight he&apos;s believed to be nurse in some sort of walled. Body injuries are believed that in go to on the run away. The other night and then retirement. So he&apos;s got some sort of lower body injury. But he will compete. And met the line shooting competition so. Marcia and not in the fastest skater competition and I would say that if you honors in some type of injury even if it&apos;s just minor. Just some type of fights. Don&apos;t put yourself in that fastest skater competition we. The last thing the Bruins need is Brad marsh and. Damage himself. In the all star game skills competition. Now would know football this weekend I should say that we do a footballer of the for all tomorrow I have city of four point favorite I couldn&apos;t tell here. Who&apos;s in illusionist who. The quarterbacks I&apos;ve no idea. Because you might think itself well we know the best quarterbacks in the league but they don&apos;t necessarily. Mean I&apos;m talking about the guys who did make the Super Bowl obviously. They don&apos;t necessarily have to accept the invitation to play in the rubble you see all these two guys who reject. The invitation and they have to invite so many more players that actually selected for this day. So I always have a problem with the if you&apos;re Harris Indiana she&apos;s a four point favorite tomorrow night. Well I watch status that NHL all star damn I think I&apos;ll probably watch the NHL all star am. A little bit more only because they do owned they have three damn right they sort of in the semifinals. One team from each division I semifinal xenophile gam. Is it three on three till. It&apos;s round three right I think they&apos;d they changed it a little bit the last couple years but. We have an extra weekend here at and pull another week next week. The breakdown suitable 51 patriots and falcons but for the time being on taken you up calls right now what you think is gonna happen in this one. A week from tomorrow and Houston 617779. 798370. Let&apos;s go to Bob in New Hampshire it&apos;s a body. OK. I don&apos;t guy. It certainly got into interior LB quick dump truck trucks are gonna go back and wrote two part question real quick ordering the militants are number one. I don&apos;t believe the neutral. You discriminate both offenses looked pedestrian I think it&apos;s going to be at the he turned to struggle. I&apos;m actually look at middle school I noted but it looked in the high end but I&apos;m looking at 1714. Caps. Only because Clinton are -- dollar check it. And Belichick knows Quinn. I think they&apos;re gonna try to take away what each other does well I think it&apos;s gonna come down the last five minutes about what order it&apos;s missed tackle. You know mr. Roberts spoke outrage so that it&apos;s back to may be in a field goal. That&apos;s like personnel when I hear what you -- to think about I&apos;m looking at lowland gorilla electorate -- 1714. Maybe 1410. And my other question has caught on with his injuries. We know kind of injury Lila thought. He&apos;s the most awesome tight end in the league but you know -- gotten bigger players collapsed -- I just I didn&apos;t mean to do that I&apos;d aiming to do that body I had about an accident. I didn&apos;t mean to do that starred Bob I I I cut you up by action that&apos;s on me. Call back and if you get a chance he would Bob calls back Dave I just I was wipe my hand over the strain I had bought by accident but I wit with regards to go wrong. I think I don&apos;t need all that. And net is my take on it well when it comes to Rob Gronkowski is a businessman you&apos;re right. On the patriots handled a football team like a business as well. I think Rob Gronkowski. Is without question. The most dangerous. Tight end that I have ever seen in the history of the league honestly yes. But that said. Well. Not the brunt warned me room for the patriots. Mr. ball is obviously gonna group the Richards but if the patriots and it are you gonna wanna shoot the ball and I&apos;ll run. I did you know when it comes time to. For the business side of it along the injury it&apos;s. Well it&apos;s crazy to think that may be Bill Belichick isn&apos;t gonna give grind. What you want toward Drew Rosenhaus whose agent. Would want to grow and both sides handle it. Like a business. Than I could see and I could envision. Both sides not being close honestly that it is how I envision it now could they end up work and something out. Perhaps I would I hope they can&apos;t. IA I think that I think you know we got a couple years for that even be a conversation. I clear that we know all that Rob Gronkowski based on the tweet that he had on the patriots picked up his option which I believe picked up you know four years of pride for you at four more years and a deal. Don&apos;t you just drew that tweet out there. Because he was completely joking around like I do feel like it was a method to the madness of debt tweet okay. Because we do know he&apos;s a businessman but. To be honest with ya like from meteorite now widow crime. Ticket to get into especially where his contract isn&apos;t even up for me to get into a Rob Gronkowski contract. Argument the line. To really sit there and spent too much time on that I just that&apos;s not anywhere close to be in on my radar. I think if there is a story line of someone who&apos;s not gonna play him is damn. We have maybe that would be a little bit closer. Moderate that would be grapple and maybe what his future because at a garrote all plays and that is based on the fact that. Yup she&apos;s in this success that Tom bradys have. And I don&apos;t believe Tom Brady is just gonna fall off a cliff like Max element might want him to after this year. Berg said the result that is. Again there&apos;s a reason why the pitcher it&apos;s her favorite already to win actually is suitable. So next you&apos;ll be the last year or drop below steal I think that&apos;s a much more timely story line and that would be on my read off a little bit more than any type of grunt and what grunts futuristic the patriots. Brunch futurist heal up get back to register at some point and she would you can do what Brady at quarterback but of Rob Lowe is still here and he&apos;s a backup. I like I look at this coming offseason. And I think to myself. I when it comes to plays on this team and moves that the patriots could make big moves. I think you&apos;ll look back problem because. There are teams. But you just saw the final fall in the NFL. Brady Roethlisberger. Rodgers Ryan you&apos;ve got to have a quarterback in this league to be successful. There&apos;ll lot of teams in this league that don&apos;t have a quarterback there it seems initially a lot of them that have tried multiple options whether it&apos;s. Trade draft. Crazy signings like Houston get an Oz while a fortieth 72 million dollar deal and none of it&apos;s worked out form right. So. The names that are going to be looked at Tony romo&apos;s name people I&apos;ve got a call Dallas. And I got to see what AA what&apos;s gonna take that to take Tony Romo off stance because the actress got is the guy in Dallas. Romo is going to be available if you Bill Belichick . Yeah I&apos;ll maybe create some type of bidding war. Because what would blue would you rather have would you rather have Rob Lowe. What&apos;s he gonna be 27 are up on X you believe I believe he&apos;s 26 years Greg Robb was point six. Toll road all is going to be 37 I believe in April and the sprint I was at an update this the other day. And Mitt. So would you rather have through the triple drop or guys is all that and Tony Romo who has won anything in this league. Other than some regular season games. I mean I&apos;d rather spend it. You know some some draft pixel oil trade shifts on on a guy who&apos;s in his twenties Joost revive its 25 going to be 26 next. Or so ago I mean I&apos;d rather have dropped obviously Kenny is on him. Why did appellate judge you throw a rock wall and in these two tick the tie is because debt and that you don&apos;t like Rob Lowe control his own desk. This is a free agent I shown embraced a plan at a high level and this is the way I want I don&apos;t know onset and how Belichick can play at I&apos;m telling you what I would. IA. Want telecheck. To embrace Brady&apos;s career and say we&apos;re gonna stick operating as long as we can what I can award about the backup quarterback because when Brady is gone. This isn&apos;t gonna what the sand we are Derek going to be years where we gotta have finally feel. What it&apos;s like to not be in the AFC championship. And I think what you have Brady now plan at a high level you know. Do you roll attack which means if you drop although the patriots got a role Brady you don&apos;t wanna be back up. I can&apos;t help ensure might love the patriots organizational love bill village tackle might want to be the patriots quarterback at some point in your career after Brady. Don&apos;t wanna sit around and wait any longer after this deals up you wanna go somewhere restart cubic. And especially. After he just put his skills on display. Earlier this season. So you&apos;ll like Rob Lowe. Make his own decision on that I&apos;d I&apos;d think. You know. At least if umbrella checked that&apos;s what I would do but that&apos;s storyline to grapple store economy to the future of grappled verse to future Brady and the patriots organization committee. That&apos;s a much more timely storyline to storyline that would be on the migrate. A little bit more that any type of Gradkowski. Situation because he is under contract sure he&apos;s yeah I he has these injuries. Bud. When he is on the field Durbin did is he can&apos;t you can&apos;t but I don&apos;t I don&apos;t grunt grunt and appealed their credit did. But it wanting to Victor it&apos;s approved right now is that they have built an offense that is able to. Still put up big numbers evil and out rock and a big reason that is the guy. Who&apos;s on dissent Tom Brady Tom Brady and Bill Belichick act regardless of any of the moves as long as those two guys around him this ship. The patriots are going to be one of the best teams in the AFC and a gonna have a shot to get at Super Bowl and bowl will take blob is back Bob&apos;s column back. I&apos;ll put a mind and Bashar about that I hit the button by accident that&apos;s my fault. Continuing to dot on ground. They. Hey yeah I don&apos;t ansari had today I heard a thing at the higher I would listen to you can&apos;t match I totally agree with eagle putt to drop opium highest point on the radar right now. It is a young curious what you thought about blunt where you know we missed a lot of playtime and stopped that saw what I do agree 100% above that I grew up lol I think you sized point my other part of the question was as simple bloke I know it&apos;s going to be in -- -- on I think it&apos;s gonna I think it&apos;s gonna they are both offenses kind of pedestrian I think it&apos;s going to be a defense of struggle that&apos;s my personal and I think it&apos;s going to be a low scoring affair I really built for some reason I think Quinn not knows Belichick Belichick knows Quinton and they&apos;re both gonna take away it would each try to do well. I don&apos;t think it&apos;s going to be much in the running game I think it&apos;s gonna come out the last five minutes outlook quota. I don&apos;t currently we are you re appeared on this week I just I want you finish your ground you ground the I know you are you at a at a hot take on ground had I didn&apos;t want and yet. Yeah I know I again I love the Crocker and now my my biggest lies we not dollar check it&apos;s sort of players collapse you know what I&apos;m saying is. So I&apos;m glad I&apos;d love disputed Clark&apos;s Iran and I don&apos;t see him and not Martellus. You know you know you book to book ends up. Now I would show I would still I don&apos;t think gaga moved broad at least they should remove grind. But added that&apos;s his ID so I think the garage story line has some been for a couple years down the road you know I&apos;d I don&apos;t think I only got distort my friend ever again it&apos;s.

Let&apos;s go to Jay in Randolph would subject. I hire you good so borrowers. Its Internet. Goodell did not belong on the things he did so because group now epic. But in its workers and perhaps support a political race and the department. So I don&apos;t they are Britain belongs in the end and then. If you would what a god that we&apos;re Richards. Our our hope that you stop and these forward in mop up. Average federal government&apos;s help and I had that there are pretty sure it Omega my daughter. So I don&apos;t they bring the lament and contribute greatly when he opened flat out of or breakthrough at bigger let down chop. Well I mean I that&apos;s get in the hole not a discussion you you talk about. Tom Brady&apos;s seniors comments. And it I&apos;d we have audio of Tom Brady senior I believe they&apos;ll planet. The previous show train at the moxie but you know when it comes the Tom Brady  Bill Belichick act and their relationship with Donald Trump whatever that relationship may be in the fact that. Date they say they have a friendship and and Brady says that you know he doesn&apos;t. Support every single view that the guy has just because their frenzy as the sport every single view. I will tell you this about. Patriots fans who maybe don&apos;t support Brady and the patriots because of that relationship. And there are a lot more people that aren&apos;t they might. They might not support the fact that Tom Brady is friendly. Donald Trump but I think most people feel like I still watch him and still I gotta root for the patriots a week from tomorrow ashes to feel Idec. I don&apos;t care what anybody. Once stood to write about it in personal stories of people they know who won&apos;t watcher and Alaska oil and natural right to make that decision. And opera for the patriots on talent is I think there are still a lot of people. And that most people who aren&apos;t they might not like the fact that Brady bella checked. Have a relationship with Donald Trump I pick most people who don&apos;t like that we&apos;ll still watch and root for the patriots. Village in Springfield it&apos;s uphill. Any I want to tell you got a great so are there any talk sports is very important. This is sports now I have a great idea I don&apos;t know can make the Colombo are coming. Why has it do that when we only take you and puts you in the morning show. What Jerry does count and get ruined by minute that it should be a movie critic. I talked about it anomalies. He season jogging is not about what. I thought you wanted to did you just calling and saying you wanted to talk sports and that&apos;s a good thing. So why don&apos;t why are you going to. I would opt out about current crop until I think you contradicted yourself and I got I was confused. Regardless salad is lying and many are not that audience. This is my show is right now I&apos;d opponent might show so give me something that you wanna talk about did you just call them the gimmick called saint. You would rather talk to you like that I talked sport so glad. OK Clark went warp 540. Tight and inside that&apos;s that he can attest to that can&apos;t play too deep to get. And Brady has the ability to conduct becomes faster on the outside out negotiate up from the outside. Got better angle on it. One right down the middle and so on so tight end. It the hard or put on Brady puts it right on the money. Looking you people go crazy about going up while there he&apos;s played a game and perhaps you might be just like Romo injured girl. What a and that one I used to pocket about. What is taught what&apos;s going on right now what are you trying to show you know the rocket engine right there is not a lion of the short ball. Right and I sort of like. They&apos;re not much right on all of. Talking about trading drunk who would say. Some of RadioShack. Well just this ready to show you can&apos;t say. Like well I tarts pop it&apos;s an open what got anything that you generally talk about. Rondo went deep on the middle of the field the patriots play in the show all week from tomorrow rob doesn&apos;t Clint. I don&apos;t a lot of people talking about trading right if they not admitted to find some battles to talk about because I I don&apos;t I don&apos;t get that one. That&apos;s not may we call. Earlier who brought up brawn can I do as I said in a lot that&apos;s not a big rock story line is not a moderate his final he op plan a week from tomorrow that&apos;s when I don&apos;t. Like ya as remote things that I know I know he&apos;s not plant and I also know the patriots. It&apos;s still gonna roll on Atlanta&apos;s defense without is that a knock on drug of course not a knock on rock. But I think it says a lot of all Tom Brady and this season he&apos;s Avant. Also says a lot about the offensive line think back last year at this time what we were don&apos;t. We are talking about the patriots. Watch in the Broncos watching Peyton Manning and the Broncos go to the Super Bowl . Why does the patriots offensive line was banged up. And they were a puddle to graduate healthy could get the job done you got the job that Dante Scarnecchia has done with this group that is not healthy back implant. You know top notch opera sublime football right now this is a group that is blocking for quarterback that is having an MVP type season. There&apos;s no court incidents that right now that the Patriots offense is Roland. Into the Super Bowl and last year. You know they got stopped in their tracks and Brady was hit it. And he was drone picks and it was spot in the broncos&apos; field position and it may Peyton Manning in that first half look like the best quarterback in football he wasn&apos;t even close. All comes back to what&apos;s going on for. And at a dose of stored and traded on. Like what you thought what do people pocket of what&apos;s going on there if you&apos;re shipment today wake up well what the patriots are gonna do it rock. And you gotta. You gotta find something to do you need to find a hobby because that&apos;s not a top story on. On my radar had minted its rubles 6177797907617. 7797. 9837. Pak Afghanistan at all.</content>
