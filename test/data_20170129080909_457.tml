<content type="str">I bought a cable to record audio to my go pro but when I use it the audio quality drops way off. 
 
The volume drops to near muted. I even tried plugging it into the passenger jack (with my headset plugged into the pilot jack) and the quality instantly dropped again. 
 
I&apos;m guessing it&apos;s an issue with the cable, but wondering if there is something else I should check before I send it back.</content>
