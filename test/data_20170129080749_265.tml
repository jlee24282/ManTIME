<content type="str">&quot;Furnace,&quot; by Dead Man Winter 
 
Dave Simonett has delivered something you almost never see in music: a gorgeous divorce album. Simonett, leader of the progressive bluegrass-rock band Trampled by Turtles, works under the banner of Dead Man Winter on &quot;Furnace&quot; to delve into the dissolution of his marriage and the splintering of his family. It&apos;s a deeply personal album he says he put out only after &quot;a long and violent debate with myself.&quot; From the wrenching first stanza of &quot;This House is On Fire,&quot; Simonett spins the desolate landscape of his heartbreak into art. Cut live-to-tape in rustic Cannon Falls, Minnesota, the album sets achy lyrics against an elegant acoustic backdrop that accentuates the hurt but never veers into self-indulgence. That Simonett delivers it without wallowing in self-pity or defensive rationalizations about why things didn&apos;t work out is a monumental achievement. &quot;Mockingbird, you come to my window, in the dead of night, to see if we&apos;re all right,&quot; he sings with clear-eyed solemnity in the elegiac &quot;Weight of the World.&quot; &apos;&apos;The moonlight in your eyes, and then you&apos;re gone.&quot; You&apos;d have to go back decades to find a more cathartic breakup album — perhaps as far as Bob Dylan&apos;s &quot;Blood on the Tracks,&quot; the gold standard for such things. &quot;Furnace&quot; reassures us that the human heart is beautiful even when it&apos;s in anguish. Its memorable anthems to lost intimacy and disconnection will remind those who have been there that they&apos;re not so alone after all. — Scott Stroud, The Associated Press 
 
&quot;a girl a bottle a boat,&quot; by Train  
 
Some people simply adore Train. Others simply loathe them. The band&apos;s new album is unlikely to change anyone&apos;s mind. The band — now without lead guitarist and founding member Jimmy Stafford — has returned with an unmemorable, fluffy and yet desperately needy soft-rock CD, &quot;a girl a bottle a boat.&quot; Train, the band behind &quot;Drops Of Jupiter (Tell Me)&quot; and &quot;Meet Virginia,&quot; is once again as edgy and raw as a Labradoodle puppy. If Train was an article of clothing, it would be mom jeans. Take &quot;Play That Song,&quot; the new CD&apos;s first single. It&apos;s instantly cloying and catchy — the way &quot;Hey, Soul Sister&quot; was — until you realize they&apos;ve swiped the melody from &quot;Heart and Soul,&quot; the Hoagy Carmichael tune kids learn to play on the piano. Fans will adore it. Others will consider it a crime against rock. On the new 11-song disc, Train tries some doo-wop (&quot;Valentine&quot;), some faux-Coldplay (&quot;Drink Up&quot;), dance-pop (&quot;Lost and Found&quot;) and a bombastic piano ballad (&quot;You Better Believe&quot;). But it&apos;s all so very limp, especially coming off their completely unnecessary remake of &quot;Led Zeppelin II&quot; last year. Even the album&apos;s comma-less title — apparently advocating drunken boating? — doesn&apos;t really fit the vibe. The best song is &quot;Working Girl,&quot; but it&apos;s marred by typically atrocious lyrics that rhyme &quot;game&quot; with &quot;Aspartame&quot; and &quot;never been&quot; with &quot;Ritalin.&quot; Still, lead singer Patrick Monahan does have this advice for anyone firmly anti-Train: &quot;If you don&apos;t like it, let me get the door for you.&quot; — Mark Kennedy, The Associated Press  
 
&quot;Graveyard of Good Times,&quot; by Brandon Can&apos;t Dance 
 
Brandon Can&apos;t Dance is the nom de indie rock of Philadelphia songwriter Brandon Ayres. In the manner of rising DIY stars like Car Seat Headrest and Alex G (with whom he has toured), Ayres has followed several self-releases on his Bandcamp page over a number of years with this official coming-out party on the Lucky Number label. It&apos;s a bit of a jumble, with Ayres sometimes sounding like a collection of influences: vocals that alternately recall Elliott Smith, Wayne Coyne, and Ira Kaplan of Yo La Tengo, and songs that mix synthy dance-floor moves (&quot;Smoke &amp; Drive Around&quot;), 1980s Europop (&quot;Pop Queen of the Teen Scene&quot;) and tongue-in-cheek self-mockery (&quot;So Deep, So Tortured, So Freak&quot;). But the catchy tunes keep coming over the course of a 16-track album on which Ayres is too intent on enjoying himself to worry about the identity crisis he&apos;ll surely outgrow. — Dan DeLuca, The Philadelphia Inquirer 
 
&quot;London Fog 1966,&quot; by The Doors 
 
Before The Doors celebrate a golden anniversary in March with a three-LP take on their still-provocative debut (&quot;The Doors: 50th Anniversary Deluxe Edition&quot;), the never- before-released origin-story tapes of their time as a house band at &quot;fantastic L.A.&apos;s&quot; London Fog — a Sunset Strip dive bar — finally arrive. Good. Though The Doors presented shamanic monotone poet Jim Morrison, cabaret organist Ray Manzarek, and company as fully formed psychedelic sensualists whose snaky sound reflected a darker California than the usual sunshine dream of the era, the quartet&apos;s roots were in raw rural blues. When drummer John Densmore and guitarist Robby Krieger find the pocket of Big Joe Williams&apos; &quot;Baby, Please Don&apos;t Go,&quot; they burrow deep. When Morrison reaches into his personal primordial ooze to appropriate Muddy Waters&apos; hurt for &quot;I&apos;m Your Hoochie Coochie Man,&quot; you hear how The Doors&apos; next steps were logical progressions of a blue-black start. Minus any studio cleansing, these tunes are crackling gut-punch jazz-psychedelia shot through with Morrison&apos;s meaty croon. Here&apos;s hoping Rhino finds more tapes. — A.D. Amorosi,  The Philadelphia Inquirer 
 
&quot;Hidden Figures: The Album,&quot; Various Artists 
 
To tell &quot;Hidden Figures&apos;&quot; rarely heard story of the brainy African-American women working at NASA at the dawn of the 1960s, director-screenwriter Theodore Melfi brought in nu-soul auteur Pharrell Williams to compose, star in, and oversee its soundtrack, co-compose its score (with Hans Zimmer), and produce the film. Rather than shrink at the responsibility, Williams rises high; not just with sweet retrofit R&amp;B appropriate to the Motown era and the optimism of the space race, but with his usual sunny disposition pop-hop, this time tinged with strains of gentle folk and sacred song. Though the former describes Williams&apos; own chipper anthem &quot;Runnin&apos;,&quot; the gloriously emboldened &quot;I See a Victory&quot; encompasses the Virginia native&apos;s rich gospel inspirations. Williams offers similar raw religiosity for duet partner Lalah Hathaway on &quot;Surrender.&quot; Along with producing grand raging tracks for Mary J. Blige (&quot;Mirage&quot;) and saving a hint of hard soul for himself (&quot;Crystal Clear&quot;), Williams _ with movie costar Janelle Monae _ tackles &quot;Jalapeno&quot; and brings back another side of his sound, the blistering electro-rock-funk of his onetime band N.E.R.D. More of that _ please _ would have added a star to this review. — A.D. Amorosi,  The Philadelphia Inquirer</content>
