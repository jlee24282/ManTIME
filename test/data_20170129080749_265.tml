<TITLE>Album Reviews: Dead Man Winter, Train, Brandon Can't Dance, The Doors and 'Hidden Figures'</TITLE>
<TEXT>"Furnace," byDead Man Winter 
 
Dave Simonett has delivered something you almost never see in music: a gorgeous divorce album. Simonett, leader of the progressive bluegrass-rock band Trampled by Turtles, works under the banner of Dead Man Winter on "Furnace" to delve into the dissolution of his marriage and the splintering of his family. It's a deeply personal album he says he put out only after "a long and violent debate with myself."From the wrenching first stanza of "This House is On Fire," Simonett spins the desolate landscape of his heartbreak into art. Cut live-to-tape in rustic Cannon Falls, Minnesota, the album sets achy lyrics against an elegant acoustic backdrop that accentuates the hurt but never veers into self-indulgence.That Simonett delivers it without wallowing in self-pity or defensive rationalizations about why things didn't work out is a monumental achievement."Mockingbird, you come to my window, in the dead of night, to see if we're all right," he sings with clear-eyed solemnity in the elegiac "Weight of the World." ''The moonlight in your eyes, and then you're gone."You'd have to go back decades to find a more cathartic breakup album  perhaps as far as Bob Dylan's "Blood on the Tracks," the gold standard for such things."Furnace" reassures us that the human heart is beautiful even when it's in anguish. Its memorable anthems to lost intimacy and disconnection will remind those who have been there that they're not so alone after all. Scott Stroud, The Associated Press 
 
"a girl a bottle a boat," by Train 
 
Some people simply adore Train. Others simply loathe them. The band's new album is unlikely to change anyone's mind.The band  now without lead guitarist and founding member Jimmy Stafford  has returned with an unmemorable, fluffy and yet desperately needy soft-rock CD, "a girl a bottle a boat."Train, the band behind "Drops Of Jupiter (Tell Me)" and "Meet Virginia," is once again as edgy and raw as a Labradoodle puppy. If Train was an article of clothing, it would be mom jeans.Take "Play That Song," the new CD's first single. It's instantly cloying and catchy  the way "Hey, Soul Sister" was  until you realize they've swiped the melody from "Heart and Soul," the Hoagy Carmichael tune kids learn to play on the piano. Fans will adore it. Others will consider it a crime against rock.On the new 11-song disc, Train tries some doo-wop ("Valentine"), some faux-Coldplay ("Drink Up"), dance-pop ("Lost and Found") and a bombastic piano ballad ("You Better Believe"). But it's all so very limp, especially coming off their completely unnecessary remake of "Led Zeppelin II" last year. Even the album's comma-less title  apparently advocating drunken boating?  doesn't really fit the vibe.The best song is "Working Girl," but it's marred by typically atrocious lyrics that rhyme "game" with "Aspartame" and "never been" with "Ritalin." Still, lead singer Patrick Monahan does have this advice for anyone firmly anti-Train: "If you don't like it, let me get the door for you." Mark Kennedy, The Associated Press 
 
"Graveyard of Good Times," byBrandon Can't Dance 
 
Brandon Can't Dance is the nom de indie rock of Philadelphia songwriter Brandon Ayres. In the manner of rising DIY stars like Car Seat Headrest and Alex G (with whom he has toured), Ayres has followed several self-releases on his Bandcamp page over a number of years with this official coming-out party on the Lucky Number label.It's a bit of a jumble, with Ayres sometimes sounding like a collection of influences: vocals that alternately recall Elliott Smith, Wayne Coyne, and Ira Kaplan of Yo La Tengo, and songs that mix synthy dance-floor moves ("Smoke & Drive Around"), 1980s Europop ("Pop Queen of the Teen Scene") and tongue-in-cheek self-mockery ("So Deep, So Tortured, So Freak"). But the catchy tunes keep coming over the course of a 16-track album on which Ayres is too intent on enjoying himself to worry about the identity crisis he'll surely outgrow.Dan DeLuca,The Philadelphia Inquirer 
 
"London Fog 1966," byThe Doors 
 
Before The Doors celebrate a golden anniversary in March with a three-LP take on their still-provocative debut ("The Doors: 50th Anniversary Deluxe Edition"), the never- before-released origin-story tapes of their time as a house band at "fantastic L.A.'s" London Fog a Sunset Strip dive bar finally arrive. Good.Though The Doors presented shamanic monotone poet Jim Morrison, cabaret organist Ray Manzarek, and company as fully formed psychedelic sensualists whose snaky sound reflected a darker California than the usual sunshine dream of the era, the quartet's roots were in raw rural blues. When drummer John Densmore and guitarist Robby Krieger find the pocket of Big Joe Williams' "Baby, Please Don't Go," they burrow deep. When Morrison reaches into his personal primordial ooze to appropriate Muddy Waters' hurt for "I'm Your Hoochie Coochie Man," you hear how The Doors' next steps were logical progressions of a blue-black start.Minus any studio cleansing, these tunes are crackling gut-punch jazz-psychedelia shot through with Morrison's meaty croon. Here's hoping Rhino finds more tapes.A.D. Amorosi,The Philadelphia Inquirer 
 
"Hidden Figures: The Album," Various Artists 
 
To tell "Hidden Figures'" rarely heard story of the brainy African-American women working at NASA at the dawn of the 1960s, director-screenwriter Theodore Melfi brought in nu-soul auteur Pharrell Williams to compose, star in, and oversee its soundtrack, co-compose its score (with Hans Zimmer), and produce the film. Rather than shrink at the responsibility, Williams rises high; not just with sweet retrofit R&B appropriate to the Motown era and the optimism of the space race, but with his usual sunny disposition pop-hop, this time tinged with strains of gentle folk and sacred song.Though the former describes Williams' own chipper anthem "Runnin'," the gloriously emboldened "I See a Victory" encompasses the Virginia native's rich gospel inspirations. Williams offers similar raw religiosity for duet partner Lalah Hathaway on "Surrender."Along with producing grand raging tracks for Mary J. Blige ("Mirage") and saving a hint of hard soul for himself ("Crystal Clear"), Williams _ with movie costar Janelle Monae _ tackles "Jalapeno" and brings back another side of his sound, the blistering electro-rock-funk of his onetime band N.E.R.D. More of that _ please _ would have added a star to this review.A.D. Amorosi,The Philadelphia Inquirer</TEXT>
