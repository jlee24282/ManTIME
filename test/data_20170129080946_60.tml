<content type="str">Recently, surprising physical effects were observed using special microscopic waveguides for light. Such &quot;photonic structures&quot; currently are revolutionizing the fields of optics and photonics, and have opened up the new research area of &quot;Chiral Quantum Optics&quot;. Physicists from Copenhagen, Innsbruck, and Vienna, who are leading figures in this field, have now written an overview on the topic which just appeared in the scientific journal Nature. What one learns at school is that light oscillate...</content>
