<TITLE>Becahi tops Nazareth for EPC wrestling crown | Full coverage</TITLE>
<TEXT>As seniors we sure didnt want to be the ones who broke our streak, said senior Jody Crouse, who delivered a key fall at 220 pounds for Becahi.

Becahi also moved closer to evening the all-time series with Nazareth, which now stands at 11-9 in the Blue Eagles favor. Of all the teams Nazareth has wrestled more than 10 times, the only teams with an all-time winning record against the Blue Eagles are Easton (59-26-4), Phillipsburg (28-19) and the old Bethlehem High School (20-1-1 before the split).
