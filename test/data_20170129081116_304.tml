<TEXT type="str">NASA has revealed its new spacesuits for Boeing Starliner astronauts, and the outfits bear a striking resemblance to those seen in Stanley Kubrick&apos;s film 2001: A Space Odyssey. 
 
Here&apos;s a look at the new suit (via Gizmodo ), which features built-in ventilation, as well as touchscreen-sensitive gloves, cross trainer-style shoes and an improved helmet.

And here&apos;s a look at an action figure based on the blue spacesuits from 2001: A Space Odyssey. 
 

 
&quot;It is a lot lighter, more form-fitting and it’s simpler, which is always a good thing,&quot; astronaut Eric Boe said of the new Starliner suit. &quot;Complicated systems have more ways they can break, so simple is better on something like this.&quot; 
 
These new suits replace the much bulkier launch-and-entry suits.
