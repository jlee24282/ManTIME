<TEXT type="str">Oscar nominees Andrew Garfield, Dev Patel and Naomie Harris are among a host of British stars hoping for success at the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) Awards.

The star-studded ceremony in Los Angeles is seen as a key indicator of who will fare well at the Academy Awards next month.

Powerful drama Manchester By The Sea leads the way with four nominations, while musical La La Land – which earned a record equalling 14 Oscar nods – is up for two awards.

Stranger Things star Millie Bobby Brown could make history by becoming the youngest ever SAG Award winner after she was nominated for best actress in a TV drama.

The 12-year-old, who plays a girl with psychokinetic abilities in the Netflix show, is up against fellow Britons Claire Foy and Thandie Newton and her Stranger Things co-star Winona Ryder.

Golden Globe winner Claire is nominated for her portrayal of the Queen in Netflix drama The Crown, while Thandie has been recognised for her performance as a life-like robot in HBO show Westworld.

Andrew received a best actor nod for his role as real-life army medic Desmond Doss in Mel Gibson’s Second World War drama Hacksaw Ridge.

James Bond star Naomie is nominated for the best supporting actress award after playing a crack addict in coming-of-age drama Moonlight.

Dev earned a best supporting actor nomination for his performance in Lion, the true story of Saroo Brierley, a young Indian boy who was separated from his family and adopted in Australia.

The Slumdog Millionaire star will compete for the award with fellow Briton Hugh Grant, who is nominated for his role in comedy Florence Foster Jenkins.

Hugh’s co-star Meryl Streep, who recently became the first star to be nominated for 20 Oscars, is up for the SAG award for best actress.

Other British nominees include Emily Blunt, who earned a best actress nod for her starring role in psychological thriller The Girl On The Train.</TEXT>
