A famous &quot;goodbye&quot; has led to a celebrated &quot;hello&quot; for Don Was and friends 
 
The musician, record producer and music executive is part of the all-star team in &quot;The Last Waltz 40: A Celebration of the 40th Anniversary of The Last Waltz.&quot; 
 
The &quot;Waltz&quot; was the big star, big deal finale for the Band, the American rock group that featured Robbie Robertson, Rick Danko, Levon Helm, Garth Hudson and Richard Manuel. The concert, advertised as the guys&apos; farewell concert appearance, was held in San Francisco on Thanksgiving Day, Nov. 25, 1976. The party attracted stars like Muddy Waters, Bob Dylan, Neil Diamond, Joni Mitchell, Eric Clapton and Van Morrison. Ringo Starr, Paul Butterfield, Ronnie Wood, Neil Young and Dr. John also stopped by. 
 
The show lives on, with an assist from Martin Scorsese. The film director had cameras inside San Fran&apos;s Winterland Ballroom and edited songs and interviews into 1978&apos;s &quot;The Last Waltz&quot; movie, acclaimed as one of the greatest concert films ever made. 
 
Was and his pals have said hello to the classic material and have brought back the live show. &quot;Last Waltz New Orleans&quot; was a monster hit at the city&apos;s Jazz Fest in 2016 and the &quot;Waltz&quot; ensemble later decided to take the music and run for an 11-stop tour that includes Albany, Atlanta, Boston, Philadelphia and Washington. 
 
The Albany show will be held Thursday, Feb. 2 at the Palace Theatre. Curtain is 8 p.m. Fans can expect favorites like &quot;Up on Cripple Creek,&quot; &quot;Stage Fright,&quot; &quot;The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down,&quot; &quot;The Weight&quot; and bunches of others. 
 
They can also expect a crowded stage. Warren Haynes of the Allman Brothers and southern jam outfit Gov&apos;t Mule, Michael McDonald, Bob Margolin - Muddy Waters&apos; longtime partner - Dave Malone of New Orleans&apos; Radiators, Ivan Neville and country musician Jamey Johnson are all on the team. 
 
&quot;The band itself that we&apos;re touring with is an odd-enough collection,&quot; said Was, who led the 1980s funk band Was (Not Was) and has been president of the Blue Note jazz music label since 2012. He was co-producer for the Rolling Stones&apos; latest album, the well-regarded &quot;Blue and Lonesome.&quot; 
 
&quot;You really don&apos;t expect Michael McDonald, Warren Haynes and Jamey Johnson to blend,&quot;  Was said in a telephone interview from the beach in Hollywood, Florida, where the tour opens Saturday. &quot;It seemed like a real unlikely thing and when we first did it in New Orleans last year, it could have gone either way, man. It could have been a train wreck or it could have been something great, but we clicked from the first rehearsal. Everyone playing in the band was really knocked out. that doesn&apos;t always happen. Usually, it doesn&apos;t. This is a serious band and it&apos;s a great honor to play with these guys.&quot; 
 
  
 
Was, 64, is only talking about &quot;Last Waltz&quot; during this round of interviews - so no questions about the Rolling Stones, no questions about jazz. He doesn&apos;t think anyone will ever duplicate the Band&apos;s big sounds from Thanksgiving 1976. 
 
  
 
&quot;I watched it recently and nobody&apos;s ever going to re-create that night, man,&quot; he said. &quot;Neil Diamond is a buddy of mine and I was asking him about it. It&apos;s just hard to imagine all those people on the stage. Even he said everyone was kind of awed by the gathering that night.&quot; 
 
  
 
Was is playing Rick Danko&apos;s notes for the tour. 
 
  
 
&quot;He was a big influence on me as a young man,&quot; he said. &quot;There&apos;s something very Detroit about his playing in that if you really examine how he&apos;s approaching songs, he&apos;s approaching it like an R&amp;B player. He and Levon, if you just isolated their tracks you&apos;d think you were listening to and R&amp;B group, but the songs that go on top of that groove are quite different to me. That&apos;s the Detroit tradition. I grew up with Mitch Ryder, who&apos;s a rock &apos;n&apos; roll guy but had a very serious R&amp;B foundation, that&apos;s kind of the Detroit sound.&quot; 
 
  
 
Waltz musicians want to be respectful and faithful to the original versions, but they also want to take possession of the tunes, if only for a short time. 
 
  
 
&quot;The songs lend themselves to stretching,&quot; Was said. &quot;So far, we&apos;ve done this three times and every time the songs have been different.&quot; 
 
  
 
He hopes Robertson and Hudson find their ways to one of the shows. He has already prepared himself for that feeling - playing music for the people who made it famous. 
 
  
 
&quot;A couple years ago I was the music director on a CBS show that celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Beatles being on Ed Sullivan and McCartney and Ringo were on the show,&quot; Was said. &quot;When McCartney wasn&apos;t playing bass, I was and for a lot of it he was sitting in the front row and I knew he was going to be sitting right in front of me; I also knew I wouldn&apos;t be a bass player if it wasn&apos;t for Paul McCartney, so I was determined to treat the songs respectfully and I studied like crazy, man. I got the Beatle multi-tracks isolated, learned his parts and  listened to what he does now. 
 
  
 
&quot;Sometimes, things just happened on the day of the sessions and never recurred,&quot; Was added, &quot;but some of the parts are essential, you learn to distill the essential from the things that just happened in the moment and I was OK with it. It was intimidating in concert, but I was prepared for it.&quot; 
 
  
 
Was believes Robertson and Hudson would be happy with the &quot;Waltz&quot; bands&apos; re-creation. &quot;I&apos;ve heard Robbie likes it and I&apos;ve played with Garth ... it would be great if both those guys showed up,&quot; Was said. &quot;If they were sitting in the front row I&apos;d go down and grab them and make them play.&quot; 
 
  
 
Anyone could be leading the band. Haynes, long known for his associations with the Allmans, the Dicky Betts Band and Dead and Friends, co-founded Gov&apos;t Mule in 1994. Michael McDonald and Jamey Johnson have also led their own bands. 
 
  
 
&quot;You could call anyone the musical director,&quot; Was said of the Waltz band, which will close its quick tour Feb. 4 in Washington. &quot;Warren and I were there first, so we took it.&quot; 
 
  
 
All the guys are just happy to have a spot on stage, and playing in a group that only rarely convenes. Everyone&apos;s working, there are obligations for other projects, but a chance to play &quot;Last Waltz&quot; songs was a powerful incentive. 
 
  
 
&quot;Everybody cleared the time,&quot; Was said. &quot;This is just about fun.&quot;
