<content type="str">A server at a Kentucky Buffalo Wild Wings restaurant was shocked to see what a customer left in place of a tip. 
 
According to LGBTQ Nation, Kyle Griffith was working at a Louisville Buffalo Wild Wings, when he got a surprising note in place of a tip. The server says prior to the incident, it was just a normal night like any other.

Griffith served a table of two young girls and says everything went well with their meal and his service. 
 
&quot;I ended up cashing them out, gave them boxes, told them if they needed anything else before they headed out to let me know,&quot; Griffith told WDRB.

After the two girls left the restaurant, Griffith saw what was written on the receipt in place of a tip.  
 
The receipt read, &quot;Sorry I don&apos;t tip f*****s #uNeedJesus.&quot; 
 

 
&quot;It just crushed me that someone could say something like that,&quot; Kyle said. 
 
He added, &quot;To see that coming from someone so much younger than me, just the hate instilled within the, it hurt me very deeply.&quot; 
 
Griffith shared a photo of the receipt on his Facebook page and was surprised to see how much attention the post had received the next morning. 
 
The server says he hopes that his post will help raise awareness of the hate he regularly receives as a gay man. 
 
&quot;I want to be able to tell everyone that this is not a lie, that this is truth, this is an everyday happening,&quot; Griffith said. &quot;It&apos;s an occurrence that... can&apos;t happen any longer. It&apos;s got to stop. The hate has to stop. There&apos;s not reason for it.&quot; 
 
Buffalo Wild Wings released a statement regarding the incident. 
 
&quot;We&apos;re disappointed to learn about the comment left on a receipt by a Guest at one of our independently owned franchise locations in Louisville recently, the company&apos;s statement reads. &quot;Because Buffalo Wild Winds is about creating a great guest experience, we feel strongly that our restaurant environment needs to be respectful in order to provide the experience that out Guests and Team Members expect and deserve.&quot; 
 
Griffith said that Buffalo Wild Wings was very supportive of him following the incident. 
 
&quot;They told me that if I needed anything I could come and talk to them, so its just been an amazing outpour of support and love from everybody around,&quot; Kyle said.  
 
The customer who wrote the note commented on Griffith&apos;s Facebook post, he says.  
 
&quot;She did apologize and said that it was a joke and that it shouldn&apos;t have a been a joke and that she felt bad for it,&quot; Griffith said. &quot;It&apos;s not something you should joke about. My sexual preference at all shouldn&apos;t be something someone should joke about.&quot;</content>
