<content type="str">Sam Carter says Christian Lealiifano will still be the Brumbies&apos; leader even if he can&apos;t play this year. 

ACT Brumbies lock Sam Carter says he will relish the challenge of being the club&apos;s captain if he is given the role for the Super Rugby season, but insists Christian Lealiifano is still the team&apos;s leader.

Carter took the captaincy reins for the first time in the and stepped up in the absence of several key Wallabies.

Brumbies coach Stephen Larkham is still deciding who will replace Lealiifano and Stephen Moore as the on-field skipper for the Super Rugby campaign, which starts on February 25.

It&apos;s unlikely Lealiifano will play this season as he continues his treatment for leukaemia, but the respected playmaker will still have a significant role at the club.

Lealiifano has been touted as a future coach and could become one of Larkham&apos;s assistants while he is recovering.

Carter and the five other players in the senior leadership group will fill the void on the field.

Carter, who is in contract negotiations to extend his Brumbies career, said he was keen to stand up as a leader even if he wasn&apos;t captain.

&quot;I think the Barbarians game was the first time since school that I&apos;ve been captain [of a team],&quot; Carter said.

&quot;I want to be a leader in the pack and in the team. I&apos;ve gradually been building up in leadership roles with [calling] the lineout and things like that.

&quot;But Christian is still the captain when he comes back, whenever that will be. But at the moment I&apos;m happy with the chance if that&apos;s the way Bernie [Larkham] goes.&quot;

The Brumbies&apos; first trial of the year was soured by a Taliauli has a suspected torn anterior cruciate ligament, which can require a nine-month recovery period.

The Brumbies are expected to know by Monday whether Taliauli&apos;s season is over or if they former Australian sevens player can make an impact on the field this year.

The Brumbies will recall their big guns for their next trial against the NSW Waratahs, with Scott Fardy, Scott Sio, Tevita Kuridrani, Allan Alaalatoa and Rory Arnold all set to be included for a trip to Mudgee.

The grudge match against rivals the Waratahs will give the Brumbies a good indication of how their preparations has progressed since the end of last year.

Carter is confident the Brumbies have put the building blocks in place to help cover the loss of departed stars Moore (Queensland), Lealiifano (illness), Matt Toomua (England), David Pocock (sabbatical) and Joe Tomane (France).

But Carter is also one of several Brumbies whose contracts expire at the end of this year and is working with the club to make a decision on his future.

&quot;I&apos;m off at the end of the year and I&apos;m just going to let it play out how it normally does,&quot; Carter said.

&quot;At the moment I&apos;m in no rush. I&apos;ll handle it when it comes I guess.

&quot;It will be good to have a full-strength team against the Waratahs in Mudgee and we&apos;ll get to have a look at how we&apos;re tracking in our training.&quot;

New Zealand rookie Wharenui Hawera in his debut at flyhalf and could form a strong playmaker combination with Kyle Godwin.

&quot;[Hawera] did everything he needed to do out there - carried well, organised the team well and defended well. I thought he was really good,&quot; Larkham said.

&quot;I thought he combined really well with Kyle at 12 so there are some good signs there.&quot;

Nigel Ah Wong will return to Canberra this week after a playing stint in Japan while Andrew Muirhead is set to be retained in the squad to help replace Taliauli for the Waratahs fixture.
