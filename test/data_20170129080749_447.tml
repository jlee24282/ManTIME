Dead Man Winter. &quot; Furnace. &quot; GNDWIRE/Thirty Tigers. 
Dave Simonett has delivered something you almost never see in music: a gorgeous divorce album. Simonett, leader of the progressive bluegrass-rock band Trampled by Turtles, works under the banner of Dead Man Winter on &quot;Furnace&quot; to delve into the dissolution of his marriage and the splintering of his family. It&apos;s a deeply personal album he says he put out only after &quot;a long and violent debate with myself.&quot;From the wrenching first stanza of &quot;This House is On Fire,&quot; Simonett spins the desolate landscape of his heartbreak into art. Cut live-to-tape in rustic Cannon Falls, Minnesota, the album sets achy lyrics against an elegant acoustic backdrop that accentuates the hurt but never veers into self-indulgence.That Simonett delivers it without wallowing in self-pity or defensive rationalizations about why things didn&apos;t work out is a monumental achievement.&quot;Mockingbird, you come to my window, in the dead of night, to see if we&apos;re all right,&quot; he sings with clear-eyed solemnity in the elegiac &quot;Weight of the World.&quot; &quot;The moonlight in your eyes, and then you&apos;re gone.&quot;You&apos;d have to go back decades to find a more cathartic breakup album - perhaps as far as Bob Dylan&apos;s &quot;Blood on the Tracks,&quot; the gold standard for such things.&quot;Furnace&quot; reassures us that the human heart is beautiful even when it&apos;s in anguish. Its memorable anthems to lost intimacy and disconnection will remind those who have been there that they&apos;re not so alone after all.</TEXT>
