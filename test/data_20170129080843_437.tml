<TITLE>Homeless spending days at Denvers libraries find help in the stacks</TITLE>
<TEXT>Acrowd waits outside Denvers Central Library on cold winter mornings, many of them homeless, their backpacks and wheeled luggage carts heavy with necessities of life on the street. 
 
When the doors open at 10 a.m., they rush inside to spend hours reading, resting and using computers to look for work or do other research. 
 
It gets us someplace warm, reasonably safe and we can get work done, said James Short, 51, who regularly meets with two other homeless men in a third-floor conference room to develop a plan that they hope will blossom into a hydroponics business. 
 
Denver Public Librarieshave long been a haven for the homeless  especially during cold weather  making the facilities an ideal place to link them with referrals to housing and other services. But with the numbers of both regular and homeless visitors growing, there is a need tobalance the needs of both populations.

In January, the library added three part-time peer navigators to help provide referrals and free up social workers for more complex interactions. 
 
Dubbed community resource specialists, the social workers served1,265 people last year, referring many to help with housing, substance abuse and mental health treatment, and other services.A service target for this year is 1,620 customers, with 405 of them being juveniles, library spokesman Chris Henning said. 
 
They have been able to intercede in some situations which would have required a police call or someone being bounced from the library, library security manager Bob Knowles said. 
 
However, a hoped-for decline in calls for police and other emergency responders didnt materialize during the same period, Henning said. 
 
Calls to Denver Police jumped 93 percent to 83 from 43 during the period. Callstoother responders for medical emergencies or to take someone to detox, or the fire department for other problems jumped 40.3 percent above 2015 totals, Henning said. The mitigating factor on this has been the influx of new and displaced customers experiencing homelessness, as well as a general increase in library visitors. 
 
Winter is especially difficult for those on the street and weather influences the number who take refuge in the library. Recent sweeps of homeless encampments also produced noticeable temporary jumps in the population. 
 
Andy Cross, The Denver Post Angie, checks text messages in the Denver Central Library. Angie, a homeless woman, came into the library to warm up and use library resources. Andy Cross, The Denver Post For years, staffers have fieldedquestions from people who wanted to know where they could go to get a meal, sleep for the night, find housing, or apply for food stamps or other services. 
 
They felt they were just being reactionary, rather than helping, said Elissa Hardy, one of the librarys social workers. 
 
Library staff did some research and found that library systems in Washington and San Francisco had social workers on staff. The librarys Homeless Services Action Committee recommended hiring a social worker, and Hardy joined the staff. 
 
After one year, we proved the need for this, Hardy said. The Denver City Council in 2016 approved hiring a second full-time social worker, Kristi Schaefer. 
 
The navigators, all of whom havewrestled with their own substance abuse or mental health problems and are now in recovery, are there to establish relationships and help guide the homeless toward help.Those personal struggles make their interactions with the homeless genuine and empathetic, Hardy said. 
 
Navigator Sarah Humble uses her story of recovery from opiate abuse and struggle with a mental disorder, to establish rapport with members of an often mistrustful population. 
 
Humble was involved in a recent meeting with a woman who was barred from the library after assaulting someone who had accidentally bumped into her, Knowles said. 
 
The woman wanted permission to return to the library, and told Knowles she had taken steps toward recovering from a substance abuse problem. Humble told her she was also in recovery and set the foundation for the relationship with the customer, Knowles said. 
 
This gal was at the point where she knew she had an issue, Knowles said, and was so pleased there was somebody in recovery she could talk to. 
 
The navigators are trained and employed by the Colorado Mental Wellness Network. 
 
The resource staff is often called on to de-escalate tensions. When a radio Schaefer carries came to life with news that a security guard was confronting aman washing his hair in a bathroom, an activity that is not allowed, she responded. 
 
She went in and was able to intervene and begin a relationship with him, Hardy said. 
 
Engaging the man in conversation Schaeferlearned that he lost his home after suffering a serious brain injury. 
 
Schaefer referred the man to the Brain Injury Alliance of Colorado and got him into a housing program that gives preference to those considered most vulnerable. The Alliance is on a list of service providers that includes the Colorado Coalition for the Homeless, Veterans Affairs Administration, Mental Health Center of Denver. 
 
The man was given a housing voucher and is now looking for an apartment with the help of his Brain Injury Alliance case manager. 
 
When a suicide note was found sitting by a computer in one of the branch libraries, it was brought to the resource officers attention. 
 
We knew who it was, and were able to get that person help, Hardy said. That has happened three or four times since I have been here. 
 
For librarians, the presence of the resource team has reduced concerns that they were unable to help those those who came to them with questions they werent able to answer, Henningsaid. 
 
Andy Cross, The Denver Post Folks, mostly homeless men and women, line up and wait to enter the Denver Central Library to warm up and to use their resources. Library visitors are required to follow rules that include no sleeping or leaving personal property unattended. 
 
In April, the library placed a three-bag, or 30-inch height limit on bags brought into the facility, ensuring that shopping carts filled with possessions dont impedemovement. 
 
The restriction can lead to disputes. One morning recently a man who gave his name as Rabbit,arrived pulling a couple of small bags fastened to aluggage cart with a bungee cord. 
 
A security guard measured the bundle, and found it was slightly more than 30 inches tall. He was allowed to stay but told to reduce its height before he returns. 
 
Rabbit thinks the rules are arbitrary, but said security guards try to be fair. 
 
Hardy and Schaefer train librarians and security guards on managing patrons who have experienced trauma, and give them information on how to shed the stress of dealing with those who have been traumatized. You can work through your day and think you are not affected by that but you are, Hardy said. 
 
The homeless also act as librarians eyes and ears, letting them know when someone is in trouble, or causing a problem, Hardy said. 
 
Hardy said she tries to impress on others how resilient the homeless are. By the time many of them arrive at the library, they have already struggled through difficulties that most never encounter. 
 
Whether they are sleeping on the street or in a shelter, they are likely to be awakened at 4:30 or 5 a.m. They have to pack up belongings, and carry them with them throughout the day, and they must find something to eat, and decide where they will spend the day. 
 
When we open at 10 every morning they have already had a full day, Hardy said. Just to recognize that is huge.</TEXT>
