<TITLE>Sunday in the Park with George</TITLE>
<TEXT>With a practically bare, white playing space as a blank 
canvas, Zoetic Stages Stuart Meltzer, his cast and crew have fashioned 
a gorgeous work of art in the award-winning Miami companys current 
production of Stephen Sondheim and James Lapines masterpiece 
 . 
 
The Pulitzer-Prize-winning musical, which also won the Olivier Award 
for Best Musical, is playing the Carnival Studio Theater, located in 
Miamis Adrienne Arsht Center through Feb. 12. 
 
This production, the South Florida premiere of the musical, combines 
striking stage pictures, stark lighting by Rebecca Montero, eye- 
catching video projections by Greg Duffy and top-notch singing voices 
from a talented cast of veterans and younger thespians who nail 
Sondheims complex music. They are accompanied by a vibrant, live 
orchestra. 
 
Individually, cast members have rangy, expressive voices. But like the 
painting technique at the center of the musical, the individual voices 
beautifully coalesce, especially to sing the shows best 
song, the stately Sunday. 
 
On several Sundays during the late 1800s, French painter Georges 
Seurat gathers at a park on an island in the Seine river to prepare his 
notable painting A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La 
Grande Jatte. Sound effects of chirping birds, created by sound 
designer Dan Mayer, reinforce the serene atmosphere. 
 
Seurat created the work, considered his most famous, in the form of a 
painting technique called Pointillism. It involves small, separate dots of 
color applied in patterns to form an image. 
 
The image mostly comprises members of the French bourgeoisie 
relaxing on lazy, sunny Sundays on the island. 
 
In the show, the paintings subjects spring to life, commenting on 
various subjects, including Seurats endless concentration 
while he works to paint likenesses of the people 
Director Meltzers smart staging includes ensuring a separation exists 
on-stage between the aloof Seurat (Cooper Grodin) and the rest of the 
characters. 
 
With his dark hair, beard, black costume, lowered eyebrows and sharp, 
bossy voice, Grodin projects a brooding, even dictatorial air. Hes 
commanding toward those he is painting, particularly his love interest, 
Dot (Kimberly Doreen Burns). Its clear his Seurat is deeply 
committed to Finishing the Hat. 
 
Grodin projects a dark and serious aura without making his character 
unlikable. Like his painting, his performance is multi-colored, with 
injections of charm and playfulness. 
 
As Dot, Kimberly Doreen Burns invests her character with impatience 
and exasperation at Seurats demands and neglect of her. But Burns 
also communicates her characters devotion to Seurat, at one point 
seductively touching his body from the top to the bottom, as though 
hes a work of art himself. 
 
The first act takes place in 1884, while the second fast forwards to a 
museum in 1984 New York City. 
In the latter, Georges great-grandson, named George, is a struggling 
painter trying to preserve his ancestors painting. With him is Georges 
and Dots now-elderly daughter, Marie (also played by Burns, who 
looks too young and acts too vibrant in the role). 
The importance of art as a family legacy and the challenge of 
producing art are among the timeless themes in Act II. 
George is played by Grodin with a strong sense of commitment and a 
sense hes burdened by the hard task of producing art. Grodin makes it 
clear theres a weight on this mans shoulders to preserve his great- 
grandfathers legacy. 
 
Art isnt easy, are lyrics that are repeated in the song Putting it 
Together. Its sung by Multiple characters, including George. The song, 
like others in the musical, showcases Sondheims brilliant rhymes and 
elegant lyrics. 
 
Perhaps the lyrics that really draw us into the musical are the following: 
White. A blank page of canvasSo many possibilities. 
In Zoetics production, George sings the lyrics So many possibilities, 
in a whisper, but with an ardent enthusiasm suggesting a treasure 
chests worth of tempting choices. 
Maybe arts infinite possibilities make it so tempting to try to create.</TEXT>
