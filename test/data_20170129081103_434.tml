<content type="str">With a practically bare, white playing space as a blank 
canvas, Zoetic Stage’s Stuart Meltzer, his cast and crew have fashioned 
a gorgeous work of art in the award-winning Miami company’s current 
production of Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine’s masterpiece 
“ .” 
 
The Pulitzer-Prize-winning musical, which also won the Olivier Award 
for Best Musical, is playing the Carnival Studio Theater, located in 
Miami’s Adrienne Arsht Center through Feb. 12. 
 
This production, the South Florida premiere of the musical, combines 
striking stage pictures, stark lighting by Rebecca Montero, eye- 
catching video projections by Greg Duffy and top-notch singing voices 
from a talented cast of veterans and younger thespians who nail 
Sondheim’s complex music. They are accompanied by a vibrant, live 
orchestra. 
 
Individually, cast members’ have rangy, expressive voices. But like the 
painting technique at the center of the musical, the individual voices 
beautifully coalesce, especially to sing the show’s best 
song, the stately “Sunday.” 
 
On several Sundays during the late 1800s, French painter Georges 
Seurat gathers at a park on an island in the Seine river to prepare his 
notable painting “A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La 
Grande Jatte.” Sound effects of chirping birds, created by sound 
designer Dan Mayer, reinforce the serene atmosphere. 
 
Seurat created the work, considered his most famous, in the form of a 
painting technique called Pointillism. It involves small, separate dots of 
color applied in patterns to form an image. 
 
The image mostly comprises members of the French bourgeoisie 
relaxing on lazy, sunny Sundays on the island. 
 
In the show, the painting’s subjects spring to life, commenting on 
various subjects, including Seurat’s endless concentration 
while he works to paint likenesses of the people 
Director Meltzer’s smart staging includes ensuring a separation exists 
on-stage between the aloof Seurat (Cooper Grodin) and the rest of the 
characters. 
 
With his dark hair, beard, black costume, lowered eyebrows and sharp, 
bossy voice, Grodin projects a brooding, even dictatorial air. He’s 
commanding toward those he is painting, particularly his love interest, 
Dot (Kimberly Doreen Burns). It’s clear his Seurat is deeply 
committed to “Finishing the Hat.” 
 
Grodin projects a dark and serious aura without making his character 
unlikable. Like his painting, his performance is multi-colored, with 
injections of charm and playfulness. 
 
As Dot, Kimberly Doreen Burns invests her character with impatience 
and exasperation at Seurat’s demands and neglect of her. But Burns 
also communicates her character’s devotion to Seurat, at one point 
seductively touching his body from the top to the bottom, as though 
he’s a work of art himself. 
 
The first act takes place in 1884, while the second fast forwards to a 
museum in 1984 New York City. 
In the latter, Georges’ great-grandson, named George, is a struggling 
painter trying to preserve his ancestor’s painting. With him is Georges’ 
and Dot’s now-elderly daughter, Marie (also played by Burns, who 
looks too young and acts too vibrant in the role). 
The importance of art as a family legacy and the challenge of 
producing art are among the timeless themes in Act II. 
George is played by Grodin with a strong sense of commitment and a 
sense he’s burdened by the hard task of producing art. Grodin makes it 
clear there’s a weight on this man’s shoulders to preserve his great- 
grandfather’s legacy. 
 
“Art isn’t easy,” are lyrics that are repeated in the song “Putting it 
Together.” It’s sung by Multiple characters, including George. The song, 
like others in the musical, showcases Sondheim’s brilliant rhymes and 
elegant lyrics. 
 
Perhaps the lyrics that really draw us into the musical are the following: 
“White. A blank page of canvas…So many possibilities.” 
In Zoetic’s production, George sings the lyrics “So many possibilities,” 
in a whisper, but with an ardent enthusiasm suggesting a treasure 
chest’s worth of tempting choices. 
Maybe art’s infinite possibilities make it so tempting to try to create.</content>
