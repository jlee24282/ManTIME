<content type="str">Deutsche Post DHL Group and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance , today announced a global partnership to help improve vaccine supply chains in Gavi-supported countries. 
 
As immunization programs expand to include new, life-saving vaccines and strive to reach more people, often in remote areas, they are increasingly constrained by outdated supply chains. With vaccine volumes continuing to increase and the persistence of often weak or broken health systems, there is a critical need for improvements in immunization supply chain infrastructure. 
 
Over the next three years, the new partnership will be vital in helping to provide countries with efficient supply chain solutions to improve health care delivery. Deutsche Post DHL Group’s industry leading logistics expertise in life sciences and healthcare combined with the global DHL transportation network will help countries overcome challenges, and make the vaccine supply chain more efficient. This can help countries increase immunization coverage, reduce vaccine wastage and better ensure vaccine availability and potency and will ultimately help reduce child mortality. 
 
Kenya is one of the first countries to benefit from the new partnership, announcing a new initiative with DHL, the logistics unit of Deutsche Post DHL Group. Gavi and DHL, toegehter with the Kenyan Ministry of Health will test a dedicated transportation management solution for the efficient distribution of vaccines throughout the East African country. Incorporating a control tower called a Transport Support Hub, to better manage and coordinate third-party transport carriers and the use of DHL’s own global transportation network, the solution will improve the speed and reliability of vaccine deliveries to hospitals, clinics and medical professionals in the country. 
 
“We are proud to support Gavi in its important societal role,” said Frank Appel, CEO of Deutsche Post DHL Group. “This enhanced relationship will allow Deutsche Post DHL Group to contribute its world class supply chain expertise and network towards making a real difference to vaccine distribution in the developing world – and, with this, to improve lives.” 
 
Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, emphasized the importance of this partnership. “Robust vaccine supply chains are a vital part of building strong health systems, so that children, parents, and communities can be reached wherever they live with life-saving vaccines,” he said. “DHL’s expertise in healthcare delivery and its footprint in sub-Saharan Africa will help the partnership develop and test new innovative solutions aimed at increasing the health impact in Gavi-supported countries.” 
 
This project aligns directly with Gavi’s private sector engagement strategy, which seeks to build a cluster of a private sector partners to address critical bottlenecks to immunisation coverage and equity in Gavi-supported countries. By focusing the skills, expertise, and technology of the private sector on the immunisation supply chain, data quality, and demand generation, Gavi aims to accelerate progress and achieve lasting impact. 
 
Deutsche Post DHL Group’s new engagement with Gavi is guided by the Shared Value proposition, the notion that Deutsche Post DHL Group and Gavi can partner to contribute to society and the environment while, at the same time, contributing to the success of Deutsche Post DHL Group’s business.
