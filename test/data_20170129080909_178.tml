<content type="str">Following the improvement in the weather, the highway was cleared off snow and debris left by landslides and one-way traffic was allowed this morning. The arterial Srinagar-Jammu National Highway was thrown open for one-way traffic today, five days after snowfall in the Valley had led to the closure of the only all-weather road link between Kashmir and the rest of the country. “The Srinagar-Jammu National Highway has been opened for traffic and vehicles have been allowed to ply from Jammu towards Srinagar,” an official of the Traffic Control department told PTI. He said following the improvement in the weather, the highway was cleared off snow and debris left by landslides and one-way traffic was allowed this morning. The nearly 300-km road was closed for traffic in the wake of snowfall on Tuesday. It remained shut for five days, choking the supply of essentials to the Valley where prices of these commodities have more than doubled in the past week.

Kashmir experienced fresh snowfall on Tuesday which continued intermittently yesterday as well.

While morning flights were delayed yesterday, all afternoon flights were cancelled due to snowfall.This morning as well, the flights have been delayed, an official at the airport said.
