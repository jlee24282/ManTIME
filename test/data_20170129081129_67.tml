<TEXT type="str">A new race to space is on this year — a private-sector one, among the five finalists in the Google Lunar XPRIZE competition. 
 
To stay in the race, each team must initiate its moon launch by Dec. 31, 2017. To win, its craft must land on luna — and a probe must move at least 500 meters (1,640 feet) and send hi-resolution images of its exploration back to earth. 
 
The winner gets the $20 million grand prize, while runners-up split a $1 million consolation award. 
 
It’s already taking a bit longer than hoped — rules that required a complete finish by the Dec. 31 deadline just got loosened to give the competitors a bit more time. 
 
But the goal is still remarkable: landing a high-tech mobile probe on the moon, 238,900 miles away. The Chinese government, with all its vast resources and desire to win global respect, pulled it off in 2013 — but the last (non-crash) landing before that was in 1976. 
 
The five teams include one international one, Synergy Moon, with members from 15-plus countries, as well as the Israeli SpaceIL, the California-based Moon Express, India’s Team Indus and Japan’s Hakuto. 
 
Each has its rocket booked (Team Indus and Hakuto are actually sharing their flight) and the contract verified by X Prize, which sponsors a variety of technical contests aimed at building a better future. 
 
Established in 2007, the competition is meant to push a lowering of the cost of spaceflight — while also inspiring the world’s scientists and engineers. 
 
Once this competition is won, it’ll be time for a race to get live astronauts back to luna: It’s been far too long (45 years!) since the late Gene Cernan walked on the moon. 
 
Government programs alone will never establish a real human presence off-planet: That will require a private sector that can make it pay. The Google Lunar XPRIZE promises a giant step toward that brilliant future.
