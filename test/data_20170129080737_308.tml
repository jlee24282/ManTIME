Horan was chatting to the guys over at Heat, when he said, &quot;I&apos;ve been doing it for a while. I recorded &apos;What Makes You Beautiful&apos; in my boxers. &apos;What Makes You Beautiful&apos; was the first time I did it because it was really warm in the studio, and I&apos;ve done it ever since.&quot; 

While many of the One Direction boys have been involved in long term and high profile relationships, Niall Horan has been linked to a number of different women. It was recently claimed that Niall Horan and Ellie Goulding are dating, although both parties have come out and insisted that they are just good friends.</TEXT>
