<TEXT type="str">Billings Skyview&apos;s drive home from Bozeman was a long one. 

The top-ranked Falcons fell to the third-ranked Hawks in double-overtime Friday night, and didn&apos;t get back into Billings until 1 a.m. Saturday.

The team had a shoot-around at 9 a.m., but then held a team breakfast at Montana Jacks to lighten the mood.

Skyview coach Kevin Morales said that was a turning point for the team&apos;s spirits.

&quot;That kind of set the tone and gave us a good feel,&quot; he said. &quot;We got back to smiling and laughing and joking around again. That was important for us to get our heads back straight and understand that losses happen, and if anything, Bozeman&apos;s a dang good team for us to drop one too.

&quot;I felt like the kids did a good job of responding today.&quot;

That response led the Falcons (9-1, 4-1) to bouncing back from Friday&apos;s loss with a 52-38 grind-it-out victory over the surging Class A Laurel Locomotives (8-3, 5-1) in Skyview&apos;s gym. 

RayQuan Evans led all scorers with 23 points in a game where fouls were aplenty. The teams combined for 51 free throws, 35 by Skyview.

It wasn&apos;t a pretty win, but it was a win nonetheless.

&quot;It was much needed,&quot; Evans said. &quot;We were all kind of bummed out last night and we knew what Laurel would bring. This is a big one being on our home court so we really wanted to get this one.&quot;

Senior Jerelle Big Hair, who has seen some big minutes off of the bench for the Falcons lately, knocked down a 3-pointer right before the first quarter ended, giving Skyview a 13-12 lead. The Falcons never trailed again.

Evans took over in the second quarter, scoring 11 of his points in the period to give Skyview a 28-20 halftime lead. Zharon Richmond also added 10 points for the Falcons. 

The Falcons sealed the win with a poster dunk from Evans with about a minute left in the game.

For Skyview, it was nice to get back in the win column. 

&quot;Losing a tough game like that, especially in double-overtime, it&apos;s tough, but it&apos;s always onto the next, even if it&apos;s a win,&quot; Evans said. 

Christian Jones had nine points to lead Laurel. The Locomotives, who took down Hardin 66-60 on Thursday, saw their seven-game winning streak snapped. 

Laurel starter Layne Willis missed the game due to sickness.

&quot;The bottom line is we told our kids is we&apos;re disappointed with the fire in our belly and our effort tonight,&quot; Laurel coach Pat Hansen said. &quot;I don&apos;t think individually our kids came out trying to play their best basketball and we don&apos;t do that against a good team like Skyview. This is the result that happens.&quot;</TEXT>
