<TEXT type="str">All Black Sevens finish 6th after last minute try leads to 17-12 lose to Argentina. 
  
Sixth has a pretty unpalatable look about it. 
 
Fifth would&apos;ve been bad enough, but New Zealand couldn&apos;t even manage that at the Wellington Sevens, losing 17-12 to Argentina in their final match of the weekend. 
 
A Regan Ware try, set up by Vilimoni Koroi, got New Zealand underway, before a converted Lautaro Bazan Velez try gave Argentina a 7-5 halftime lead. Captain Scott Curry restored the host&apos;s lead after the break and then the game ebbed and flowed until Bazan Velez went in again to make it 12-12. 
 
But another New Zealand turnover settle the issue and Franco Sabato won the match for Argentina with a try in the corner. 
 
  
   
  
  
Having won the last three editions of this event, finishing sixth wasn&apos;t particularly impressive. However there were encouraging signs in the shape of forward Iopu Iopu-Aso and playmaker Koroi. 
 
Koroi is just out of Feilding High School, but his Wellington cameos suggest the 18-year-old has talent. 
 
Talent of the sort that made Manawatu&apos;s Tomasi Cama one of the most feared ball-players on the sevens circuit. Cama is now co-coach of New Zealand and picked Koroi despite him not appearing at the recent national tournament. 
 
&quot;He&apos;s probably better than me,&quot; Cama said of Koroi. 
  
The teenager produced some magical touches to guide New Zealand to a 24-0 win over England in their fifth-place semifinal and looks to have a bit to offer, having played on the wing for New Zealand Secondary Schools last year. 
 
&quot;This is his first tournament and for a young fella he looks like he&apos;s been playing for a few years now. There&apos;s always things to work on and hopefully he&apos;s going to kick on from now,&quot; said Cama. 
 
&quot;When you look at playmakers, obviously they can pass, they can kick. But one thing they do have, they do have time when they have the ball and that&apos;s when they look forward and make decisions.&quot; 
 
It&apos;s Koroi&apos;s composure that really excites Cama. 
 
&quot;At this stage I don&apos;t have to do a lot. He&apos;s got all the talent. If anything it&apos;s just the little things we can work on off the field to make sure that he gets out there and does what he does best.&quot; 
 
Koroi can&apos;t quite believe this is happening. He grew up idolising players such as Cama and team-mates DJ Forbes and Tim Mikkelson. Being picked for Wellington was one thing, but the idea he might play - and play well - was quite another. 
 
&quot;I&apos;ve been very nervous playing out there. Very nervous,&quot; Koroi said. 
 
It&apos;s just that he hasn&apos;t played like a nervous bloke. 
 
&quot;Just like Junior [Cama] says, when you get out on the field just play your game [and] stay calm under pressure, because you&apos;re a playmaker.&quot;</TEXT>
