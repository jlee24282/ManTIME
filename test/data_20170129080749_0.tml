<content type="str">Approximately 1.5 million women untie the knot in America each year. Many of them start the process in January, a month when the divorce rate rises by roughly one-third. 
 
Yet the resources available fall surprisingly short in offering the support and sense of understanding that these women need, said Jill Sockwell, a 1994 graduate of Marion Center High School who grew up in Home and now lives in Maplewood, N.J., near New York City. 
 
Community, she said, is the one thing that can turn the shattering experience of divorce into a tolerable and ultimately a positive one. 
 
She writes about the community who helped her and co-author Suzanne Riss in a new book, “The Optimist’s Guide to Divorce: How to Get Through Your Breakup and Create a New Life You Love” ($14.95). 
 
When Sockwell separated from her husband in 2010, she planned to read her way through the pain and learn from the experiences of divorced women who preceded her. 
 
What she found were clinical tomes written by counselors and lawyers, and memoirs written by wealthy women who went on worldwide quests of self-discovery. She did not find uplifting advice from women who survived their divorces and shared their lessons in how to forge a realistic path to a new and better place. 
 
That’s because this book didn’t exist. 
 
When Riss started this same process a year later, a mutual friend introduced her to Sockwell, allowing the two of them to become this necessary resource for each other. Realizing that other women could use the kind of support they were giving each other, Sockwell and Riss created the Maplewood Divorce Club, offering conversation, a sense of community, guest speakers and advice to women seeking divorce. 
 
The group was successful beyond their wildest dreams and has been growing ever since. 
 
Their book offers advice from its members, women who know what it feels like to go through divorce, who understand the practical issues as well as the emotional ones, and who can help the reader keep a sense of hope and a sense of humor. 
 
It also offers a powerful, uplifting message, Sockwell said: The end of a significant relationship is the best time to introduce positive change in your life. 
 
Packed with practical advice, smart strategies, and memorable personal stories from a diverse circle of 12 women, the book is broken into three sections. 
 
The first, Deal, focuses on what readers need to know right away: how to tell the kids, confront finances, figure out where to live, find legal help, and emotionally get through the day. The second section, Heal, helps readers work through their anger, loss and sadness and develop an action plan for the future; and the third, Reveal, celebrates the hard work and a new, stronger self with advice on creating your own community, dating and exploring new relationships. 
 
In addition to writing the book, Sockwell is a senior sales associate with Keller Williams Mid-Town Direct Realty.
