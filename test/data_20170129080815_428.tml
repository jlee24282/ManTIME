<content type="str">SIOUX CITY — The Sioux City International Film Festival (SCIFF) Board announced 67 short films from 12 countries​ and 17 states have been selected for screening at the 13th annual festival, to be held Feb. 19–25. 
 
T​he board also announced guest speakers and an expanded ​lineup of events. 
 
“Our new slogan is ‘Bringing the world’s movies to Sioux City,’ and this year’s film entries certainly support it,” said Tim Bottaro, festival co-founder and board president. “We have films from places as far flung as Rwanda, Guam, Romania, Australia, and Finland. And the quality of these movies is the best we’ve ever seen in our 13 years of putting on this festival. For the judges, the selection process was extremely difficult. There were so many more great films that we could not include because we don’t have time to show them.” 
 
Bottaro said the filmmakers will be notified of their selection by Feb. 1. The Festival Board will make a separate announcement at that time of the films that have been included. 
 
“Also new this year are local and national speakers, workshops, and parties after the screenings,” Bottaro said. In addition, several filmmakers will be present during the Festival to talk with their audiences at the fest.
