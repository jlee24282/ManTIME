The thing I love about Abilene is our residents’ willingness to allow people their own beliefs and opinions even if they are different than theirs. 
 
The people of Abilene have a devout love for God and a desire to live up to God’s expectations, as well as to hold the dignity and respect of all humanity as an important value.  All the faiths represented in the Abilene community promote the love of God and stress its reflection in our loving actions toward one another. It is also a city where people seek out an understanding of other faiths, ideas and political opinions. 
 
So, in a city that prides itself in living its spiritual values and understanding those of others, I am often asked  what position my church, Exodus Metropolitan Community Church, has on various issues. The election and the new administration was no exception. 
 
As a church and as individuals, we respect the office of president,whether held by a Republican, Democrat or Independent. As individuals, we may agree or disagree with candidates on various policies. Collectively, we take our responsibility to vote seriously, and we encourage people to speak out when they believe human rights are being violated, or the people of the country are being hurt, bullied or forgotten. 
 
We also have a homeless outreach as well as several educational outreaches to raise awareness and meet needs in our community and abroad. As a church, locally and internationally, we stand and support the following ideas which we believe to be in keeping with the will of God. 
 
●     First and foremost, Exodus MCC believes in an inclusive, loving God who sees no racial, national or gender boundaries. We are required to love God with all our being and our neighbor as ourselves. We believe that love is not just a feeling but a feeling translated into action that meets the needs of others. An inauguration is about beginnings, but EMCC has never stopped holding up its core values of human rights, respect, and freedom that are basic to the teachings of Jesus whose life and teachings we follow. 
 
In regards to political and social actions, we: 
 
● hold any administration — local, state, or national — accountable for harmful policies and actions. We speak out, meet with our representatives, and let our dream for a whole and healthy country be known to our elected officials. 
 
● believe any violent rhetoric and actions are not partisan politics but dangerous tactics, which create a climate of intolerance and hate. We require that the dignity of all persons be respected. 
 
● name and reject the rising tide of hate crimes against immigrants, people of color, Muslims, the aged, handicapped, LGBTQ people and any other individual or group targeted because of who or what they are. 
 
● deplore the use of derogatory labels. Hateful labels shatter public discourse. Name-calling is the infancy of bullying which evolves into action. If we don&apos;t stand up for those being targeted, how can we expect to be defended? 
 
●  would like to see America whole — through health care for all, through women&apos;s health and reproductive rights, through immigrant family reunion, through defending the integrity of Native lands, through support for public schools, jobs  for all, elder care, racial justice and care for the planet.
