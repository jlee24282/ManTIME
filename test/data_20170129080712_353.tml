FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
 
Federal Minister for Education’s first steps toward compulsory Year 1 assessment show commendable caution 
 
The Association of Heads of Independent Schools of Australia (AHISA) has welcomed the announcement by the federal Minister for Education, Senator the Hon Simon Birmingham, that an expert advisory panel has been established to inform the development and implementation of a national Year 1 assessment of students’ literacy and numeracy skills. 
 
‘The advisory panel’s terms of reference indicate that the federal government is taking a cautious approach to compulsory Year 1 assessment,’ said AHISA CEO Ms Beth Blackwood. ‘There is to be a review of current research on best practice in early years assessment and – most welcome – the option for an initial pilot study.’ 
 
Ms Blackwood said evaluations of the compulsory Phonics Check operating in the United Kingdom indicated that this caution was warranted. 
 
‘Australia should not adopt the British – or any other – assessment model until its suitability for the Australian context is fully tested,’ said Ms Blackwood. ‘The UK model has been criticised by academics and educators for its failure to provide teachers with more information on students’ phonic skills than is already available through regular testing. Further, its focus on phonics skills means it adds little to teachers’ knowledge of students’ reading skills.’ 
 
Ms Blackwood said that the advisory group’s terms of reference also indicate that consultations will be held with professional associations for principals and for teachers of relevant subjects. 
 
‘If the Australian Government is to introduce a testing regime that will produce useful data to help inform classroom practice then consultations with principals and teachers will be vital,’ said Ms Blackwood. ‘AHISA looks forward to contributing to those consultations.’
