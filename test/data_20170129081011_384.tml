<content type="str">Trump says that the media thumped him. I say that it is closer to the truth to say that the media made him. Even my remark is only a partial truth.   
 
The media made Trump in at least two ways .First, the media made him a celebrity through his TV shows, gave him national name recognition, one of the things most necessary to get someone elected. Second, the media gave him &quot;yuuuge&quot; amounts of publicity. Okay, maybe he earned that publicity by talking dirty and using glittering generalities, a well known ploy in advertising, as well as gloom and doom generalities. He said that blacks were living in hell and asked what they had to lose. 
 
Other propaganda techniques he used included the plain folks appeal and scapegoating. We know what historical figure blamed all problems on the Jews. Trump blamed them on the media. He carried the plain folks appeal to a new low, saying or implying this: &quot;I am just as much a narrow-minded, foul mouthed, mean-spirited &quot;male chauvinist pig&quot; as the lowest construction worker, whom I may have hired illegally.&quot;  
 
David Brooks said that those in the defense, diplomatic, and intelligence branches of the government should &quot;devise systems to prevent him from stumbling... into a global disaster.&quot; Here&apos;s a better idea. A majority of his live audience should shun him, give him the silent treatment, deny him any positive feedback, while showing proper respect the way a private would show respect to his superiors.  Positive feedback from a live audience, like those at his rallies, is to Mr. Trump what blood is to a vampire.
