<content type="str">The first season of Vuzu&apos;s hip-hop talent search, The Hustle, saw AKA coming on board as a judge (and one of the most vocal at that) but he&apos;ll be adding one more role to his roster come season 2.  
  
In addition to the show&apos;s second season now airing on Mzansi Magic, Times Live reports AKA will come on board as an executive producer of The Hustle.  
 
This will require him to come up with concepts and ideas for the challenges that contestants will have to face each week. 
 
He was actually the one who approached the channel with his ideas for the upcoming season and they welcomed him on board with open arms.  
 
&quot;I felt like I had something to give and told them my ideas to make the show bigger and better. Luckily, they agreed,&quot; he told Times Live.  

 
He&apos;s not the only one who gets to add a producer credit to his resume.  
 
ProVerb will double up as a presenter and co-executive producer on the upcoming season of Idols SA .  
  
This isn&apos;t the first time he&apos;ll be stepping into those producer shoes. He did have a hand in producing the last season of Idols SA and MNet loved his work so much that his production company was given a few more shows to produce for M-Net in the coming year.  
 
The same goes for former Gang of Instrumentals band member, Mandla N who runs Black Brain Productions alongside his partner, Tumi Masemola .  
 
The production company has even won a few SAFTA&apos;s and are currently filming episodes of prison drama, Lockdown, for Mzansi Magic and Ses&apos;top La for SABC 1.
