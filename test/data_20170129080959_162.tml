<content type="str">FOXBORO - Who needs a Super Bowl? Martellus Bennett can entertain the media on a regular, non-descript weekday, let alone on the biggest stage that the NFL has to offer.

&quot;Any chance I get to do the things I love, which is to play football and to be pretty good at it, then I&apos;m always happy,&quot; the Patriots&apos; tight end said Friday. &quot;I try to do the things I love more each day. So whether it&apos;s drawing or writing or watching movies with my family I make sure I make time to do the things I love and not spend the time doing things I don&apos;t love. So I only do the things I love to do.&quot;

One of those is apparently talking, and Bennett is as good at that as he is at playing his position.

That should come in handy during the myriad of media opportunities Bennett will have to entertain the assembled Fourth Estate in his hometown of Houston beginning Monday.

Born in San Diego, but raised in Houston, Bennett attended Texas A&amp;M and played briefly for the Dallas Cowboys. But now, he will have the chance to display his talents at a Super Bowl competed on his own home turf - which, oddly enough, he claims he didn&apos;t envision as he was growing up in this east Texas metropolis.

&quot;I don&apos;t think I was thinking of that as a young kid, with my imagination,&quot; Bennett said. &quot;It was more about dragons and wizards. I just felt that football was what we did. It was what we did.

&quot;In Texas, if you don&apos;t play football, you&apos;re a weirdo,&quot; he added. &quot;I always laugh because I tell people in Texas it&apos;s oil, football and God. So growing up there and just playing football there, it was always something. We didn&apos;t have to imagine it, it&apos;s just what we did.&quot;

But he admitted he may have one of those &quot;welcome to the NFL&quot; moments a week from now even though he&apos;s been in the league since 2008. It is likely to happen in the moments before the Patriots take on the Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl LI, and it will help if the retractable roof at NRG Stadium is open at the time.

&quot;I have that moment before every game,&quot; he said. &quot;Just being in the moment and being present, one of my favorite parts of the game is when the planes fly over the stadium. It just reminds me of everything I went through to get to where I am. Building trust with my teammates and the guys on the other team&apos;s sideline, everyone put in so much work to get to where we are. So it seems like that moment before every game, and I&apos;m pretty sure this one won&apos;t be any different.&quot;

While the Super Bowl will be a new experience for him, the Bennett family has already been represented at two of them. Older brother Michael went to back-to-back Super Bowls with the Seattle Seahawks, including their loss to the Patriots in Super Bowl XLIX in Phoenix two years ago.

&quot;I really love my brother,&quot; he said. &quot;I&apos;m very proud of him and he&apos;s very proud of me. He&apos;s been a guy that I&apos;ve worked with my entire life because we&apos;re only 16 months apart. So every day that I&apos;ve been on this earth, he&apos;s been by my side and had my back.

&quot;When he went to the Super Bowl, I was talking about all the hard work we put in together and all we&apos;ve done for one another, and I think it was pretty much the same reflection for him when I made it as well,&quot; Bennett continued. &quot;So I&apos;m very proud of him. He&apos;s in the Pro Bowl and, hopefully, he&apos;ll get another Pro Bowl MVP and I&apos;m in my first Super Bowl. We just kind of keep building off each other and picking each other up. We&apos;ve never been competitive with one another, we&apos;ve always been supportive.&quot;

Bennett said he expects that being on the playing-team side of the Super Bowl will be a hoot.

&quot;I don&apos;t know, I&apos;ve never really experienced it,&quot; he said. &quot;I usually do the tour thing when I&apos;m there. So I don&apos;t know what this is going to be like, but the good news is it&apos;ll be a new experience for me and I&apos;ll be the same person I always am and hopefully it&apos;s fun.&quot;</content>
