       Highlights    Shiv Sena questions BJP over Ram temple in Ayodhya.      Why they talk about Ram temple during elections, asks Sanjay Raut.      Scams are happening in Maharashtra, says Raut.     
It seems that the BJP and Shiv Sena are now in an open war while sharing power at the Centre and breaking apart downwards. 
 
Shiv Sena spokesperson Sanjay Raut questioned the BJP over the promise of Ram temple in Ayodhya in its manifesto for Uttar Pradesh polls. 
 
Raut said, &quot;Why do they talk of Ram temple during elections only? Why do you send Ram Lalla into banishment after the polls?&quot;

Shiv Sena also came down heavily on the Maharashtra government and the state BJP. Sanjay Raut alleged that &apos;scams are happening in Maharashtra government.&quot; 
 
Reacting to statements from various BJP leaders against Shiv Sena, Sanjay Raut said, &quot;Those living in glass-house should not throw stones on others.&quot; 
 
His comments came a day after Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis dismissed Shiv Sena as a spent force in the state saying that the BJP would show the &apos;old partner&apos; its might in the upcoming urban body elections.

Responding to another query, Raut said, &quot;BJP ne party mein gunde bhar rakhe hain (BJP has accommodated goondas in the party). 
 
Earlier, Fadnavis had accused Shiv Sena of being involved in extortion and corruption. &quot;You carry the saffron flag in one hand and resort to extortion and corruption. This is not at all acceptable to us,&quot; Fadnavis had said.
