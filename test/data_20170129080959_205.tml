<TEXT type="str">Five of us, all but me a Rooney, were sitting in the North Side’s newest saloon talking about another bar that once stood about 150 yards away.

We got to the Southern Tier on North Shore Drive around 4 p.m. Thursday, just before a crowd had it all but bursting at the doors and just under 104 years after Dan Rooney’s Cafe &amp; Bar had opened on General Robinson Street.

The old place stood about where the entrance to the North Side subway station is now. Dan’s granddaughter, Kathy Rooney, had a map that we had used for a walking tour that was as quick as it was cold, and now we were settling in and passing old photos around our pints.

There was one with Dan in front of his bar circa 1916, the only hatless man among a half-dozen gents who were posing so casually they seemed to be trying to out-jaunty each other. The front of the Rooney bar was festooned with flags, though nobody can be sure now what they were celebrating, and Dan has his hands on the shoulders of his fifth son, Vince, then a grade schooler.

Pittsburghers might know Vince -- whom everyone called “Duke’’ -- better as Art Rooney’s younger brother. It was out of their father’s bar that the eldest of six boisterous brothers and two sisters ventured out to play baseball, box, shoot craps and eventually start a sandlot football team that would evolve into the Pittsburgh Steelers.

My table mates knew the Steelers founder as Uncle Art. They knew Vince as “Daddy.’’ Vince and his wife, Anne, would have seven children. Kathy is the youngest, and two of her older brothers, Jamie and Tom, were with us along with Tom’s son, Josh.

Our walking tour had included a majestic view of the parking lot across Martindale Street from the D.L. Clark Building, because now we were looking at a 1915 photo of a firehouse that once stood there.

That Hope Fire Station at the foot of Monument Hill doubled as the locker room for the Hope Harvey football team, the team Art Rooney ran, and also ran for, while he was still in high school. A hundred years ago, the Hope Harvey boys played in Exposition Park, the stadium the Pirates had abandoned for Forbes Field in 1909.

Expo Park, where the first World Series was played in 1903, stood just west of where PNC Park is now. In fact, the office building where I’m typing this would have been in Expo Park’s right field.

So why am I telling you all this? Because, as a fellow once said, history doesn’t repeat itself -- it stutters.

The neighborhood those Rooneys knew when they lived above the family bar is long gone. Known only as “The Ward’’ to generations of North Siders who lived there, the entire neighborhood was leveled in the 1960s to make way for the opening of Three Rivers Stadium and the obligatory sea of parking surrounding it.

That stadium was blown up 16 years ago. PNC Park and Heinz Field rose on either side, and some of the old street grid was brought back, too, with Stage AE, office buildings, hotels, restaurants and bars filling in along the new and old streets.

Millions now venture each year to what has been relabeled “The North Shore’’ -- some of those millions being the same person a dozen times or more -- but it’s not a real neighborhood. The area is exponentially livelier than it was in the Three Rivers era, but working there can make you feel like you’re just “the backdrop for other people’s good times,’’ as my colleague Chris Potter put it.

Apartments are supposed to go up between the stadiums in 2018, but one high rise won’t make a neighborhood. Still it’s a sign of progress to see people flocking to the North Side when there is no game. Southern Tier Brewing, with roots in western New York, began drawing crowds last week with the promise of no more than beer and fellowship, just as Dan Rooney’s Cafe &amp; Bar had.

When I asked our waitress what was the closest thing the place had to a Guinness, she suggested the 2XStout. It was very good but, after reading the description, I asked Jamie Rooney what his grandfather might have said to a customer who asked for something “rich, caramel and roasty, with high residual sweetness”?

“Why, you lob,” Mr. Rooney said, channeling his grandfather’s voice.

I’m not sure what that means, but I’m sure you could hear it only in a real neighborhood bar. So I had another and then walked up the hill home, passing the ghosts of a fire house and an ancient bar along the way.
