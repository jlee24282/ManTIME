<TITLE>And on the 7th day, Trump violated the first amendment prohibitions against a state religion</TITLE>
<TEXT>How do you destroy a democracy? You do it fast. You do it while people still think traditions have meaning. You do it while people still expect policies to be followed. You do it while people still believe that institutions have value. And if it takes coming in on a weekend to erase democracy you make that sacrifice.On Friday, Donald Trump signed an executive order abruptly cutting off travel from seven predominantly Muslim nations. But Trumps orderavoided nations where he does businessas well as those that were home to the 9/11 terrorists. If the religious bigotry wasnt obvious enough, Trump followed up by making it clear thatChristian refugeesget special treatmentwhile Muslims are left behinda blatant violation of the first amendment.Trumps order was so poorly planned and executed that the result wasnt just clearly immoral, it was alsoconfused and chaotic. With not just refugees, but ordinary immigrants, including many who were already working in the United States, caught up in the misrule.Watching not just US policy, but the last grains of the nations moral standing scrawled away with Trumps bigoted order didn't bother Republicans.Who found they had something to say on every topic  except that of families torn apart, legal immigrants stranded in airports, and people who had put their lives on the line to serve with the United States being denied the admission they were promised.But Democratic legislatorsdid come forwardand continue to speak outagainst Trumps xenophobic order and in defense of the people trapped between two worlds by a regime that would rather frighten Americans with the boogeyman of nonexistent danger than uphold the values that truly made America great.As Trump signeda new brace of executive orders , Trump was asked about his Muslim ban. His response was to deny that it is a Muslim banand also to deny the evidence of world-snarling f*ck up visible on every television screen.And above all this was a reminder to Democrats that there is no nominee, no policy, no subjecton which they should support Trump.Ill say it this way: Trump is a madman with delusions of tyranny. Every vote for him, no matter how innocuous, is one step closer to his dystopian fascist America.</TEXT>
