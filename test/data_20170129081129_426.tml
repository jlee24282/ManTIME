<content type="str">Big V-neck is back and lower, the better. But it&apos;s just one nip-slip away from wardrobe malfunction. Here&apos;s how to bare right... 
 
There seems to be a celebrity cleavage competition going on. Recently, our most successful western export Priyanka Chopra took the &apos;golden&apos; in Golden Globes literally by donning the shiny shade in a Ralph Lauren gown. Back home, Hollywood hopeful Deepika Padukone put the X in &apos;xXx&apos; by following suit in a Naeem Khan. Even as the jury is out on who wore it best, many Indian celebrities have taken a leaf out of Kim Kardashian West&apos;s stylebook by wearing the daring neckline. If new mommy Kareena Kapoor Khan wore it post-baby bump in a sedate avatar, wunderkind Alia Bhatt styled her sternum in a golden blazer. And obviously our self-proclaimed fashion icon Sonam Kapoor had to show how it&apos;s done in a near-naked Yanina Couture gown. 
 
 BARE BASICS 
Celebrity stylist and fashion designer Esha Amiin calls it &quot;the&quot; big trend for the red carpet - national or international. &apos;&apos;The plunging neckline is all about being sexy and sensual,&apos;&apos; she says and adds, &apos;&apos;However, one walks on a thin line with it as it could either swing towards a memorable look or towards vulgarity depending upon quite a few factors.&apos;&apos; Now the style is spilling over (ahem!) to everyday fashion too. Fashion and lifestyle blogger Akanksha Redhu says, &apos;&apos;You can even wear a top or bodysuit with a plunging neckline along with jeans.&apos;&apos; 
Amiin advises: &apos;&apos;If you are planning to wear a daring neckline you need three things - confidence, body type and, of course, double-sided tape.&apos;&apos; In fact, there are numerous tutorials on how to boob tape it, up a la Kardashian, available online for pointers. 
 
 OFF YOUR CHEST 
Amiin is all for wearing it casually. &apos;&apos;Just use a deep neck body suit or lace ups and pair with denims. This look has the potential to go from a day look into a night look,&apos;&apos; she says. Bodysuits also work best as they keep the neckline pulled down and it doesn&apos;t get a chance to loosen up from anywhere and lead to a wardrobe malfunction. Redhu says that the best way to rock this look would be to accessorise it with a black choker, deep red lips, black booties, huge silver earrings and a bohemian cover-up, &apos;&apos;because we are in India and the men don&apos;t know how to control themselves here&apos;&apos;. Point taken.

 SUIT YOURSELF 
The plunging look works best on women with a more modest chest like Kangana Ranaut&apos;s. Rock a low cut for a day occasion by opting for a blazer minus 
the shirt. 
 
 BLING IT RIGHT 
Don&apos;t clutter or hide your neckline under some statement necklace like Priyanka Chopra. Best is to go for a choker or statement earrings so that the neckline gets the attention it deserves. 
 
 BARE CHEST, BARE FACE 
Keep the makeup dewy or nude with just a hint of colour on the lips. A wet look with open hair like Alia Bhatt&apos;s, or hair tied up in a bun, works best. 
 
 KEEP IT MINIMAL 
A plunging neckline is a statement in itself. Go with minimal accessories, maybe just a pair of elegant earrings and rings. But wear it with confidence and don&apos;t fumble like Deepika Padukone. 
 
 CONTOUR RIGHT 
Contour your chest to take the entire look to its full potential - like Kareena Kapoor. A plunging neckline is pointless if you have a pasty chest. If you have bumps or acne, cover it up with makeup. It will make the photos come out million times better. 
 
 TAPE IT WELL 
A near nude look like Sonam Kapoor&apos;s requires a sound knowledge of boob tape and pasties.</content>
