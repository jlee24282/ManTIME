Stomper Kenzo was concerned to see a cyclist riding on the Pan-Island Expressway (PIE) yesterday (Jan 28), at around 12.40pm. 
 
A video he sent in shows the man riding by the side of the road even though cycling is not allowed on expressways in Singapore. 
 
According to a April 2015 report on The New Paper. those cycling on expressways may be charged under Section 279 of the Penal Code for driving in a rash manner which endangers human life or causes hurt or injury to any other person. 
 
&quot;Under Section 2 of the Road Traffic Act, a cyclist qualifies as a driver. So technically, they can be fined up to $5,000,&quot; said lawyer Raphael Louis.
