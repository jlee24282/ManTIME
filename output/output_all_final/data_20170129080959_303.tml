<TITLE>New Sirius model from STAR Electric Vehicles makes its debut at PGA Merchandise Show</TITLE>


<TEXT>
PRWeb  
At the golf industry's biggest trade show event of <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">the year</TIMEX3>, the <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> PGA Merchandise Show, golf cars and low speed electric vehicles occupy a large part of the convention room floor. On <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-26">Thursday's</TIMEX3> Morning Drive on the Golf Channel, live at the Orange County Convention Center, the STAR EV Sirius <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">took</EVENT> center stage along with big industry names like Club Car, E-Z-Go, and Garia. 
 
Although primarily associated with golf, the golf car industry <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> <EVENT eid="e2" class="STATE">encompasses</EVENT> a wide range of small vehicles from LSVs (a street legal low-speed vehicle) to utility vehicles to the classic golf course companion. STAR EV <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">kept</EVENT> the golf course-to-neighborhood overlap in mind with the ground-up creation of the new Sirius model, which <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">boasts</EVENT> automotive conveniences like an electronic locking trunk, USB port, LED <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">illuminated</EVENT> dashboard, and self-cancelling turn signals. But it is still golf course worthy, with optional golf ball holder inserts, and a large bagwell, or the option of a 2-in-1 Combo Seat (a patented design that turns a rear seat into a golf bag holder without tools). 
 
STAR EV <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">revealed</EVENT> two prototypes at its PGA show exhibit; a standard Sirius with 2-in-1 Combo Seat, and a "tricked-out" <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE">version</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE">show</EVENT> how customizable the Sirius will be. The front trunk gives the golf car the look of a hood that can be <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE">painted</EVENT> a different color from the main body, like the sleek matte black trunk on the deep metallic maroon prototype. STAR EV also <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE">offers</EVENT> a variety of wheels, with rim finishes in machined aluminum, matte black, dura chrome, black PVD, and special color accents. 
 
While the models at the show were standard 2 and 4-passenger vehicles, the Sirius line will <EVENT eid="e11" class="I_STATE">expand</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE">include</EVENT> 6 and 8 passenger models like the STAR EV Classic. As all STAR's vehicles, the Sirius is 100% electric with a 4 kW AC motor, 350 A Curtis AC controller, and can <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE">travel</EVENT> at a top speed of 19.5 mph. (The LSV version peaks at 25 mph.) The line officially launches in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-SU">the summer of 2017</TIMEX3>, available through any of STAR's 250+ authorized dealers nationwide and internationally.
