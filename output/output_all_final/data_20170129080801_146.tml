<TITLE>Green light for Hydel University College - Local and international bodies approve accreditation</TITLE>


<TEXT>
The St Catherine-based Hydel University College is <EVENT eid="e1" class="REPORTING">reporting</EVENT> success in its efforts to <EVENT eid="e2" class="STATE">have</EVENT> its current programme <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">accredited</EVENT> by the University Council of Jamaica (UCJ). 
 
Hydel administrators have also <EVENT eid="e4" class="REPORTING">reported</EVENT> that the United States-based international accrediting body, Accreditation Service for International Schools, Colleges, and Universities (ASIC), has <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">awarded</EVENT> it International Institutional accreditation. 
 
ASIC, which is <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">approved</EVENT> by the United Kingdom government, is a member of the British Quality Foundation as well as the International Quality Body. 
 
"The Hydel University College has <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE">emerged</EVENT> from an excruciatingly grievous <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DURATION" value="P8Y">eight-year</TIMEX3> tortuous journey," <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE">declared</EVENT> its founder and president, Hyacinth Bennett, 
 
"Given the ASIC accreditation, as well as the <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE">accreditation</EVENT> of our current offerings by UCJ, the Hydel University College will certainly not be a mere pretty Polly, simply <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE">adding</EVENT> charm to the education landscape. Instead, it is now <EVENT eid="e11" class="I_STATE">positioned</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE">claim</EVENT> its sense of a history of solid contribution to the field of education and training and, of course, nation building," added Bennett. 
 
According to Bennett, <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE">given</EVENT> the fact that the Hydel University College's programmes are accredited by the UCJ, its graduates, with immediate effect, are <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE">entitled</EVENT> to their rightful classification as employees in relation to their fields of study, as well as the attendant remuneration. 
 AUTOMATIC ACCREDITATION  
"As far as the ASIC-awarded accreditation is concerned, programmes offered by the Hydel University College <EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE">enjoy</EVENT> automatic accreditation. Therefore, all degrees earned by graduates of the Hydel University College are <EVENT eid="e16" class="OCCURRENCE">accepted</EVENT> globally, and this, in turn, facilitates access to international employment," <EVENT eid="e17" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT> Bennett. 
 
In the meantime, vice-president with responsibility for sports development at the Hydel University College Yvonne Kong <EVENT eid="e18" class="OCCURRENCE">expressed</EVENT> her joy at the latest developments. 
 
"I am extremely <EVENT eid="e19" class="STATE">happy</EVENT>, not only with the UCJ's <EVENT eid="e20" class="OCCURRENCE">accreditation</EVENT> of our current programmes, but more so with ASIC's award of International Institutional accreditation," <EVENT eid="e21" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT> Kong, a former principal of G.C. Foster College. 
 
For his part, former chief education officer and founding vice-president of the Hydel University College Jasper Lawrence <EVENT eid="e22" class="REPORTING">noted</EVENT> that from early, the institution <EVENT eid="e23" class="I_ACTION">embarked</EVENT> on a <EVENT eid="e24" class="OCCURRENCE">journey</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e25" class="OCCURRENCE">enlighten</EVENT>, <EVENT eid="e26" class="OCCURRENCE">empower</EVENT>, and <EVENT eid="e27" class="OCCURRENCE">release</EVENT> the highest potential of students, faculty, staff, management, and other stakeholders.
