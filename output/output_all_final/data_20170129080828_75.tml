<TITLE>LETTER TO THE EDITOR: Letter writer is wrong</TITLE>


<TEXT>
Re: Letter, <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-16">Jan. 16</TIMEX3>, "Not hypocrites" 
 
To the man who accuses pro-lifers of only being concerned with the preborn baby, which he <EVENT eid="e1" class="REPORTING">refers</EVENT> to as fetus, and not the pregnant mother, we boldly <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">disagree</EVENT>. Our Pregnancy Counseling Centers, many with medical clinics, <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">welcome</EVENT> any girl or woman before or after an abortion. 
 
Pro-lifers are in front of abortion clinics throughout our country and many other countries, <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">offering</EVENT> alternatives to <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">destroying</EVENT> a life. We have <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">heard</EVENT> over and over again from those who have <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE">experienced</EVENT> abortion about the painful aftermath and their deep regrets. The doors to Catholic and other Christian churches are open to Christs mercy and forgiveness along with post-abortion ministries such as Rachaels Vinyard, Silent No More and many other aftermath of abortion groups throughout our country. 
 
A new center has <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE">opened</EVENT> in Fort Walton Beach with assistance and needs for pregnant women, including medical. Approximately half the women in pro-life efforts <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3> have had one or more abortions. When they are <EVENT eid="e9" class="I_STATE">permitted</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e10" class="STATE">speak</EVENT> in classrooms, generally private schools, most, if not all who were pro-choice, <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE">change</EVENT> their mind. Young people <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE">deserve</EVENT> the whole picture  the truth. When <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE">adoption</EVENT> is <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE">presented</EVENT>, especially from a person who has been <EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE">adopted</EVENT>, students see a positive alternative to <EVENT eid="e16" class="OCCURRENCE">killing</EVENT>. 
 
Teens are aware of the <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> culture of death in our country, led by the father of lies, the "angel of death, as the Bible <EVENT eid="e17" class="OCCURRENCE">calls</EVENT> him. Teen suicide in the U.S. per capita is one of the highest in the world. This is because they are being sold the mantra, "If it feels good, do it. In this culture, sex <EVENT eid="e18" class="OCCURRENCE">sells</EVENT>, and when good, consistent abstinence until marriage programs are implemented in a school the students respond and realize self-control, concern for others' welfare and sacrifice are necessary to be happy! 
 
The letter writer is 100 percent wrong, we <EVENT eid="e19" class="OCCURRENCE">care</EVENT> deeply for women. Many of the hundreds of thousands in next Saturdays March for Life in Washington, D.C., will be holding signs, "ABORTION <EVENT eid="e20" class="OCCURRENCE">HARMS</EVENT> WOMEN." Let's <EVENT eid="e21" class="PERCEPTION">see</EVENT> how much the press will <EVENT eid="e22" class="OCCURRENCE">cover</EVENT> it!
