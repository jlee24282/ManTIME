<TITLE>Volvo S90 And V90 Score Top Pedestrian Safety Ratings From Euro NCAP</TITLE>


<TEXT>
Whereas the 2017 Ford Mustang <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">failed</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">achieve</EVENT> a satisfactory <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">rating</EVENT> in Euro NCAP's safety tests, Volvo's all-new S90 sedan and V90 wagon <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">find</EVENT> themselves at the opposite end, with a 5 star rating. 
 
The achievement <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">makes</EVENT> Volvo the first ever vehicle maker to score full marks in the test. Interestingly, the Volvo XC90 was the first vehicle from any <EVENT eid="e6" class="I_ACTION">manufacturer</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE">score</EVENT> full points in the Euro NCAP Autonomous Emergency Braking auto to vehicle rear-end tests (AEB City and AEB Interurban). The system <EVENT eid="e8" class="I_ACTION">works</EVENT> by identifying potential hazards on the road ahead, such as vehicles, pedestrians and cyclists in certain situations, <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DURATION" value="PXD">day</TIMEX3> and night. 
 
The Volvo S90 saloon and V90 estate have <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE">received</EVENT> the full six points in the Autonomous Emergency Braking for Pedestrians (AEB Pedestrian) Euro NCAP test procedure and an overall five-star rating for both cars. Furthermore, with this score , now Euro NCAP's top-three best-ever-performing cars are all Volvos. Our main focus is, and always has been, real-life safety. Volvo's success in the Autonomous Emergency Braking tests are <EVENT eid="e10" class="STATE">aided</EVENT> by the advanced City Safety system, which is standard in all new Volvo cars. "The S90's and V90's five-star ratings and maximum points in the AEB testing procedures <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE">underscores</EVENT> our ongoing commitment to <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE">delivering</EVENT> a safe, enjoyable and confident driving experience in our cars", <EVENT eid="e13" class="REPORTING">added</EVENT> Ekholm. 
 
The AEB Pedestrian tests involves three scenarios: an adult runs into the road from the driver side of the vehicle; an adult walks into the road from the passenger side of the vehicle (two tests are <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE">carried</EVENT> out for this scenario); and a child runs from between two parked cars into the road from the passenger side of the vehicle.
