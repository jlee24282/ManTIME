<TITLE>Donal Trump: U.S president's first week in power</TITLE>


<TEXT>
Donald Trump hurtled through his <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DURATION" value="PXW">first week</TIMEX3> in power punching out at critics dishing up "alternative facts" polarizing public opinion and making good on an electoral promise to shake up Washington 

One <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P1W">week</TIMEX3> into the Trump era and there is a serious case of political whiplash in America's capital Just <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-W04">a week ago</TIMEX3> an outsider who never before held elected office rode into town <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="PXD">Seven days</TIMEX3> later norms and doctrine that have guided the United States for decades are being re-examined Trump's down-to-the-studs gut job began with a feisty inaugural address a call to arms that tested old distinctions between left and right

"<TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Today</TIMEX3> we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another or from one party to another"he <EVENT eid="e1" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT>

"We are transferring power from Washington DC and giving it back to you the people"

US President Donald Trump's down-to-the-studs gut job began with a feisty inaugural address a call to arms for the era of "America first"

The establishment "elites" in big cities in politics and the media were no longer the technocrats in charge of the world's only superpower they were the enemy

The new president also put the rest of the world on notice

For the <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">last 75</TIMEX3> years America had been what Barack Obama described as the "indispensable nation" -- the glue that bound the global order

The era of Trump would be the era of "America first" he said of naked self-interest and zero-sum diplomacy Old alliances would be reassessed new alliances would be explored

Before his inauguration many asked if the presidency would change Donald Trump or whether Donald Trump would change the presidency

Barely <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="X">20</TIMEX3> minutes into his <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="P4Y">four-year</TIMEX3> term anyone who was listening had their answer Keeping Trump's campaign promises Before <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">arriving</EVENT> at the Oval Office Trump's strategists had decided to use the first few <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="PXW">weeks</TIMEX3> to <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">unleash</EVENT> a daily wave of executive orders

The aim was to unbalance opponents define Trump as a man of action and slake his supporters' thirst for change

For much of middle America globalization automation and the Great Recession had been apocalyptic

Politics had passed them over and worse they felt steamrollered by "coastal elites" in America's "culture wars" over abortion gay rights immigration global warming and religion

Trump had won the election by promising to be their champion and he was going to -- as Ronald Reagan <EVENT eid="e4" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT> -- "dance with the one that brung ya"

For the most part the CEO-in-chief put forward actions that could have come from any Republican in the country defunding abortion preening the military and approving oil pipelines

But it was coated with a thick veneer of nationalist and populist rhetoric and accompanying policies championed by top aide Steve Bannon

Trump <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">ripped</EVENT> up a trans-Pacific trade deal designed to counterbalance China's regional economic power imposed a ban on refugees from Syria and migrants from seven other Muslim countries

He ordered planning to begin to build a wall on Mexico's southern border and picked a very public fight with Mexico's president Enrique Pena Nieto who <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">cancelled</EVENT> a trip to Washington

The United States a nation founded by migrants was <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> willing to shut its doors Not since Obama's election or perhaps the Iraq War has America's image around the world <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE">changed</EVENT> so dramatically and so quickly

But Trump supporters saw an outsider sticking up for them and sticking it to the elites

"Get used to it" said Trump aide Kellyanne Conway boasting that Trump had delivered a "shock to the system" "And he's just getting started" she <EVENT eid="e8" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT>

- Rocky start -

But it was not all positive for Trump The White House is far from purring Key positions have yet to be filled and the decision making process is haphazard

Trump aides were forced to publicly row back suggestions of a 20 percent border tax on Mexican goods and defend a chaotic rollout of the refugee and migrant ban

Throughout the <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P1W">week</TIMEX3> Trump engaged in intemperate outbursts about the size of his inaugural crowd alleged election fraud and perceived media persecution

Privately in call after call he complained to top aides about press coverage The impression was of a man focused on his image more than running the country

Trump also seemed like a a man for whom becoming US president was not adulation enough

Spokesman Sean Spicer -- between tirades and missteps -- <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE">offered</EVENT> a window onto the soul of the White House "There's this constant theme to undercut the enormous support he has" Spicer <EVENT eid="e10" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT> "It's unbelievably frustrating when you're continually told it's not big enough it's not good enough You can't win" According to a Quinnipiac poll Trump's approval rating at the end of his <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="PXW">first week</TIMEX3> stood at 36 percent

But critics saw a more sinister motive for the outbursts particularly Trumps unsubstantiated claim that three million people voted illegally in the election

Brian Klaas an expert on global democracy at the London School of Economics sees Trump "casting aspersions without evidence on electoral integrity is a key way to restrict voting rights and erode confidence in elections"

"Attacking the media and blurring the lines of truth with state narratives not grounded in fact is important to sowing public doubt" he said

Mindy Finn who ran as a independent vice presidential candidate summed up Trump's strategy as "sow chaos deepen division and consolidate power"

For his harshest critics the question is now whether Donald Trump breaks the presidency or whether the presidency breaks Donald Trump
