<TITLE>Audio review: Dead Man Win</TITLE>


<TEXT>
Bluegrass/rock  
Dead Man <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-WI">Winter</TIMEX3>. " Furnace. " GNDWIRE/Thirty Tigers. 
Dave Simonett has <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">delivered</EVENT> something you almost never see in music: a gorgeous divorce album. Simonett, leader of the progressive bluegrass-rock band Trampled by Turtles, works under the banner of Dead Man Winter on "Furnace" to <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">delve</EVENT> into the <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">dissolution</EVENT> of his marriage and the <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">splintering</EVENT> of his family. It's a deeply personal album he <EVENT eid="e5" class="REPORTING">says</EVENT> he <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">put</EVENT> out only after "a long and violent debate with myself."From the wrenching first <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE">stanza</EVENT> of "This House is On Fire," Simonett spins the desolate landscape of his heartbreak into art. Cut live-to-tape in rustic Cannon Falls, Minnesota, the album <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE">sets</EVENT> achy lyrics against an elegant acoustic backdrop that <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE">accentuates</EVENT> the hurt but never <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE">veers</EVENT> into self-indulgence.That Simonett delivers it without <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE">wallowing</EVENT> in self-pity or defensive rationalizations about why things didn't <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE">work</EVENT> out is a monumental achievement."Mockingbird, you <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE">come</EVENT> to my window, in the dead of night, to <EVENT eid="e14" class="PERCEPTION">see</EVENT> if we're all right," he sings with clear-eyed solemnity in the elegiac "Weight of the World." "The moonlight in your eyes, and then you're gone."You'd have to <EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE">go</EVENT> back decades to <EVENT eid="e16" class="OCCURRENCE">find</EVENT> a more cathartic breakup album - perhaps as far as Bob Dylan's "Blood on the Tracks," the gold standard for such things."Furnace" <EVENT eid="e17" class="I_STATE">reassures</EVENT> us that the human heart is <EVENT eid="e18" class="STATE">beautiful</EVENT> even when it's in anguish. Its memorable anthems to lost intimacy and disconnection will <EVENT eid="e19" class="OCCURRENCE">remind</EVENT> those who have been there that they're not so alone after all.
