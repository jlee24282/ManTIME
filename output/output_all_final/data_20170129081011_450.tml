<TITLE>Harriet Harman: I dont want to be not-liked...</TITLE>


<TEXT>
I always totally <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">denounced</EVENT> people who <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">wrote</EVENT> their memoirs, <EVENT eid="e3" class="REPORTING">says</EVENT> Harriet Harman, who has just <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">written</EVENT> her memoir. There is a copy of A Womans Work in front of us. A hardback whopper of nearly 400 pages with all kinds of enticing entries in the index: Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers, 18; Association of Metropolitan Authorities, 106; Mothers in Manufacturing Report, 219, 235. One thing I <EVENT eid="e5" class="I_ACTION">learn</EVENT> about Harriet Harman: shes not one to <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">shy</EVENT> away from the boring detail. During her time on the frontbench, she <EVENT eid="e7" class="REPORTING">says</EVENT>, people would <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE">sit</EVENT> in cabinet meetings and literally be <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE">writing</EVENT> their diaries in front of her. And I <EVENT eid="e10" class="I_ACTION">used</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE">think</EVENT>, Weve <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE">got</EVENT> a country to <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE">run</EVENT>! I was very moral high ground about it, all the time denouncing them as male vanity projects. So, this is what? A female vanity project? Yes! she <EVENT eid="e14" class="REPORTING">says</EVENT>. Its a self-consciously female vanity project. When all my colleagues autobiographies <EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE">came</EVENT> out, the first thing you do is to <EVENT eid="e16" class="OCCURRENCE">look</EVENT> at the photos and it would all be men. Maybe <EVENT eid="e17" class="I_STATE">thered</EVENT> be their wife and someone who <EVENT eid="e18" class="OCCURRENCE">worked</EVENT> for them. And possibly Hillary Clinton and thats it. And its like, where were the 100 women who <EVENT eid="e19" class="OCCURRENCE">swept</EVENT> into parliament? Where was the transformation reflected in our politics and the change in womens lives? You remember Sheila Rowbothams Hidden from History? Her thing about unless its written about, its invisible and then it hasnt <EVENT eid="e20" class="OCCURRENCE">happened</EVENT>? Well, funnily enough, even though I was in the cabinet at the time, I dont <EVENT eid="e21" class="I_STATE">seem</EVENT> to be in these memoirs either. You might <EVENT eid="e22" class="OCCURRENCE">find</EVENT> one reference, Harman, sacking of. And I <EVENT eid="e23" class="I_STATE">thought</EVENT>, Well, stuff that. So I <EVENT eid="e24" class="OCCURRENCE">found</EVENT> it very easy to <EVENT eid="e25" class="OCCURRENCE">do</EVENT> my U-turn. Oh, its raining men in the Labour party From someone else, this would be hypocritical self-aggrandisement. But this is Harriet Harman, AKA Harriet Harperson. Her conversation is <EVENT eid="e26" class="I_STATE">littered</EVENT> with references to the cause, the struggle, the mission  her whole adult life, and her entire career at Westminster, has been in single-minded pursuit of equal rights. And its fair to <EVENT eid="e27" class="REPORTING">say</EVENT> that A Womans Work is in some ways more about the <EVENT eid="e28" class="OCCURRENCE">changing</EVENT> political representation of women than it is about her. Its just that she defines and embodies that change. Were in the kitchen of her house in her south London constituency, a warm, comfortable, family home with various piles of clutter and a prowling cat, the kind of fantasy dwelling that would <EVENT eid="e29" class="I_ACTION">make</EVENT> a millennials heart <EVENT eid="e30" class="OCCURRENCE">bleed</EVENT>, and shes <EVENT eid="e31" class="OCCURRENCE">telling</EVENT> me how they <EVENT eid="e32" class="OCCURRENCE">bought</EVENT> it in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="1987">1987</TIMEX3> when the area was all social workers and FE lecturers. And <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3>? Now its bankers and corporate lawyers. When Harman first <EVENT eid="e33" class="OCCURRENCE">became</EVENT> an MP, at a <EVENT eid="e34" class="OCCURRENCE">byelection</EVENT> in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="1982">1982</TIMEX3>, London was a Tory stronghold, a family home was an achievable goal and she was one of only 11 women Labour MPs. And the only one who was pregnant. She was a completely new sight in British politics: a young, pregnant, feminist MP. The photos in the book <EVENT eid="e35" class="OCCURRENCE">show</EVENT> her campaigning with a babe in arms and then a toddler and they culminate in the still-record-breaking sight of the 101 Labour women <EVENT eid="e36" class="OCCURRENCE">elected</EVENT> during the <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="1997">1997</TIMEX3> landslide: Blairs Babes. Though shes still cross about that. The photo. Tutting when I <EVENT eid="e37" class="OCCURRENCE">bring</EVENT> it up. Because there they all are, Folletted up in jackets all the colours of the rainbow, the prescribed style decreed by the Labour partys fashion arbiter, the then member for Stevenage, Barbara Follett, massed around a grinning Tony Blair. It was <EVENT eid="e38" class="I_STATE">supposed</EVENT> to be the sisterhood! <EVENT eid="e39" class="REPORTING">says</EVENT> Harman. It was <EVENT eid="e40" class="I_STATE">supposed</EVENT> to be us, the women, <EVENT eid="e41" class="OCCURRENCE">doing</EVENT> it for ourselves. Not as the backing group for the great leader. Even more galling was the fact that it had been her idea. Shed <EVENT eid="e42" class="OCCURRENCE">arranged</EVENT> it all, when suddenly at <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">the last minute</TIMEX3> someone <EVENT eid="e43" class="OCCURRENCE">added</EVENT> Blair to the line-up. It was a complete failure to <EVENT eid="e44" class="OCCURRENCE">understand</EVENT> that this was a moment for women. On the other hand, she <EVENT eid="e45" class="REPORTING">says</EVENT>, at least people remember it. Though she backtracks almost immediately. Though I <EVENT eid="e46" class="I_STATE">think</EVENT> they would anyway. And a lot of it, of them, was down to her. <EVENT eid="e47" class="OCCURRENCE">Campaigning</EVENT> and networking and inspiring and ultimately <EVENT eid="e48" class="I_ACTION">helping</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e49" class="OCCURRENCE">get</EVENT> the highly unpopular but effective all-women shortlists through, a struggle, documented at length, in the book. Alan Clarkes Diaries this is not, though she does recall how, as Robin Cooks deputy on the shadow frontbench, she had <EVENT eid="e50" class="I_ACTION">promised</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e51" class="OCCURRENCE">take</EVENT> her son to the Bromley Odeon and, despite frantic calls to <EVENT eid="e52" class="OCCURRENCE">deliver</EVENT> a response to striking ambulance workers, she <EVENT eid="e53" class="OCCURRENCE">took</EVENT> him to the Bromley Odeon. Cook was furious. And since she <EVENT eid="e54" class="OCCURRENCE">couldnt</EVENT> think of an excuse, she simply <EVENT eid="e55" class="OCCURRENCE">told</EVENT> him: I was not available. Cook <EVENT eid="e56" class="I_ACTION">responded</EVENT> with conspiratorial... Read more
