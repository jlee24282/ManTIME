<TITLE>A few examples of intellectual laziness</TITLE>


<TEXT>
My wife <EVENT eid="e1" class="I_ACTION">parroted</EVENT> the comment that secondhand smoke is worse for you than firsthand smoke. I was <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">struck</EVENT> by the obvious insanity of the statement  and more importantly, the intellectual laziness of <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">subscribing</EVENT> to it. <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3>, it is not entirely impossible that 100% of a toxin is less harmful than 5% of a toxin  perhaps air dilution <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">multiplies</EVENT> the toxicity  but to readily <EVENT eid="e5" class="I_ACTION">accept</EVENT> that assertion is simply intellectual laziness. It would take some really conclusive evidence to <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">believe</EVENT> such a claim, and that evidence does not <EVENT eid="e7" class="I_STATE">exist</EVENT>. 
 
Another good example of intellectual laziness is the global warming hypothesis. If all the molecules in the atmosphere were <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE">lined</EVENT> up between N.Y. and L.A., with CO2 at the front of the line, you would <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE">run</EVENT> out of CO2 before your plane <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE">got</EVENT> off the runway. It is <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE">called</EVENT> a trace gas because 4 parts in 10,000 is a pretty small fraction. For CO2 to <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE">have</EVENT> the impact <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE">claimed</EVENT>, it would have to <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE">qualify</EVENT> as a supernatural atom. Add to that the facts that CO2 represents only maybe 1% of the global heat retention <EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE">caused</EVENT> by water and that anthropogenic CO2 is a small fraction of global CO2 production, and it is clear that the anthropogenic CO2 "hypothesis" is simply farcical. 
  
Then there is the issue of Islam. Any belief system that asserts that it is necessary to <EVENT eid="e16" class="OCCURRENCE">chop</EVENT> a woman's head off if she goes to the market without her husband is not a legitimate philosophy; it is abject insanity. And for so many to <EVENT eid="e17" class="REPORTING">tell</EVENT> themselves that it is valid because it is a "religion" is one of the most offensive examples of intellectual laziness. Slavery has been around since time immemorial, and it never has been and never will be part of a legitimate philosophy. 
 
And of course there is the immigration issue. Every nation on Earth has immigration limits. When 10% of your population is illegal, it is not immigration; it is invasion. When you <EVENT eid="e18" class="I_ACTION">allow</EVENT> yourself to <EVENT eid="e19" class="OCCURRENCE">conflate</EVENT> reasonable immigration control with racism, you are being intellectually lazy. And when you <EVENT eid="e20" class="OCCURRENCE">slander</EVENT> with wails of racism those who aren't intellectually lazy, who <EVENT eid="e21" class="I_STATE">admit</EVENT> that a country, no matter how wealthy, can't <EVENT eid="e22" class="OCCURRENCE">absorb</EVENT> unlimited numbers of the desperately poor without inflicting hardship on the native population, you are guilty of not only intellectual laziness, but also character assassination. 
 
The most important example of intellectual laziness is the claim that I can't <EVENT eid="e23" class="REPORTING">say</EVENT> something that <EVENT eid="e24" class="OCCURRENCE">offends</EVENT> you, but you can <EVENT eid="e25" class="OCCURRENCE">insult</EVENT> me, <EVENT eid="e26" class="OCCURRENCE">offend</EVENT> me, and <EVENT eid="e27" class="OCCURRENCE">stone</EVENT> me to death for <EVENT eid="e28" class="OCCURRENCE">disagreeing</EVENT> with you. <EVENT eid="e29" class="REPORTING">Telling</EVENT> yourself you can <EVENT eid="e30" class="OCCURRENCE">discount</EVENT> other people's opinions and don't have to <EVENT eid="e31" class="OCCURRENCE">debate</EVENT> them because you have <EVENT eid="e32" class="OCCURRENCE">convinced</EVENT> yourself of your own moral superiority is the pinnacle of intellectual laziness. 
 
Before the <EVENT eid="e33" class="OCCURRENCE">election</EVENT>, a colleague <EVENT eid="e34" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT> that it didn't matter, as they were all the same. In their defense, he would have been correct for nearly every <EVENT eid="e35" class="OCCURRENCE">election</EVENT> in my lifetime. But this time, the differences could not have been more extreme, and to <EVENT eid="e36" class="REPORTING">tell</EVENT> oneself that the candidates were the same is, again, a shameful example of intellectual laziness. 
 
To <EVENT eid="e37" class="OCCURRENCE">inherit</EVENT> one of the richest, fairest, and best run countries in the history of the world and then to <EVENT eid="e38" class="I_ACTION">allow</EVENT> it to be Venezuela-ized is not just intellectually lazy; it is morally lazy, or worse. 
  
My wife <EVENT eid="e39" class="I_ACTION">parroted</EVENT> the comment that secondhand smoke is worse for you than firsthand smoke. I was <EVENT eid="e40" class="OCCURRENCE">struck</EVENT> by the obvious insanity of the statement  and more importantly, the intellectual laziness of <EVENT eid="e41" class="OCCURRENCE">subscribing</EVENT> to it. <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3>, it is not entirely impossible that 100% of a toxin is less harmful than 5% of a toxin  perhaps air dilution <EVENT eid="e42" class="OCCURRENCE">multiplies</EVENT> the toxicity  but to readily accept that assertion is simply intellectual laziness.
