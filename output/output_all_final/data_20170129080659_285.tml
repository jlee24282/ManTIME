<TITLE>Letter to the editor: Treat each human being with humanity</TITLE>


<TEXT>
There is no one who <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">loves</EVENT> this country more than I, or can claim to be more patriotic then I, and I am a liberal.

However, there is an even more important label for me  citizen. I <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">walked</EVENT> with many citizens on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-22">Jan. 22</TIMEX3>, the women in Tulsa and the sons and fathers who love and support them, all who are just as patriotic and full of love for this country.
