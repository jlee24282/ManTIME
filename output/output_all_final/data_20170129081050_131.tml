<TITLE>G'Day USA 2017 honours Hollywood's man of the moment, Ben Mendelsohn</TITLE>


<TEXT>
Rogue One star Ben Mendelsohn, Moulin Rouge designer Catherine Martin and TV executive David Hill <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">honoured</EVENT>. 

Following a critically-acclaimed <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">performance</EVENT> in the Netflix television series Bloodline and a starring role in the smash <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">hit</EVENT> Star Wars film Rogue One, Australian actor Ben Mendelsohn is Hollywood's man of the moment.

The success the 47-year-old Melbourne-born actor has <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">enjoyed</EVENT> in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2016">the last year</TIMEX3> has been <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">acknowledged</EVENT> with an award for excellence in film and television at the annual G'Day USA gala in Los Angeles.

Accepting the award, Mendelsohn <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">regaled</EVENT> the audience with a <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE">speech</EVENT> full of jokes, seemingly random references and gentle self-deprecation.

He <EVENT eid="e8" class="I_ACTION">noted</EVENT> wryly he was "big in Australia from <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="1988">about 1988</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="1989">1989</TIMEX3>".

"I was the <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE">shit</EVENT>," he joked.

Mendelsohn <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE">thanked</EVENT> Damon Herriman, David Michod and Kate Beahan for <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE">backing</EVENT> him when it was, he <EVENT eid="e12" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT>, "unfashionable" to <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE">do</EVENT> so.

He also <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE">thanked</EVENT> Simon Baker and Rebecca Rigg, Dominic Purcell and the late Heath Ledger for <EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE">giving</EVENT> him a bed over <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="PXY">the years</TIMEX3>, and <EVENT eid="e16" class="OCCURRENCE">acknowledged</EVENT> Nicole Kidman and Naomi Watts for inspiring him.

Each year the event, which is part of a larger trade mission <EVENT eid="e17" class="OCCURRENCE">promoting</EVENT> Australian innovation and industry to the world's largest economy, honours several Australians of distinction.

<TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017">This year</TIMEX3>'s "honourees" were Mendelsohn, the award-winning film and television production designer Catherine Martin, whose credits include Moulin Rouge and The Great Gatsby, and the television executive David Hill.

Martin and Hill <EVENT eid="e18" class="OCCURRENCE">received</EVENT> lifetime achievement awards; those two awards were <EVENT eid="e19" class="OCCURRENCE">presented</EVENT> by Kidman and her husband, musician Keith Urban respectively.

The event was <EVENT eid="e20" class="OCCURRENCE">staged</EVENT> at the Ray Dolby Ballroom, adjacent to the Dolby Theatre, the home of the annual Academy Awards.

Other VIPs in attendance <EVENT eid="e21" class="OCCURRENCE">included</EVENT> Australia's consul-general in Los Angeles Chelsey Martin, actors Rachel Griffiths, Paul Hogan and Daniel MacPherson and the directors Baz Luhrmann and Phillip Noyce.

The Australian and American national anthems were <EVENT eid="e22" class="OCCURRENCE">performed</EVENT> by Australia's Hugh Sheridan and W McDonald, a contestant on the US version of The Voice, respectively; Australian singer-songwriter Vance Joy also <EVENT eid="e23" class="OCCURRENCE">performed</EVENT>.

The black-tie gala, which is also <EVENT eid="e24" class="OCCURRENCE">attended</EVENT> by Australia's foreign minister Julie Bishop and trade minister Steve Ciobo, is the somewhat colourful icing on a larger, more serious government cake, the G'Day USA trade mission.

That mission, first <EVENT eid="e25" class="OCCURRENCE">staged</EVENT> in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2004">2004</TIMEX3>, <EVENT eid="e26" class="OCCURRENCE">promotes</EVENT> Australian food and wine, fashion, film and the arts, defence industry and technological innovation; in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent years</TIMEX3> it has also <EVENT eid="e27" class="OCCURRENCE">included</EVENT> our <EVENT eid="e28" class="OCCURRENCE">expertise</EVENT> in water and drought management.

The foreign minister and trade minister have <EVENT eid="e29" class="STATE">been</EVENT> in the US for <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-W04">the last week</TIMEX3> as part of a travelling roadshow, more fancifully <EVENT eid="e30" class="OCCURRENCE">referred</EVENT> to as the business of "economic diplomacy".

In addition to the gala, <EVENT eid="e31" class="OCCURRENCE">nicknamed</EVENT> "G'Day LA" and held in Los Angeles, there are events staged by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade across the US, including San Francisco, Austin and New York.

As part of that roadshow Mr Ciobo <EVENT eid="e32" class="OCCURRENCE">delivered</EVENT> an economic outlook address in New York, and <EVENT eid="e33" class="STATE">was</EVENT> the guest of Texas governor Greg Abbott at an "Australia-Texas BBQ" at the governor's mansion in Austin.

Ms Bishop <EVENT eid="e34" class="REPORTING">delivered</EVENT> a keynote address on the role of Australia and the US in the Indo-Pacific at the Skirball Cultural Centre in Los Angeles.

Despite the fact that <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2017">this year</TIMEX3>'s G'Day USA trade mission has <EVENT eid="e35" class="OCCURRENCE">taken</EVENT> place largely in the shadow of a turbulent <EVENT eid="e36" class="OCCURRENCE">handover</EVENT> of power in the US, Mr Ciobo <EVENT eid="e37" class="REPORTING">told</EVENT> Fairfax Media it was a success.

"We are always, of course, <EVENT eid="e38" class="OCCURRENCE">focused</EVENT> on Australia's national interest, but the US and Australia have been very close friends for decades and and I'm very confident we'll <EVENT eid="e39" class="ASPECTUAL">continue</EVENT> to be for a long time yet," he <EVENT eid="e40" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT>.

Australia's trade with the US in goods and services is worth about A$60 billion <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3> and Mr Ciobo <EVENT eid="e41" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT> the trade mission was an opportunity to <EVENT eid="e42" class="OCCURRENCE">reinforce</EVENT> Australia's "diversified and mature" economy.

"On the west coast, for example, we <EVENT eid="e43" class="OCCURRENCE">highlight</EVENT> the benefits of being able to <EVENT eid="e44" class="OCCURRENCE">produce</EVENT> film and television shows in Australia; in each particular area we focus on our natural strengths," he <EVENT eid="e45" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT>.

Mr Ciobo <EVENT eid="e46" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT> G'Day USA was largely unaffected by US president Donald Trump's decision to <EVENT eid="e47" class="OCCURRENCE">nix</EVENT> the planned Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) free-trade agreement.

"Australia will <EVENT eid="e48" class="ASPECTUAL">continue having</EVENT> conversations on the TPP 11 or 12-1 approach, and that's with other countries excluding the US, but there's always opportunity to <EVENT eid="e49" class="OCCURRENCE">drive</EVENT> the relationship forward," Mr Ciobo <EVENT eid="e50" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT>.

Australia also has an existing free-trade agreement with the US, the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement (AUSFTA), which was <EVENT eid="e51" class="OCCURRENCE">signed</EVENT> in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2005">2005</TIMEX3>.

"That's the architecture that drives the [Australia-US] relationship," Mr Ciobo <EVENT eid="e52" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT>. "That provides a good framework for our trade relationship and investment relationship."

The G'Day USA event is <EVENT eid="e53" class="OCCURRENCE">managed</EVENT> by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade with Austrade and Tourism Australia.

It is <EVENT eid="e54" class="OCCURRENCE">sponsored</EVENT> by organisations including Australia Unlimited, Qantas, the United States Studies Centre at The University of Sydney and the American Australian Association. The story first <EVENT eid="e55" class="OCCURRENCE">appeared</EVENT> on The Sydney Morning Herald.
