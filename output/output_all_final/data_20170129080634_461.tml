<TITLE>Girls less likely to think women are</TITLE>


<TEXT>
By the age of six, girls <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">become</EVENT> less likely than boys to <EVENT eid="e2" class="I_STATE">believe</EVENT> that members of their gender are brilliant, and are more likely to avoid activities <EVENT eid="e3" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT> to be for children who are "really, really smart," a new study has <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">found</EVENT>. 
 
Researchers of the study, <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">published</EVENT> <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-W05">this week</TIMEX3> in the U.S. journal Science, <EVENT eid="e6" class="REPORTING">conducted</EVENT> a series of experiments with 400 children aged between five and seven, stages when societal stereotypes about gender are known to begin. 
 
In one experiment, the children <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE">heard</EVENT> a story about a person who was "really, really smart" but no hints as to the protagonist's gender were <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE">provided</EVENT>. 
 
At age five, both boys and girls were equally likely to <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE">choose</EVENT> their own gender as "really, really smart," yet by age six and seven, girls were significantly less likely than boys to <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE">associate</EVENT> brilliance with their own gender, the study <EVENT eid="e11" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT>. 
 
In another set of questionnaires, children had to <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE">guess</EVENT> which of four children, two boys and two girls, "<EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE">gets</EVENT> the best grades in school." 
 
In contrast with the <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE">drop</EVENT> in brilliance scores, there was no significant difference between younger and older girls in the likelihood of selecting other girls as having top grades. 
 
"Thus, girls' ideas about who is brilliant are not <EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE">rooted</EVENT> in their perceptions of who <EVENT eid="e16" class="OCCURRENCE">performs</EVENT> well in school," <EVENT eid="e17" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT> the study. 
 
Lastly, children were <EVENT eid="e18" class="OCCURRENCE">introduced</EVENT> to two novel games, one <EVENT eid="e19" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT> to be for "children who are really, really smart" and the other for "children who try really, really hard." 
 
The researchers <EVENT eid="e20" class="OCCURRENCE">found</EVENT> no difference between game choice of boys and girls at age five, but by age six and six girls were significantly less interested than boys in the game for smart children, but not in the <EVENT eid="e21" class="OCCURRENCE">game</EVENT> for hard-working children. 
 
The <EVENT eid="e22" class="OCCURRENCE">research</EVENT>, <EVENT eid="e23" class="OCCURRENCE">led</EVENT> by Lin Bian, a doctoral student at the University of Illinois, and New York University psychology professor Andrei Cimpian and <EVENT eid="e24" class="OCCURRENCE">supported</EVENT> by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF), <EVENT eid="e25" class="OCCURRENCE">demonstrated</EVENT> how early gender stereotypes <EVENT eid="e26" class="OCCURRENCE">take</EVENT> hold. 
 
"Our society <EVENT eid="e27" class="I_STATE">tends</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e28" class="I_ACTION">associate</EVENT> brilliance with men more than with women, and this notion pushes women away from jobs that are <EVENT eid="e29" class="I_STATE">perceived</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e30" class="OCCURRENCE">require</EVENT> brilliance," <EVENT eid="e31" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT> Bian. 
 
"Not only do we <EVENT eid="e32" class="I_STATE">see</EVENT> that girls just <EVENT eid="e33" class="STATE">starting</EVENT> out in school are <EVENT eid="e34" class="OCCURRENCE">absorbing</EVENT> some of society's stereotyped notions of brilliance, but these young girls are also <EVENT eid="e35" class="OCCURRENCE">choosing activities</EVENT> based on these stereotypes. This is heartbreaking," <EVENT eid="e36" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT> Cimpian. 
 
"This work <EVENT eid="e37" class="OCCURRENCE">offers</EVENT> insight into the intransigence of gender disparities in math and science," <EVENT eid="e38" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT> David Moore, program director for the NSF Developmental Sciences program. 
 
"It highlights the importance of <EVENT eid="e39" class="OCCURRENCE">attacking</EVENT> the problem of gender disparities in society, because it <EVENT eid="e40" class="OCCURRENCE">shows</EVENT> that we are <EVENT eid="e41" class="STATE">influenced</EVENT> by the society we encounter <EVENT eid="e42" class="OCCURRENCE">starting</EVENT> when we are extremely young."
