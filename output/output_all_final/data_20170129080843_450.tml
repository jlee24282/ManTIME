<TITLE>President Trump, Good to His Word</TITLE>


<TEXT>
Via Billy Read and <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">share</EVENT> it widely. We are the counter balance to the enemedia. We <EVENT eid="e2" class="STATE">are</EVENT> the army that must <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">go</EVENT> head to <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">head</EVENT> against their propaganda. We must <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">expose</EVENT> their smear, demonization and libel in the information battle-space. You and me.

Trumps <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DURATION" value="PXW">first week</TIMEX3> has been astonishing.

People who are <EVENT eid="e6" class="REPORTING">say</EVENT> that Donald Trump is not a politician are wrong. He <EVENT eid="e7" class="STATE">is</EVENT> the only politician we have <EVENT eid="e8" class="PERCEPTION">seen</EVENT> for a long time.

My friend Alan S <EVENT eid="e9" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT>, What Donald Trump is <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE">exposing</EVENT> here and <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> with his actions,

achievements and projected workload, is just how little his predecessors actually <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE">did</EVENT>, how entrenched they actually were, how useless they actually where and are before the people they are <EVENT eid="e12" class="I_STATE">supposed</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE">represent</EVENT> and how much of a self serving insincere game it was for them prior to him and this, or his Presidency. Barrack Obama should be <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE">feeling</EVENT> really embarrassed and <EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE">exposed</EVENT> in light of his statements about, or with regard to one man, or the Presidential job is too big for one person and obviously not being able to <EVENT eid="e16" class="OCCURRENCE">do</EVENT> the Presidents job, and as I said soon after, he would be <EVENT eid="e17" class="OCCURRENCE">proven</EVENT> wrong and I <EVENT eid="e18" class="I_STATE">think</EVENT> he actually is and has been in a very short space of time indeed.
