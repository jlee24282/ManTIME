<TITLE>Real estate professionals do good for veterans</TITLE>


<TEXT>
By Of the thousands of complaints received by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">gripes regarding</EVENT> debt collections from the military community <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">numbered</EVENT> twice the rate of the general population. 
 
That's rather surprising when you <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">consider</EVENT> that servicemen and women, veterans and their families are covered not only by the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, which applies to everyone, but also by the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act. The latter postpones or suspends certain civil obligations to enable service members to <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">devote</EVENT> their full attention to their military duties. 
 
That the CFPB has <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">fielded</EVENT> nearly 20,000 complaints from servicemembers is terrible news, indeed. But there's also good news from the financial field  especially from the housing industry  when it comes to the military. 
 
Here's a peek at just some of the "thank you for your service" efforts being <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">taken</EVENT> on behalf of the military: 
 
 Barbara Mills,a RE/MAXRealty One agent in Inverness, Florida, has <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE">arranged</EVENT> hundreds of small parties to <EVENT eid="e8" class="I_ACTION">greet</EVENT> individual warriors <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE">returning</EVENT> home from the Middle East. She also <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE">arranged</EVENT> a larger event for 140 National Guardsmen who <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE">arrived</EVENT> all at <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="X">once</TIMEX3>. Each soldier or sailor is <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE">given</EVENT> a gift basket valued at about $450. Each basket also <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE">contains</EVENT> $500 or so in checks and other gifts frommemberof the Citrus County community. 
 
 Army Sgt. Matthew White and his two dogs, Nike and Toffee, <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE">received</EVENT> the keys to a new mortgage-free, fully furnished home in Dumfries, Virginia. The house was <EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE">donated</EVENT> by PulteGroup's Built to Honor program, which gives new homes to wounded veterans and their families across the country. (White was <EVENT eid="e16" class="OCCURRENCE">injured</EVENT> while on a foot patrol during his second <EVENT eid="e17" class="OCCURRENCE">deployment</EVENT> to Afghanistan.) Pulte has <EVENT eid="e18" class="OCCURRENCE">given</EVENT> away dozens of houses under the program. 
 
More than 50 national and local contractors, trade partners and Pulte employees <EVENT eid="e19" class="OCCURRENCE">donated</EVENT> time, money and resources to <EVENT eid="e20" class="OCCURRENCE">build</EVENT> the 1,800-square-foot townhouse. The home's furniture was <EVENT eid="e21" class="OCCURRENCE">donated</EVENT> by TV personality Rachael Ray. 
 
 Bank of America has <EVENT eid="e22" class="OCCURRENCE">given</EVENT> more than 2,000 abandoned and foreclosed houses to such nonprofit partners as HomeStrong USA and the Military Warriors Support Foundation, which vet the eventual recipients to <EVENT eid="e23" class="OCCURRENCE">make</EVENT> sure they can <EVENT eid="e24" class="OCCURRENCE">handle</EVENT> the responsibilities of homeownership. The bank's employees volunteer thousands of hours to <EVENT eid="e25" class="I_ACTION">help put</EVENT> the houses into <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="X">move-in</TIMEX3> condition, including stocking the pantries with canned goods. 
 
 SunTrust <EVENT eid="e26" class="OCCURRENCE">honored</EVENT> vets on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-01-26">the Thursday before Memorial Day last year</TIMEX3>. At exactly <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29T11:00">11 a.m.</TIMEX3>, the bank's 35,000 employees <EVENT eid="e27" class="OCCURRENCE">stopped</EVENT> what they were <EVENT eid="e28" class="OCCURRENCE">doing</EVENT> for a moment of silence to <EVENT eid="e29" class="OCCURRENCE">honor</EVENT> the <EVENT eid="e30" class="OCCURRENCE">fallen</EVENT>  even if a teller or loan officer was with a customer. And in many cases, customers <EVENT eid="e31" class="OCCURRENCE">bowed</EVENT> their heads right along. 
 
 In conjunction with local groups, Freddie Mac  the giant quasi-government secondary market institution that helps <EVENT eid="e32" class="OCCURRENCE">keep</EVENT> the mortgage money flowing  offers free homeownership counseling during American Heroes Housing Fairs and Open Houses throughout the country. Counseling is open to both active and retired military, as well as educators, firefighters, police and other first responders. 
 
 The Chesty Puller House in Saluda County, Virginia, is <EVENT eid="e33" class="I_STATE">intended</EVENT> to be a refuge for at-risk Marines of all ranks, from privates to generals, before they <EVENT eid="e34" class="OCCURRENCE">reach</EVENT> the point of considering suicide. In <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3>, to <EVENT eid="e35" class="OCCURRENCE">raise</EVENT> money for this <EVENT eid="e36" class="OCCURRENCE">cause</EVENT>, Dave Biggers of real estate technology firm A La Mode <EVENT eid="e37" class="OCCURRENCE">matched</EVENT> donations, dollar-for-dollar, from customers, employees and anyone else who felt <EVENT eid="e38" class="OCCURRENCE">compelled</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e39" class="OCCURRENCE">donate</EVENT>. 
 
 Brint Construction, a Texas-based, family-owned homebuilder, designed and <EVENT eid="e40" class="OCCURRENCE">built</EVENT> the Lone Survivor Foundation's first retreat center in Bolivar, Texas. The space provides therapeutic healing and educational support for soldiers suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and other wounds <EVENT eid="e41" class="OCCURRENCE">associated</EVENT> with combat. 
 
 Greystone Real Estate Partners of Charleston, South Carolina, is among a number of firms involved with Homes Fit for Heroes, a foundation that provides apartments to wounded special operations warriors  SEALs, Green Berets, Rangers, Night Stalkers, Delta Force members and others  while they recover from their wounds. 
 
These are just a few examples of how real estate folks try to <EVENT eid="e42" class="OCCURRENCE">give</EVENT> back. There are too many others to list here. But we <EVENT eid="e43" class="OCCURRENCE">salute</EVENT> all of them, as well as the warriors they are <EVENT eid="e44" class="OCCURRENCE">helping</EVENT>. 
 
Lew Sichelman has been <EVENT eid="e45" class="OCCURRENCE">covering</EVENT> real <EVENT eid="e46" class="OCCURRENCE">estate</EVENT> for <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P30Y">more than 30 years</TIMEX3>. He is a regular contributor to numerous shelter magazines, as well as housing and finance industry publications. Readers can <EVENT eid="e47" class="OCCURRENCE">contact</EVENT> him at lsichelman@aol.com.
