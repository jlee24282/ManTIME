<TITLE>Pre-eclampsia and risk of infantile haemangioma</TITLE>


<TEXT>
Summary  Background  
Infantile haemangioma is the most common tumour of infancy, but the association with pre-eclampsia is poorly <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">understood</EVENT>. 
 Objectives  
We <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">determined</EVENT> the relationship between variants of pre-eclampsia and risk of infantile haemangioma. 
 Methods  
We <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">carried</EVENT> out a retrospective cohort study of hospital data for all live births between <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="1989">1989 and 2013</TIMEX3> in Quebec, Canada. We <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">identified</EVENT> 14 240 neonates with, and 1 930 564 without haemangioma before discharge, and <EVENT eid="e5" class="I_ACTION">determined</EVENT> whether early- or late-onset pre-eclampsia was <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">documented</EVENT> on the maternal chart. We <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE">used</EVENT> log-binomial regression to <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE">compute</EVENT> prevalence ratios (PRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE">association</EVENT> between pre-eclampsia and infantile haemangioma, adjusted for maternal characteristics. 
 Results  
The prevalence of any haemangioma was higher for pre-eclampsia than for no pre-eclampsia (813 vs. 729 per 10 000), with a PR of 115 (95% CI 106125) after adjustment for maternal characteristics. Pre-eclampsia with onset before <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P34W">34 weeks</TIMEX3> gestation was <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE">associated</EVENT> with cutaneous (PR 232, 95% CI 168321), noncutaneous (PR 366, 95% CI 249537) and unspecified haemangioma (PR 249, 95% CI 177349). However, the association between early-onset pre-eclampsia and haemangioma was <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE">attenuated</EVENT> <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="X">once</TIMEX3> long neonatal length of hospital stays was accounted for. There was no association with late-onset pre-eclampsia after <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P34W">34 weeks</TIMEX3>, and associations were weaker for other variants including severe pre-eclampsia and pre-eclampsia with low birthweight. 
 Conclusions  
Early-onset pre-eclampsia is <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE">associated</EVENT> with increased risk of haemangioma at birth, but detection bias due to longer hospital stays and closer follow-up may be part of the reason.
