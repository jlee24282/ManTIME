<TITLE>Drink: Due Amici at Panorama</TITLE>


<TEXT>
With a world of international wines by the glass at his disposal, one might <EVENT eid="e1" class="I_STATE">expect</EVENT> Panorama owner Luca Sena to <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">name</EVENT> one of the many Italian beauties there as his favorite. But it is perhaps precisely because he is an old-school Italian that he's <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">thinking</EVENT> about the wine he <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">helped</EVENT> make - even if it does <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">come</EVENT> from Pennsylvania. Due Amici ("Two Friends" in Italiano) really is made by two Italian friends, including Gino Razzi from Penns Woods, along with Panorama staff members who <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">helped pick</EVENT>, crush, and blend it in honor of the restaurant's 25th anniversary. An equal-parts blend of cab sauvignon and cab franc (the other duo reference) <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE">combines</EVENT> for a wine that, if tasted blind, few would <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE">guess came</EVENT> from Chester County grapes. This wine has heft, structure, and a core of balanced ripe fruit - some tart plum, tobacco, and cassis from the cab sauv; leathery earth and pepper from the franc - that was spot-on with meats like the braciola, which <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE">tasted</EVENT> better with every sip.
