<TITLE>Xi, Trump share same Achilles' heel</TITLE>


<TEXT>
TOKYO -- Shortly before Donald Trump's raucous presidential <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">inauguration</EVENT> on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-20">Jan. 20</TIMEX3>, a fresh wave of political change <EVENT eid="e2" class="ASPECTUAL">began</EVENT> to sweep through a U.S. rival across the Pacific: China. 
       
To further <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">cement</EVENT> his <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">grip</EVENT> on power ahead of a Communist Party leadership reshuffle <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2018">later this year</TIMEX3>, President Xi Jinping has been <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">promoting</EVENT> allies to top local government posts. On <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-20">Jan. 20</TIMEX3>, Cai Qi and Ying Yong <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">became</EVENT> the latest to <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE">join</EVENT> this growing political army. 
 
Cai, the acting mayor of Beijing, and Ying, the vice mayor of Shanghai, were both elevated to mayor of their respective metropolises. 
 
The Politburo Standing Committee -- the Communist Party's top decision-making body, led by Xi -- is due for a <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE">shake-up</EVENT> at the next national party congress <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="X">this autumn</TIMEX3>. Most of the seven current committee members have <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE">reached</EVENT> retirement age. The 63-year-old Xi, who <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE">doubles</EVENT> as the party's general secretary, will <EVENT eid="e11" class="STATE">stay</EVENT> on. 
 
Xi's <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE">maneuvering comes</EVENT> at a time of high tension between Beijing and Washington, on both the economic and security fronts. But the Chinese leader has at least one thing in common with Trump, the 70-year-old property tycoon and Republican outsider:a personnel policy based on favoritism, be it cronyism or nepotism. 
 
Compared with their predecessors, both presidents were slow to <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE">jump</EVENT> into politics. Xi <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE">did</EVENT> it in his 50s; Trump much later in life. Having not <EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE">spent</EVENT> their lives building political bridges, perhaps, they <EVENT eid="e16" class="OCCURRENCE">tend</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e17" class="OCCURRENCE">rely</EVENT> on limited pools of like-minded talent.The problem is that teams filled with yes men are prone to <EVENT eid="e18" class="OCCURRENCE">malfunctioning</EVENT>. 
 
Factions and friction 
 
Xi <EVENT eid="e19" class="OCCURRENCE">rose</EVENT> to power at the party's last national congress in the <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-AU">autumn of 2012</TIMEX3>, when he <EVENT eid="e20" class="OCCURRENCE">assumed</EVENT> the post of general secretary. He <EVENT eid="e21" class="OCCURRENCE">became</EVENT> president in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-SP">spring 2013</TIMEX3>. Since then, he has been <EVENT eid="e22" class="OCCURRENCE">using</EVENT> his anti-corruption crusade to <EVENT eid="e23" class="OCCURRENCE">bring</EVENT> down political foes and <EVENT eid="e24" class="OCCURRENCE">shore</EVENT> up his power. 
 
Not a few rivals have already been <EVENT eid="e25" class="OCCURRENCE">purged</EVENT>. Those who remain are so frightened that they <EVENT eid="e26" class="OCCURRENCE">keep</EVENT> low profiles, <EVENT eid="e27" class="I_STATE">hoping</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e28" class="OCCURRENCE">ride</EVENT> out the storm. This creates an illusion that the party is <EVENT eid="e29" class="STATE">united</EVENT>. But Xi has <EVENT eid="e30" class="OCCURRENCE">defied convention</EVENT>, both in how he <EVENT eid="e31" class="OCCURRENCE">emerged</EVENT> and how he <EVENT eid="e32" class="OCCURRENCE">rules</EVENT>. 
       
Xi <EVENT eid="e33" class="OCCURRENCE">secured</EVENT> an unusual <EVENT eid="e34" class="OCCURRENCE">promotion</EVENT> at the party congress in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2007">2007</TIMEX3>: He <EVENT eid="e35" class="OCCURRENCE">became</EVENT> a member of the standing committee and <EVENT eid="e36" class="OCCURRENCE">leapfrogged</EVENT> his way to the sixth-ranked post in the hierarchy. That was one notch higher than Li Keqiang, a protege of then President Hu Jintao. 
 
This <EVENT eid="e37" class="OCCURRENCE">made</EVENT> Xi a shoo-in to <EVENT eid="e38" class="OCCURRENCE">succeed</EVENT> Hu. Li <EVENT eid="e39" class="ASPECTUAL">ended</EVENT> up as premier. 
 
Unlike Xi, Hu was still in his 40s when he <EVENT eid="e40" class="OCCURRENCE">emerged</EVENT> as a leader of the future. To be sure, Hu <EVENT eid="e41" class="OCCURRENCE">tapped</EVENT> into his power base -- the Communist Youth League -- to <EVENT eid="e42" class="OCCURRENCE">fill</EVENT> a number of important positions. But he also <EVENT eid="e43" class="ASPECTUAL">advocated standardizing</EVENT> the criteria for <EVENT eid="e44" class="OCCURRENCE">promoting</EVENT> party officials. 
 
Xi has <EVENT eid="e45" class="OCCURRENCE">shunned</EVENT> any institutionalized promotion system. Instead, he has <EVENT eid="e46" class="OCCURRENCE">tapped</EVENT> former subordinates and old friends for most key positions. 
 
The No. 1 requirement for promotion: loyalty to the boss. 
 
Broadly <EVENT eid="e47" class="OCCURRENCE">speaking</EVENT>, the Communist Party is <EVENT eid="e48" class="OCCURRENCE">divided</EVENT> into three groups: Xi's clique; the Communist Youth League faction, comprising former officials of the massive party youth organization; and former PresidentJiang Zemin's faction. 
 
Xi's group, then, is <EVENT eid="e49" class="OCCURRENCE">split</EVENT> between the Zhejiang and Fujian factions. These are <EVENT eid="e50" class="OCCURRENCE">made</EVENT> up offormer underlings from the <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="PXD">days</TIMEX3> when Xi <EVENT eid="e51" class="OCCURRENCE">held</EVENT> party posts in Zhejiang and Fujian provinces. 
 
The majority of his personnel picks <EVENT eid="e52" class="OCCURRENCE">come</EVENT> from these two factions,with the folks from Zhejiang taking precedence. It was in Zhejiang thatXi <EVENT eid="e53" class="OCCURRENCE">became</EVENT> a top provincial official for the first time, serving asparty chief from <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2002">2002 to 2007</TIMEX3>. He <EVENT eid="e54" class="OCCURRENCE">regards</EVENT> the province as his second home. 
 
One prominent member of the Zhejiang faction is Chen Min'er, 56, the <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> party chief in the province of Guizhou.Chen <EVENT eid="e55" class="OCCURRENCE">served</EVENT> as president of the Zhejiang Daily Press Group when he <EVENT eid="e56" class="STATE">was</EVENT> in his 30s. He later <EVENT eid="e57" class="OCCURRENCE">became</EVENT> the province's top propaganda official, <EVENT eid="e58" class="OCCURRENCE">tasked</EVENT> with <EVENT eid="e59" class="OCCURRENCE">supervising</EVENT> local media outlets. 
 
Chen's knack for writing <EVENT eid="e60" class="OCCURRENCE">earned</EVENT> him a job as Xi's speechwriter while he was the provincial party chief. Chen has since <EVENT eid="e61" class="OCCURRENCE">climbed</EVENT> the party ladder quickly. 
 
Ying, the new Shanghai mayor, also hails from the faction. When Xi was <EVENT eid="e62" class="OCCURRENCE">promoted</EVENT> to party chief in Shanghai in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2007">2007</TIMEX3>, he <EVENT eid="e63" class="OCCURRENCE">brought</EVENT> Ying to the city with him. 
 
At 59, Ying has a great deal of experience in judicial and public security affairs. But as mayor, he is useful to Xi in another way: countering the local influence of former President Jiang's group, known as the Shanghai faction. 
 
Xi <EVENT eid="e64" class="OCCURRENCE">spent</EVENT> <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="P17Y">nearly 17 years</TIMEX3> in Fujian, before <EVENT eid="e65" class="OCCURRENCE">moving</EVENT> to Zhejiang. He <EVENT eid="e66" class="OCCURRENCE">rose</EVENT> as high as provincial governor -- the No. 2 post, after provincial party chief. But insiders <EVENT eid="e67" class="REPORTING">say</EVENT> his network of connections there pales in comparison to his Zhejiang ties, <EVENT eid="e68" class="OCCURRENCE">explaining</EVENT> why the Fujian faction plays second fiddle.  
 
Wang Xiaohong, Beijing's public security bureau chief, belongs to the Fujian group. The 59-year-old concurrently serves as the Chinese capital's vice mayor. 
 
Wang is an expert on security, having <EVENT eid="e69" class="OCCURRENCE">served</EVENT> as the top security official in the Fujian city of Xiamen, but he is not necessarily familiar with Beijing. Yet Xi <EVENT eid="e70" class="OCCURRENCE">made</EVENT> him the top watchdog in the capital. 
 
Apparently, Xi <EVENT eid="e71" class="OCCURRENCE">feared</EVENT> for his own physical safety and <EVENT eid="e72" class="I_STATE">wanted</EVENT> someone who would never <EVENT eid="e73" class="OCCURRENCE">betray</EVENT> him. 
 
Wang is also close to Xi's wife, Peng Liyuan. After <EVENT eid="e74" class="OCCURRENCE">divorcing</EVENT> his first wife, Xi married Peng, a popular singer in the military, during his time in Fujian. 
 
Some close aides straddle both factions. Cai, the61-year-old new mayor of Beijing, is one. Xi <EVENT eid="e75" class="OCCURRENCE">got</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e76" class="OCCURRENCE">know</EVENT> Cai in his Fujian days and <EVENT eid="e77" class="OCCURRENCE">brought</EVENT> him along to Zhejiang. 
 
Another example isHuang Kunming, 60, the executive deputy head of the Communist Party's Publicity Department. Huang is in charge of <EVENT eid="e78" class="OCCURRENCE">manipulating</EVENT> public opinion. 
 
Circle of friends 
 
Xi has also <EVENT eid="e79" class="OCCURRENCE">reached</EVENT> further back into his <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">past</TIMEX3> and <EVENT eid="e80" class="OCCURRENCE">tapped</EVENT> old friends for crucial jobs. 
 
Chen Xi, 63, serves as executive deputy head of the Communist Party's Organization Department. The department oversees personnel affairs -- a critical position ahead of the next national congress. 
 
Chen Xi and the president both <EVENT eid="e81" class="OCCURRENCE">graduated</EVENT> from Beijing's Tsinghua University, where they were roommates. 
 
Liu He, 65, is the oldest pal among Xi's close aides. They both <EVENT eid="e82" class="OCCURRENCE">graduated</EVENT> from the prestigious Beijing 101 Middle School -- the school of choice for many children of senior Communist Party and military officials. 
 
Liu is Xi's top economic adviser. He <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> <EVENT eid="e83" class="STATE">serves</EVENT> as director of the Office of the Central Leading Group on Financial and Economic Affairs, the party's key economic panel. 
 
Anti-corruption czar Wang Qishan, 68, and Xi also <EVENT eid="e84" class="OCCURRENCE">go</EVENT> way back. 
 
During the <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="-1976">1966-1976</TIMEX3> Cultural Revolution, "intellectual youths" from the cities were <EVENT eid="e85" class="OCCURRENCE">sent</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e86" class="OCCURRENCE">live</EVENT> and <EVENT eid="e87" class="OCCURRENCE">work</EVENT> in rural areas under the "Up to the Mountains and Down to the Countryside Movement." 
 
When Xi was 15, he too was "<EVENT eid="e88" class="OCCURRENCE">sent</EVENT> down" from Beijing to a remote farming <EVENT eid="e89" class="OCCURRENCE">village</EVENT> near Yan'an, Shaanxi Province. Wang was <EVENT eid="e90" class="OCCURRENCE">sent</EVENT> to the area around the same time. <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Today</TIMEX3>, Wang is <EVENT eid="e91" class="OCCURRENCE">spearheading</EVENT> the crackdown on graft as head of theCentral Commission for Discipline Inspection, and is one of Xi's most trusted allies. 
 
The Communist Party's General Office is <EVENT eid="e92" class="OCCURRENCE">headed</EVENT> by Li Zhanshu, 66. Li and Xi <EVENT eid="e93" class="OCCURRENCE">became acquainted</EVENT> in Hebei Province, when <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="X">the</TIMEX3> future president was in his 20s. 
 
The executive deputy head of the General Office, 54-year-oldDing Xuexiang, <EVENT eid="e94" class="OCCURRENCE">served</EVENT> as Xi's secretary when he <EVENT eid="e95" class="STATE">was</EVENT> the party chief in Shanghai. Ding is also head of the General Secretary's Office. 
 
Trump's way 
 
It is easy to see similarities in President Trump's approach. For starters, he <EVENT eid="e96" class="OCCURRENCE">made</EVENT> his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, a senior adviser, <EVENT eid="e97" class="OCCURRENCE">raising</EVENT> concerns about potential conflicts of interest. 
 
One diplomat who has been <EVENT eid="e98" class="OCCURRENCE">stationed</EVENT> in the U.S. and Europe <EVENT eid="e99" class="OCCURRENCE">weighed</EVENT> in on Trump's personnel appointments. 
 
"When it comes to security, he <EVENT eid="e100" class="I_STATE">thinks</EVENT> of generals he's <EVENT eid="e101" class="PERCEPTION">seen</EVENT> in war movies and appoints military personnel to government posts," the diplomat <EVENT eid="e102" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT>. "As for the economy, he can think of only financial people he knows on Wall Street, such as those from Goldman Sachs." 
 
Trump, who never <EVENT eid="e103" class="OCCURRENCE">held</EVENT> public office prior to <EVENT eid="e104" class="OCCURRENCE">becoming</EVENT> president, is <EVENT eid="e105" class="OCCURRENCE">forming</EVENT> a team with plenty of yes men, much like Xi. 
 
Politically, this is a particularly sensitive <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DURATION" value="PXY">year</TIMEX3> for China. The tug-of-war within the party is <EVENT eid="e106" class="I_STATE">expected</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e107" class="OCCURRENCE">intensify</EVENT> before the new leadership lineup is <EVENT eid="e108" class="OCCURRENCE">announced</EVENT> in the <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2017-AU">autumn</TIMEX3>. Various forces will be <EVENT eid="e109" class="I_ACTION">looking</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e110" class="OCCURRENCE">put</EVENT> their rivals at a <EVENT eid="e111" class="OCCURRENCE">disadvantage</EVENT>, and could seek to <EVENT eid="e112" class="OCCURRENCE">exploit</EVENT> tensions with the U.S. 
 
The question is: Will the two presidents' yes men <EVENT eid="e113" class="I_STATE">manage</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e114" class="OCCURRENCE">find</EVENT> common ground amid growing friction over trade and security?
