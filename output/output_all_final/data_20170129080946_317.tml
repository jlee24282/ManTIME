<TITLE>The Convert review  full-blooded, with a dash of melodrama</TITLE>


<TEXT>
Gate, London

A young womans conversion to Catholicism in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="X">19th-century</TIMEX3> Rhodesia speaks volumes in Danai Guriras bold tale of oppression and identity The Convert is enough to give historical drama a good name. With more bare breasts than bonnets, and a complicated intertwining of hope and betrayal, Danai Guriras <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">play</EVENT> wallops down with force. This is Christopher Haydons last <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">production</EVENT> as artistic director of the Gate: it is a bold goodbye.

To <EVENT eid="e3" class="REPORTING">say</EVENT> that Gurira concerns herself with the effects of colonialism on southern Africa is to <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">risk making</EVENT> her play sound doctrinaire, and single-stranded. There is nothing dry about it: it is full-blooded, with a dash of melodrama, <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">hitting</EVENT> out in several directions.

In <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="1896">1896</TIMEX3>, in what was then Rhodesia, a young Zezuru girl is <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">taken</EVENT> into the household of a black Roman Catholic missionary. She has been <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE">rescued</EVENT> from a forced marriage, at a cost. She has to <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE">convert</EVENT>. She has to <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE">change</EVENT> her name: Jekesai becomes Ester. She has to <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE">alter</EVENT> her demeanour, <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE">reining</EVENT> in exuberant affection, the forceful expression of grief. She has to <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE">abandon</EVENT> her family. She is <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE">regarded</EVENT> as a quisling. The character who most upturns expectations is <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE">played</EVENT>, with beautiful, slinky scepticism, by Joan Iyiola As Jekesai, Mimi Ndiweni <EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE">arrives</EVENT> with a smile so enormous that her features can barely <EVENT eid="e16" class="OCCURRENCE">fit</EVENT> around it. Her language is Shona, which is not <EVENT eid="e17" class="OCCURRENCE">welcomed</EVENT> among English speakers. In the absence of vocabulary she proselytises with her good humour. As Ester, <EVENT eid="e18" class="OCCURRENCE">equipped</EVENT> with English habits and speech, she becomes contained but is still radiant. She is an utterly convincing missionary: fervent and eloquent, <EVENT eid="e19" class="OCCURRENCE">fired</EVENT> up by <EVENT eid="e20" class="OCCURRENCE">having</EVENT> a task which uses her talents.

Rosie Elniles design tells of the countrys schisms: a chaise longue and a desk are perched on the cracked floor; in one corner is a heap of red rock. But when the expected strife between settlers and inhabitants <EVENT eid="e21" class="OCCURRENCE">breaks</EVENT> out, it does not obscure another division: between men and women.

Stefan Adegbola is persuasive and comic as the compliant missionary who is <EVENT eid="e22" class="OCCURRENCE">bursting</EVENT>  "under my very nostrils"  with askew phrases. But the character who most upturns expectations is played, with beautiful, slinky scepticism, by Joan Iyiola. Prudence, another convert, is a tea-drinking, pipe-smoking, Shona-speaking, academically brilliant black woman. She is more than sophisticated and sharp. She is the cleverest person on stage.
