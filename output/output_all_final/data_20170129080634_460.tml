<TITLE>Concerns Over Child Miners Of Plateau</TITLE>


<TEXT>
A new trend is <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">emerging</EVENT> in Jos and its environs as far as mining activities is concerned as school children <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">abandon</EVENT> their studies for illegal mining business which is thriving, ACHOR ABIMAJE, reports.I am here because I <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">work</EVENT> in the site everyday so that I can make little money to <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">take</EVENT> to my parents. They <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">use</EVENT> the money to <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">provide</EVENT> food and do other necessary things for us. These were the words of 10-year-old Daniel Pam (not real name).People <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE">call</EVENT> our business illegal and sometime security operatives <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE">chase</EVENT> us but we <EVENT eid="e9" class="I_STATE">believe</EVENT> it is better than <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE">stealing</EVENT> or <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE">engaging</EVENT> in other vices. We are <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE">exploring</EVENT> the <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE">blessing</EVENT> of God on our land to our own benefit, he <EVENT eid="e14" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT> while looking unperturbed.Many children, like Pam who ordinarily should be in the class room <EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE">listening</EVENT> to their teachers <EVENT eid="e16" class="OCCURRENCE">impart</EVENT> knowledge to them, are unfortunately on the mining field, in many of the mining sites scattered in different <EVENT eid="e17" class="OCCURRENCE">locations</EVENT> in Jos and its environs, including some far away council areas where mining activities <EVENT eid="e18" class="OCCURRENCE">take</EVENT> place.Plateau State is reputed for mining with Jos its capital, widely <EVENT eid="e19" class="OCCURRENCE">referred</EVENT> to as the tin city state <EVENT eid="e20" class="OCCURRENCE">owing</EVENT> the abundance of tin and years of tin mining activities in the area.But over <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="X">a century</TIMEX3> after mining <EVENT eid="e21" class="OCCURRENCE">commenced</EVENT> in parts of the state, school children and in some instances, children of school age <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> abandoned school for illegal mining activities in Plateau State.It is observed that this singular act is responsible for an unusually large number of students/pupil drop out to <EVENT eid="e22" class="OCCURRENCE">pursue</EVENT> illegal mining business in various location in the state.In places like Bassa, Jos South, Riyom and BarkinLadi local government council of the state where illegal mining activities are being <EVENT eid="e23" class="OCCURRENCE">carried</EVENT> out, scores of children are seen <EVENT eid="e24" class="OCCURRENCE">engaged</EVENT> in <EVENT eid="e25" class="OCCURRENCE">carrying</EVENT> the excavated minerals from one location to another for a token.In most of the sites <EVENT eid="e26" class="OCCURRENCE">visited</EVENT>, there are close to a thousand youths; this is aside married women who are <EVENT eid="e27" class="STATE">engaged</EVENT> in illegal mining activities. Other businesses also thrive around the mining sites such as selling of local beer known as burukutu, and commercial sex work.Beyond the fact that there are so many youths engaged in the illegal activities, the key concern of stakeholders hinge on the fact that children who ordinarily should have been in schools swarm in and around the illegal mining sites.As against this background, stakeholders in education sector in Barkin-Ladi and Bassa local government area <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> <EVENT eid="e28" class="OCCURRENCE">appealed</EVENT> to relevant government authorities to look into this ugly trend which they noted, was <EVENT eid="e29" class="OCCURRENCE">putting</EVENT> the education of the children and by implication, the future of the state in jeopardy.This development has led to <EVENT eid="e30" class="OCCURRENCE">increase</EVENT> in school drop out in the area, a seasoned educationist and retired principal, Solomon Titus noted.The stakeholders made the call when the commissioner for Secondary Education in the state Hon. Joseph Mairiga <EVENT eid="e31" class="OCCURRENCE">visited</EVENT> Government College Foron in Barkin-Ladi LGASpeaking to our correspondent, the area director of Education in Barkin-Ladi, Longbam Elizabeth who <EVENT eid="e32" class="OCCURRENCE">acknowledged</EVENT> the increase in students enrolment in public school as a result of the relative peace that has <EVENT eid="e33" class="OCCURRENCE">returned</EVENT> to the area, lamented that tin mining activities in the locality was distracting students from attending schools.Speaking in a similar manner, a community leader, Timothy David from Bassa local government area also <EVENT eid="e34" class="OCCURRENCE">called</EVENT> for intervention on the illegal mining activities in the area along Mista Ali.But while the community leader was silent on what many described as side effect of the mining bug that has bitten Plateau State children, the principal of Government Secondary School Mista Ali, a village along Jos-Zaria road, Mrs. JijidaJamo specifically noted that the ongoing illegal mining activities in the area was <EVENT eid="e35" class="OCCURRENCE">threatening</EVENT> the education of the children of the area.It is distracting the activities of the institution as most students would rather <EVENT eid="e36" class="OCCURRENCE">visit</EVENT> the site to <EVENT eid="e37" class="OCCURRENCE">work</EVENT> and make little money than attend school, she said and called for urgent intervention.Security Clamp Down On Illegal MinersIndications have emerged that security personnel are not resting on their oars in stemming the dangerous tide if for no other thing, but to save the <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="FUTURE_REF">future</TIMEX3> of the children who are increasingly being lured into abandoning their education for the illegal business.Only <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3>, the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDS) in the state arrested four persons for carrying out illegal mining activities around the Lamingo Dam, in Jos North local government area of the state.The states NSCDC public relations officer Naomi Cishak told journalist that the corps also <EVENT eid="e38" class="OCCURRENCE">arrested</EVENT> three other illegal miners around Mista Ali Bassa local government area of the state <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3>, <EVENT eid="e39" class="OCCURRENCE">bringing</EVENT> the number of those arrested to seven, a figure many describe insignificant considering the large number of persons allegedly <EVENT eid="e40" class="OCCURRENCE">engaged</EVENT> in the act, but a step in the right direction.Chishak warned residents to desist from mining around the Lamingo Dam which provides water for domestic and industrial use insisting that it was detrimental to the health of all residents of Jos City. She <EVENT eid="e41" class="REPORTING">assured</EVENT> that that the NSCDC will <EVENT eid="e42" class="OCCURRENCE">intensify efforts</EVENT> at <EVENT eid="e43" class="OCCURRENCE">arresting</EVENT> such illegal miners. Our correspondent reports that other security agencies like the police are also not <EVENT eid="e44" class="OCCURRENCE">resting</EVENT> in their oars in <EVENT eid="e45" class="OCCURRENCE">combating</EVENT> the menace.A Peep Into History Of Mining On The PlateauOne of the things that <EVENT eid="e46" class="OCCURRENCE">earned</EVENT> fame for Plateau State is <EVENT eid="e47" class="OCCURRENCE">mining</EVENT> activities which was <EVENT eid="e48" class="OCCURRENCE">done</EVENT> by the Europeans before the <EVENT eid="e49" class="OCCURRENCE">discovery</EVENT> of oil in Nigeria. Indeed, before the oil boom, mining was one of the major sources of revenue generation in the country.By <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="1913">1913</TIMEX3>, there were 108 mining companies registered by the Royal Niger Company and in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="1943">1943</TIMEX3>, tin mining on the Plateau was at its peak as there were about 80,000 African workers.Until <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="1960">1960</TIMEX3>, Jos was the sixth largest producer of tin in the world while it was <EVENT eid="e50" class="OCCURRENCE">gathered</EVENT> that 225-kilometre land space was <EVENT eid="e51" class="OCCURRENCE">claimed</EVENT> by tin mining. In <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="197X">the 1970s</TIMEX3>, Nigeria <EVENT eid="e52" class="REPORTING">produced</EVENT> an average of 10,000 tons of tin-ore annually.Experts estimated that miners on the Plateau <EVENT eid="e53" class="OCCURRENCE">dig</EVENT> up six million tons of soil <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="SET" value="P1Y">every year</TIMEX3>. Sitting on the mineral-rich Plateau, Jos and its surrounding areas <EVENT eid="e54" class="OCCURRENCE">became</EVENT> prosperous and famous as a result of tin mining activities.It is <EVENT eid="e55" class="OCCURRENCE">gathered</EVENT> that mining activities on the Plateau was the single most important factor responsible for the wealth of some indigenous business men during <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="196X">the 1960s</TIMEX3> when the business boom.Residents Seek End To Illegal MiningObviously <EVENT eid="e56" class="OCCURRENCE">disturbed</EVENT> by the emerging trend and its implication for the state, some residents who <EVENT eid="e57" class="OCCURRENCE">spoke</EVENT> to our correspondent <EVENT eid="e58" class="OCCURRENCE">enjoined</EVENT> government and relevant stakeholders to <EVENT eid="e59" class="OCCURRENCE">synergize</EVENT> and <EVENT eid="e60" class="OCCURRENCE">ensure</EVENT> a lasting solution to the menace is achieved.Among the respondents who <EVENT eid="e61" class="OCCURRENCE">spoke</EVENT> to our correspondent was Dachan Dennis. He <EVENT eid="e62" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT> the time was ripe for all hands to be on deck in <EVENT eid="e63" class="OCCURRENCE">combating</EVENT> the menace of illegal mining in general and specifically, the idea of <EVENT eid="e64" class="I_ACTION">luring</EVENT> children to be <EVENT eid="e65" class="OCCURRENCE">used</EVENT> as child labour in most of the illegal sites.This is a sad development and indeed, its an infraction on the rights of children, that is even if we <EVENT eid="e66" class="I_STATE">dont condemn</EVENT> the business for the simple fact that it is illegally <EVENT eid="e67" class="OCCURRENCE">done</EVENT>, we must <EVENT eid="e68" class="OCCURRENCE">condemn</EVENT> it for <EVENT eid="e69" class="OCCURRENCE">attracting</EVENT> children.One thing which appears central in the views expressed by all the respondents is the need for government to <EVENT eid="e70" class="OCCURRENCE">step-up</EVENT> its surveillance role and <EVENT eid="e71" class="OCCURRENCE">ensure</EVENT> that all those engaged are <EVENT eid="e72" class="OCCURRENCE">arrested</EVENT> and made to <EVENT eid="e73" class="OCCURRENCE">face</EVENT> full wrath of the law.We are not <EVENT eid="e74" class="I_STATE">opposed</EVENT> to people <EVENT eid="e75" class="OCCURRENCE">prospecting</EVENT> for minerals after all it is a source of revenue for us as a people but we <EVENT eid="e76" class="I_STATE">frown</EVENT> at it being <EVENT eid="e77" class="OCCURRENCE">done</EVENT> illegally and more so that people <EVENT eid="e78" class="OCCURRENCE">use</EVENT> it to <EVENT eid="e79" class="OCCURRENCE">lure</EVENT> children to the sites for cheap labour, DomicToklong <EVENT eid="e80" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT>.
