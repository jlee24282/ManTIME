<TITLE>Donald Trump capping a pen triggers the funniest of photoshop battles online</TITLE>


<TEXT>
The jokes were aplenty, from <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">replacing</EVENT> the pen with toys and cutlery to <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">handling</EVENT> him a guitar and a violin. If the last online <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">offering</EVENT> of Barack Obamas presidency was a whole spate of Joe Biden and Obama memes (and lets face it, theyre so awesome we cant get enough of them), then the current US President Donald Trump has been an unending source of <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">photoshoppping</EVENT> memes and battles online ever since his election campaigning days. That hes <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> the most powerful man in the world, who justifiably <EVENT eid="e5" class="I_STATE">thinks owning</EVENT> the nuclear codes is very, very scary, does nothing to <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">lessen</EVENT> the number of memes inspired by him. ALSO READ | If at all, every day is a fresh day for a whole new set of hilarious photo-editing battles online, and were not <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE">complaining</EVENT>.

The latest is a picture of the US President smugly <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE">capping</EVENT> a pen soon after his <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE">inauguration</EVENT>, where he <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE">made</EVENT> his cabinet selections official, along with a couple of other nitty-gritties. Trump apparently <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE">took</EVENT> a great deal of car while capping each pen after <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE">signing</EVENT> the order and <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE">giving</EVENT> it away. One such picture was <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE">captured</EVENT> and <EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE">circulated</EVENT> on social media, <EVENT eid="e16" class="OCCURRENCE">prompting</EVENT> a whole host of memes. MUST WATCH | The jokes were aplenty, from <EVENT eid="e17" class="OCCURRENCE">replacing</EVENT> the pen with toys and cutlery to <EVENT eid="e18" class="OCCURRENCE">handling</EVENT> him a guitar and a violin. There were, of course, a number of wall jokes as well  from actual bricks to Legos.

Take a look at some of the funniest ones here.
