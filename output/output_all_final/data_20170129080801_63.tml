<TITLE>How Kcee approached Harrysong to help salvage his dying career  Harrysongs management</TITLE>


<TEXT>
The new management company of Harrysong Altar Plate has said Five Star Musics Kcee is talentless and knows nothing about music

While reacting to a statement by Five Star Music Harrysongs management <EVENT eid="e1" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT> Kcee desperately bought him out of his contract with Question Mark Records According to Desmond Ike-Chima who <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">released</EVENT> a statement Kcee approached Harrysong on "bended knees to help salvage his dying career"

He also <EVENT eid="e3" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT> Harrysong developed and wrote all the hit songs of former label mate Kcee

Ike-Chima noted that Harrysong was not <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">arrested</EVENT> rather he was <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">invited</EVENT>

"It was 8am and policemen acting on the instruction of the Assistant Inspector General of Police in Onikan <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">stormed</EVENT> our hotel room to invite Harrysong over for <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE">questioning</EVENT> As a law abiding citizen with nothing to fear we got dressed up and went to the AIGs office

"On getting there we were <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE">greeted</EVENT> by the presence of a haggard looking young man in cheap suit identified as Five Star Musics lawyer As against the kangaroo statement <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE">released</EVENT> by Five Star Music Harrysong did not at any time approach anyone or company to sign him it was Kcee who <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE">approached</EVENT> Harrysong on bended knees to help salvage his dying career after he <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE">fell</EVENT> out with his then partner Presh

"As much as Harrysong loved to help him out in that time of need it is worthy of note that Kcee is talentless and knows next to nothing about music

"Harrysong had a running contract with Questionmark Records but out of desperation Kcee and Five Star Music were prepared to pay off Kelvin Luciano in their quest to have Harrysong at all cost

"It should be recalled that Harrysong succeeded in recreating Kcees sound as he wrote and co-produced hits including Had it been I know Okpekete Limpopo Pull Over and other songs that defined the Kcee that everyone <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> knows and celebrates <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3> all pro bono

"For what its worth Harrysongs dealing with Five Star Music was with the clause that he would be left to pursue his career whenever he deemed it fit For the records Altarplate has come to stay and the general public can do business with Harrysong and Alterplate management" Follow ynaija on Twitter
