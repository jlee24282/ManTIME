<TITLE>The 4-1-1 on Archie Comics' new series 'Riverdale'</TITLE>


<TEXT>
Everyone’s <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">got</EVENT> questions about “Riverdale,” the new series, which <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">premiered</EVENT> <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-26">Thursday</TIMEX3> on The CW, based on the enduring characters from Archie Comics. Here, then, are the answers: 
 
QUESTION: Some people refer to this series as “Dawson’s Creek meets Twin Peaks.” Is that accurate? 
 
ANSWER : It isn’t just “some people” who <EVENT eid="e3" class="REPORTING">say</EVENT> that, it’s Roberto Aguirre Sacasa himself, a TV and comics veteran who is the Chief Creative Officer at Archie Comics and the creator of “Riverdale.” He <EVENT eid="e4" class="REPORTING">told</EVENT> comicbookresources. com in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2014">2014</TIMEX3>: “Something we <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">talk</EVENT> a lot about is, ‘Imagine if Riverdale were like “Twin Peaks,” and was a really weird small town.’ But “Twin Peaks” had some very funny black humor stuff to it; obviously it was very serious as well. So that kind of balance is what we’re going to <EVENT eid="e6" class="I_ACTION">try</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE">strike</EVENT> with the show.” 
 
QUESTION: So it’s going to be <EVENT eid="e8" class="STATE">weird</EVENT>. 
 
ANSWER : A little, yeah. It begins with the death of Jason Blossom, the identical twin of Riverdale High’s Queen Bee and resident Mean Girl, Cheryl Blossom (Madelaine Petsch). Much like “Twin Peaks,” Riverdale is going to be the ’50s throwback town with dark secrets beneath the seemingly perfect surface. 
 
QUESTION: Why do that? Why change these wholesome characters from our youth? Is nothing sacred? 
 
ANSWER : Because the wholesome characters from our youth don’t <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE">sell</EVENT> well anymore. I read them until middle school and then <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE">quit</EVENT>, and I bet so did you. And younger kids <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3> are <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE">playing</EVENT> video games, not <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE">reading</EVENT> Archies. Up until <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3>, the Archie titles were <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE">selling</EVENT> in the low thousands. 
 
So for <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="PXY">the last few years</TIMEX3>, Archie Comics has been working to <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE">fix</EVENT> these problems by <EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE">placing</EVENT> the gang in new situations — zombie apocalypse survivor Archie in “Afterlife with Archie,” <EVENT eid="e16" class="OCCURRENCE">grown</EVENT> and married Archie in “Life with Archie,” not long for this world Archie in “Archie vs. Predator.” The publisher <EVENT eid="e17" class="I_ACTION">assumed</EVENT> affection for the characters would <EVENT eid="e18" class="OCCURRENCE">carry</EVENT> readers through, and it <EVENT eid="e19" class="OCCURRENCE">worked</EVENT>. 
 
The core line of Archie books has been <EVENT eid="e20" class="OCCURRENCE">rebooted</EVENT> as well. The new titles still <EVENT eid="e21" class="OCCURRENCE">feature</EVENT> a group of basically good (and funny) kids, but the humor is more sophisticated and the approach more modern. They’re <EVENT eid="e22" class="OCCURRENCE">written</EVENT> and <EVENT eid="e23" class="OCCURRENCE">drawn</EVENT> by mostly A list talent, and appeal to older readers as well as their children. 
 
“Riverdale” is just an <EVENT eid="e24" class="OCCURRENCE">extension</EVENT> of that game plan. 
 
QUESTION: Will I <EVENT eid="e25" class="OCCURRENCE">recognize</EVENT> any actors on this show? 
 
ANSWER : Oh, sure. Most of the principals are essentially newcomers, but you’ll see Luke Perry of “Beverly Hills 90201” as Archie’s dad, Fred Andrews. Molly Ringwald, who <EVENT eid="e26" class="I_STATE">seemed</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e27" class="OCCURRENCE">star</EVENT> in every movie John Hughes made in the ’80s, <EVENT eid="e28" class="OCCURRENCE">plays</EVENT> Archie’s mother, Mary Andrews. Madchen Amick, waitress Shelly Johnson at the Double R Diner in “Twin Peaks,” is Betty’s mother, Alice Cooper. Cole Sprouse, of “Grace Under Fire,” <EVENT eid="e29" class="REPORTING">plays</EVENT> Jughead. Shannon Purser, who <EVENT eid="e30" class="OCCURRENCE">played</EVENT> Barb on “Stranger Things,” is “Big” Ethel Muggs. Sarah Habel, who <EVENT eid="e31" class="OCCURRENCE">plays</EVENT> Miss Grundy, was in “Hostel: Part III,” which makes her sorta famous, I guess. 
 
QUESTION: Wait, Sarah Habel is a hottie! Miss Grundy is <EVENT eid="e32" class="I_STATE">supposed</EVENT> to be an old bat! 
 
ANSWER : Not in “Riverdale”! And she’s something of a twentysomething cougar, having <EVENT eid="e33" class="OCCURRENCE">seduced</EVENT> Archie into an illicit affair at the <EVENT eid="e34" class="ASPECTUAL">beginning</EVENT> of the show. 
 
QUESTION: Wait, there’s sex in Riverdale? That’s new. 
 
ANSWER: We still don’t <EVENT eid="e35" class="PERCEPTION">see</EVENT> it in the comics. As to “Riverdale,” we shouldn’t be <EVENT eid="e36" class="STATE">surprised</EVENT>. There was sex when we were in high school, too, and always has been. We just didn’t <EVENT eid="e37" class="OCCURRENCE">talk</EVENT> about it, and girls who got pregnant “<EVENT eid="e38" class="OCCURRENCE">went</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e39" class="OCCURRENCE">visit</EVENT> their aunt” for <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P6M">six months</TIMEX3>. Welcome to the <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="202X">21st century</TIMEX3>, where what goes on behind closed doors is discussed at Pop’s Choklit Shoppe. 
 
QUESTION: Speaking of sex, it looks like Betty and Veronica are <EVENT eid="e40" class="OCCURRENCE">kissing</EVENT> on one of the “Riverdale” trailers. I <EVENT eid="e41" class="I_STATE">guess</EVENT> in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="202X">the 21st century</TIMEX3>, they just don’t <EVENT eid="e42" class="I_STATE">need</EVENT> Archie. 
 
ANSWER: Don’t <EVENT eid="e43" class="OCCURRENCE">worry</EVENT>, the central love triangle is still mostly intact on “Riverdale.” Betty Cooper (Lili Reinhart), who has been best friends with Archie (KJ Apa) since childhood, is <EVENT eid="e44" class="OCCURRENCE">wrestling</EVENT> with stronger feelings for him. That’s <EVENT eid="e45" class="OCCURRENCE">complicated</EVENT> by the arrival of Veronica Lodge (Camila Mendes), who snags Archie’s <EVENT eid="e46" class="OCCURRENCE">attention</EVENT>. 
 
But Reinhart <EVENT eid="e47" class="REPORTING">told</EVENT> holly woodlife.com that the kiss on the trailer is a dodge. 
 
“They’re not romantically <EVENT eid="e48" class="OCCURRENCE">involved</EVENT>,” she <EVENT eid="e49" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT>. And while there’s a lot of fan fiction out there about “Beronica,” and some fans would <EVENT eid="e50" class="I_STATE">love</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e51" class="OCCURRENCE">see</EVENT> them as a couple, Reinhart <EVENT eid="e52" class="REPORTING">says</EVENT> “That’s not our show.” The girls are the best of friends, <EVENT eid="e53" class="REPORTING">according</EVENT> to The CW description, and they’re unlikely to jeopardize that by <EVENT eid="e54" class="OCCURRENCE">fighting</EVENT> over a boy. 
 
QUESTION: So there’s no homosexuality on the show? 
 
ANSWER: I didn’t <EVENT eid="e55" class="REPORTING">say</EVENT> that. Kevin Keller (Casey Cott) is an openly gay student at Riverdale High, as he is in the comics. And while it’s by no means definite, Entertainment Weekly describes Ethel as someone “who has a major crush on Jughead ... in the comics. But, on Riverdale, Ethel will <EVENT eid="e56" class="OCCURRENCE">find</EVENT> herself in a romantic relationship with someone very different.” It’s a good bet that someone is of a different gender. 
 
QUESTION: Or a different race? 
 
ANSWER: That’s possible, too. The original Archie cast was <EVENT eid="e57" class="OCCURRENCE">created</EVENT> in <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="194X">the 1940s</TIMEX3>, so by default they were all white. “Riverdale,” however, reflects the America of <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3>. 
 
Veronica and her mother Hermione (Marisol Nichols) are Latina. It’s unclear who <EVENT eid="e58" class="OCCURRENCE">plays</EVENT> resident genius Dilton Doiley — both Daniel Yang and Major Curda have been <EVENT eid="e59" class="OCCURRENCE">mentioned</EVENT> — but he’s definitely Asian. Josie  amp; the Pussycats, which <EVENT eid="e60" class="OCCURRENCE">used</EVENT> to have one black member, is now entirely African American (starring Ashleigh Murray as Josie, Hayley Law as Valerie and Asha Bromfield as Melody). Ross Butler, who <EVENT eid="e61" class="OCCURRENCE">plays</EVENT> Archie foil Reggie Mantle, is part Indonesian. 
 
QUESTION: Reggie, Dilton, Josie and the Pussycats — who else <EVENT eid="e62" class="OCCURRENCE">made</EVENT> the cut? 
 
ANSWER: Riverdale High’s coach Clayton (Colin Lawrence) appears, so maybe his son Chuck will, too. 
 
Marmaduke “Moose” Mason (Cody Kearsley) is on the show, but so far there’s no sign of girlfriend Midge Klump. Cheryl’s Mean Girl posse includes Ginger Lopez (Caitlin Mitchell Markovitch) and Tina Patel (Olivia Ryan Stern). But probably the most interesting cast member could <EVENT eid="e63" class="OCCURRENCE">arrive</EVENT> from neighboring Greendale. 
 
QUESTION: You mean ... ? 
 
ANSWER: Yep. Rumor has it that Sabrina the Teenage Witch is due to <EVENT eid="e64" class="OCCURRENCE">appear</EVENT> in the last episode of what will hopefully be just the first season of “Riverdale.” Anybody know what Melissa Joan Hart is <EVENT eid="e65" class="OCCURRENCE">doing</EVENT> these <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="PXD">days</TIMEX3>?
