Scout takes a look at the Top 10 defensive prospects from North squad at the Senior Bowl. 
 

 

 
1. NT - Stevie Tu'ikolovatu , USC - We <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">asked</EVENT> Tu'ikolovatu how what the key is to <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">anchor</EVENT> down in the middle and <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">keep</EVENT> double teams from <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">moving</EVENT> him back too far. He wasn't sure how he does it, but we have a pretty good idea - he's a powerful 6-foot-1, 350 pounds. That helps. But don't <EVENT eid="e5" class="I_STATE">think</EVENT> about the big uglies with the massive guts. He's <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">built</EVENT> solid and strong and <EVENT eid="e7" class="I_STATE">loves</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE">trash</EVENT> talk  then smile about it. He was incredibly consistent from day <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DURATION" value="PXD">to day</TIMEX3>, <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE">making</EVENT> big plays in the running game, even when he was double-teamed. Some draft analysts had him as a late-round pick prior to Senior Bowl <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P1W">week</TIMEX3>, but his stock should be <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE">rising</EVENT>.

2. DE -  Chris Wormley , Michigan - An ideal blend of size (6-foot-5, 297) and speed for an NFL defensive end in a 4-3 system, nobody <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE">displayed</EVENT> better and more consistent pass-rushing speed in Mobile <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-W05">this week</TIMEX3> than Wormley. He's quick off the snap, good at <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE">splitting</EVENT> double teams and can <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE">get</EVENT> to the quarterback. He also has one of the biggest wingspans among Senior Bowl players. 
 
3. CB - Rasul Douglas , West Virginia - At 6'2 and 204 pounds, Douglas has the size at corner that NFL general managers crave. Because he <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE">moved</EVENT> so well in drills, Douglas didn't <EVENT eid="e15" class="I_STATE">seem</EVENT> to be that big. he <EVENT eid="e16" class="OCCURRENCE">moved</EVENT> like a 5'10 <EVENT eid="e17" class="OCCURRENCE">corner</EVENT> with a lower center of gravity. He is incredibly physical and <EVENT eid="e18" class="STATE">uses</EVENT> his hands well in press and to <EVENT eid="e19" class="OCCURRENCE">knock</EVENT> away a ball. The biggest <EVENT eid="e20" class="OCCURRENCE">knock</EVENT> on him has been his health, but out at Senior Bowl practice, Douglas looked healthy, and terrific 
 
4. Safety - John Johnson , Boston College  - When <EVENT eid="e21" class="OCCURRENCE">watching</EVENT> the defensive backs <EVENT eid="e22" class="OCCURRENCE">go</EVENT> through drills, Johnson had a different gait with his back pedal, turn and run; he glides. He could visibly <EVENT eid="e23" class="OCCURRENCE">accelerate</EVENT> in his backpedal, and there was no wasted motion when he would <EVENT eid="e24" class="OCCURRENCE">flip</EVENT> his hips and run deep. Johnson <EVENT eid="e25" class="OCCURRENCE">checked</EVENT> in at 6'0 5/8" and 205 pounds. He has the skills to <EVENT eid="e26" class="OCCURRENCE">play</EVENT> corner in some schemes, but he can also <EVENT eid="e27" class="OCCURRENCE">drop</EVENT> right in and <EVENT eid="e28" class="I_STATE">play</EVENT> free safety in the NFL. When the practices <EVENT eid="e29" class="OCCURRENCE">went</EVENT> to seven on seven or full scrimmage situation, Johnson was as solid in coverage as he <EVENT eid="e30" class="OCCURRENCE">looked</EVENT> in drills. He was the best looking safety on either team. 
 
5. CB - Desmond King , Iowa - At 5'10 1/8" and 206 pounds, King doesn't have the height that Douglas does at corner, but he still <EVENT eid="e31" class="STATE">has</EVENT> plenty of size and strength <EVENT eid="e32" class="OCCURRENCE">packed</EVENT> into that frame. The most fundamentally sound of the corners for the North, King had great technique. He might be the most ready of the defensive backs to <EVENT eid="e33" class="OCCURRENCE">step</EVENT> in right away in the NFL. 
 
6. OLB - Haasan Reddick, Temple - Reddick immediately <EVENT eid="e34" class="OCCURRENCE">caught</EVENT> our eyes during drills because of his athleticism. Checking the roster, he was <EVENT eid="e35" class="OCCURRENCE">listed</EVENT> at 6'1 and 230 pounds, standing eye to eye with Michigan's Ben Gedeon who was listed 6'3 and 247. Something didn't <EVENT eid="e36" class="OCCURRENCE">measure</EVENT> up. When the official heights and weights were <EVENT eid="e37" class="OCCURRENCE">released</EVENT>, Reddick was 6'1.5 and 237 pounds, while Gedeon was 6'1 5/8" and 243 pounds. That's more like it. Reddick's athleticism in agility drills <EVENT eid="e38" class="OCCURRENCE">translated</EVENT> to production on the field as he was the North's best pass rusher from the linebacker spot, and he was <EVENT eid="e39" class="STATE">good</EVENT> in coverage as well. While not <EVENT eid="e40" class="OCCURRENCE">blessed</EVENT> with proto-type height, Reddick has plenty big enough, and <EVENT eid="e41" class="STATE">has</EVENT> plus athleticism. 
 
7. CB - Jourdan Lewis , Michigan - At 5<TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="X">'10</TIMEX3> and 188 pounds, Lewis <EVENT eid="e42" class="OCCURRENCE">plays</EVENT> much bigger than that because he's so physical at the line of scrimmage. Lewis didn't <EVENT eid="e43" class="OCCURRENCE">look</EVENT> as comfortable in his turn and release as other defenders like Douglas and King, but he <EVENT eid="e44" class="REPORTING">jammed</EVENT> receivers at the line as well or better than either of the two corners who <EVENT eid="e45" class="OCCURRENCE">had</EVENT> roughly twenty pounds on him. Ideally <EVENT eid="e46" class="OCCURRENCE">suited</EVENT> for a press and release type of scheme or to <EVENT eid="e47" class="OCCURRENCE">drop</EVENT> into the slot to <EVENT eid="e48" class="OCCURRENCE">cover</EVENT> shorter, quicker receivers in tight spaces. Lewis is a disrupter more than a smooth outside cover man. 
 
8. ILB - Ben Gedeon , Michigan - Yes, there was a lot of Wolverine representation on the North Defense. Michigan didn't <EVENT eid="e49" class="OCCURRENCE">finish</EVENT> No. 1 in the nation in total defense for nothing. Gedeon (6'1 5/8" / 247) was a standout against the run in all <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P3D">three days</TIMEX3> of practice. He's strong and physical with good instincts. He <EVENT eid="e50" class="OCCURRENCE">struggled</EVENT> at times on his pass rush drills, but he may be best <EVENT eid="e51" class="OCCURRENCE">suited</EVENT> as a two down inside linebacker who <EVENT eid="e52" class="OCCURRENCE">goes</EVENT> to the sidelines in <EVENT eid="e53" class="OCCURRENCE">passing</EVENT> situations anyway. 
 
9. DT - Jaleel Johnson , Iowa - Considered a <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="PXD">Day</TIMEX3> 2 pick, we're not sure he's <EVENT eid="e54" class="OCCURRENCE">going</EVENT> that high. He didn't <EVENT eid="e55" class="OCCURRENCE">display</EVENT> a lot of great pass-rushing moves, but he <EVENT eid="e56" class="STATE">has</EVENT> a knack for following and <EVENT eid="e57" class="OCCURRENCE">getting</EVENT> to the <EVENT eid="e58" class="OCCURRENCE">action</EVENT>. He would <EVENT eid="e59" class="OCCURRENCE">struggle</EVENT> during one on one drills, and then he'd live in the backfield during the <EVENT eid="e60" class="OCCURRENCE">scrimmages</EVENT>. He <EVENT eid="e61" class="I_STATE">seems</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e62" class="OCCURRENCE">get</EVENT> penetration by <EVENT eid="e63" class="OCCURRENCE">finding</EVENT> the right angle rather than a big array of moves, but there have been plenty of smart players to overcome potential athletic limitations. 
 
10. OLB - Carroll Phillips , Illinois - Phillips <EVENT eid="e64" class="OCCURRENCE">checked</EVENT> in at 6'3 1/4" and 237 pounds and was a standout on the pass rush. With good length and quickness Phillips was <EVENT eid="e65" class="I_ACTION">using</EVENT> quickness to <EVENT eid="e66" class="OCCURRENCE">beat</EVENT> offensive linemen and tight ends for sacks in both drills and scrimmage situations.
