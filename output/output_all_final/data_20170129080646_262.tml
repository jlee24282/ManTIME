<TITLE>Is This 60m Bundesliga Superstar The Perfect Replacement For Alexis Sanchez At Arsenal?</TITLE>


<TEXT>
Arsenal are on the verge of a decent season (yet again) but theyre <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="X">once</TIMEX3> again <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">falling</EVENT> short of their championship goals, mainly due to Antonio Contes team incredible surge. So theyre probably going to <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">focus</EVENT> their efforts in the UEFA Champions League until the end of the season. 
 
Nevertheless, they have other issues that need to be fixed in order to <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">face</EVENT> the next campaign, as theyre in abig danger of <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">losing</EVENT> two of their most important players and they need to be <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">planning</EVENT> ahead if they dont <EVENT eid="e6" class="I_STATE">want</EVENT> the next season to <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE">become</EVENT> a nightmare from start to <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE">finish</EVENT>. 
 
And over the course of <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="PXW">the last few weeks</TIMEX3>, the rumour that states that Marco Reus is the main priority on Arsene Wengers agenda and is just <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE">getting</EVENT> stronger and stronger, and it seems like the Gunners are keen to <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE">make</EVENT> a 60m <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE">bid</EVENT> for the former Borussia Monchengladbach star. 
 
Even if he hasnt been able to <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE">contribute</EVENT> for his team on a regular basis over the course of this season, it seems like the extremely talented, yet extremely injury prone Borussia Dortmund and Germany star Marco Reus is once again on Wengers team radar. 
 
Apparently, the veteran boss <EVENT eid="e13" class="I_STATE">wants</EVENT> Reus to be a potential Alexis Sanchez replacement if (when) the Chilean star decides to <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE">leave</EVENT> the Emirates Stadium, as Sanchez has been strongly <EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE">linked</EVENT> with a <EVENT eid="e16" class="OCCURRENCE">move</EVENT> to the Italian Serie A , where he already <EVENT eid="e17" class="OCCURRENCE">thrived playing</EVENT> with Udinese before <EVENT eid="e18" class="OCCURRENCE">making</EVENT> his great jump to FC Barcelona. 
 

 
Reus is arguably the most versatile offensive player in Germany since his surge at Monchengladbach, with the ability to <EVENT eid="e19" class="OCCURRENCE">play</EVENT> on either flank of the pitch, as an offensive midfielder and even as a pure striker, being a lethal player wherever his boss decides to <EVENT eid="e20" class="OCCURRENCE">use</EVENT> him. 
 
Over the course of <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">the year</TIMEX3>, Marco has only been <EVENT eid="e21" class="I_STATE">able</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e22" class="OCCURRENCE">step</EVENT> on the pitch 5timesand has <EVENT eid="e23" class="OCCURRENCE">scored</EVENT> 1goal to <EVENT eid="e24" class="OCCURRENCE">go</EVENT> along with 3assists, <EVENT eid="e25" class="OCCURRENCE">showing</EVENT> no signs of rust and <EVENT eid="e26" class="OCCURRENCE">demonstrating</EVENT> that value and incredible talent that <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="X">once</TIMEX3> <EVENT eid="e27" class="OCCURRENCE">made</EVENT> him one of the most scouted players in the world. Of course, he has had his injury issues, but whenever he is on the field, he is a threat 
 
During Klopps Dortmund spell, Reus was probably the most important player in a team that also <EVENT eid="e28" class="OCCURRENCE">featured</EVENT> Mario Gotze, Matt Hummels, Robert Lewandowski, Shinji Kagawa and Nuri Sahin, but unfortunately, injuries <EVENT eid="e29" class="OCCURRENCE">stopped</EVENT> him in <EVENT eid="e30" class="OCCURRENCE">becoming</EVENT> one of the top 3 players in the world, even <EVENT eid="e31" class="OCCURRENCE">missing</EVENT> the last World Cup where Germany <EVENT eid="e32" class="OCCURRENCE">took</EVENT> the trophy back home. 
 
Reus could totally be a more than capable replacement for Sanchez, or for every single star in the world, as a matter of fact, considering how extremely <EVENT eid="e33" class="OCCURRENCE">talented</EVENT> the forward is with both feet, his ability to <EVENT eid="e34" class="OCCURRENCE">make</EVENT> plays and his outstanding pace, as well as his breathtaking passing and finishing abilities. 
 
Nevertheless, <EVENT eid="e35" class="OCCURRENCE">considering</EVENT> his long and sad <EVENT eid="e36" class="OCCURRENCE">history</EVENT> with several injuries, Arsenal is on the verge of making one of the riskiest signings in history, so lets hope it all <EVENT eid="e37" class="OCCURRENCE">works</EVENT> out fine for both parties.
