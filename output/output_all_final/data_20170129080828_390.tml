<TITLE>Hobey Baker Watch: Week Twelve</TITLE>


<TEXT>
What <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="X">once</TIMEX3> <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">seemed</EVENT> like a clear-cut Hobey Baker race <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> <EVENT eid="e2" class="STATE">represents</EVENT> one that is anything but <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">decided</EVENT>. A logjam at the top of the scoring race and competitive goaltending play has <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">led</EVENT> to some intrigue as the season <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">heads</EVENT> into the final <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01">weekend of January</TIMEX3> and into the stretch run. Here are the names worth watching in a considerably open Hobey campaign. 
 
For Atlantic Hockey, Brady Ferguson (Robert Morris) is still the name to <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">watch</EVENT> as he <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE">finds</EVENT> himself five points off the national lead, and in a sixth place tie in the NCAA. The goalies to watch remain Parker Gahagen of Army (1.77 GAA, .938 save percentage) and Francis Marotte (1.81, .943) of Robert Morris as both remain among the top seven statistical goalies in the nation. The trio all have a legitimate case to <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE">contend</EVENT> if they can <EVENT eid="e9" class="ASPECTUAL">continue</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE">perform</EVENT> at a high level. 
 
Over in the Big Ten, Denis Smirnov (Penn State) has <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE">ceded</EVENT> the conference lead in points to Tyler Sheehy (Minnesota). With 32 points, he <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE">leads</EVENT> the conference and is in an 11 th place tie in the nation. No goalies stand out as Hobey contenders but Hayden Lavigne (Michigan) does rank in the top 10 in save percentage at .932. The Big Ten has standout teams this season, but no standout players for the Hobey. 
 
On the flip side in the ECAC, many of the top contenders reside. Mike Vecchione and Spencer Foo (Union) are tied for the national point lead at 41. For goaltenders, Kyle Hayton ranks in the top 10 in save percentage at .933. Hayton represents quite the long-shot but Vecchione and Foo have as much of a chance as anyone to <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE">take</EVENT> home the Hobey. 
 
<TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> in Hockey East, both Zach Aston-Reese (Northeastern) and Tyler Kelleher (UNH) are tied with the aforementioned Foo and Vecchione at 41 points, that being the national lead. Dylan Sikura (Northeastern) sits right behind them at 38, fifth nationally, and Anders Bjork (Notre Dame) is right behind him at 35, good for a sixth place tie in the nation. Jake Oettinger of Boston University (1.70, .938) <EVENT eid="e14" class="I_STATE">leads</EVENT> the conference for goaltenders, as he <EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE">ranks</EVENT> just inside the top five in GAA and save percentage. 
 
In the NCHC, Austin Ortega is not quite out of the race with 34 points, <EVENT eid="e16" class="OCCURRENCE">putting</EVENT> him in an eighth place tie nationally. At 31 points, Shane Gersich (North Dakota) ranks 13 th in the nation and second in the conference. Ben Blacker (Western Michigan) is <EVENT eid="e17" class="ASPECTUAL">beginning</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e18" class="OCCURRENCE">impress</EVENT> (1.67, .939) although he still has not <EVENT eid="e19" class="OCCURRENCE">played</EVENT> in as many games as other goalies. Tanner Jaillet of Denver (1.91, .931) also <EVENT eid="e20" class="OCCURRENCE">impresses</EVENT>, but still <EVENT eid="e21" class="OCCURRENCE">finds</EVENT> himself out of the national Hobey race. 
 
And in the WCHA, the only forward over 30 points is Marc Michaelis (Minnesota State), a 14 th  place tie nationally, not exactly lighting college hockey on fire. The goalies are a different story however, as Angus Redmond (Michigan Tech) and Michael Bitzer (Bemidji State) <EVENT eid="e22" class="OCCURRENCE">lead</EVENT> the country in GAA at 1.50 and 1.59 respectively. Impressive numbers that definitely <EVENT eid="e23" class="OCCURRENCE">leave</EVENT> them within the chase for the Hobey, at least for <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3>.
