Upcoming SlideShare      Loading in … 5   1. By CA Tax Consultant (indirect tax) Sanjay Sabran  amp; Comapany Taxation of Composite contract under GST 1. The intention is here to tax works contract(Includingany transfer of property in goods in the execution of contract) related to immovable property as supply of service.Works contractas well as saleof under construction apartment shall <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">besubjected</EVENT> to GST. <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Currently</TIMEX3> servicetax charge on 40% of project value,thus the effective servicetax rate is 6%, similarly effectivevat rate around 1% chargeon project valuein different state. We should <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">waitfor</EVENT> what will <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">betax</EVENT> rate on work contractin new tax regime. 2. Now, question arises in mind what will <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">betreatment</EVENT> of composite <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">contractrelated</EVENT> to movable property, the concept of compositesupply and mix supply has been insertin GST Law <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-11">Nov</TIMEX3>, <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3>. 3. Once it is clear thatwork contractwill be tax in GST as goods or service, the distinction between goods and service is relevantonly for Placeof supply and Pointof Taxation. 4. The <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">transaction</EVENT> of sale/purchaseof immovableproperty shall <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE">beoutsidethe</EVENT> ambit of GST and shall <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE">beliableto</EVENT> stamp duty and property tax under state law.  2. A transaction of works contract,is now, sometimes, <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE">taxed</EVENT> twice; firstly as saleby the State Government and secondly as serviceby the Central Government. Works contracts can <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE">straddletwo</EVENT> taxableactivities asper the current law.There is of coursesupply of goods. Then, due to the very nature of the contract, there is supply of services. As of <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3>, the supply of goods is <EVENT eid="e11" class="I_ACTION">taxablein</EVENT> the form of Value Added Tax (VAT), whilethe services element is taxableas servicetax. In law, there have been differingviews of the Supreme Court and the High Court’s on the applicability of this theory. The final word of the Apex court in BSNL and Others vs. Union of India (SC <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2006">2006</TIMEX3>) was that the aspects doctrinepertains to legislativecompetence and not the application of taxation on the same components of a transaction. At present, State VAT laws havespecific provisionsfor taxingworks contracts.To avoid taxingthe services element, these laws and associated rules providefor either separation of labour and materials or percentage deductions in transaction value.Another method is of prescription of a lower rate of tax in a composition/lump sumscheme for works contracts.The servicetax lawhas also provided for similar treatment to <EVENT eid="e12" class="I_ACTION">avoid</EVENT> taxation of saleof goods as partof a works contract. The overarching concept in a GST is one of supply which <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE">subsumes</EVENT> the concepts of sale of goods, provision of services and manufacture. In GST Model, goods as well as services will be <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE">taxed</EVENT> on a uniform rate. Therefore the dispute whether a transaction is <EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE">subjected</EVENT> to VAT or Service tax <EVENT eid="e16" class="I_ACTION">comes</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e17" class="OCCURRENCE">end</EVENT>. After article 246 of the Constitution,the following article shall be <EVENT eid="e18" class="OCCURRENCE">inserted</EVENT>, namely:—  246A. (1) Notwithstanding anything <EVENT eid="e19" class="STATE">contained</EVENT> in articles 246 and 254, Parliament, and, subject to clause (2), the Legislature of every State, have power to <EVENT eid="e20" class="OCCURRENCE">make</EVENT> laws with respect to goods and services tax <EVENT eid="e21" class="OCCURRENCE">imposed</EVENT> by the Union or by such State. (2) Parliament has exclusive power to <EVENT eid="e22" class="OCCURRENCE">make</EVENT> laws with respect to goods and services tax where the supply of goods,or of services,or both <EVENT eid="e23" class="OCCURRENCE">takes</EVENT> place in the course of inter State trade or commerce. In article 366 of the Constitution,— (i) after clause (12), the following clause shall be inserted, namely:— ‘(12A) “goods and services tax” means any tax on supply of goods,or services or both except taxes on the supply of the alcoholic liquor for human consumption;’; All supply of goods or services or both will attractCGST (to be <EVENT eid="e24" class="OCCURRENCE">levied</EVENT> by Centre) and SGST (to be <EVENT eid="e25" class="OCCURRENCE">levied</EVENT> by State) unless kept out of purview of GST. GST will <EVENT eid="e26" class="OCCURRENCE">beapplicableeven</EVENT> when the transaction involves supply of both (goods and services).In effect, woks contracts will also attractGST. As GST will be applicableon supply ‘the erstwhiletaxableevents such as manufacture‘, sale‘,provision of services etc. will <EVENT eid="e27" class="OCCURRENCE">losetheir</EVENT> relevance. For taxinga transaction in GST, two things are important one is supply and other is goods or serviceor both Transition Provisions under GST Goods and/or service suppiedon or After appointedday  tax has <EVENT eid="e28" class="OCCURRENCE">beenpaidata</EVENT> rate spacefied under GST (Sec 159 ofGST) Goods and/or service suppiedon orafter appointedday,No tax under GSTwherepayment has <EVENT eid="e29" class="OCCURRENCE">beenreceived</EVENT> anddepositebefore appointed <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="PXD">day</TIMEX3>.(Sec 160 ofGST) Goods and/or service suppiedon or before appointedday No taxwherepart <EVENT eid="e30" class="OCCURRENCE">payment</EVENT> is <EVENT eid="e31" class="OCCURRENCE">received</EVENT> afterappointedday ,iftax has been <EVENT eid="e32" class="OCCURRENCE">paid</EVENT> under theearlierlaw.
