Bourget's chapters, for I <EVENT eid="e4" class="I_STATE">know</EVENT> by the newspapers that there are several Americans who are <EVENT eid="e5" class="I_STATE">expecting</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">get</EVENT> a whole education out of them; several who <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE">foresaw</EVENT>, and also foretold, that our long night was over, and a light almost divine about to <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE">break</EVENT> upon the land.
