<EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">Interview</EVENT> by Mohammad Mazhari 
 
TEHRAN, <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Jan. 29</TIMEX3> (MNA)  Trumps election to presidency in the US, his clear stand against global trade, and his persistence on American indigenous potentials have <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">challenged</EVENT> theory of globalization. 
 
Trump has <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">pointed</EVENT> out to America First policy and <EVENT eid="e4" class="I_STATE">tries</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">protect</EVENT> American market from Chinese goods. In the same context, some experts consider Brexit and rise of right-wing parties in Europe as a failure of process of globalization and rise of a sort of deglobalization which <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">highlights</EVENT> national and local values and cultures. 
 
To <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE">address</EVENT> the diverse dimensions of this subject, we <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE">reached</EVENT> George Ritzer, <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE">distinguished</EVENT> University of Maryland professor. Ritzer is well-known for Iranian students for his books on sociological theories. 
 
Among his books in theory are Sociology: A Multiple Paradigm Science (1975/1980) and Metatheorzing in Sociology (<TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="1991">1991</TIMEX3>). In the <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE">application</EVENT> of social theory to the social world, his books include The McDonaldization of Society (7th ed., 2013), Enchanting a Disenchanted World (3rd ed. 2010), and The Globalization of Nothing (2nd ed., 2007). His is also the author of Globalization: A Basic Text (Blackwell, 2010).  He <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE">edited</EVENT> the Wiley-Blackwell Companion to Sociology (<TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2012">2012</TIMEX3>), The Blackwell Companion to Globalization (<TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3>) and co-edited the Wiley-Blackwell Companions to Classical and Contemporary Major Social Theorists (<TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2012">2012</TIMEX3>) and the Sage Handbook of Social Theory (<TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2001">2001</TIMEX3>). 
 
Here is our interview with him: 
 
How do you <EVENT eid="e12" class="PERCEPTION">see</EVENT> the relationship between nationalism and globalization? Would you <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE">consider</EVENT> nationalism as a major obstacle for the process of globalization? 
 
As in all things, it is complicated. For example, there can be a positive relationship between them as, for example, in the global trend toward increased nationalism during WW I and II. There could also be a negative relationship as in the global trend away from nationalism after those <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE">wars</EVENT> and their disastrous effects. At the moment, of course, the trend toward nationalism is <EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE">serving</EVENT> as an obstacle to <EVENT eid="e16" class="OCCURRENCE">globalization</EVENT>. But these things are dialectical and sooner or later the pendulum will <EVENT eid="e17" class="OCCURRENCE">swing</EVENT> back. 
 
Can we <EVENT eid="e18" class="PERCEPTION">see</EVENT> Trumps election to presidency, UK withdrawal from EU and rise of right-wing parties in Europe as a failure for process of globalization? Or its better to <EVENT eid="e19" class="OCCURRENCE">regard</EVENT> them as temporary phenomena? 
 
As <EVENT eid="e20" class="OCCURRENCE">implied</EVENT> in the answer to question 1, it is temporary (of course, temporary could <EVENT eid="e21" class="OCCURRENCE">last</EVENT> <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="PXY">years</TIMEX3> or even <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="P1E">decades</TIMEX3>). I <EVENT eid="e22" class="I_ACTION">dont think</EVENT> its a failure of globalization, but rather another moment in its ebb and flow. 
 
What is the role of religion in the globalization process, given that religions such as Christianity and Islam <EVENT eid="e23" class="OCCURRENCE">claim</EVENT> universal values; can we <EVENT eid="e24" class="OCCURRENCE">suppose</EVENT> the religion as rival for globalization? 
 
No, religion is one of the most important globalizing forces both historically and contemporaneously. Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Judaism, and others have <EVENT eid="e25" class="OCCURRENCE">globalized</EVENT> and have <EVENT eid="e26" class="STATE">had</EVENT> a wide-scale impact on the world. I <EVENT eid="e27" class="I_STATE">think</EVENT> you are <EVENT eid="e28" class="OCCURRENCE">assuming</EVENT>, as most people do, that globalization <EVENT eid="e29" class="OCCURRENCE">equals</EVENT> economic globalization, but from my point of view it is one of a number of aspects of globalization (this communication between us is another minor example) 
 
Some countries and cultures <EVENT eid="e30" class="I_STATE">resist</EVENT> against globalization, justifying their resistance by the premise that it would <EVENT eid="e31" class="OCCURRENCE">devastate</EVENT> cultural diversity in our world; instead, they <EVENT eid="e32" class="OCCURRENCE">put</EVENT> emphasis on local values and cultures. Would you think that the localization is a barrier to <EVENT eid="e33" class="OCCURRENCE">globalization</EVENT>? Or it can <EVENT eid="e34" class="OCCURRENCE">enrich</EVENT> our world and globalization process? 
 
Both! Localization is a barrier to many forms of globalization and in that sense can be a barrier to the enrichments associated with globalization. On the other hand, the local is a source of great diversity and much of that can be, and has been, <EVENT eid="e35" class="OCCURRENCE">globalized</EVENT>. Of course, the exclusionary power of the local can <EVENT eid="e36" class="OCCURRENCE">limit</EVENT> or <EVENT eid="e37" class="OCCURRENCE">eliminate</EVENT> the spread of that diversity. 
 
Does globalization equal westernization or Americanization? Or you <EVENT eid="e38" class="OCCURRENCE">recognize</EVENT> a model of multipolar world which includes China, Europe and Islamic-Arabic countries? 
 
No, but they have been the most powerful globalizing forces in <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="X">the last two centuries</TIMEX3>. With their decline we will have an increasingly multipolar world. China will be an increasingly important globalizing force, especially economically, in <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="PXY">the years</TIMEX3> to <EVENT eid="e39" class="OCCURRENCE">come</EVENT>. Europe is part of the west, but its independent influence on globalization is <EVENT eid="e40" class="OCCURRENCE">declining</EVENT> with the problems in the EU. At the moment, at least under Trump, the U.S. is <EVENT eid="e41" class="OCCURRENCE">opting</EVENT> for a smaller role globally. Islam has had a powerful effect historically and to <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">this day</TIMEX3>. Unfortunately, its positive influence today has been <EVENT eid="e42" class="OCCURRENCE">obscured</EVENT> by the tendency, at least in much of the West, to <EVENT eid="e43" class="I_ACTION">associate</EVENT> it, or at least its more radical elements, with terrorism. 
 
You can also <EVENT eid="e44" class="OCCURRENCE">read</EVENT> the <EVENT eid="e45" class="OCCURRENCE">interview</EVENT> in ARABIC.
