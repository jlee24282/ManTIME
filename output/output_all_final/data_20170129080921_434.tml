One of Cornwall's most magical and secret gardens is about to <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">reopen</EVENT>. Here is a peek into this hidden location.

Antony Woodland Garden near Torpoint reopens to the public on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-03-01">March 1</TIMEX3>. A haven of peace and tranquility, it is one of the least-known gems among the many public and private gardens the county has to <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">offer</EVENT>. <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017">This year</TIMEX3> the Carew Pole Garden Trust, which runs the gardens, is <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">hoping</EVENT> more people than ever before will <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">visit</EVENT> the unique location, an International Camellia Gardens of Excellence.

Watch and <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">discover</EVENT> stunning Antony Woodland Garden:

Sir Richard Carew Pole, former president of the Royal Horticultural Society, <EVENT eid="e6" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT>: "This is not the lost garden of Cornwall, but the undiscovered one. Sitting on the banks of the Lynher the garden has something for both serious gardeners and those after a relaxing walk in beautiful surroundings." The gardens <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE">run</EVENT> along the Lynher Estuary, an area of outstanding natural beauty, and are also renowned for their stunning magnolias, rhododendrons, wildflowers and sculptures - <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE">loved</EVENT> by professional and amateur gardeners alike. 

The variety of flora and fauna has been <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE">planted</EVENT> by successive generations of the Carew Pole family, who have lived at grade one-listed Antony House since <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="17XX">the early 18th century</TIMEX3>. The 100-acre garden is home to more than 600 varieties of camellias, including the National Collection of Camellia japonica, and nearly 250 types of magnolias. All of these <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE">come</EVENT> alive when they bloom in the <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-SP">spring</TIMEX3>, with walks covered in wild flowers including celandines, primroses, bluebells and campion. 

The gardens are divided into two areas  the Woodland Garden and the Woodland Walk, situated where the River Lynher <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE">flows</EVENT> into the Tamar, with views across to Brunel's Royal Albert Rail Bridge. They boast beautiful <EVENT eid="e12" class="I_STATE">walks</EVENT>, stunning scenery and the chance to <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE">see</EVENT> wild birds, including oystercatchers, grey herons, egrets, cormorants and shelducks along the estuary. Antony Woodland Garden will be <EVENT eid="e14" class="STATE">open</EVENT> from 11am until 5pm <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="SET" value="P1D">every day</TIMEX3> except Mondays and Fridays, although they will be open over bank holidays and <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Good Friday</TIMEX3>.
