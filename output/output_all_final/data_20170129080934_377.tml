<TITLE>A joyful chorus</TITLE>


<TEXT>
By James Braxton Peterson 

Given this nation's history and our native language's predilection for black connotations, the phrase black joy is a fairly good example of what an oxymoron looks like. 

In the first version of his autobiographical narrative, An American Slave , Frederick Douglass <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">chastised</EVENT> Northerners for mishearing and <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">misunderstanding</EVENT> the sorrowful singing of enslaved Africans. Too many Northerners, abolitionists, and others, who were <EVENT eid="e3" class="I_STATE">supposed</EVENT> to be sympathetic to the <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">plight</EVENT> of enslaved black folks, <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">mitigated</EVENT> their white guilt by selectively hearing happiness in the harrowing sounds of what W.E.B. DuBois <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">called</EVENT> the "sorrow songs." Douglass <EVENT eid="e7" class="I_ACTION">exposed</EVENT> the lie in his brilliant way, arguing - to paraphrase - that slaves <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE">sing</EVENT> most when they are most sad. 

Almost ironically <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3>, some of the brightest, most visceral moments of black joy are <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE">embedded</EVENT> in the black church - not in the pulpit, but in the voices of so many black choirs. The black joy of a spiritually <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE">uplifting</EVENT> "sorrow song" <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE">moves</EVENT> us to tears, sends chills through our bodies, and for some, <EVENT eid="e12" class="I_STATE">entices</EVENT> them to <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE">move</EVENT>, dance, and <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE">shout</EVENT> with abandon. This is black joy: a physical-spiritual connection made through our own artistic cultural production <EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE">formed</EVENT> historically in the belly of our own program of resistance. We are still here. And we <EVENT eid="e16" class="OCCURRENCE">sing</EVENT> and we <EVENT eid="e17" class="I_STATE">shout</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e18" class="OCCURRENCE">remind</EVENT> you as much as to <EVENT eid="e19" class="ASPECTUAL">celebrate</EVENT> the unlikely fact of our very existence. 

In some religious contexts, joy is that blessed form of happiness and solace that can only be <EVENT eid="e20" class="OCCURRENCE">derived</EVENT> from a reservoir of spirituality and an abiding faith in an almighty and all-knowing God. Black joy <EVENT eid="e21" class="OCCURRENCE">acknowledges</EVENT> this awesome belief in things unseen, but it is also <EVENT eid="e22" class="STATE">predicated</EVENT> on the facts of our enduring fortitude in the face of transatlantic slavery and the long history of brutal white supremacy, and the cruel crimes of antiblack racial violence. Our collective black head is "<EVENT eid="e23" class="OCCURRENCE">bloodied</EVENT>, but unbowed." 

Maybe punching a Nazi is not necessarily a joyous occasion. But when black Twitter <EVENT eid="e24" class="I_ACTION">remixed</EVENT> the video syncing/replaying the punch to the beat of Biggie Smalls' "Hypnotize," the result was, well, the result was hypnotic - and some modicum of black joy was <EVENT eid="e25" class="OCCURRENCE">had</EVENT> by all who <EVENT eid="e26" class="OCCURRENCE">played</EVENT> and <EVENT eid="e27" class="OCCURRENCE">posted</EVENT> it. 

The sounds of black joy will always be what's most remarkable about this counterintuitive concept - the laughter of a child, the sobs of joy for the first black president; the clanking and banging rhythms of a black chef preparing a meal in a cluttered kitchen. Black joy must be as mundane as it is aspirational in order for it to be at all. 

Ultimately the counterintuitive, oxymoronic nature of black joy might very well be the key to <EVENT eid="e28" class="OCCURRENCE">understanding</EVENT> its most potent meaning. Joy in the face of the long history of pain is, for some, what is most remarkable about the black experience on these stolen lands. We don't <EVENT eid="e29" class="OCCURRENCE">attain</EVENT> or <EVENT eid="e30" class="OCCURRENCE">achieve</EVENT> black joy. We <EVENT eid="e31" class="STATE">eke</EVENT> it out of this American project. We <EVENT eid="e32" class="I_STATE">squeeze</EVENT> every bit of joy out of what at times and throughout history has been the silencing force of our spiritual voices. We <EVENT eid="e33" class="REPORTING">sing</EVENT> (sometimes) because we are happy.
