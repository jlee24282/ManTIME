<TITLE>Over one hundred wildfires in the Balearics in 2016</TITLE>


<TEXT>
There were a number of fires in Ibiza but all on a very low scale.  06-03-2016 Toni Escobar  
The amount of land <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">affected</EVENT> by forest, scrub and other fires <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3> was more than double the amount in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3>. There were 113 fires in the Balearics which affected 230 hectares, 37.5% of which were forest. A third was scrub, and the remainder was pasture and reed. 

The environment ministry <EVENT eid="e2" class="REPORTING">suggests</EVENT> that given the drought, the figures aren't too <EVENT eid="e3" class="STATE">bad</EVENT>, but <EVENT eid="e4" class="I_ACTION">concedes</EVENT> that they aren't among the lowest. Nevertheless, the amount of damage was a third of the average for <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P10Y">the past ten years</TIMEX3>. 

Most of the fires (43%) were because of negligence or accidents. There were seventy fires in Majorca that <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">affected</EVENT> 190 hectares, while Minorca had three fires that <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">covered</EVENT> 37 hectares. In Ibiza there were 33 fires but these <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE">caused</EVENT> damage to only 1.2 hectares, a record low. 

The largest fire in Majorca was in August at Ses Comunes in Petra (45 hectares). The next two largest were Albufera in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-02">February</TIMEX3> (36 hectares) and Sa Canova in Arta in the <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-SU">summer</TIMEX3> (23.4). All three were intentional.
