Title: "The Custer Conspiracy" 
   
Author: Dennis Koller 
   
Publisher: Pen Books, 340 pages 
   
"The Custer Conspiracy" is the third offering by San Francisco author Dennis Koller in the Tom McGuire suspense series. It follows "Kissed by The Snow" and "The Oath. Most of the characters <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">created</EVENT> in the book are action personalities with a big liking for law enforcement and weapons. 
   
Along these lines, if you like suspenseful, fast-moving detective stories, this would be an entertaining choice. 
   
Starting with international intrigue, the book quickly <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">moves</EVENT> to the connection with Lt. Col. George Custer through a modern-day ill-fated <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">meeting</EVENT> between the main character, Tom McGuire, and an close friend at the Little Bighorn Battlefield Monument near Hardin, Mont. With the <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">death</EVENT> of McGuires friend Matt Conroy, the stage is <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">set</EVENT> for the remainder of the book and amounts to a whodunit. 
   
With an almost cavalier style, the author blends mystery, murder, guns and beautiful women that would heavily <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">appeal</EVENT> to the military/law enforcement background reader. Together with the continual almost prayerful stories about outlandish sniper shooting plus an almost godlike praise for those capable of 1,000-plus-yard headshots, the book also appeals to the military sniper-worshiping crowd. 
   
The main character comes across as a undiscovered super-asset who <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE">moves</EVENT> seamlessly from San Francisco detective through FBI and CIA contacts and crisscrosses the country on his journey to <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE">solve</EVENT> the mysterious <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE">killing</EVENT> of an old friend, and the motive of the international arms cartel behind that cowardly act. 
   
While the book is a fun ride, there is one irritating factor in the organizational details: The book's 340 pages are <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE">split</EVENT> into 89 chapters, some just two or three pages long. What nonsense. 
   
Also, without <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE">revealing</EVENT> the details of the plot, there are many who will be <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE">insulted</EVENT> by the disparaging reference and fictional treatment of Custer in this book. The author <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE">takes</EVENT> great liberty in <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE">plucking</EVENT> an American hero from history and <EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE">assigning</EVENT> him a less-than-honorable characterization. 
   
As the book <EVENT eid="e16" class="OCCURRENCE">moves</EVENT> quickly to what <EVENT eid="e17" class="STATE">seems</EVENT> a foregone conclusion, it is nevertheless quite entertaining and very easy reading. Notwithstanding the strange chapter divisions, I would <EVENT eid="e18" class="OCCURRENCE">recommend</EVENT> this intriguing tale. Good reading.
