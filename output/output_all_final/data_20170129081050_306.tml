International Journal of Development in Engineering, Technology and Science (IJDETS) Volume: 01, Issue: 01, <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01">January  2017</TIMEX3> www.ijdets.com Page 35 M.Harish, C.K.Vinod 1, 2 PG Scholar, Department of Mechanical Engineering, CBIT, Hyderabad, Telangona, India Abstract  The <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="X">present</TIMEX3> technique in automotive industry is to <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">change</EVENT> their Sedan cars into Hatch back or vice versa, instead of <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">manufacturing</EVENT> an entire new car, thereby <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">decreasing</EVENT> the manufacture and cost of the production. The major goal of this <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">operation</EVENT> is to do external navigation visual of Sedan and Hatch Back car models <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">containing</EVENT> similar front view by <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">applying</EVENT> computational technique on 1:40 reduced scaled car model and dimensions are 0.4m (wide, high) and 1.6m length respectively. The Sedan car is <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE">measured</EVENT> down model of the existing car, while the Hatch Back car model is newly manufactured such that both the car models have similar front view. The 3D computational technique was <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE">maintained</EVENT> by <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE">using</EVENT> CATIA V6 as the modelling technique, ICEM CFD as the pre processor (<EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE">meshing</EVENT> process), and ANSYS FLUENT as the calculator and ANSYS CFD  POST as the post processor. Computational outcomes support that Sedan car is more streamlined and nagivagated efficiently as compared to that of newly manufactured Hatch Back car model. Though both car models have similar front view, Hatch back car model has nearly 3.6 percentage more Drag Co Efficient as compared to that of Sedan car model. This can be <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE">defined</EVENT> as Hatch Back car which considers Sedan car by <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE">putting</EVENT> front area same can develop the Drag Co Efficient of 3.6 percentage.. Key Words: Sedan version, Hatch Back version, drag co  efficient, CFD I.INTRODUCTION External navigation design of car models has <EVENT eid="e13" class="REPORTING">suggested</EVENT> automotive industry in <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE">decreasing</EVENT> the drag force operation on the cars over <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="PXY">the years</TIMEX3>. Even though drag force operating on the car bases on various variables such as drag co efficient, <EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE">projected</EVENT> front view, velocity at which the car is <EVENT eid="e16" class="OCCURRENCE">running</EVENT> and the environmental condition in which the car operates [density variable], it’s only the drag co efficient times the front view of the car that can be <EVENT eid="e17" class="OCCURRENCE">cared</EVENT> [1]. So, manufacturing of the cars <EVENT eid="e18" class="OCCURRENCE">help</EVENT> in <EVENT eid="e19" class="I_STATE">declining</EVENT> the drag co efficient of the cars, thereby <EVENT eid="e20" class="OCCURRENCE">decline</EVENT> the drag force. In modern <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="PXD">days</TIMEX3> , automotive industries have <EVENT eid="e21" class="OCCURRENCE">implemented</EVENT> a new configure of <EVENT eid="e22" class="OCCURRENCE">changing</EVENT> their most successful sedan car version into hatch back version and vice versa, where both the cars have similar front view. This donates a sense of relaxation for external navigation design engineers, where they keep at most pressure in <EVENT eid="e23" class="OCCURRENCE">developing</EVENT> fuel efficient and economical cars. The automotive companies can <EVENT eid="e24" class="OCCURRENCE">invest</EVENT> their money in <EVENT eid="e25" class="I_ACTION">manufacturing</EVENT> the rear part of the car instead of <EVENT eid="e26" class="OCCURRENCE">manufacturing</EVENT> an entire new car where the cost would be more and also the external navigation design engineers will not <EVENT eid="e27" class="OCCURRENCE">concentrate</EVENT> on the aesthetics of whole car, as it is sufficient to concentrate only at the rear part, thereby <EVENT eid="e28" class="OCCURRENCE">declining</EVENT> manufacture time and price. Also need of CFD equipment and high end <EVENT eid="e29" class="I_ACTION">featured</EVENT> computers has <EVENT eid="e30" class="I_ACTION">suggested</EVENT> automotive industries in <EVENT eid="e31" class="OCCURRENCE">declining</EVENT> the investment price on cars and also to <EVENT eid="e32" class="OCCURRENCE">convert</EVENT> maximum usage of modelling and design equipment to <EVENT eid="e33" class="OCCURRENCE">get</EVENT> essential corrections in the geometry of the cars, thereby <EVENT eid="e34" class="OCCURRENCE">getting</EVENT> actual cars will be secure and infection free before the actual <EVENT eid="e35" class="OCCURRENCE">production</EVENT>. Bhagirathi zala et al (<TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2013">2013</TIMEX3>) [2] in their research compared 1:21 <EVENT eid="e36" class="OCCURRENCE">decreased</EVENT> measure Sedan and Hatch Back car versions by practical analysis. The research <EVENT eid="e37" class="REPORTING">presented</EVENT> that Sedan car version was more <EVENT eid="e38" class="OCCURRENCE">navigation</EVENT> as compared to Square Back car version and <EVENT eid="e39" class="STATE">had</EVENT> a drag coefficient value 43% lesser than the Hatch Back car version. The computational task maintained by <EVENT eid="e40" class="OCCURRENCE">having</EVENT> Bijlani et al [<TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2013">2013</TIMEX3>] [3] also <EVENT eid="e41" class="OCCURRENCE">supports</EVENT> that Sedan car version is more navigation than Hatch back car version by 43%. It is stated from the literature studies that most of the road vehicle external navigation study work has been <EVENT eid="e42" class="OCCURRENCE">concentrated</EVENT> either on Sedan cars or bluff equipment such as bus and only a few works has been <EVENT eid="e43" class="OCCURRENCE">noticed</EVENT> on the external navigation studies of Hatch Back cars. Though there are some works <EVENT eid="e44" class="OCCURRENCE">worked</EVENT> on the external navigation comparison of Sedan and Hatch Back cars [3, 5], there is no work noticed on the direct comparison of Sedan and Hatch Back cars containing similar front view by computational technique. Since each car designing company has its own design language and it’s not a good idea to compare two different points of cars i.e., Sedan and Hatch Back cars of various make (company) to <EVENT eid="e45" class="OCCURRENCE">come</EVENT> into a conclusion that which among them is better, unless any of the geometric variable is <EVENT eid="e46" class="OCCURRENCE">put</EVENT> study state (in the <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> work front view is <EVENT eid="e47" class="OCCURRENCE">put</EVENT> constant). II. COMPUTATIONAL TECHNIQUE Computational technique was <EVENT eid="e48" class="OCCURRENCE">managed</EVENT> for both 1:40 <EVENT eid="e49" class="OCCURRENCE">measured</EVENT> down Sedan and Hatch Back car versions containing similar front view. Sedan car version was <EVENT eid="e50" class="I_STATE">made</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e51" class="PERCEPTION">see</EVENT> geometrically same to commercially existing Sedan Car, while Hatch Back car version was newly <EVENT eid="e52" class="OCCURRENCE">analysed</EVENT> by <EVENT eid="e53" class="OCCURRENCE">correcting</EVENT> the 2 D background of the similar Sedan car version. Both the car versions were <EVENT eid="e54" class="OCCURRENCE">versioned</EVENT> such that they contain similar front view but different only at the rear state i.e., one is versioned as Sedan car version and other as the Hatch Back car version. Geometrical version was <EVENT eid="e55" class="OCCURRENCE">generated using</EVENT> CATIA V5 modelling software, while the  2. International Journal of Development in Engineering, Technology and Science (IJDETS) Volume: 01, Issue: 01, <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-01">January  2017</TIMEX3> www.ijdets.com Page 36 meshing process of computational range was <EVENT eid="e56" class="OCCURRENCE">managed</EVENT> in ICEM CFD software using blocking phenomenon. ANSYS Fluent was <EVENT eid="e57" class="I_ACTION">applied</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e58" class="I_ACTION">calculate</EVENT> the flow problems and CFD POST was <EVENT eid="e59" class="OCCURRENCE">applied</EVENT> as post processing software. A. Geometrical Technique Geometric techniques were <EVENT eid="e60" class="OCCURRENCE">modelled using</EVENT> CATIA V5 R22 modelling software. For available research only2 D background available car was appliance to <EVENT eid="e61" class="OCCURRENCE">generate</EVENT> the 3 D geometrical technique. Side <EVENT eid="e62" class="OCCURRENCE">mirrors</EVENT> and other joints were not taken to <EVENT eid="e63" class="OCCURRENCE">make</EVENT> the simulation case easy. For existing work, there are four different types of car versions were <EVENT eid="e64" class="OCCURRENCE">modelled</EVENT>. First is the Hatch Back car version and the Sedan car version was <EVENT eid="e65" class="OCCURRENCE">divided</EVENT> into 3 types of same measure i.e., Sedan with tyres, Sedan without tyres fixed to body, Sedan with gap between body and tyres, because it was need to <EVENT eid="e66" class="I_STATE">know</EVENT> what percentage of drag force <EVENT eid="e67" class="OCCURRENCE">raises</EVENT> due to the account of tyres and gap between tyres and body. So, if the drag force gap is less, then the car models without tyres can be <EVENT eid="e68" class="OCCURRENCE">applied</EVENT> in <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="FUTURE_REF">the future</TIMEX3> computation methods in order to <EVENT eid="e69" class="OCCURRENCE">decline</EVENT> unnecessary meshing process and computational time, on the other case if the gap is large than either the car model tyres <EVENT eid="e70" class="OCCURRENCE">fixed</EVENT> or the car model with gap between body and tyres can be <EVENT eid="e71" class="OCCURRENCE">selected based</EVENT> up on the accuracy and computational resources <EVENT eid="e72" class="OCCURRENCE">required</EVENT>. The Sedan car model has the measurements 0.066m wide, 0.050m high and 0.176m long, while Hatch Back car version has the measurements 0.066m wide, 0.050m high and 0.155m long. Fig. 1: Sedan Car Version without Tyres Fig. 2: Sedan Car Model With Tyres Fixed Fig. 3: Sedan Car Version with Variation between Body and Tyres Fig. 4: Hatch Back Car Version B. Meshing Process Meshing process of the computation range was <EVENT eid="e73" class="OCCURRENCE">exercised</EVENT> entirely by <EVENT eid="e74" class="I_ACTION">applying blocking</EVENT> in ICE phenomenon CFD meshing phenomenon. Since, only 2d background of the Sedan and Hatch Back car versions were <EVENT eid="e75" class="OCCURRENCE">selected</EVENT> for research in the existing work, 2d planer mesh was <EVENT eid="e76" class="OCCURRENCE">produced</EVENT> initially in the XY plane <EVENT eid="e77" class="I_ACTION">catching</EVENT> the 2d background of the car versions which was later on <EVENT eid="e78" class="OCCURRENCE">changed</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e79" class="OCCURRENCE">3d</EVENT> mesh just by <EVENT eid="e80" class="I_ACTION">considering</EVENT> the mesh <EVENT eid="e81" class="OCCURRENCE">blocks</EVENT> in the Z direction. 1. Frame work Frame work was <EVENT eid="e82" class="OCCURRENCE">managed</EVENT> for 1:40 measured Sedan car version without tyres in a 0.4m wide, 0.4m high and 1.6m long wind tunnel range. Initially course mesh was <EVENT eid="e83" class="OCCURRENCE">produced</EVENT> for the car version with nearly 2.6million nodes, later on the mesh was <EVENT eid="e84" class="OCCURRENCE">corrected</EVENT> by <EVENT eid="e85" class="OCCURRENCE">raising</EVENT> the node count to 1.6 times <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">the past</TIMEX3> mesh. The similar problem was <EVENT eid="e86" class="OCCURRENCE">made</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e87" class="OCCURRENCE">work</EVENT> i.e. at the similar velocity but with distinct mesh size. In the final mesh, node count was restricted to 15.9 million as there were no great <EVENT eid="e88" class="OCCURRENCE">changes</EVENT> in drag co efficient outcomes. Table 1: Difference of Drag Co Efficient With Number of Nodes  3. International Journal of Development in Engineering, Technology and Science (IJDETS) Volume: 01, Issue: 01, <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2017-01">January  2017</TIMEX3> www.ijdets.com Page 37 Frame work study for the existing work was <EVENT eid="e89" class="OCCURRENCE">managed</EVENT> at 21m/s and a total of six different grid resolutions were <EVENT eid="e90" class="OCCURRENCE">applied</EVENT>. Case A has the coarsest resolution and case G has the existing grid resolution. Grid refinement was <EVENT eid="e91" class="OCCURRENCE">worked</EVENT> only at some finite identification around the car version where steep pressure gradients were <EVENT eid="e92" class="OCCURRENCE">predicted</EVENT>. Table 1 <EVENT eid="e93" class="OCCURRENCE">shows</EVENT> the difference of drag co efficient with raise in the node count. It can be clearly <EVENT eid="e94" class="OCCURRENCE">showed</EVENT> that there are no reasonable changes in drag co efficient after 9.7 million node count. Hence there was no specific point in selecting existing grid at the price of huge computational systems for slight raise in accuracy. So, the mesh with 9.7 million node count was <EVENT eid="e95" class="OCCURRENCE">discussed</EVENT> for the <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="X">present</TIMEX3> computational <EVENT eid="e96" class="OCCURRENCE">technique</EVENT>. All the meshes produced were concentrated such that the low angle of the grid would <EVENT eid="e97" class="OCCURRENCE">lie</EVENT> above 22 degree and the determinant would <EVENT eid="e98" class="OCCURRENCE">lie</EVENT> above 0.6. The measurements of the computational range was <EVENT eid="e99" class="OCCURRENCE">depended</EVENT> on the real wind tunnel test part measurements (0.4m wide, 0.4m high and 1.6m long) and the car versions were <EVENT eid="e100" class="OCCURRENCE">kept</EVENT> in the computational wind tunnel range certainly similar to that was <EVENT eid="e101" class="OCCURRENCE">mounted</EVENT> in the wind tunnel test section with blockage ratio of 4% [5], as it was need to <EVENT eid="e102" class="OCCURRENCE">simulate</EVENT> actual wind tunnel situations (a) (b) Fig. 5: Sedan Without Tyres: (a) Mesh Range; (b) External Mesh (a) (b) Fig. 6: Sedan with Tyres Fixed: (a) Mesh Range; (b) External Mesh (a) (b) Fig. 7: Sedan with Variation between Body and Tyres: (a) Mesh Range; (b) External Mesh  4.

Calculation Computational car external navigation problem was <EVENT eid="e103" class="OCCURRENCE">calculated</EVENT> by applying ANSYS FLUENT as the calculator for both Sedan and Hatch Back car versions at 4 different velocities (15m/s, 20m/s, 25m/s, 30m/s). Table 2: Calculator Arrangement Fig. 9: Correlation of Plot for Sedan Car Version Firstly problem was <EVENT eid="e104" class="OCCURRENCE">taken</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e105" class="OCCURRENCE">operate</EVENT> for <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="X">7000</TIMEX3> repetitions at specific velocity. Since there were no great <EVENT eid="e106" class="OCCURRENCE">alterations</EVENT> in the dust values above <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2000">2000</TIMEX3> repetitions, all the other flow difficulties were <EVENT eid="e107" class="OCCURRENCE">made</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e108" class="OCCURRENCE">operate</EVENT> for <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2000">2000</TIMEX3> repetitions, thereby <EVENT eid="e109" class="OCCURRENCE">declining</EVENT> computational time. Fig. 9 represents the Correlation plot for Sedan car version at 25 m/s. Correlation absolute approach for measured dust was <EVENT eid="e110" class="OCCURRENCE">fixed</EVENT> to 10 6. As the measured dust for all the variables are less than 10 6 it can be <EVENT eid="e111" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT> that solution is <EVENT eid="e112" class="OCCURRENCE">correlated</EVENT>. D. Post Processing All the post processing work was <EVENT eid="e113" class="OCCURRENCE">made</EVENT> by <EVENT eid="e114" class="OCCURRENCE">using</EVENT> CFD POST software pattern. Different contour plots such as velocity contours, pressure contour etc were <EVENT eid="e115" class="OCCURRENCE">pointed</EVENT> at different velocities for both Sedan and Hatch Back car version. All the computational technique was <EVENT eid="e116" class="OCCURRENCE">managed</EVENT> in Hp Z800 workstation <EVENT eid="e117" class="OCCURRENCE">containing</EVENT> the following point, Processors: 18x Intel Xeon 5570 2.9GHz, Memory: 32GB DDR2 RAM, Chipset: Intel 5570, Graphics: ATI FirePro 5700 Graphics. III. RESULTS AND REVIEWS (b) Fig. 10: Pressure Distributions: (a) Sedan car (b) Hatch Back car Simulative external navigation technique was <EVENT eid="e118" class="OCCURRENCE">focussed</EVENT> on Sedan and Hatch Back car versions having same front view in a <EVENT eid="e119" class="OCCURRENCE">trial</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e120" class="OCCURRENCE">know</EVENT> their external navigation attitude at distinct velocities. It is (a) Table 3: Corner Conditions  5. International Journal of Development in Engineering, Technology and Science (IJDETS) Volume: 01, Issue: 01, <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2017-01">January  2017</TIMEX3> www.ijdets.com Page 39 <EVENT eid="e121" class="OCCURRENCE">proved</EVENT> from the Fig. 10 (a) and Fig. 10 (b) that extreme pressure (stagnation plot) acts at the front bumper and this pressure <EVENT eid="e122" class="OCCURRENCE">raises</EVENT> with raise in velocity for both the cars versions. At the meeting point of hood and front windshield the car models practices positive pressure due to the interference <EVENT eid="e123" class="OCCURRENCE">harmed</EVENT> by the front windshield. The car models, while rest of the areas of car versions <EVENT eid="e124" class="OCCURRENCE">feels</EVENT> negative pressure. Also it can be <EVENT eid="e125" class="OCCURRENCE">presented</EVENT> that pressure <EVENT eid="e126" class="OCCURRENCE">working</EVENT> over the car models is less where the car structure is streamlined and is more at another areas. Due to <EVENT eid="e127" class="OCCURRENCE">obstruct change</EVENT> in body and generation of adverse pressure parameter, flow division <EVENT eid="e128" class="OCCURRENCE">takes</EVENT> place at the mid part of rear wind shield. Due to this flow division, production of eddies and vortices <EVENT eid="e129" class="OCCURRENCE">takes</EVENT> place at the rear wind shield of both Sedan and Hatch Back car versions which can be clearly preented in the Fig. 11 (b) and Fig .12 (b). Slight flow re fix <EVENT eid="e130" class="OCCURRENCE">takes</EVENT> place at the boot region in case of sedan car model. (b) Fig. 11: Sedan Car version: (a) Pressure Contour; (b) streamlines It is <EVENT eid="e131" class="OCCURRENCE">identified</EVENT> that Pressure co efficient plot trend remains constant at all the velocities for both the car models as <EVENT eid="e132" class="OCCURRENCE">shown</EVENT> in the Fig. 13 (a) and (b). So, it can be <EVENT eid="e133" class="I_ACTION">finalised</EVENT> that pressure co  efficient <EVENT eid="e134" class="OCCURRENCE">variation</EVENT> along the middle line of the car models is unique of velocity [9]. Also it can be <EVENT eid="e135" class="OCCURRENCE">identified</EVENT> that variation of pressure co efficient along the middle line of the car model <EVENT eid="e136" class="OCCURRENCE">follows</EVENT> same trend as that of the pressure, with pressure co  efficient being maximum at the front bumper with a value near to 1.0 and minimum on the roof. Almost unique value of CP is <EVENT eid="e137" class="OCCURRENCE">attained</EVENT> at every port on the car model for different velocity domains. (a) (b) Fig. 12: Hatch Back Car Version: (a) Pressure Contour; (b) Streamlines It is <EVENT eid="e138" class="OCCURRENCE">proved</EVENT> from the fig. 14 that <EVENT eid="e139" class="OCCURRENCE">drag</EVENT> force <EVENT eid="e140" class="OCCURRENCE">raises</EVENT> with raise in velocity over the whole velocity valuates for both the car models, while drag co efficient declines slightly with raise in Reynolds number. It is <EVENT eid="e141" class="OCCURRENCE">identified</EVENT> that Hatch Back car model has around 3.6 % more drag force and drag co efficient than the Sedan car model though both the car models have similar front view. Hatch Back car model feels more drag force as compared to Sedan car model due to actual fact that air flow over the Hatch Back car model <EVENT eid="e142" class="OCCURRENCE">separates</EVENT> much earlier and the negative pressure area <EVENT eid="e143" class="OCCURRENCE">left</EVENT> behind the Hatch Back car model due to <EVENT eid="e144" class="OCCURRENCE">flow</EVENT> division is more as compared to that of Sedan car model. It is interested to <EVENT eid="e145" class="OCCURRENCE">notice</EVENT> that drag co efficient declines with raise in velocity because of delay in flow division as the speed <EVENT eid="e146" class="OCCURRENCE">raises</EVENT> in both the car versions.

International Journal of Development in Engineering, Technology and Science (IJDETS) Volume: 01, Issue: 01, <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2017-01">January  2017</TIMEX3> www.ijdets.com Page 40 (a) (b) Fig. 13: Division of CP: (a) Sedan (b) Hatch Back From the above computational comparison technique it is fine that body change only at the rear end can generate a drag co  efficient division up to 3.6%. This can be <EVENT eid="e147" class="OCCURRENCE">finalised</EVENT> in the other case, correlation of Hatch Back car into a Sedan car can <EVENT eid="e148" class="OCCURRENCE">develop</EVENT> the drag co efficient by 3.6%.Though the drag development is quite small in magnitudes, but this small development can <EVENT eid="e149" class="OCCURRENCE">make</EVENT> huge influence on external navigation efficiency of cars. In general this development in drag co efficient of the Sedan car <EVENT eid="e150" class="OCCURRENCE">suggests</EVENT> in <EVENT eid="e151" class="I_ACTION">getting</EVENT> the mileage almost equal to that of Hatch Back car though weight of Sedan car is more as compared to Hatch Back cars. Fig. 14: Variation of Fd with Velocity Fig. 15: Division of CD with Velocity As it was important to <EVENT eid="e152" class="ASPECTUAL">understand</EVENT> the <EVENT eid="e153" class="OCCURRENCE">change</EVENT> in force and drag co efficient <EVENT eid="e154" class="OCCURRENCE">attained</EVENT> with and without the respect of tyres and variation between body and tyres, computational technique was <EVENT eid="e155" class="I_ACTION">managed</EVENT> for different classifications of Sedan car models i.e. Sedan car without tyres, Sedan car with tyres fixed, Sedan car with gap between body and tyres. Table 4 <EVENT eid="e156" class="OCCURRENCE">represents</EVENT> the division in drag force and drag co efficient <EVENT eid="e157" class="OCCURRENCE">attained</EVENT> for different cases of Sedan car versions at 10m/s. It can be <EVENT eid="e158" class="OCCURRENCE">identified</EVENT> that Sedan car model with tyres fixed has 9% more drag co efficient as compared to Sedan car without tyres, while the difference in drag coefficient between Sedan car without tyres and Sedan car with gap between body and tyres is 16%. So it is fine that there is a greater basis of drag co efficient on exterior background of the car model. But on the other case it can be <EVENT eid="e159" class="OCCURRENCE">identified</EVENT> that computational time necessary for Sedan car with gap between tyres and body is around 250 hrs while its only <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="X">40</TIMEX3> hrs for Sedan car without tyres for each velocity. So it can be <EVENT eid="e160" class="OCCURRENCE">concluded</EVENT> that the combination of type of car models for technique on the computational resources existing and the accuracy range <EVENT eid="e161" class="OCCURRENCE">needed</EVENT>. Table 4: <EVENT eid="e162" class="OCCURRENCE">Drag</EVENT> Division for different types of Sedan car version  7. International Journal of Development in Engineering, Technology and Science (IJDETS) Volume: 01, Issue: 01, <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2017-01">January  2017</TIMEX3> www.ijdets.com Page 41 IV. CONCLUSION 1. Computational technique of Sedan and Hatch Back car models support that Sedan car model has less drag co  efficient and drag force over the whole velocity range as compared to that of Hatch Back car model so it can be <EVENT eid="e163" class="OCCURRENCE">concluded</EVENT> that Sedan car model is more streamlined and external navigation efficient compared to Hatch Back car version. 2. For both Sedan and Hatch Back car versions drag force raises with raise in velocity, while drag co efficient declines slightly with raise in Reynolds number. 3. Computational technique <EVENT eid="e164" class="REPORTING">supports</EVENT> that, as the speed <EVENT eid="e165" class="OCCURRENCE">raises</EVENT> the difference in drag force between Sedan and Hatch Back car models also <EVENT eid="e166" class="OCCURRENCE">raises</EVENT>. 4. Computational technique is <EVENT eid="e167" class="OCCURRENCE">maintained</EVENT> on Sedan without tyres, Sedan with tyres fixed to body and Sedan with tyre and gap between the body states that there is greater dependency on the exterior background of the car models. Hence it <EVENT eid="e168" class="ASPECTUAL">advised taking</EVENT> the entire background of the car for <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="FUTURE_REF">future</TIMEX3> external navigation studies based on the computational and practical resources available.
