These birds were <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">made</EVENT> by inmates at the Rohwer War Relocation Center, a detention facility for Japanese Americans that <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">operated</EVENT> from <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="1942">1942 to 1945</TIMEX3> in Desha County in southeast Arkansas. Now they're a part of the collection at Little Rock's Butler Center for Arkansas Studies and its newest exhibit: "The American Dream Deferred: Japanese American Incarceration in WWII Arkansas." It is the first of four <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE">exhibitions</EVENT> about the Japanese internment in Arkansas that will be <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE">held</EVENT> at the Butler Center over <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P2Y">the next two years</TIMEX3>. 
 
Because the inmates couldn't <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE">get</EVENT> jewelry in the camp, "all of these bird pins are <EVENT eid="e10" class="STATE">made</EVENT> out of scraps," <EVENT eid="e11" class="REPORTING">says</EVENT> exhibition curator Kim Sanders. 
 
She <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE">points</EVENT> out how the legs were <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE">made</EVENT> from wires pulled out of screen doors. 
 
The art created at Rohwer and at Jerome War Relocation Center in Drew and Chicot counties gives impressive and poignant insight into what the 16,000 inmates' lives were like <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="PXY">the years</TIMEX3> they <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE">lived</EVENT> there. 
 
This is not the first time the Butler Center has had an exhibit on the subject, but this is its largest and most involved effort: a four-part, two-year project that will focus on multiple aspects of the history and cultural significance of the Japanese American experience during World War II. The exhibit <EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE">exists</EVENT> thanks in large part to a grant from the National Park Service to <EVENT eid="e16" class="I_ACTION">encourage spreading</EVENT> the story of Rohwer and Jerome. 
 
The efforts of people like actor George Takei, who <EVENT eid="e17" class="OCCURRENCE">lived</EVENT> at Rohwer and the Tule Lake facility in California as a child, have <EVENT eid="e18" class="OCCURRENCE">drawn</EVENT> more attention to the story of Japanese Americans' forced relocations, a story that has been 
 
largely unheard for many years. 
 
"It's only been in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P1E">the past couple of decades</TIMEX3> that this story has <EVENT eid="e19" class="OCCURRENCE">gained</EVENT> momentum," Sanders <EVENT eid="e20" class="REPORTING">says</EVENT>. "For a while, it was <EVENT eid="e21" class="OCCURRENCE">swept</EVENT> under the rug. People didn't <EVENT eid="e22" class="OCCURRENCE">talk</EVENT> about it." 
 
The <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="1941">1941</TIMEX3> <EVENT eid="e23" class="OCCURRENCE">attack</EVENT> on Pearl Harbor <EVENT eid="e24" class="OCCURRENCE">fanned</EVENT> strong anti-Japanese sentiments and fears of further Japanese attacks on the United States. In response, President Franklin D. Roosevelt <EVENT eid="e25" class="OCCURRENCE">signed</EVENT> Executive Order <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="X">9066</TIMEX3>, <EVENT eid="e26" class="OCCURRENCE">ordering</EVENT> the <EVENT eid="e27" class="OCCURRENCE">deportation</EVENT> and internment of thousands of people of Japanese descent, most of whom were American citizens and most of whom <EVENT eid="e28" class="OCCURRENCE">lived</EVENT> in California, Oregon and Washington state. 
 
Many were <EVENT eid="e29" class="OCCURRENCE">gathered</EVENT> in places like the Santa Anita racetrack, where horse stables were converted into "apartments," before the people were <EVENT eid="e30" class="OCCURRENCE">loaded</EVENT> on trains and <EVENT eid="e31" class="OCCURRENCE">sent</EVENT> to camps. They <EVENT eid="e32" class="OCCURRENCE">worked</EVENT>, <EVENT eid="e33" class="OCCURRENCE">went</EVENT> to school, <EVENT eid="e34" class="OCCURRENCE">took</EVENT> classes, <EVENT eid="e35" class="OCCURRENCE">took</EVENT> part in camp government, had clubs and social events, but they were also <EVENT eid="e36" class="OCCURRENCE">surrounded</EVENT> by <EVENT eid="e37" class="OCCURRENCE">barbed</EVENT> wire and guards and <EVENT eid="e38" class="OCCURRENCE">forced</EVENT> away from their homes and livelihoods. 
 
... 
 
The Butler Center has a large collection of artifacts, particularly from Rohwer, that includes art, furniture, camp school yearbooks, newsletters, posters, circulars, even mundane things such as art supply lists. 
 
Much of that is due to the <EVENT eid="e39" class="OCCURRENCE">foresight</EVENT> and dedication of Mabel "Jamie" Jamison Vogel, the art teacher at Rohwer, who <EVENT eid="e40" class="OCCURRENCE">saved</EVENT> everything she could think of. When she <EVENT eid="e41" class="OCCURRENCE">died</EVENT>, she <EVENT eid="e42" class="OCCURRENCE">left</EVENT> her collection to Rosalie Santine Gould, the mayor of McGehee, who eventually <EVENT eid="e43" class="OCCURRENCE">donated</EVENT> everything to the Butler Center. 
 
It was a perfect fit, Butler Center Director David Stricklin <EVENT eid="e44" class="REPORTING">says</EVENT>. There are five galleries for <EVENT eid="e45" class="OCCURRENCE">displaying</EVENT> art, but also a research room that's open to the general public. 
 
"You could <EVENT eid="e46" class="OCCURRENCE">go</EVENT> up there right <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> and <EVENT eid="e47" class="OCCURRENCE">sit</EVENT> down and <EVENT eid="e48" class="OCCURRENCE">read</EVENT>. We're unusual in that respect." 
 
As word has <EVENT eid="e49" class="OCCURRENCE">gotten</EVENT> around about the collection, more and more people have donated pieces because, as Stricklin <EVENT eid="e50" class="OCCURRENCE">explains</EVENT>, they <EVENT eid="e51" class="I_STATE">realize</EVENT> that having such an extensive collection in one place "<EVENT eid="e52" class="I_ACTION">attracts</EVENT> people to come <EVENT eid="e53" class="OCCURRENCE">learn</EVENT> about it and <EVENT eid="e54" class="OCCURRENCE">experience</EVENT> it." 
 
One person who <EVENT eid="e55" class="OCCURRENCE">donated</EVENT> works to the collection is Frank Sata (named for President Franklin Roosevelt), whose father, J.T. Sata, was an accomplished and established <EVENT eid="e56" class="OCCURRENCE">artist</EVENT> before his <EVENT eid="e57" class="OCCURRENCE">incarceration</EVENT> at Jerome. The new exhibit features a few of his paintings of the Jerome camp and one of his sketchbooks. They were some of the last pieces Sata ever <EVENT eid="e58" class="OCCURRENCE">did</EVENT>. 
 
"As a result of the whole experience, he <EVENT eid="e59" class="ASPECTUAL">stopped creating</EVENT> art," Stricklin <EVENT eid="e60" class="REPORTING">says</EVENT>. "It was so <EVENT eid="e61" class="I_STATE">jarring</EVENT> for him he couldn't do it anymore." 
 
The <EVENT eid="e62" class="OCCURRENCE">exhibit</EVENT> is organized thematically. Along one wall, there's a timeline that covers the story of the Japanese in America from the <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="18XX">19th century</TIMEX3> to the 21st, with a heavy emphasis on WWII. The historical data is <EVENT eid="e63" class="OCCURRENCE">interspersed</EVENT> with photos and artwork and excerpts from autobiographies by Rohwer high school students who were <EVENT eid="e64" class="OCCURRENCE">asked</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e65" class="OCCURRENCE">write</EVENT> about their experiences so far. 
 
The <EVENT eid="e66" class="OCCURRENCE">artwork</EVENT> is <EVENT eid="e67" class="OCCURRENCE">divided</EVENT> into sections. There's a section on Vogel, with her portrait and photos of her students posing by the mural they <EVENT eid="e68" class="OCCURRENCE">painted</EVENT> on the walls of the camp gym, and <EVENT eid="e69" class="OCCURRENCE">displays</EVENT> on Rohwer and Jerome. 
 
The wall on community focuses on the various activities and interests people had, like a series of fashion sketches. 
 
"A lot of what the people in the camps <EVENT eid="e70" class="I_ACTION">tried</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e71" class="OCCURRENCE">make</EVENT> life as normal as possible," Stricklin <EVENT eid="e72" class="REPORTING">says</EVENT>. "So some of the young women, especially, they would <EVENT eid="e73" class="OCCURRENCE">design</EVENT> dresses because that's what they had been interested in." 
 
They also <EVENT eid="e74" class="OCCURRENCE">kept</EVENT> up with more traditional Japanese art like kobu (a process of <EVENT eid="e75" class="OCCURRENCE">boiling</EVENT>, <EVENT eid="e76" class="OCCURRENCE">removing</EVENT> bark from and polishing cypress knees) and there are a few examples on display. 
 
"Part of it goes back to this Japanese aesthetic of loving natural forms, simple things and things that are imperfect," Sanders <EVENT eid="e77" class="REPORTING">says</EVENT>. 
 
Nearby, the identity wall has sketches and paintings that represent the cultural duality these people <EVENT eid="e78" class="OCCURRENCE">felt</EVENT> -- the pull between their dedication to and love for America and the pride and strength of their Japanese heritage. 
 
"For a lot of them, it was a real <EVENT eid="e79" class="OCCURRENCE">struggle</EVENT> with their identity," Sanders <EVENT eid="e80" class="REPORTING">says</EVENT>. "You can be 100 percent American and <EVENT eid="e81" class="STATE">have</EVENT> a different heritage. We <EVENT eid="e82" class="I_STATE">know</EVENT> that <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3>, but back then that was a different story." 
 
That duality also comes into stark relief in the wall of patriotic posters, all painted in the camp and all <EVENT eid="e83" class="OCCURRENCE">looking</EVENT> very much like posters that could be <EVENT eid="e84" class="OCCURRENCE">found</EVENT> all over the country. Calls to "<EVENT eid="e85" class="OCCURRENCE">Keep</EVENT> Them Flying" or to <EVENT eid="e86" class="OCCURRENCE">buy</EVENT> war bonds. Despite the fact that they were <EVENT eid="e87" class="OCCURRENCE">called</EVENT> "resident non-aliens" instead of "citizens" and that they had been <EVENT eid="e88" class="OCCURRENCE">taken</EVENT> from their homes, many of them were still very patriotic. 
 
Sanders <EVENT eid="e89" class="REPORTING">says</EVENT>, "It's no <EVENT eid="e90" class="STATE">different</EVENT> in these camps, even though they were <EVENT eid="e91" class="OCCURRENCE">rounded</EVENT> up by the very government they're trying to <EVENT eid="e92" class="OCCURRENCE">support</EVENT>, they still <EVENT eid="e93" class="I_STATE">want</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e94" class="OCCURRENCE">show</EVENT> they're loyal Americans so they were going to <EVENT eid="e95" class="OCCURRENCE">do</EVENT> their part for the war effort." 
 
About 800 Rohwer camp inmates <EVENT eid="e96" class="ASPECTUAL">ended</EVENT> up serving in the 442nd combat team in Europe, which may have been the most highly decorated military unit in the <EVENT eid="e97" class="OCCURRENCE">war</EVENT>. 
 
"Their attitude was, I think, the faster the war ends, the faster we can <EVENT eid="e98" class="OCCURRENCE">go</EVENT> back to California," Stricklin <EVENT eid="e99" class="REPORTING">says</EVENT>. 
 
The residents <EVENT eid="e100" class="OCCURRENCE">had</EVENT> access to ample amounts of wood, since Japanese American labor was <EVENT eid="e101" class="OCCURRENCE">used</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e102" class="OCCURRENCE">clear</EVENT> the swamps for farmland. 
 
Much of that wood was <EVENT eid="e103" class="OCCURRENCE">used</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e104" class="OCCURRENCE">make</EVENT> furniture. The government <EVENT eid="e105" class="OCCURRENCE">provided</EVENT> inmates with a pot-bellied stove, a cot and a mattress. To <EVENT eid="e106" class="OCCURRENCE">make</EVENT> their little barrack apartments less stark, residents <EVENT eid="e107" class="OCCURRENCE">made</EVENT> their own furniture, built front porches, <EVENT eid="e108" class="OCCURRENCE">added</EVENT> gardens and gazebos. The exhibit includes a chair, table and screen made from pieces of scrap wood. 
 
While Sata's paintings and some other pieces are obviously by skilled, highly trained artists, Sanders <EVENT eid="e109" class="REPORTING">says</EVENT>, "Most of the work that we have here is by people who had never <EVENT eid="e110" class="OCCURRENCE">done</EVENT> art before." 
 
Art classes were very popular at the camps with adults and children and while they did have some art <EVENT eid="e111" class="I_STATE">supplies</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e112" class="STATE">work</EVENT> with and they could <EVENT eid="e113" class="I_ACTION">order</EVENT> fabric to <EVENT eid="e114" class="OCCURRENCE">make</EVENT> clothes, they also <EVENT eid="e115" class="OCCURRENCE">created</EVENT> art out of whatever they could <EVENT eid="e116" class="OCCURRENCE">find</EVENT> -- like <EVENT eid="e117" class="OCCURRENCE">making</EVENT> carefully sewn necklaces out of metal buttons. 
 
"The ingenuity in this whole collection -- the whole experience is just <EVENT eid="e118" class="STATE">incredible</EVENT>," Sanders <EVENT eid="e119" class="REPORTING">says</EVENT>. "It's a testament to how humans can <EVENT eid="e120" class="OCCURRENCE">endure</EVENT>. They usually <EVENT eid="e121" class="OCCURRENCE">turn</EVENT> to art for endurance. It <EVENT eid="e122" class="OCCURRENCE">gives</EVENT> them some sort of control, I <EVENT eid="e123" class="I_STATE">think</EVENT>, over their surroundings when they have little control otherwise." 
 
... 
 
This particular exhibit will <EVENT eid="e124" class="ASPECTUAL">continue</EVENT> at the Butler Center through <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2017-06-24">June 24</TIMEX3>, but there will be three more. In the <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="PXF">fall</TIMEX3>, there will be an exhibit of photographs by Paul Faris, who was <EVENT eid="e125" class="OCCURRENCE">invited</EVENT> to the camp to photograph the residents. 
 
Part three, in winter/spring <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2018">2018</TIMEX3>, will <EVENT eid="e126" class="OCCURRENCE">focus</EVENT> on the experiences of the camp high school students, <EVENT eid="e127" class="OCCURRENCE">giving</EVENT> more details from the students' autobiographies, artworks and yearbooks. 
 
The final part, in <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2018">later 2018</TIMEX3>, will be on camp portraits. 
 
The <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> exhibit will <EVENT eid="e128" class="OCCURRENCE">stay</EVENT> in a state of flux. 
 
"Things are going to <EVENT eid="e129" class="OCCURRENCE">change</EVENT>," <EVENT eid="e130" class="REPORTING">says</EVENT> co-curator Colin Thompson. "What you see here is just the beginning." 
 
They <EVENT eid="e131" class="I_STATE">plan</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e132" class="ASPECTUAL">continue</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e133" class="OCCURRENCE">add</EVENT> more pieces of artwork from the permanent collection, so Thompson promises there will be different things to <EVENT eid="e134" class="STATE">see</EVENT> as weeks go by. 
 
The national attention drawn to the story of Japanese Americans in WWII has <EVENT eid="e135" class="OCCURRENCE">increased</EVENT> over <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DURATION" value="PXY">the years</TIMEX3>, and so has interest in the Butler Center's collection. 
 
Takei has <EVENT eid="e136" class="OCCURRENCE">come</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e137" class="OCCURRENCE">visit</EVENT> and <EVENT eid="e138" class="OCCURRENCE">explore</EVENT> the art and documents. While they have not <EVENT eid="e139" class="OCCURRENCE">interviewed</EVENT> him, they have <EVENT eid="e140" class="ASPECTUAL">started collecting interviews</EVENT> with other former inmates, their families and the relatives of people who <EVENT eid="e141" class="OCCURRENCE">worked</EVENT> at the camps. And they have hopes for <EVENT eid="e142" class="OCCURRENCE">starting</EVENT> new research projects based on the documents and works in the collection. 
 
But it's still a subject many people don't <EVENT eid="e143" class="STATE">know</EVENT> about. Even if they do know about the internment camps in general, there are still many who don't <EVENT eid="e144" class="I_STATE">realize</EVENT> there were two in Arkansas. That's what the exhibit hopes to <EVENT eid="e145" class="OCCURRENCE">correct</EVENT>: to <EVENT eid="e146" class="OCCURRENCE">let</EVENT> people <EVENT eid="e147" class="OCCURRENCE">know</EVENT> what <EVENT eid="e148" class="OCCURRENCE">happened</EVENT> in southeast Arkansas and to <EVENT eid="e149" class="OCCURRENCE">link</EVENT> past and <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="X">present</TIMEX3>. 
 
"Part of what I've tried to <EVENT eid="e150" class="OCCURRENCE">do</EVENT> here was <EVENT eid="e151" class="I_ACTION">try</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e152" class="OCCURRENCE">relate</EVENT> it to people <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3>," Sanders <EVENT eid="e153" class="REPORTING">says</EVENT>. "I <EVENT eid="e154" class="I_STATE">try</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e155" class="OCCURRENCE">drive</EVENT> it home that it's really up to us to <EVENT eid="e156" class="OCCURRENCE">reshape</EVENT> society so something like this doesn't happen again." 
 
That connection between <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">past</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="X">present</TIMEX3> <EVENT eid="e157" class="OCCURRENCE">comes</EVENT> through in the first-person accounts of the students, or in a young woman's sketches designing her dream formal gown -- one that looks much like a dress from Gone With the Wind . It's a world away, but also so very normal. 
 
"I <EVENT eid="e158" class="I_STATE">want</EVENT> them to know that just because it's history doesn't mean it can't <EVENT eid="e159" class="OCCURRENCE">happen</EVENT> again," Sanders <EVENT eid="e160" class="REPORTING">says</EVENT>. "History is a living, breathing thing. It's not just over. It's something we make happen <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="SET" value="P1D">every day</TIMEX3>." 
 
Thompson agrees. 
 
"It's a tremendous story. A very <EVENT eid="e161" class="OCCURRENCE">moving</EVENT> story. When you meet people who were in the camps and you see, this isn't just a random fact. These were real people that were in these camps in Arkansas. I <EVENT eid="e162" class="I_STATE">think</EVENT> it's something people should know about."
