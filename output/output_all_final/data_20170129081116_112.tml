STAR Institute has two new companies who are <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE">kicking</EVENT> off 2017 as STAR Institute Corporate Partners, Bellicon and Stokke. It is extremely important for STAR Institute to have <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE">support</EVENT> from organizations like these and we thank each of these companies for their <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE">collaboration</EVENT> with us as they help us further our vision of a world where everyone with SPD <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE">receives</EVENT> support and services that result in having a meaningful and fulfilled life, <EVENT eid="e11" class="REPORTING">explains</EVENT> Dick Layton, Director of STAR Institute.

We <EVENT eid="e13" class="STATE">serve</EVENT> the very same community of people as the STAR Institute, so our partnership is natural, <EVENT eid="e14" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT> Donna Chambers, Founder and CEO of SensaCalm. 
 
We <EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE">chose</EVENT> to partner with STAR Institute, as so many families have a sensory related diagnosis in addition to other diagnoses. As parents to a child with sensory needs, we value the dual model of research and support provided by the STAR Institute. Being a national company that supports those with additional needs, it was important for us to <EVENT eid="e16" class="OCCURRENCE">find</EVENT> a like-minded corporate partner that <EVENT eid="e17" class="OCCURRENCE">shared</EVENT> our values and mission, <EVENT eid="e18" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT> Shelli Smartt, owner of Chewigem USA. 
 
The STAR Institute thanks all of their 2017 Corporate Partners.
