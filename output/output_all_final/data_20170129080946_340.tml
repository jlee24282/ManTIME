<TITLE>Sing review  wildlifes got talent in this joyous animation</TITLE>


<TEXT>
Sing is by no means the first animation to <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">incorporate</EVENT> the talent-show format into its narrative, but its certainly the most successful. While its not particularly original, this madcap caper based around a theatre-owning koala with big dreams has charm to spare and enough diversity in the music choices not to completely <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">alienate</EVENT> older audience members  Dolly Parton rubs shoulders with Katy Perry, Stevie Wonder with Nicki Minaj.

Buster Moon (Matthew McConaughey) is <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">clinging</EVENT> to his business by one koala claw; the bank is <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">poised</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">prise</EVENT> the theatre from his grasp. His solution  a talent show  <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">captures</EVENT> the public imagination, before disaster strikes. And <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE">thats</EVENT> about it in the way of plot.

Each of the key contestants must <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE">overcome</EVENT> their own challenge, be it crippling stage fright, the invisibility of being a stay-at-home mum or a bank-robber dad with a vacancy in the family business. But the density of sight gags in this animation debut from Garth Jennings (Son of Rambow), the breakneck <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE">pacing</EVENT> and the fizzing energy of the storytelling make this an unexpectedly joyful experience. And I <EVENT eid="e10" class="I_STATE">challenge</EVENT> you not to well up when Meena, the painfully shy elephant (<EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE">voiced</EVENT> by Tori Kelly) finally <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE">sings</EVENT> Leonard Cohens Hallelujah.
