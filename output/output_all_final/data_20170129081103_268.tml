For <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DURATION" value="P0Y">twenty-five years</TIMEX3>, the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program has <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">supported</EVENT> a comprehensive system of health services for vulnerable and under- or uninsured people living with HIV. <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">Using</EVENT> data from the Health Resources and Services Administration about people living with HIV and <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">served</EVENT> by the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program, we <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">found reductions</EVENT> in disparities in viral suppression rates between <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010">2010</TIMEX3> and 2014with rates for Blacks/African Americans, adolescents and young adults, and people living in the South <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">becoming</EVENT> more similar to rates for Whites, older adults, and people in other regions of the United States, respectively. Although absolute viral suppression rates for people without stable housing and transgender people <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">improved</EVENT> during the same time period, disparities were not <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE">reduced</EVENT> between these groups and those with stable housing and nontransgender people, respectively. Addressing persistent disparities through the effective use of this program will be one of the key ways to <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE">meet</EVENT> the goals of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy.
