<TITLE>Obama's failing: lack of ambition</TITLE>


<TEXT>
Nobody thinks Margaret Thatcher's claim on posterity is that she was Britain's first female prime minister. Admirers and critics alike know she was more consequential than that. Barack Obama was America's first black president, which is a huge thing and a fine thing. But when you've <EVENT eid="e1" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT> that, you've probably <EVENT eid="e2" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT> what <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">matters</EVENT> most about his time in office. 
 
Perhaps it was harder--less probable--for a black man with little experience of government to be <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">elected</EVENT> president of the U.S. in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3> than it was for a woman to <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">lead</EVENT> the British Conservative Party to electoral victory in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="1979">1979</TIMEX3>. Obama's rise to the presidency was a remarkable accomplishment. Talk about audacity. But <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">reflecting</EVENT> on his <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="X">eight</TIMEX3> years in office, one <EVENT eid="e7" class="I_ACTION">wonders</EVENT> how much ambition he had <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE">left</EVENT> after that. 
 
He doubtless wanted to <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE">succeed</EVENT>, and he did, in some ways. Not least, he <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE">won re-election</EVENT> in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2012">2012</TIMEX3> and <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE">departs</EVENT> the White House with most voters thinking well of him. But already in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3> he could <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE">say</EVENT> and <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE">think</EVENT>, "Yes we <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE">did</EVENT>." Nothing he achieved afterward <EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE">eclipses</EVENT> that. Thatcher, in contrast, betrayed little or no interest in <EVENT eid="e16" class="I_ACTION">defeating</EVENT> a prejudice about what women could aspire to be. She <EVENT eid="e17" class="REPORTING">wanted</EVENT> power because she <EVENT eid="e18" class="I_STATE">believed</EVENT> it was necessary to <EVENT eid="e19" class="OCCURRENCE">transform</EVENT> Britain, and nobody else was up to the job. For good or ill, <EVENT eid="e20" class="REPORTING">transform</EVENT> Britain is what she did. 
 
A prime minister with a comfortable majority in Parliament <EVENT eid="e21" class="STATE">has</EVENT> more power to <EVENT eid="e22" class="OCCURRENCE">change</EVENT> Britain than any president has to <EVENT eid="e23" class="OCCURRENCE">change</EVENT> the U.S. No checks and balances to deal with. Yet you could <EVENT eid="e24" class="I_ACTION">argue</EVENT> that Ronald Reagan <EVENT eid="e25" class="OCCURRENCE">managed</EVENT> it. Obama, you could also <EVENT eid="e26" class="OCCURRENCE">argue</EVENT>, might have <EVENT eid="e27" class="OCCURRENCE">managed</EVENT> it too, had he <EVENT eid="e28" class="OCCURRENCE">tried</EVENT>. The occasion <EVENT eid="e29" class="OCCURRENCE">presented</EVENT> itself in the form of an economic <EVENT eid="e30" class="OCCURRENCE">crisis</EVENT>. Leaders subsequently <EVENT eid="e31" class="OCCURRENCE">deemed</EVENT> great usually <EVENT eid="e32" class="OCCURRENCE">find</EVENT> themselves <EVENT eid="e33" class="OCCURRENCE">contending</EVENT> with a crisis, domestic or foreign, sometimes of their own making. But Obama <EVENT eid="e34" class="OCCURRENCE">let</EVENT> his particular crisis <EVENT eid="e35" class="OCCURRENCE">go</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e36" class="OCCURRENCE">waste</EVENT>. 
 
What nonsense, Obama's admirers will <EVENT eid="e37" class="OCCURRENCE">say</EVENT>: His stimulus bill <EVENT eid="e38" class="OCCURRENCE">saved</EVENT> the U.S. from a new Great Depression; his health-care reform was a decisive and (despite the Republicans' forthcoming efforts) irreversible advance; he <EVENT eid="e39" class="OCCURRENCE">used</EVENT> his executive powers to <EVENT eid="e40" class="OCCURRENCE">shift</EVENT> policy across a wide range of issues, from climate change to national security. Take all that together, and his legacy is indeed a country <EVENT eid="e41" class="OCCURRENCE">transformed</EVENT>. 
 
All of this is very questionable. The recession would certainly have been worse without the stimulus, and the stimulus might have been smaller without Obama's input, but modern economies with huge public sectors and forceful central banks aren't vulnerable to depression in the way countries were in the <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="192X">1920s</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="193X">1930s</TIMEX3>. Britain's economy <EVENT eid="e42" class="OCCURRENCE">fell</EVENT> further in the slump, but its subsequent <EVENT eid="e43" class="OCCURRENCE">recovery</EVENT> has been about as <EVENT eid="e44" class="STATE">strong</EVENT> as America's, for the most part with a fiscally orthodox Conservative government in charge. 
 
We'll <EVENT eid="e45" class="PERCEPTION">see</EVENT> what remains of the Affordable Care Act in due course, but its prospects aren't <EVENT eid="e46" class="OCCURRENCE">helped</EVENT> by its unpopularity from the outset. Some <EVENT eid="e47" class="REPORTING">argue</EVENT> that Obamacare <EVENT eid="e48" class="OCCURRENCE">established</EVENT> access to health care as a right, and from this at least there's no going back. Actually, it <EVENT eid="e49" class="I_ACTION">failed</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e50" class="OCCURRENCE">establish</EVENT> that idea. Obamacare <EVENT eid="e51" class="OCCURRENCE">reduced</EVENT> the number of uninsured Americans, which is progress, but not to zero. 
 
As for the rest, what executive <EVENT eid="e52" class="OCCURRENCE">actions</EVENT> can do, executive actions can undo. On race relations, hopes were high that Obama would <EVENT eid="e53" class="OCCURRENCE">mark</EVENT> a decisive break with <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">the past</TIMEX3>; if anything, the divisions are deeper than before. Even Obama's most <EVENT eid="e54" class="OCCURRENCE">fawning</EVENT> admirers rarely <EVENT eid="e55" class="I_ACTION">call</EVENT> his foreign policy a success. China is <EVENT eid="e56" class="OCCURRENCE">throwing</EVENT> its weight around. So is Russia. Iran's nuclear ambitions are only on pause, the Middle East is in turmoil, and Syria has <EVENT eid="e57" class="OCCURRENCE">fallen</EVENT> into an abyss at the hands of a corrupt government and its Russian sponsor. 
 
In every case, Obama has good excuses. In foreign policy, he <EVENT eid="e58" class="OCCURRENCE">followed</EVENT> a president whose own bid for greatness, the war on Iraq, ended in catastrophe. An unassertive foreign policy, if not outright disengagement, is what many Americans <EVENT eid="e59" class="OCCURRENCE">wanted</EVENT> from the new president. Obama soon <EVENT eid="e60" class="OCCURRENCE">recognized</EVENT> the limits of that approach, but he was <EVENT eid="e61" class="OCCURRENCE">stuck</EVENT> with the country's suspicion of forceful leadership in global affairs. 
 
In domestic policy, Obama had to <EVENT eid="e62" class="OCCURRENCE">cope</EVENT> with a Congress <EVENT eid="e63" class="OCCURRENCE">crippled</EVENT> by polarization. Republicans were soon in a position to <EVENT eid="e64" class="I_ACTION">block</EVENT> every legislative initiative, and <EVENT eid="e65" class="OCCURRENCE">did</EVENT> so remorselessly. Obamacare was a centrist initiative, but Congress no longer had a center to <EVENT eid="e66" class="OCCURRENCE">get</EVENT> behind it. It <EVENT eid="e67" class="OCCURRENCE">passed</EVENT> without a single Republican vote, and despite the <EVENT eid="e68" class="OCCURRENCE">reservations</EVENT> of many leftist Democrats. It was a narrowly partisan victory that <EVENT eid="e69" class="OCCURRENCE">failed</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e70" class="OCCURRENCE">impress</EVENT> even the winners. 
 
Far-reaching reform <EVENT eid="e71" class="OCCURRENCE">requires</EVENT> consensus; <EVENT eid="e72" class="OCCURRENCE">lacking</EVENT> consensus, it <EVENT eid="e73" class="I_STATE">fails</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e74" class="OCCURRENCE">stick</EVENT>. Obama <EVENT eid="e75" class="REPORTING">thought</EVENT> the ACA would <EVENT eid="e76" class="OCCURRENCE">create</EVENT> a consensus all by itself, after the fact. So far, it hasn't. 
 
Many politicians <EVENT eid="e77" class="OCCURRENCE">make</EVENT> the mistake of <EVENT eid="e78" class="OCCURRENCE">thinking</EVENT> that consensus requires timidity. Thatcher was <EVENT eid="e79" class="I_STATE">abrasive</EVENT> and radical, and <EVENT eid="e80" class="I_ACTION">aroused</EVENT> ferocious opposition--but her assault on a trade-union movement run amok commanded wide support. Thatcherism <EVENT eid="e81" class="OCCURRENCE">moved</EVENT> the center of British politics to the right, and the shift <EVENT eid="e82" class="ASPECTUAL">persisted</EVENT>. Subsequent Labour and Tory governments have <EVENT eid="e83" class="OCCURRENCE">nestled</EVENT> closely together in this repositioned middle. Thatcher <EVENT eid="e84" class="OCCURRENCE">changed</EVENT> Britain by <EVENT eid="e85" class="OCCURRENCE">changing</EVENT> British politics. 
 
Could Obama have <EVENT eid="e86" class="OCCURRENCE">aspired</EVENT> to something similar in the U.S.--<EVENT eid="e87" class="OCCURRENCE">repopulating</EVENT> the political center and <EVENT eid="e88" class="OCCURRENCE">aligning</EVENT> it leftward, behind a new New Deal <EVENT eid="e89" class="OCCURRENCE">built</EVENT> on American capitalism but <EVENT eid="e90" class="OCCURRENCE">addressed</EVENT> to growing inequality and diminished economic security? 
 
In <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3> it <EVENT eid="e91" class="OCCURRENCE">seemed</EVENT> possible. The new president was a man of enormous talent, effortlessly commanding respect, an enthralling speaker, calm, sober and instantly likable. He'd <EVENT eid="e92" class="OCCURRENCE">come</EVENT> up from nothing, and by the way, he was <EVENT eid="e93" class="STATE">black</EVENT>. He was <EVENT eid="e94" class="OCCURRENCE">something</EVENT> entirely new, yet quintessentially American. The country, it seemed, was <EVENT eid="e95" class="STATE">proud</EVENT> of him and proud of itself for having <EVENT eid="e96" class="OCCURRENCE">produced</EVENT> him. The politically uncommitted <EVENT eid="e97" class="I_ACTION">wanted</EVENT> him to <EVENT eid="e98" class="OCCURRENCE">succeed</EVENT>, and despite later controversies and disappointments this never really <EVENT eid="e99" class="OCCURRENCE">changed</EVENT>. 
 
It would be wrong to <EVENT eid="e100" class="REPORTING">say</EVENT> he <EVENT eid="e101" class="OCCURRENCE">squandered</EVENT> these assets, but he took no chances with them. You don't <EVENT eid="e102" class="OCCURRENCE">realign</EVENT> politics by <EVENT eid="e103" class="OCCURRENCE">tending</EVENT> exclusively to the hopes and ideas of your partisan followers. That's what he <EVENT eid="e104" class="OCCURRENCE">did</EVENT>. As president, Obama was most comfortable <EVENT eid="e105" class="I_STATE">preaching</EVENT> to the <EVENT eid="e106" class="STATE">converted</EVENT>. 
 
He rarely <EVENT eid="e107" class="OCCURRENCE">challenged</EVENT> the left, or <EVENT eid="e108" class="OCCURRENCE">spoke</EVENT> to the movable center of the electorate on terms of full understanding and respect. When it <EVENT eid="e109" class="OCCURRENCE">came</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e110" class="OCCURRENCE">selling</EVENT> Obamacare, for instance, he was strangely passive. His characteristic approach was to <EVENT eid="e111" class="OCCURRENCE">apologize</EVENT> to Democrats for compromises fashioned elsewhere--regrettable compromises, <EVENT eid="e112" class="OCCURRENCE">required</EVENT> by practical politics--while <EVENT eid="e113" class="OCCURRENCE">expressing</EVENT> empathy for the benighted and unconvinced, clinging to their mistaken beliefs for perfectly understandable reasons. This <EVENT eid="e114" class="OCCURRENCE">approach</EVENT> is <EVENT eid="e115" class="I_STATE">guaranteed</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e116" class="OCCURRENCE">change</EVENT> nobody's mind. 
 
Read his farewell address. It was a good speech, like almost all his speeches. But it was <EVENT eid="e117" class="OCCURRENCE">addressed</EVENT> mostly to his supporters--"Yes we did"--not to America. Obama <EVENT eid="e118" class="I_ACTION">accepted</EVENT> the country's political divisions as given, and <EVENT eid="e119" class="OCCURRENCE">risked nothing</EVENT> on <EVENT eid="e120" class="OCCURRENCE">changing</EVENT> them. 
 
Compounding the problem, he had no taste for transactional politics. He <EVENT eid="e121" class="OCCURRENCE">entrenched polarization</EVENT> by <EVENT eid="e122" class="I_ACTION">choosing</EVENT> not to <EVENT eid="e123" class="OCCURRENCE">elicit</EVENT> latent demand for a new center, yet was <EVENT eid="e124" class="STATE">disdainful</EVENT> of the tawdry deal-making that this lack of ambition made necessary. Grand political realignment was not his thing. Cutting deals, better <EVENT eid="e125" class="OCCURRENCE">left</EVENT> to other people, was not his thing either. 
 
Great leadership--more precisely, the desire to be a great leader--can be dangerous. Remember that Thatcher could easily have been a great <EVENT eid="e126" class="OCCURRENCE">failure</EVENT>: She <EVENT eid="e127" class="OCCURRENCE">bet</EVENT> her premiership and the lives of many soldiers and sailors on a stupid war with Argentina, a reckless venture that on any rational analysis was likely to <EVENT eid="e128" class="OCCURRENCE">fail</EVENT>. She had to be outrageously lucky as well as ambitious. Don't be too quick to <EVENT eid="e129" class="OCCURRENCE">blame</EVENT> Obama for his caution. 
 
And yet it's disappointing. America's polarization and the deep political dysfunction that flows from it are themselves a kind of crisis. <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> they've <EVENT eid="e130" class="OCCURRENCE">yielded</EVENT> President Trump, and who knows what harm will <EVENT eid="e131" class="OCCURRENCE">flow</EVENT> from that? If Obama had been willing to <EVENT eid="e132" class="OCCURRENCE">think</EVENT> big and <EVENT eid="e133" class="OCCURRENCE">take</EVENT> risks--not just before getting elected but afterward as well--things might have been different. But Obama wasn't that man.
