<TITLE>Income, Wealth Transfer Tax Changes Likely Under New Administration</TITLE>


<TEXT>
Comprehensive federal tax reform likely will be a top priority for the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress in the <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017">first half of 2017</TIMEX3>. Although there are differences between their proposals, President Donald Trump and the House GOP have <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">suggested</EVENT> significant changes to the estate tax as well as to the availability of asset step up in basis after death and itemized deductions during life. High net worth individuals and their estate planners should <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">examine</EVENT> all three issues, in addition to state estate tax consequences, when <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">revising</EVENT> their lifetime and testamentary giving plans in the wake of changes at the federal level. 
 Tax Reform Plans  
The following table <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">compares</EVENT> President Trump’s statements on tax reform during his <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">campaign</EVENT> with the House Republican proposal, <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">known</EVENT> as the “Blueprint.” (See   Business Tax Reform All but Certain in US, Europe . ) 
 
President Trump and the Blueprint offer additional proposals, such as <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE">closing</EVENT> the carried interest tax  loophole  (President Trump only) and income tax rate <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE">decreases</EVENT> for corporations and <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE">pass</EVENT> through business entities (both plans). However, the issues of estate tax repeal, changes to asset basis <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE">step</EVENT> up and limitations on deductions will have the most significant effects on estate planning in terms of both testamentary plans and lifetime <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE">giving</EVENT>. 
 Estate Tax Repeal  
Estate tax repeal has <EVENT eid="e12" class="STATE">been</EVENT> on the Republican wish list for many <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="PXY">years</TIMEX3>, but previous efforts at permanent repeal <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE">failed</EVENT> — even during <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="X">one</TIMEX3> period of unified Republican government — because of Democratic political opposition and legislative rules <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE">relating</EVENT> to the reconciliation process between House and Senate spending bills. However, political will for estate tax repeal is strong <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017">this year</TIMEX3>, both because it is a stated priority for congressional Republicans and President Trump and because Senate Democrats may <EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE">cede</EVENT> opposition to estate tax repeal as a filibuster bargaining chip in overall tax reform. The generation skipping transfer tax, which prevents individuals from <EVENT eid="e16" class="OCCURRENCE">avoiding</EVENT> the estate tax through transfers to grandchildren and more remote descendants, would <EVENT eid="e17" class="OCCURRENCE">become</EVENT> largely irrelevant with no estate tax in place and would likely be part of any estate tax repeal bill. 
 
Although the 40 percent rate for transfers at death <EVENT eid="e18" class="OCCURRENCE">totaling</EVENT> over $5.49 million for an individual and $10.98 million for a married couple in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> <EVENT eid="e19" class="OCCURRENCE">appears</EVENT> ripe for the legislative chopping block, less certain is the status of the gift tax. Neither plan <EVENT eid="e20" class="OCCURRENCE">mentions</EVENT> this tax, which <EVENT eid="e21" class="OCCURRENCE">imposes</EVENT> the same rate on transfers <EVENT eid="e22" class="OCCURRENCE">exceeding</EVENT> the same amounts during a donor’s lifetime. Although transfer taxes represent only a nominal amount of revenue for the government relative to all tax receipts, the gift tax <EVENT eid="e23" class="OCCURRENCE">serves</EVENT> as a backstop to the income tax by <EVENT eid="e24" class="OCCURRENCE">preventing</EVENT> high marginal rate taxpayers from <EVENT eid="e25" class="OCCURRENCE">gifting</EVENT> certain assets to low marginal rate taxpayers — often, younger family members — who would <EVENT eid="e26" class="OCCURRENCE">sell</EVENT> the assets and gift the proceeds back to the donor. If the gift tax remains in effect, transfer techniques such as grantor <EVENT eid="e27" class="OCCURRENCE">retained</EVENT> annuity trusts would <EVENT eid="e28" class="ASPECTUAL">continue</EVENT> to be effective estate planning tools even after a repeal of the estate tax. 
 Asset Basis Step Up  
A major <EVENT eid="e29" class="OCCURRENCE">difference</EVENT> between the two plans is whether assets that appreciate will <EVENT eid="e30" class="OCCURRENCE">receive</EVENT> a step up in basis, or a readjustment in value, at an owner’s death. <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Current</TIMEX3> law and the House GOP plan <EVENT eid="e31" class="REPORTING">provide</EVENT> that all assets owned by a <EVENT eid="e32" class="OCCURRENCE">decedent</EVENT> at his or her death <EVENT eid="e33" class="OCCURRENCE">receive</EVENT> a step up in basis to their fair market value at the time of death. Unless an asset <EVENT eid="e34" class="OCCURRENCE">appreciates</EVENT> significantly after the decedent’s death, its recipient will have <EVENT eid="e35" class="OCCURRENCE">limited</EVENT> — if any — taxable gain on a later sale or exchange. 
 
However, President Trump’s plan <EVENT eid="e36" class="I_STATE">appears</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e37" class="OCCURRENCE">limit</EVENT> the step up in basis to the first $10 million of <EVENT eid="e38" class="OCCURRENCE">built</EVENT> in gain in assets owned by a decedent at death. If a decedent <EVENT eid="e39" class="OCCURRENCE">owned</EVENT> $100 million of assets at death with an aggregate basis of $50 million (in the simplest case, having <EVENT eid="e40" class="OCCURRENCE">paid</EVENT> $50 million for those assets, which then <EVENT eid="e41" class="OCCURRENCE">appreciated</EVENT> to $100 million), the basis of those assets in the hands of the recipient(s) would be <EVENT eid="e42" class="OCCURRENCE">limited</EVENT> to $60 million as <EVENT eid="e43" class="OCCURRENCE">opposed</EVENT> to their $100 million fair market value. It is unclear from President Trump’s plan how the $10 million <EVENT eid="e44" class="OCCURRENCE">increase</EVENT> in basis would be <EVENT eid="e45" class="OCCURRENCE">allocated</EVENT> among multiple built in gain assets. It also is unclear whether his plan would <EVENT eid="e46" class="OCCURRENCE">deem</EVENT> death a capital gains realization event, such that, in the previous example, the decedent’s estate would <EVENT eid="e47" class="OCCURRENCE">pay</EVENT> tax (presumably, at capital gains rates) on $40 million of appreciation, and the recipients would <EVENT eid="e48" class="OCCURRENCE">take</EVENT> the decedent’s assets with a $100 million fair market value basis. In any event, the full, tax free step up in basis at death that estate planners and clients have <EVENT eid="e49" class="OCCURRENCE">enjoyed</EVENT> would no longer be in effect. 
 Limitations on Deductions  
Finally, President Trump’s plan <EVENT eid="e50" class="OCCURRENCE">changes</EVENT> the availability of itemized deductions for all taxpayers, potentially <EVENT eid="e51" class="OCCURRENCE">limiting</EVENT> the income tax efficiency of charitable contributions during life for charitably inclined high net worth individuals. Although the House GOP plan <EVENT eid="e52" class="OCCURRENCE">eliminates</EVENT> most itemized deductions, such as deductions for medical expenses and for state and local taxes, it <EVENT eid="e53" class="OCCURRENCE">retains</EVENT> the <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> charitable deduction, which is unlimited in terms of dollar value but subject to a percentage <EVENT eid="e54" class="OCCURRENCE">limitation</EVENT> based on adjusted gross income. 
 
By contrast, President Trump’s plan <EVENT eid="e55" class="OCCURRENCE">retains</EVENT> all current itemized deductions but caps them at $100,000 for a single individual and $200,000 for a married couple. An individual whose annual home mortgage interest, medical expenses, and state and local taxes <EVENT eid="e56" class="OCCURRENCE">exceed</EVENT> $100,000 would thus <EVENT eid="e57" class="OCCURRENCE">receive</EVENT> no additional deduction for amounts <EVENT eid="e58" class="OCCURRENCE">contributed</EVENT> to charities, perhaps <EVENT eid="e59" class="OCCURRENCE">causing</EVENT> him or her to <EVENT eid="e60" class="OCCURRENCE">defer</EVENT> charitable <EVENT eid="e61" class="OCCURRENCE">giving</EVENT> to later <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="PXY">years</TIMEX3> or until death. 
 State Estate Taxes  
Even if President Trump and the House GOP <EVENT eid="e62" class="OCCURRENCE">implement</EVENT> comprehensive tax reform that eliminates the federal estate tax, state estate taxes would not automatically <EVENT eid="e63" class="OCCURRENCE">follow</EVENT> suit. New York, for example, imposes an estate tax with a top rate of 16 percent for transfers at death <EVENT eid="e64" class="OCCURRENCE">exceeding</EVENT> $4.187 million (<EVENT eid="e65" class="OCCURRENCE">increasing</EVENT> to $5.25 million in <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2017-04">April 2017</TIMEX3>). Eighteen other states have state estate taxes, with top rates <EVENT eid="e66" class="OCCURRENCE">ranging</EVENT> from 12 percent to 20 percent. New York residents and residents of other states that continue to have separate estate taxes must <EVENT eid="e67" class="OCCURRENCE">remember</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e68" class="OCCURRENCE">consider</EVENT> the state tax efficiency of their estate plans, even if state estate tax rates remain lower than the <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> top federal rate of 40 percent. 
 Looking Ahead  
At first glance, changes to the transfer tax system at the federal level would <EVENT eid="e69" class="OCCURRENCE">seem</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e70" class="OCCURRENCE">simplify</EVENT> estate planning for many individuals. However, because of offsetting changes to the federal income tax consequences of gratuitous transfers and unchanged state transfer tax systems, individuals and their estate planners should <EVENT eid="e71" class="OCCURRENCE">take</EVENT> a cautious approach when <EVENT eid="e72" class="OCCURRENCE">revising</EVENT> estate planning documents in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="FUTURE_REF">the coming year</TIMEX3>.
