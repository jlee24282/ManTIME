<TITLE>'Affordable luxury' gets real with Kia's Cadenza</TITLE>


<TEXT>
By Kia Motors America is <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">motoring</EVENT> with the idea of affordable luxury. As <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">executed</EVENT> in the <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> Kia Cadenza Limited sedan, it is more than a good marketing strategy. It is an approach to the U.S. car market that could <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">upset</EVENT> traditional notions of automotive luxury and <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">serve</EVENT> notice to the likes of Infiniti, Lexus and   yes   even BMW and Mercedes Benz. 
 
We are <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">talking</EVENT> in terms of exterior beauty, interior materials and design, structural integrity, and <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">advanced</EVENT> electronic safety and driver assistance technology. 
 
Drive feel and handling are not bad, either. They are not as good as that of a BMW 5 series, a Mercedes Benz AMG model or an Audi 7. But feel and <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE">handling</EVENT> in the Kia Cadenza are very good. And if you ve never been behind the <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE">steering</EVENT> wheel of a BMW 5 series or an Audi A7, you won t <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE">miss</EVENT> or <EVENT eid="e10" class="I_ACTION">regret</EVENT> never having <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE">done</EVENT> so as the driver of a Kia Cadenza. 
 
You won t <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE">miss</EVENT> the <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE">pricing</EVENT> of those traditional high end cars, either. Even fully <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE">loaded</EVENT>, with nearly all driver assistance and <EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE">advanced</EVENT> electronic safety options and Kia s highest trim level, the Limited, the Cadenza beats traditional luxury car prices at $45,290, including factory to dealer shipment charges. 
 
In <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2014">2014</TIMEX3>, when the Cadenza was <EVENT eid="e16" class="OCCURRENCE">introduced</EVENT>, it was an easily ignorable bargain in comparison with traditional luxury competitors. No longer. The <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> model is substantially improved. Exterior design does more than imitate something traditional. It <EVENT eid="e17" class="STATE">sets</EVENT> its own standard with a catchy vertical, concave grille. Rear end LED taillights are <EVENT eid="e18" class="STATE">attractive</EVENT>. The entire exterior is muscular yet smooth, simple and overall attractive. 
 
The interior, done with quilted Nappa leather seat trim, feels rich. Equipped with reliable, easily controllable seat heater, the Cadenza Limited feels especially comfortable on a subfreezing <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-WI">winter</TIMEX3> s day.  
 
Advanced electronic safety is everywhere in this one. Its systems include windshield heads up display combining information on blind side monitoring and lane departure <EVENT eid="e19" class="OCCURRENCE">warning</EVENT>; forward collision mitigation; hill start assist control, which <EVENT eid="e20" class="I_ACTION">helps ease</EVENT> any fears of rollback on steep inclines; and rear cross traffic alert and parking assistance. 
 
It is available in three trim levels   Premium, Technology and Limited. Buy the Technology if you <EVENT eid="e21" class="I_STATE">want</EVENT> the best value in a Cadenza. Buy the Limited if you <EVENT eid="e22" class="I_STATE">want</EVENT> the Cadenza with most available options.  
 
All Cadenza models are front wheel drive and <EVENT eid="e23" class="OCCURRENCE">equipped</EVENT> with a gasoline 3.3 liter, fuel <EVENT eid="e24" class="I_ACTION">injected</EVENT> V 6 (290 horsepower, 253 pound feet of torque). The engine is smooth and responsive. But, no, it won t <EVENT eid="e25" class="STATE">impress</EVENT> anyone fond of <EVENT eid="e26" class="OCCURRENCE">scooting</EVENT> around in an Audi A7. Who cares? Just think of what the A7 costs. 
 
Nuts  amp; Bolts 
 
2017 Kia Cadenza 
 
Bottom line: The Kia Cadenza is automotive luxury with value. The Cadenza Technology probably is the best value in this line. The Cadenza Limited is the safest and most comfortable. 
 
Ride, acceleration and handling: I ve been thinking about this category for a while, stung by the criticism that I am a conservative in this area. I am not conservative. I just <EVENT eid="e27" class="OCCURRENCE">drive</EVENT> a lot, and I am convinced that the Cadenza Limited will <EVENT eid="e28" class="OCCURRENCE">please</EVENT> most drivers who obey traffic laws. 
 
Head <EVENT eid="e29" class="OCCURRENCE">turning</EVENT> quotient: It is a beautifully styled car inside and out. 
 
Body style/layout: The Cadenza is a full sized, luxury, front engine, front wheel drive sedan, completely restyled for <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3>. 
 
Engine/transmission: It comes with a 3.3 liter, 24 valve, fuel <EVENT eid="e30" class="OCCURRENCE">injected</EVENT> V 6 (290 horsepower, 253 foot pounds of torque) with variable valve timing. The engine is linked to an eight speed automatic transmission that also can be <EVENT eid="e31" class="OCCURRENCE">operated</EVENT> manually via <EVENT eid="e32" class="I_ACTION">steering</EVENT> wheel <EVENT eid="e33" class="OCCURRENCE">mounted</EVENT> paddle shifters. 
 
Capacities: Seating is for five people. Cargo capacity is 16 cubic feet. The fuel tank holds 18.5 gallons of gasoline. Regular grade works fine. 
 
Mileage: I <EVENT eid="e34" class="OCCURRENCE">averaged</EVENT> 22 miles per gallon combined city highway with lots of <EVENT eid="e35" class="OCCURRENCE">idling</EVENT> in the city because of subfreezing weather and light snow. 
 
Safety: Standard equipment includes ventilated front disc and solid rear disc brakes; four wheel anti lock brake protection; emergency braking assistance; stability and traction control; blind side monitoring and lane departure warning; post collision and pre collision safety systems; side and head air bags. 
 
Pricing: The <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> Kia Cadenza Limited starts at $44,390. Price as tested is $45,290, including $900 factory to dealer shipment charge.
