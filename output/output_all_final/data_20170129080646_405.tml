<EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">Buoyed</EVENT> by demand, one of South Africas most commercially successful comedians, Karou Charou, <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">returns</EVENT> to Carnival City for another outrageously funny show.

<TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="X">This</TIMEX3> time he <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">brings</EVENT> with him an entourage of Durban-based comedians for the Karou Charou Comedy Showcase.

On the bill for the show, on <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-02-19">February 19</TIMEX3>, are Charou himself, Neville Pillay, Muthu Murugan and Shika Budhoo.

In <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-11">November</TIMEX3>, <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3>, he <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">achieved</EVENT> sold-out status when he <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">featured</EVENT> a host of local Johannesburg-based comics.

This time he features some of the best comedic talent that Durban has to <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">offer</EVENT>.

Headlining the show will be the living legend of Indian comedy, Muthu Murugan.

A household name, this comedian has a commanding stage presence and a career spanning <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="X">three</TIMEX3> decades.

He combines laid-back humour with sharp wit to <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE">appeal</EVENT> to South Africas rainbow nation.

Always in demand, Murugan has <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE">toured</EVENT> both nationally and internationally during his career.

Budhoo, most famous as the voice of Mrs Singh Song on the Lotus FM drama series, has <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE">performed</EVENT> in a host of comedy shows, including the KWV Indian Comedy Tour, All Girls Jam, Stekkies Comedy Jam and Prof Gopauls Comedy show.

With her roots as an actress, she has <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE">perfected</EVENT> the art of comedy drama and will <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE">leave</EVENT> you in stitches with her role playing.

Lotus FMs breakfast jock, Pillay has, via his radio show, <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE">acquired</EVENT> a following both nationally and internationally.

An established comic on the local circuit, his comedic flair <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE">comes</EVENT> through strongly on his radio show, especially with his parodies, twisted tunes and prank calls.

On stage, with the mic in hand, Pillay relates Indian stories in hilarious fashion.

And the glue that binds the entire show together will be the enigmatic and charismatic Karou Charou.

With his zany costumes, dark glasses, bling and uniquely refreshing and interactive style, Charou is always a crowd pleaser.

The show <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE">takes</EVENT> place in the Mardi Gras Theatre at 3pm. Instagram
