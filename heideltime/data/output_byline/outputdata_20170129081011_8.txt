It's finally here! The Year of the Rooster begins on <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>. Even though it is traditionally an unfortunate year for people born of the celebrated animal year, I'm excited to be a Rooster! I have a feeling in my Rooster belly that this is going to be a great year. I've been practicing my feng shui, cleaning my home, stocking up on my Rooster element — soft metals — and most importantly, being consistently hard working and positive. 
 
Just like the Gregorian calendar folks have some fun and sometimes silly traditions to bring in a great new year, so do those that celebrate the changing of the lunar calendar, or what many people around the world refer to as "Chinese New Year" (Even though it spreads well beyond the borders of The People's Republic of China). 
 
Each lunar year begins somewhere between the internationally recognized dates of <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2017-01-21">Jan. 21</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2016-02-20">Feb. 20</TIMEX3>, much like Mardi Gras season is positioned between Twelfth Night and <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017-03-01">Ash Wednesday</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="SET" value="P1Y" quant="EACH">each year</TIMEX3>. 
 
My mom, Lillie Stack, and my aunt, Laura Oakes <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> attended a celebration in preparation for the new year in Honolulu, Hawaii, an area rich in Asian culture. They were greeted by dragons being fed dollar bills to ensure a prosperous year, elaborately painted red signs wishing happiness and wealth, and of course, roosters!

But the spirit of celebration and preparation for the new year go beyond a fun parade. Tradition brings family, happiness, wealth, health, food and fun all together to ensure we are prepared for what lies ahead. So put on some red undies (very lucky!) and give this beloved holiday a try.

The most important thing is, of course, food! Having a large meal with extending family on <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2016-12-31">New Year's Eve</TIMEX3>, referred to as "Reunion Dinner," is very important to keep the family bond tight and tummies full in the <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="FUTURE_REF">coming year</TIMEX3>. But no crashing at mom and dad's house that night if you are already married, it is said to bring bad fortune to the parents. 
 
Next, be generous. It's like <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2017-12-25">Christmas</TIMEX3>, gift and money giving is in full swing the week leading up to the new year. But never give sharp objects, which "cut ties" to that person; white or black objects, which are reserved for funerals; mirrors, as they attract unfriendly spirits; or shoes, clocks, handkerchiefs, cut flowers or umbrellas, because the words sound similar to things like "funeral," "evil" and "breakup" in most Chinese dialects. 
 
As for money, crisp brand new bills in even numbers, other than the number 4 — which sounds too close to the word "death" — are given in decorated red paper envelopes to signify wealth and generosity. The most lucky amount to give or receive? $88, which is supposed to be twice as lucky as the number 8.

For cleanliness, it's important to have a fresh, clean home and take the trash out before the new year hits. Any cleaning or de-cluttering done the first <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DURATION" value="P2D">two days</TIMEX3> (some go as far as waiting <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DURATION" value="P1W">a week</TIMEX3>) of the new year might be tossing out any good luck the new year has bestowed. The same goes for washing or cutting hair, just wait <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> or two to prevent shedding of any good luck.

The week leading up to the new year is also said to be the best time to change jobs or start a new hobby. Just like the saying goes, "out with the old, in with new." This practice can really help us make a decision we might have been on the fence about. 
  
Also, spoil the children! Crying during the New Year's celebration can bring sorrow in <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2018">the following year</TIMEX3>. And maybe go ahead and spoil your significant other as well, it sure can't hurt. 
 
Praying and paying respects to our ancestors during the celebration is a great way to solidify a spiritual bond in the <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="FUTURE_REF">coming year</TIMEX3>, just like a New Year's resolution for the soul. 
 
So if you're if you're looking for something fun and beneficial to do in <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="2017-12-26">the following days</TIMEX3>, try practicing these traditions to set up for a fantastic Year of the Rooster. “Xīnnián kuàilè!” (Wishing you happiness for the New Year!)
