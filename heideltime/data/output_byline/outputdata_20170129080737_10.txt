SUMTER COUNTY, SC (WIS) - 

A teen charged in a deadly shooting in Sumter County while he was out on bond for a separate attempted murder case will remain in jail.

A Sumter County magistrate did not set bond for Rhythm Sharmell Portee, 17, at his hearing. Investigators say Bethea was shot in the chest as he and Portee played a game with a gun. 

Because of the nature of the charge, Portee will be held in the Sumter-Lee Regional Detention Center until he can appear before a circuit court judge, which the Sumter County Sheriff's Office says will be in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-03">March</TIMEX3>. 

At the time of the shooting, Portee had been out on bond for an attempted murder charge stemming from an incident in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2016-12">December</TIMEX3>. He is facing charges in adult court in both cases.
