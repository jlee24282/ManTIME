Debbie and Carrie were buried together at Forest Lawn Cemetery on <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2017-01-06">January 6</TIMEX3>, where the ashes of the Star Wars actress were carried in an urn shaped like a Prozac pill. 

Carrie had spoken publicly about her battle with bipolar disorder and drug problems during her life. 

Following the funeral, Todd promised a “bigger service down the road for the public and all their other friends”. 

Explaining the choice of urn for his sister’s ashes, he added: “Carrie’s favourite possession was a giant Prozac pill that she bought <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">many years ago</TIMEX3> and she loved it and it was in her house. (Carrie’s daughter) Billie and I felt it was where she would want to be.
