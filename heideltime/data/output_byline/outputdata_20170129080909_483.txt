Donald Trump's team taking shape is the richest in US history, but has little political experience Not since the last series of Celebrity Apprentice <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2015">two years ago</TIMEX3> has Donald Trump’s hiring drawn quite so much attention.

The former reality television star has had to deal with the reality of moving into the Oval Office with the most skeletal presidential administration in decades. More than 4,000 political appointees are required to fill out an administration and about 1,200 require confirmation by the Senate. He is nowhere near reaching those figures in his first week.

At the top of the presidential pyramid is Trump’s inner circle of cabinet nominees and White House staff. They are a mix of wealthy outsiders from business, insiders from the Republican ranks, die-hard conservatives and former generals who were critical of Barack Obama’s administration.

The most important appointees to be signed off by the Senate are Trump’s 21-strong cabinet. So far, just three have been confirmed.

On <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-24">Tuesday</TIMEX3>, the Senate confirmed Nikki Haley as the next US ambassador to the United Nations on a vote of 96 to four. The two-term South Carolina governor has little foreign policy experience but she was sufficiently impressive in her meetings with senators, both privately and under the glare of the cameras in the committee rooms, that she sailed through the confirmation process.

Within hours of being inaugurated, Trump signed off on two retired generals to cabinet roles: James Mattis as defence secretary and John Kelly as homeland security. Kansas congressman and West Point graduate Mike Pompeo was confirmed as CIA director, though this job is not considered a cabinet-level role, according to the Centre for Presidential Transition.

<TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P7D">Seven days</TIMEX3> into Trump’s administration and just three cabinet picks; it is the slowest start of any president in modern political history. On their first days in office in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2001">2001</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2009">2009</TIMEX3> respectively, the Senate confirmed seven of George W Bush and Obama’s nominees. Trump, already behind schedule after his surprise victory, lagged behind badly in terms of vetting his own nominees. His choice of wealthy business figures complicated matters as they went through the security and ethics vetting process. The delay is in part political too. Democrats are taking revenge on Republicans over their refusal to vote on Obama’s last supreme court pick, Merrick Garland, and for applying the congressional brakes to other cabinet appointments during the last president’s years in office.

"What goes around comes around," Democratic senator Dianne Feinstein of California told Politico <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2016-12">last month</TIMEX3>.

Democrats, still smarting from Hillary Clinton’s loss and fearful of Trump’s plan to roll back the key legislative wins and executive actions of the Obama presidency, have been dragging their heels and scrutinising his cabinet picks even closer than normal and seeking more time for debate.

They can use parliamentary tactics to stall cabinet confirmations and force Republicans through hoops, though ultimately Trump’s party has the votes to confirm his cabinet if they do not hobble themselves during the hearings. Wealthy philanthropist Betsy DeVos for education, US congressman Tom Price for health and Scott Pruitt for the Environmental Protection Agency are enduring a tough ride.

Trump may have campaigned as the "blue-collar billionaire" and a champion of the angry masses with an anti-establishment message, but his cabinet could not be more different from the working and middle class voters of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin that propelled his rise.

"If there was ever a group of cabinet nominees that cry out for rigorous scrutiny, it’s this one," the Democratic minority leader, senator Chuck Schumer of New York, said <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2017-W03">last week</TIMEX3>.

"The president’s cabinet is a swamp cabinet full of billionaires and bankers that have conflicts of interest and ethical lapses as far as the eye can see."

Trump has amassed a cabinet and inner circle that is the richest in US history. Their combined fortunes are estimated to be worth $14 billion (€13 billion), according to CBS News.

DeVos comes from a family worth more than $5 billion; the commerce secretary nominee, investor Wilbur Ross, is worth $2.5 billion; wrestling mogul Linda McMahon has a family fortune of $1.2 billion. Despite ripping into Clinton for giving speeches to Goldman Sachs, two of Trump’s team are former executives of the bank, Steve Mnuchin and Steve Bannon.

"You don’t appoint a cabinet of billionaires to be taking on the establishment," senator Bernie Sanders, runner-up to Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination, said <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2016-12">last month</TIMEX3>.

There are just three women in the cabinet and minorities are poorly represented. Ben Carson, nominated for the department of housing and urban development, is the only African American. Elaine Chao, for transportation, and Haley are the only Asian-Americans and, for the first time since <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="198">the 1980s</TIMEX3>, there is no Hispanic cabinet member.

Nine cabinet members have previously held elective office. Three more have previously served in government, but only one, Chao, has experience running a full department. Seven come from the private sector and have no experience of serving in public office.

That matters little to Trump, who believes he has done his best hiring to date. "We have by far the highest IQ of any cabinet ever assembled," he said the day before his inauguration.

Describing himself as a "Christian, a conservative and a Republican – in that order", Pence was the ideal choice of running mate for the brash, thrice-married property mogul and television celebrity from Manhattan.

He used his connections on Capitol Hill and beyond to help build Trump’s team after his election victory. Rex Tillerson 

Secretary of state

Former chief executive, Exxon Mobil 

Tillerson (64), the Texas oilman and lifer at the world’s largest publicly quoted oil company, was a wildcard pick to be America’s top diplomat.

During a debate in his <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2012">2012</TIMEX3> run for the presidency he forgot the name of a department he promised to abolish as president in his famous "oops" gaffe. It was the department of energy. During his confirmation hearing, Perry, an oil industry supporter and a contestant on the <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3> series of Dancing with the Stars, said he regretted recommending its abolition.

The 65-year-old retired doctor and author endorsed Trump after ending his own presidential bid in <TIMEX3 tid="t37" type="DATE" value="2016-03">March 2016</TIMEX3>. He was raised by his mother in an impoverished neighbourhood of Detroit and is the only African-American in the cabinet. Carson, who regularly derides political correctness and government efforts to legislate racial equality, lambasted the government housing agency, which has a budget of $50 billion (¤47 billion), in <TIMEX3 tid="t40" type="DATE" value="2011">2011</TIMEX3> when it criticised a city in Iowa for discriminating against black tenants.

He went on to represent a district covering the Atlanta suburbs for <TIMEX3 tid="t43" type="DURATION" value="P12Y">12 years</TIMEX3>, climbing the ranks on Capitol Hill to become House budget committee chairman. A vociferous critic of the Obamacare healthcare plan, he was criticised during his confirmation hearing for buying shares in a medical device maker days before introducing legislation that would have benefited the company.

Betsy DeVos 

Secretary of education

Champion of charter schools, philanthropist, Republican donor 

The billionaire philanthropist (59) believes in privatising public education. The former chairwoman of the Michigan Republican Party and her family, who own the Amway business, have donated more than $200 million to the party. She was criticised for her shaky grasp of education issues during her confirmation hearing and for suggesting that guns should be allowed in certain schools to deal, for example, with the threat from grizzly bears in Wyoming.

Elaine Chao 

Secretary of transportation

Former US labour secretary 

Chao (63), the Taiwanese-American wife of the Republican Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, became the first Asian-American to hold a cabinet position when George W Bush appointed her labour secretary in <TIMEX3 tid="t44" type="DATE" value="2001">2001</TIMEX3>. She was the only member of his cabinet to serve for his entire presidency.

Nikki Haley* 

US ambassador to United Nations

Governor of South Carolina 

Haley’s confirmation as Trump’s envoy at the United Nations made her the first Indian-American to serve in the cabinet. The 45-year-old Republican became a household name when, as governor of South Carolina, she supported the removal of the Confederate flag, regarded as a symbol of racism, from the state-house grounds in her home state after the mass shooting at a historic African-American church in Charleston in <TIMEX3 tid="t45" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3>.

Andrew Puzder 

Secretary of labour

Chief executive, CKE Restaurants 

The executive behind the Hardee’s and Carl’s Jr fast food chains was hailed as a man with a "record of fighting for workers" by Trump, but the 66-year-old who will lead the government department that regulates wages has argued against a higher minimum wage and said that the Obama administration’s expansion of overtime pay diminishes opportunities for workers.

John Kelly* 

Secretary of homeland security

Retired US marine general, former commander of US southern command 

A native of Boston, Kelly (65) was a popular pick to lead the department that oversees border security. He shares views with Trump, clashing with the Obama administration on plans to close the Guantànamo Bay camp and criticising illegal immigration on the US-Mexico border. His son Robert, a marine lieutenant, was killed when he stepped on a land mine in Afghanistan in <TIMEX3 tid="t50" type="DATE" value="2010">2010</TIMEX3>.

Scott Pruitt 

Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency

Oklahoma attorney general, former state senator 

One of Trump’s most contentious cabinet picks, Pruitt (48) has repeatedly sued the agency that he has been asked to lead. He has close ties to the fossil fuel industry and has sought to undermine environmental regulations. He has said that there is a "debate" about climate change and clashed with senator Bernie Sanders during his confirmation hearing, suggesting that humans may contribute to climate change "in some manner" rather than being the cause of climate change.

Mick Mulvaney 

Director of office of management and budget

US congressman from South Carolina 

A staunch fiscal conservative and budget hawk, Trump’s pick to run this powerful office in the executive branch of government was a founding member of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus. The Irish-American politician (49) was elected to represent South Carolina in the US Congress in the Tea Party wave of <TIMEX3 tid="t54" type="DATE" value="2010">2010</TIMEX3>. He faces tough questions at his confirmation hearing over his admission that he did not pay more than $15,000 in taxes for his triplets’ nanny. Linda McMahon Administrator of the Small Business Administration

Former chief executive of World Wrestling Entertainment 

McMahon (68), along with her husband Vincent, became rich from growing their professional wrestling operation from a regional business into an international corporation <TIMEX3 tid="t56" type="DURATION" value="P30Y" mod="MORE_THAN">over 30 years</TIMEX3>. She left the WWE in <TIMEX3 tid="t57" type="DATE" value="2009">2009</TIMEX3> to run unsuccessfully for the US Senate in Connecticut and was a big donor to both Trump’s campaign and his family’s scandal-prone charitable foundation.

Robert Lighthizer 

US trade representative

Former deputy US trade representative 

Lighthizer was picked by Trump from a blue-chip Washington law firm in a sign that his administration intends to take a hard line on China. A trade representative during the Reagan years, Lighthizer has accused China of unfair trade practices. His experience in trade litigation and policies for US corporations will help Trump in his plan to negotiate better trade deals.

David Shulkin 

Secretary of veterans affairs

Under secretary for health at the department of veterans affairs 

Shulkin (57), a physician who has <TIMEX3 tid="t59" type="DURATION" value="P30Y">30 years</TIMEX3> of experience running private hospitals, would be the first veterans affairs secretary who has not served in the military. He was unanimously confirmed for his post as undersecretary in charge of the Veterans Health Administration in <TIMEX3 tid="t62" type="DATE" value="2015-06">June 2015</TIMEX3>. This should put him in a strong position to be approved for this more senior role at a department plagued by mismanagement and malpractice over the treatment of military veterans.

Sonny Perdue 

Secretary of agriculture

Former Georgia governor 

Perdue (70) served two terms as governor of Georgia, from <TIMEX3 tid="t63" type="DATE" value="2003">2003</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t64" type="DATE" value="2011">2011</TIMEX3> and comes to Trump’s cabinet with strong agricultural credentials for his new role running a far-reaching agency with a budget of $150 billion. He grew up on a farm and has several agricultural-related businesses. He has described climate change as a "running joke" and the arguments of liberals concerned about the environment as "ridiculous and so obviously disconnected from reality".

White House appointments Reince Priebus Chief of staff

Chairman of Republican National Committee 

Trump tapped this top Republican Party apparatchik to bridge the gap between the property mogul’s insurgent camp of outsiders and the party faithful in Congress. Priebus (44), the former Republican national committee chairman, is close to fellow Wisconsin native Paul Ryan, the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the highest ranking Republican on Capitol Hill. Priebus is seen as an anchor of stability for the Trump ship in the stormy seas ahead.

Michael Flynn 

National security adviser

Former director of the Defence Intelligence Agency and retired army lieutenant general 

Flynn (58) was a senior intelligence official in Iraq and Afghanistan at the height of the US wars. He was fired by President Barack Obama in <TIMEX3 tid="t65" type="DATE" value="2014">2014</TIMEX3> over his pugnacious style and during the campaign has played an influential role informing Trump’s world view on the war on "radical Islamic terrorism". His ties to Russia have been investigated by the FBI in <TIMEX3 tid="t66" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent weeks</TIMEX3>.

Stephen Bannon 

Chief strategist

Former executive chairman of Breitbart News 

Bannon (63), another former Goldman Sachs executive in Trump’s inner circle, ran the right-wing Breitbart News website before joining the billionaire’s presidential campaign <TIMEX3 tid="t69" type="DATE" value="2016-SU">last summer</TIMEX3>. This combative operator has been responsible for guiding Trump on his hardline, nationalist and populist message. He has described the mainstream media as "the opposition party".

Donald McGahn 

White House counsel

Former member of the Federal Election Commission 

The Atlantic City-born campaign finance lawyer (48) was chief counsel for the National Republican Congressional Committee and was appointed to the Federal Election Commission in <TIMEX3 tid="t71" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3> by George W Bush. He was one of the earliest recruits to Trump’s presidential campaign, signing on in <TIMEX3 tid="t73" type="DATE" value="2015" mod="START">early 2015</TIMEX3>. He will have to navigate difficult legal terrain offering advice to the president on the extent of his executive authority and dealing with potential ethical issues. Kellyanne Conway 

Counsellor to the president

Former Trump campaign manager and senior adviser, pollster 

The former pollster (50) was promoted from senior adviser to be Trump’s campaign manager, his third in <TIMEX3 tid="t78" type="DURATION" value="P14M">14 months</TIMEX3>, in <TIMEX3 tid="t76" type="DATE" value="2016-08">August</TIMEX3>. She is credited for limiting his wayward rants and keeping him on message in the latter stages of the campaign. She became the first woman to lead a winning presidential campaign and was rewarded with a key position within Trump’s White House team.

Sean Spicer 

Press secretary

Former chief strategist and communications director, Republican National Committee 

Spicer (45) worked with Reince Priebus at the Republican National Committee and both joined Trump’s team after he secured the presidential nomination. In his first official briefing at the White House <TIMEX3 tid="t79" type="DATE" value="2017-01-21">last Saturday</TIMEX3>, Spicer, a proud Irish-American whose great-grandfather came from Co Cork, angrily accused the media of "deliberately false reporting" on the size of the crowd at the president’s inauguration. He has delivered steadier performances since then and will be the president’s most public defender over the coming <TIMEX3 tid="t81" type="DURATION" value="P4Y">four years</TIMEX3>. *Confirmed appointments
