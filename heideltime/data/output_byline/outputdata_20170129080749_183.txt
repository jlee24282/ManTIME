Rafael Nadal insisted his past Grand Slam wins against Roger Federer will have no bearing on their much-awaited showdown in the Australian Open final on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3>. Meanwhile Nadal is bidding to become the first man since <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="1968">1968</TIMEX3> to win each of the four major titles twice. But then Nadal began to dominate with his crushing forehand, and Federer  started to struggle. He clinched the match soon after in the tiebreak, winning his 14th consecutive final. 
 
But Federer is in the midst of a stunning resurgence and Nadal has slowed down a bit, so who will win this latest chapter in their historic rivalry? 
 
And Dimitrov, serving from behind in the fourth set, kept his composure into that stanza's tiebreak and was able to stay focused and play tactically ideal in the breaker to push the match into a deciding set. Playing two of the best back-to-back points he has likely ever contested, Nadal hit a stunning backhand up the line for a victor and then followed that up with a race to the net to put away a deft volley. 
 
The Australian Open may be the Grand Slam that American tennis audiences pay the least attention to, but <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017">this year</TIMEX3> something very special is going on down under. 
 
Federer , attempting to secure his 18th Grand Slam title, has not beaten 14-time major victor Nadal in the final of a Slam since Wimbledon in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2007">2007</TIMEX3>. 
 
Rafa Nadal returns a shot during his match against Milos Raonic at Melbourne Park, <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">yesterday</TIMEX3>. 
 
The Swiss took the fight to the Spaniard early, earning 10 break point chances over three consecutive Nadal service games. 
 
For Nadal, it's his second five set win of the tournament (the first over top teenager Alexander "Sascha" Zverev in the third round) after losing five-setters in his last three hardcourt majors. Making matters worse, Federer was also replaced by Nadal at the top of the rankings <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2017-02">a month later</TIMEX3> then suffered a back injury after winning the US Open. They have only met once previously in an Australian Open final, albeit back in <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2009">2009</TIMEX3>, and Federer won in five sets. 
 
At Wimbledon one more , despite dropping the first set, it was little sister Serena's title for the taking for the second year in a row, 4-6, 6-4, 6-2. 
 
A nervous Raonic, watching his serving rockets being fired back at him, appeared rattled by the tactic early in the match . 
 
Wawrinka said he had no concerns about Federer's timeout, adding that he didn't think it had any bearing on the outcome of the match . "That's one of the things that he improved a lot". "No one has ever beaten me as much as Venus has". In Grand Slam matches , he's 9-2 against Federer , including 3-0 at the Australian Open. He won the third set. Few could have imagined on that day that fans would have to wait this long for a major-final rematch on something other than Nadal's dominant surface of clay (a surface on which Nadal has probably been better than anyone else has ever been on any surface). 
 
Federer will be looking to extend his record haul of Grand Slam titles by claiming an 18th on <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3>, while Nadal can move ahead of Pete Sampras and take over second place outright in the history books if he claims a 15th major title. 
 
Federer looked like he would wrap up the match in straight sets and march into his 28th grand slam final - including six in Melbourne - when he was up by two sets and with Wawrinka walking off the court nearly in tears to have his knee strapped. Since that French Open final, they clashed in two Aussie Open semi-finals matches in <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2012">2012</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2014">2014</TIMEX3>, both of which were won by Nadal. 
 
After the fourth set, Federer took a cue from his countryman and did something odd for a guy who notoriously speeds matches along: He took a medical timeout to treat an adductor muscle injury in his leg.
