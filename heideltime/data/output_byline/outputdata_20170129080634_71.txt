CITY LIBRARY STAFF are set to turn the page on a new chapter in the history of the Carpenter Memorial Library <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-30">tomorrow</TIMEX3>, when the fruits of a <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P2W">two-week</TIMEX3> renovations and restoration project are revealed. 

Located at 405 Pine St., the Carpenter Memorial Library is the main branch of the Manchester City Library. The building was designed by Edward L. Tilton of New York and Edgar A. P. Newcomb of Honolulu, and dedicated on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="1914-11-18">November 18, 1914</TIMEX3>, to the memory of Elenora Blood Carpenter , the late wife of Frank Pierce Carpenter , president of the Amoskeag Paper Mill. 

The city's main library, <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> entering its 103rd year of service to Queen City residents, has been closed to the public since <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-01-16">Jan. 16</TIMEX3> while crews installed new flooring throughout all public areas on the 1st and 2nd floors of the structure, and new tiling put down in the Rotunda. 

Manchester City Library Director Denise M. van Zanten reports the building will reopen to patrons on <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017-01-23">Monday</TIMEX3>, after crews finished work on the main floor <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2017-01-26">last Thursday</TIMEX3>, and put all pieces of furniture back where they belong on <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3>. 

"We will have to restrict access to the second floor and the Rotunda at first," said van Zanten. "The new tile in the Rotunda requires the grout to set until <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2017-01-25">Wednesday</TIMEX3>, so we don't have any staining or damage to the installation." 

According to van Zanten, work on the second floor will be completed <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2017-W04" mod="END">later this week</TIMEX3>. 

"Library staff will have access to retrieve materials as needed for patrons from the Art and New Hampshire Rooms" while work continues, she said. 

As is sometimes the case with projects involving historic buildings, the renovation work uncovered a surprise equal to the twists appearing on the pages of the many mysteries stacked on its shelves. 

"One big surprise was finding original marble in the microfilm corner of the building," said van Zanten. "While tearing up the old carpeting in the Microfilm Reading Room workers made a very pleasant discovery. After the old carpet was removed and then a layer of battleship linoleum gone, workers discovered that the original marble flooring was still there, hidden away for ages and waiting to be enjoyed again." 

Why would someone cover marble flooring? The best guess, said van Zanten, is to reduce noise levels. 

"Back in the day, libraries were expected to be very quiet," she said. 

The marble flooring is going to be cleaned, restored and "brought back to its original glory," said van Zanten. 

According to van Zanten, flooring contractors worked with her to address areas of the building that had subfloor issues such as soft spots and holes, which led to them skim coat over a concrete sub base to create a clean and solid, level floor to install new carpet tiles over. 

"The Rotunda lost its <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="198">1980s</TIMEX3> terracotta look with new ceramic tiles installed in a color tone more historically accurate," said van Zanten. "A new pattern was put together by Tarra Caikauskas of the Facilities Division. The new pattern is a compilation of other patterns found in the original marble floors in the building." 

Work was also done to upgrade the electric service in the building and replace circuit breakers, "one of which was original," according to van Zanten. Staff also completed a full inventory of the main library's children's collection, and are working on a project to digitize photos with the Manchester Historic Association. 

An added bonus of the work at the Carpenter Library, said van Zanten, is the number of patrons who visited the West Manchester Branch Library, and saw the restoration work done there <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3>. 

"The usage of the branch has been impressive during <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DURATION" value="P2W">the two weeks</TIMEX3> the main library has been closed, and we are glad patrons have been able to see all the improvements there," said van Zanten. "We look forward to the public's reaction when we reopen the main library."

City school board members voted <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2017-W03">last week</TIMEX3> to ask Supt. of Schools Dr. Bolgen Vargas to send letters to state legislators in Concord expressing support for three bills that have been introduced in the <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> legislative session. 

The bills are: 

HB 155-FN: Relative to funding for kindergarten programs - This bill increases funding for pupils attending full - day kindergarten programs; 

HB 339: Relative to reimbursement of transportation costs for students attending a career and technical education.

and HB 525-FN: Relative to stabilization grants for education. This bill removes the annual 4 percent reduction in stabilization grants made to certain municipalities and provides that the stabilization grant to a municipality in fiscal year <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2018">2018</TIMEX3> shall be the same as in fiscal year <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3>.
