President Trump says that it is not safe to accept certain kinds of refugees without “extreme vetting” that he has yet to detail. So he has <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> banned people from seven countries, including Syria, which I fled with my family in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2014">2014</TIMEX3>. But we were thoroughly vetted before we came here, just like other refugees — exhaustively, endlessly vetted. We are not terrorists. And if we’d been stopped from coming here, we would be suffering horribly <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">right now</TIMEX3>. 
 
When our 7-day-old son died while receiving treatment for jaundice in a Damascus hospital, my husband and I decided to flee the country with our daughters. We ended up in a cramped apartment in Tripoli, Lebanon, where we soon spent our savings; we were living hand-to-mouth. 
 
After <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3>, I received a call from the United Nations asking if my family would like to resettle somewhere else. Based on our documents, stories and circumstances — our large family, five girls, my husband’s potential as a healthy worker — we had been deemed eligible to apply for refugee status. 
 
We could not return home to Syria. We could not continue living on the brink of starvation in Lebanon. A safe option was available: We began the application process to come to the United States. 
 
The process started with a series of meetings with U.S. government representatives — at least five in-person interviews with each of us and countless phone conversations. The questions were very detailed: about my family, my friends, how I spent my time. The interviewers often knew the answers to the questions before they asked them. They asked about my life going back to the day I was born; they even knew the location of the hospital. My story is my story, so I knew that the details would match their information. But I was stunned by the level of scrutiny and the length of the process. 
 
Each member of the family told their story, and those stories had to be consistent with interviews given by other people who knew us. If our answers didn’t match information U.S. officials already had, or if they couldn’t validate our information, we didn’t progress to the next step. 
 
Finally, <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="P1Y" mod="MORE_THAN">more than a year</TIMEX3> after we began applying and <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="P2Y" mod="MORE_THAN">more than two years</TIMEX3> after we fled Damascus, we were cleared in <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2014-12">December 2014</TIMEX3> to resettle in Baltimore. We had $30 for the journey. During an airport layover in Germany, I bought a drink and, without realizing it, spent a third of our savings on a $10 bottle of water. My husband joked that <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> we were really finished and should just turn back. 
 
We, too, have been appalled by the Islamic State’s terrorist attacks around the world, and we condemn them wholeheartedly. My family and I lived through horrific acts like these. I believe the screening we underwent was so intense, so thorough and so long that it would be impossible for militants to come here. 
 
Trump says he wants to fight terrorism, but instead he’s fighting the victims of terrorism. I want to ask him: If America is based on diverse people from different cultures and countries, what right do you have to tell suffering Muslims that they are unwelcome. Even your wife is an immigrant! Is it because she’s not from a Muslim country? 
 
With Trump’s policy, we are telling people who are dying: We can’t help you. Stay where you are, and die there.
