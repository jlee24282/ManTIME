"But here in England, my admiration for the bulk of talent in the academies has grown massively. I admire the attitude, the spirit and the values of young English footballers. They have an incredible desire.

"I have no worries about their motivation and I feel I actually have to slow them down rather than push them forward.

"There is a different culture here. The problem is that managers here wait a long time before they launch young players.

Everton are seventh in the Premier League, seven points adrift of the European places after 22 rounds.
