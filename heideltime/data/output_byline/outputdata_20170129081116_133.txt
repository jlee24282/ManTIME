NEW YORK - Lady Gaga is reportedly entertaining an unusual twist on her Super Bowl halftime show, which - though it's not confirmed - she could perform from the roof of the stadium. If that comes to pass, she won't be the only one making a big play for attention <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017">this year</TIMEX3>. 
 
Advertisers from first-timer 84 Lumber to veteran Hyundai are ramping up the marketing stunts in order to stand out from the crowd during the big game. Some will air live ads, or at least teasers for their campaigns; one will even shoot its commercial during the game. Others are deliberately courting controversy. 
 
Super Bowl LI, in which the Atlanta Falcons will take on the New England Patriots, is expected to be the biggest live TV event of the year. 
 
The war for attention 
 
<TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="SET" value="P1Y" quant="EVERY">Every year</TIMEX3>, more than 30 advertisers vie to create the most-remembered <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="PT30S">30</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="PT90S">90 seconds</TIMEX3> of the Super Bowl by stuffing commercials with celebrities, slapstick humor and cute animals. 
 
But <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> that so many ads get pre-released online or teased ahead of the game, advertisers have a harder time making a lasting impression. And with more than 110 million people expected to tune in on <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-02-05">Feb. 5</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="PT30S">30-second</TIMEX3> spots going for around $5 million, they need to scramble hard. 
 
So <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017">this year</TIMEX3>, marketers are turning to stunts. 
 
"It used to be, 'We need a Super Bowl spot.' Then, it was, 'We need a Super Bowl spot and program,' " said Mark DiMassimo, CEO of ad agency DiMassimo Goldstein in New York. "<TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3>, it's 'We need a Super Bowl stunt or event. It needs to be newsworthy, social and surprising - and it needs to be much bigger than <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="PT30S">30 seconds</TIMEX3>.' " 
 
Going live 
 
Snickers said <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2017-01-25">Wednesday</TIMEX3> it will air a live Super Bowl ad in <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2018-Q3">the third quarter</TIMEX3> starring Adam Driver ("Star Wars: The Force Awakens"). The Mars brand will also live-stream the set of the commercial for <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DURATION" value="PT36H">36 hours</TIMEX3> ahead of the spot. 
 
"The actual ad is only part of the equation," said Allison Miazga-Bedrick, a Snickers brand director, who promises "<TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DURATION" value="PT30H" mod="MORE_THAN">over 30 hours</TIMEX3> of original content" streamed live leading up to the game. 
 
Similarly, Wix - an Israeli website hosting service- turned to Facebook Live and YouTube Live on <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2017-01-17">Jan. 17</TIMEX3> to debut teasers for its Super Bowl ad. The teaser - which was prerecorded and only streamed live - starred Israeli actress and model Gal Gadot, who plays Wonder Woman in her own film <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2017" mod="END">later this year</TIMEX3>, and the English actor Jason Statham ("The Fast and the Furious"). 
 
The company said it's the first time a Super Bowl campaign has been launched live. 
 
Betting on rejection 
 
First-time Super Bowl advertiser 84 Lumber pulled a vintage ad stunt when the company went public with claims that Fox rejected its original ad because it was too "controversial." 
 
The Pennsylvania building materials supplier bought a <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DURATION" value="PT90S">90-second</TIMEX3> ad during the game - a huge commitment for a regional brand. But Amy Smiley, the company's director of marketing, said its first ad was rejected because some of its imagery, including a border wall that supposedly prevented people from working in the U.S., steered too close to political rhetoric about the Mexican border from President Donald Trump. 
 
Fox declined to comment, ensuring that 84 Lumber got plenty of press well ahead of the game. 
 
Shooting on the fly 
 
In perhaps the biggest gamble, Hyundai is teaming with director Peter Berg ("Deepwater Horizon") to actually film a <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DURATION" value="PT90S">90-second</TIMEX3> ad while the Super Bowl is underway. Hyundai said the ad will show "off the field" moments captured during the game, and will air right after the contest ends. 
 
Traditionally, ads that air before or after the Super Bowl itself aren't very successful at drawing eyeballs. But the on-the-fly aspect of this ad could make it hard to ignore. 
 
"The challenge for all of these companies is, 'How do you stand out?' " said Tim Calkins, a marketing professor at Northwestern University. "As a result, we're going to see <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2017">this year</TIMEX3> people try some very curious approaches." 
 
Dean Evans, Hyundai's chief marketing officer, said the shoot-during-the-game approach is all about buzz. 
 
"We wanted to test ourselves," Evans said. "We thought we would have to do it in a new and nontraditional way to really show the U.S. public that we're back in the game."
