On behalf of Alpha Sigma Chapter of ESA International, the members would like to thank The Grand Island Independent for the coverage that was given to us that contributed to the success of the <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3> Holiday Tour of Homes. It was very much appreciated and contributed to our success. 
 
We would also like to thank the home owners: Melodee Anderson, Jason and Teresa Zoellner, Dewayne and Rhonda Dymek, David and Amy Ostdiek, Damon and Stacy Shada and Cindy and Rick Lobeda for opening up their homes and sharing their <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-12-25">Christmas</TIMEX3> decor with all of our touring guests. It was very much appreciated. 
  
The chapter would also like to recognize the advertisers and the businesses who donated items for door prizes and raffle items. Without these funds and products coming in we would not be able to give the significant monies we derive from this event to our philanthropic projects. 
 
The Holiday Tour of Homes has become one of Grand Islandâ€™s premier events and is highly anticipated by women not only from Grand Island but from surrounding counties. We thank you very sincerely for your continued support. 
 
Joyce Cantrell 
 
Holiday Tour of Homes Chairman
