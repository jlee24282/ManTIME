On <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-26">Thursday</TIMEX3>, when the Colorado Buffaloes finally picked up their first Pac-12 Conference victory against Oregon State, junior George King noted publicly afterward that he and his fellow starters needed to start games with the same infectious enthusiasm that was displayed by the reserves-turned-starters that night. 
 
On <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> King and the rest of CU's starters did just that, setting an early tone by knocking down the Buffs' first four 3-point attempts while attacking No. 10-ranked Oregon with a defensive energy they maintained throughout a 74-65 victory. 
 
The result ended a school-record 17-game winning streak for Oregon. 
 
"They handled the lineup shift the other night like men," CU head coach Tad Boyle said. "I was really proud of them for that, both the starters and the reserves. Then <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29TNI">tonight</TIMEX3> we flipped it back and everybody responded to that as well." 
 
King started alongside Derrick White, Xavier Johnson, and Wesley Gordon — all three of whom had started every game this season before <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-01-26">Thursday</TIMEX3> — in addition to junior guard Dom Collier. 
 
While <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-01-26">Thursday</TIMEX3>'s dramatic shift in the lineup was conceived in part to send a message to a veteran group of starters that had carried the load through the first seven-game losing streak of Boyle's seven-season tenure, <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>'s return to form occurred with not only the regular starters playing with fresh inspiration, but with the reserves hitting the floor with renewed confidence. 
  
  
Freshman guards Deleon Brown and Bryce Peters combined for just two points off the bench, but they once again provided solid defense while protecting the ball (no turnovers in 19 combined minutes). And senior Josh Fortune, a starter for the first 16 games of the season, put together one of his more efficient performances of the season despite scoring only two points, as he contributed four rebounds, two assists, and a blocked shot in just <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="PT13M">13 minutes</TIMEX3>. 
 
"For a guy who has gone what he has gone through, starting the first 16 games and <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> he's come off the bench, he's handled it well," Boyle said. "He's not pouted and sulked and felt sorry for himself. He just tries to play as well as he can when he's in there, and I thought he gave us good minutes <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29TNI">tonight</TIMEX3>." 
 
Siewert surging 
 
For much of <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION" value="P2M">the past two months</TIMEX3>, freshman Lucas Siewert has looked as if he might have been better served taking a redshirt season <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2017">this year</TIMEX3>. 
 
Yet starting with his first starting nod on <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2017-01-26">Thursday</TIMEX3> against Oregon State and continuing in <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>'s upset victory against Oregon, Siewert has made his most meaningful contributions of the year. 
 
After going 3-for-3 on 3-pointers in his CU debut in the season opener, Siewert went 2-for-16 over the next 19 games before knocking down his lone 3-point attempt against Oregon State. Siewert also added five rebounds against the Beavers in his first career start, grabbing four of them at the offensive end. 
 
Siewert again provided a spark against Oregon, scoring five points in <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2017-H1">the first half</TIMEX3> and adding two rebounds, one assist, and no turnovers in <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DURATION" value="PT12M">12 minutes</TIMEX3>. Once again Siewert connected on his only 3-point attempt, and he also tallied the first two made free throws of his career after entering the game with an 0-for-2 mark. 
 
"Lucas has been practicing really well <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DURATION" value="P3W">the last three weeks</TIMEX3>," Boyle said. "I would say since we got back from <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2016-12-25">Christmas</TIMEX3>. He's really practiced well and started competing. He was terrific <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29TNI">tonight</TIMEX3>. 
 
"Lucas is just getting better and better and better. He's going to be a terrific player. I said that about both he and Bryce (Peters) and Deleon (Brown). Before it's all said and done they're going to have really good careers here at Colorado."
