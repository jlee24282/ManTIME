N.H. Historical Marker Number: 200. 
  
Date established: <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2006">2006</TIMEX3> in Easton. 
 

Location: Route 112, near Hummingbird Lane and Tunnel Brook Road. 
 

What the sign says: “In this area of Easton (formerly part of Landaff and before that, Lincoln), the settlement of Wildwood once stood. At the turn of <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="19">the 20th century</TIMEX3> Wildwood was a center for the ‘slash and run’ logging of Mt. Moosilauke. The Village included a school, a post office, several sawmills, a boardinghouse and a few homes. West of here was a dam used in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-SP">the spring</TIMEX3> drives that moved logs down the Wild Ammonoosuc River, from the mountains to southern New England mills. The last log drive on the river occurred in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="1911">1911</TIMEX3>. From <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="1933">1933</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="1937">1937</TIMEX3>, the first CCC camp authorized in NH was located at Wildwood.” 
 
The back story: In the 19th and <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="19" mod="START">early 20th centuries</TIMEX3>, Wildwood was one of many logging villages that were scattered throughout the White Mountains region. From there, loggers stripped much of the forest from the northern flanks of Mount Moosilauke. 
 

At a ceremony in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2006-06">June 2006</TIMEX3> to dedicate the marker, local and state officials were joined at the site of the lost village by Eunice Woods, who sponsored the marker. Woods spent her childhood summers in the old schoolhouse in Wildwood, which her grandfather purchased in <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="1927">1927</TIMEX3> as a <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2017-SU">summer</TIMEX3> vacation home.  
 
Woods, 84 at the time of the dedication, spoke at length about Wildwood and told stories of her family’s experience at the settlement. She recalled the woodsmen, who in their youth drove logs down the Wild Ammonoosuc to the Connecticut River, and in later years frequented her grandfather’s general store where they regaled listeners with tales of adventure and hardship on the river. 
 

The N.H. Division of Historical Resources called Woods perhaps the last living person to remember the settlement and the last link to its activity and the stories passed along to her by Wildwood’s old timers. 
 
In <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="1933">1933</TIMEX3>, Wildwood also became the site of the first Civilian Conservation Corps camp to be established in New Hampshire. The CCC was a Depression-era public work relief program that operated from <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="1933">1933</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="1942">1942</TIMEX3> in the United States
