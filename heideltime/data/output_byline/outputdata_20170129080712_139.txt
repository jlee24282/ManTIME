What’s the story?  
 
WWE UK Champion Tyler Bate made a surprise appearance in San Antonio <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-W04-WE">this weekend</TIMEX3>, working a match for <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-W05">next week</TIMEX3>'s NXT television tapings prior to a big NXT TakeOver live special on the WWE Network.  
 
In case you didn’t know... 
 
At only 19 years old, Tyler Bate became only the second star in history to win an official WWE Championship at such a young age, following in the footsteps of former tag team champion Rene Dupree. 
 
He became the inaugural UK Champion after winning a 16-man tournament <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-01" mod="START">earlier this month</TIMEX3>, working four matches in just <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="P2D">two days</TIMEX3> with hard fought victories over Tucker, Jordan Devlin, Wolfgang and Pete Dunne.  
 
Bate has been wrestling since <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2012">2012</TIMEX3> and has already made an impact in several of the biggest independent wrestling promotions in the UK. 
 
He is <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> one-half of the Progress Wrestling tag team champions, alongside veteran Trent Seven, and has made appearances for Chikara, WhatCulture Pro Wrestling, ICW, RevPro, New Japan, Preston City, CZW and more in his short career.  
 
The heart of the story 
 
19-year-old British wrestling sensation Tyler Bate made his debut with the WWE NXT brand <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">this Saturday</TIMEX3> in San Antonio, prior to the NXT TakeOver event. 
 
Bate is the <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> reigning and inaugural WWE UK Champion, a title he won in a gruelling <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DURATION" value="P2D">two-day</TIMEX3> affair <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2017-01" mod="START">earlier this month</TIMEX3>. Bate took on developmental star Oney Lorcan, also known to independent fans as Biff Busick, on NXT.  
 
Bate brought the UK title with him for the match, which will air <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2017-01-25">this Wednesday</TIMEX3> on the WWE Network. 
 
He wasn't the only UK star who came along for <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2017-W04-WE">this weekend</TIMEX3>'s TV tapings, as Scotland native Wolfgang – who Tyler eliminated in the semi-final round of the UK Championship Tournament – also worked a dark match prior to TakeOver.

What's next? 
 
At this point, it's unclear if Bate or Wolfgang will remain regulars on NXT television going forward, or if this was a one-off appearance for the UK stars. 
 
More importantly, there’s no indication yet on what the future holds for other tournament competitors such as Pete Dunne, Trent Seven and Jordan Devlin.  
 
Sportskeeda’s Take 
 
Hopefully, this leads to more opportunities for Bate, Wolfgang and others from the UK Championship Tournament. It'll be interesting to see the dynamic on the UK independent scene as more and more stars make appearances for WWE going forward.
