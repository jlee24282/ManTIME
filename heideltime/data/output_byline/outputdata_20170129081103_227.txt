(AFP) – President Donald Trump vowed  to improve floundering ties with Russia, while also reassuring close US allies he 
supports NATO. 
 
Trump faced a first legal defeat amid growing international alarm over his 
halt to refugees and travelers 
 
The temporary stay orders authorities to stop deporting dozens of refugees 
and other travelers who had been detained at US airports since Trump signed his 
measure <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="TIME" value="2017-01-27TAF">Friday afternoon</TIMEX3>. 
 
British Prime Minister Theresa <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2016-05">May</TIMEX3> indicated she does “not agree” with the 
restrictions, and will intervene if they affect UK nationals. 
 
French President Francois Hollande warned of the “economic and political 
consequences” of the American leader’s protectionist stance. 
The move sparked large protests at major airports across the country. At 
New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport, some of the 2,000 
demonstrators chanted “Let them in, let them in!”
