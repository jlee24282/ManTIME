The Bawku Central Member of Parliament (MP) says his narration about the alleged attempt to buy the approval of Energy Minister Boakye Agyarko was inherently “factual and absolute fact.” 

Mahama Ayariga dared the Minister to take whatever action he might deem fit, saying he would defend himself anywhere. 

He believes the facts he has put out in the public and actions taken to return the money are enough to acquit him in any court. 

“I am not sure any law court if it hears the evidence that I am giving and [if] my colleagues confirm” would deem the issue unworthy, he told Samson Lardy Ayenini, host of Joy FM/MultiTV's news analysis programme Newsfile <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>. 

Mr Ayariga has alleged on an Accra-based Radio Gold that he was told Mr Agyarko had offered GHC100,000 to the Appointments Committee. 

He said each member of the Committee was offered GHC3,000, but when they were told of the giver of the money the minority members returned it.

Mr Agyarko's approval together with Senior Minister, Yaw Osafo Maafo had earlier been scuttled by the NDC after some "inaccurate" information they provided the Committee.

They were requested to provide further information to support some claims they have made in the past. The alleged money was seen as an attempt to buy the approval of minority members on the Committee. 

Chairman of the Committee, Joseph Osei Owusu later revealed a different information. He told Parliament the legislator had withdrawn his claim at an in-camera meeting. 

Few minutes after his swearing as a minister by President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, the Mr Boakye said he might consider legal actions against the MP. 

Although he admitted that he never dealt with the Minister directly, Mr Ayariga said he gave facts about events he was part of. 

"I have recounted facts and actions taken and [what] I have witnesses," he said.
