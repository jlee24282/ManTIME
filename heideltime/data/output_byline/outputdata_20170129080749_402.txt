President Trump's executive order banning entry into the United States for people travelling from seven different Muslim-majority countries may impact Canadians with dual citizenship. 
 
"Diversity is our strength", he wrote , following up by posting photo of himself greeting a young Syrian refugee. 
 
At press time, Trudeau and his comments were the top trend on Facebook. 
 
However, Canadian carrier WestJet has already complied with the immigration ban and said that it would reimburse passengers who were affected by the new USA policy. 
 
"The fact that since 9/11, there have been over 750,000 refugees that have resettled in the United States, 50 per cent have been children". 
 
Trump's executive order, which prevents citizens of Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Syria, Yemen and Libya from entering the country in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P3M">the next three months</TIMEX3>, also banned refugees from Syria indefinitely, pending a review of the application process. During Mr. Trudeau's <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> cross-country tour, the chief complaint about immigration has been that refugees are not arriving as quickly as would-be sponsors would like.

But Kate Purchase, Trudeau's director of communications, said in an email that Trump's National Security Adviser Michael Flynn has given assurances that Canadian passports will be dealt with normally by American border officials. 
 
But Mr. Trudeau , like his predecessors' dealings with other presidents before him, has been careful not to criticize Mr. Trump or his administration. 
 
The federal government has been low-key in its response to the American ban. 
 
WestJet spokeswoman Lauren Stewart said the airline would give full refunds to anyone affected by the USA executive order. 
 
On <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>, Canadian airline WestJet said it would reimburse passengers prevented from traveling to the United States under the new policy. But WestJet, a major carrier with several flights to America, said that by <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TAF">Saturday afternoon</TIMEX3> it had turned away only one passenger.
