Bigg Boss 10 - <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01">January</TIMEX3> It is not just the Bigg Boss finale which feels like a déjà vu for its audience. Even an offer which might remind everyone of what happened with former contestant Kishwar Merchant in the last season. Remember how Kishwar quit the show during its Ticket to Finale taking Rs 15 lakhs? Something similar has happened this time too, but with a difference. So while Kishwar was forced to quit, Bigg Boss <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="191">10's</TIMEX3> most favourite aam aadmi, Manu Punjabi has left the show taking home Rs 10 lakhs. 
 
According to a report in Bollywood Life, like <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="SET" value="P1Y" quant="EVERY">every year</TIMEX3>, Bigg Boss offered all the four finalists - Manveer Gurjar, Manu Punjabi, Bani Judge and Lopamudra Raut, a sum of Rs 10 lakhs. This meant if anyone of them chose the money, they'll have to leave the show right away. And to the surprise of everyone, it was Manu who came forward and put his hands of the amount. Yes, according to inside sources, Manu has bargained the tenth season of Bigg Boss for Rs 10 lakhs. 
 
 © Provided by Screen Manu has always been one of the strongest contestants on the show from the very start. He was the one who kept the commoners hooked together, and gave a tough fight to the celebs. He was instrumental in the "M3" bond between Manveer, Mona Lisa and himself. While he was the toughest competitor in any task, he even won hearts due to his charming personality and the way he fought his personal loss during the show.

So why did he leave the show? We are reminded of the task where he had to ask for public votes against best friend Manveer. And we saw how Manveer won the task and the eventual Ticket to Finale, with a huge margin. That surely gave a jolt to Manu and showed him the clear picture that Manveer has much more following that him. Also, considering Bani has remained the most popular contestant on the show, and Lopamudra has a good following too, maybe he thought this was the right step to take, as chances of him winning the season looked bleak. Nevertheless, his decision might leave his fans disappointed, he isn't going home empty-handed. He has the big amount, the love of his followers, and face that has become quite know <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3>. It's definitely a win-win situation for Manu. Let the other three fight it out in the grand finale.
