Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal make their unexpected return as Grand Slam finalists in a classic Australian Open decider that nobody saw coming but which has sent tremors of excitement through the sport. 
 
Even the two combatants would never have predicted they would meet again in the Melbourne final, but the stars have aligned after the early exits of top seeds Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic.

Both players stand to make plenty of HISTORY in the final. 
 

At <TIMEX3 tid="t35" type="DURATION" value="P35Y">35 years</TIMEX3>, <TIMEX3 tid="t36" type="DURATION" value="P174D">174 days</TIMEX3> Federer can become the second oldest Grand Slam champion in the Open era, after Australia's Ken Rosewall. Meanwhile Nadal is bidding to become the first man since <TIMEX3 tid="t37" type="DATE" value="1968">1968</TIMEX3> to win each of the four major titles twice. 
 

It will be Federer's sixth Australian Open final and 28th Grand Slam decider in total, and caps a marvellous comeback after <TIMEX3 tid="t38" type="DATE" value="2018-H2">the second half</TIMEX3> of last season was ruined by a knee injury, with his ranking dipping to 17. 
 
    
<TIMEX3 tid="t40" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Jan 29, 2017</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t43" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29T13:27">1:27 pm</TIMEX3> (IST) 
  
The Mallorcan has spent well <TIMEX3 tid="t44" type="DURATION" value="PT5H" mod="MORE_THAN">over five hours</TIMEX3> more on court than Federer, and has one fewer day of rest before the final after his epic semi-final wrapped up in the early hours of <TIMEX3 tid="t42" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>. 
 

Yet Nadal has done it before in Melbourne in <TIMEX3 tid="t45" type="DATE" value="2009">2009</TIMEX3>, when he pounded out a longer five-set semi-final against Fernando Verdasco, and <TIMEX3 tid="t46" type="DATE" value="2017-01-30">two days later</TIMEX3> conquered Federer in the final -- in another five-setter. 
 

Perhaps significantly, in five out of <TIMEX3 tid="t49" type="DURATION" value="P9Y">the past nine years</TIMEX3>, the man who has played his semi-final second has gone on to win the final.

<TIMEX3 tid="t55" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Jan 29, 2017</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t63" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29T13:26">1:26 pm</TIMEX3> (IST) 
    
<TIMEX3 tid="t56" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Jan 29, 2017</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t64" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29T13:26">1:26 pm</TIMEX3> (IST)

Nadal appears to hold the edge over his great rival, at least on paper, with a 23-11 win-loss record against Federer, 6-2 in major finals and 3-0 at the Australian Open. 
 

But Nadal insists his past Grand Slam supremacy over Federer will have no bearing on the outcome. 
 
    
<TIMEX3 tid="t67" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Jan 29, 2017</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t69" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29T13:26">1:26 pm</TIMEX3> (IST) 
  
Federer, who also needed five sets to get past world number four and fellow Swiss Stan Wawrinka in the semis, spoke of the "magnitude" of his match against Nadal. 
 
    
<TIMEX3 tid="t74" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Jan 29, 2017</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t82" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29T13:25">1:25 pm</TIMEX3> (IST) 
    
<TIMEX3 tid="t75" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Jan 29, 2017</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t83" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29T13:25">1:25 pm</TIMEX3> (IST) 
    
<TIMEX3 tid="t76" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Jan 29, 2017</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t84" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29T13:25">1:25 pm</TIMEX3> (IST) 
    
<TIMEX3 tid="t77" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Jan 29, 2017</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t85" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29T13:25">1:25 pm</TIMEX3> (IST) 
  
"It is special to play with Roger in a final of a Grand Slam, I cannot lie,"  Nadal  said, after surviving a nailbiting, five-set semi-final with Grigor Dimitrov. 
 
    
<TIMEX3 tid="t87" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Jan 29, 2017</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t89" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29T13:24">1:24 pm</TIMEX3> (IST) 
  
Either Federer, 35, will expand his record haul of major singles titles with his 18th, or 30-year-old Nadal will close the gap on the Swiss legend by winning his 15th. 
 
    
<TIMEX3 tid="t93" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Jan 29, 2017</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t95" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29T13:24">1:24 pm</TIMEX3> (IST) 
  
It promises to be a final to savour between the two old warriors, who have both returned from injury to set up their 35th career meeting and ninth for a Grand Slam title. 
 
    
<TIMEX3 tid="t99" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Jan 29, 2017</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t105" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29T13:24">1:24 pm</TIMEX3> (IST)

Even the two combatants would never have predicted they would meet again in the Melbourne final, but the stars have aligned after the early exits of top seeds Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic.
