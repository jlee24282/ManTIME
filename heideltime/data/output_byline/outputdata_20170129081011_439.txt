By Nick Selbe  of Graphiq  |   Bing Predicts: Africa Cup of Nations   
In <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="1957">1957</TIMEX3>, three nations competed in the first-ever Africa Cup of Nations: Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia. The Egyptians defeated Ethiopia, 4-0, in that year's final, with Ad-Diba scoring all four goals. <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017">Sixty years later</TIMEX3>, 16 teams were selected to participate for the continent's highest honor. After play finished on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-01-25">Jan. 25</TIMEX3>, the field has been trimmed to eight, with the knockout stage set to begin on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>. 
 
As fans anticipate the start of these win-or-go-home matches, PointAfter , a sports data site powered by Graphiq , used data from Bing Predicts to analyze every remaining match and predict each winner. Bing Predicts uses web activity and social sentiment — in addition to historical player, team and match stats — to predict the outcome of soccer matches. Web and social data allow Bing Predicts to capture real-time information about lineup changes and reaction to them to tune the strengths of teams . 
 
Egypt, who has won more titles (seven) than any other nation, again appears to be the team to beat, though the path to glory won't be easy. <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017">This year</TIMEX3>'s quarterfinals begin on <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>, with Tunisia taking on Burkina Faso and Cameroon facing Senegal. 
 
In each match prediction, Bing assigns percentage amount signifying its level of confidence in each pick — the higher the percentage, the more confident Bing is in picking the winner. We'll run through each match, from the closest match to the most lopsided — until we have the entire tournament on the record ahead of the final on <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-02-05">Feb. 5</TIMEX3>, which will be played at Stade d'Angondjé in Libreville, Gabon.
