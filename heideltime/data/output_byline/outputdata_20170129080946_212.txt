Chargrilled steaks, chicken and sausages. Not your typical festive meal in England but on a street in the leafy Cheshire suburbs, it was the way Ramiro Funes Mori and his friends celebrated the <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> holiday season. 
The 25-year-old is 7,000 miles away from his home city in Argentina, but he still remains true to his traditions. He’s South American and proud. 

“On <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2016-12-24">Christmas Eve</TIMEX3> we went to Sergio Romero’s and then on New Year’s Eve we were at Sergio Aguero’s house,” he explains. “We had a <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2016-12-25">Christmas</TIMEX3> barbecue with all the lads. In Argentina, we like to eat meat a lot!” 

Those ‘lads’, as Funes puts it, are his compatriots, international teammates affiliated to various Premier League clubs across the region. There is an Argentinian hub in the north-west and, naturally, they all stick together. 

“We are all nearby and close to each other - Nicolas Otamendi lives two doors down from me,” Funes adds. “It was good for all our families to spend time together and celebrate. It felt like being at home - we played music, danced and enjoyed <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2016-12-25">Christmas</TIMEX3>. All the kids played, we ate and had a fun time.” 
The defender relaxes into his chair at USM Finch Farm. He is happy to talk about his background and heritage, a welcome change from conversation surrounding on-the-pitch matters. 

“Argentina is a nice country, the place I was born,” he continues. “Warm climate, sunny with nice weather. There’s good food, lots of tradition and fun to visit if you are from overseas. It is hard when you have to come to another country but it’s what I wanted - I wanted to play in Europe. 

“There are things I miss like friends and family. I actually miss our traditional Argentinian drink! It’s called maté and is made from herbs. You have it with boiling hot water. It’s a drink you share and have whilst you are sat speaking and socialising. Lots of people in Argentina enjoy it. There are some places in London which sell it but I bring it back when I go home.” 



Since his £10m switch to Everton from River Plate in <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2015-08">August 2015</TIMEX3>, Funes has become a mainstay in his national team. Regular call-ups, of course, provide the chance to journey back to his homeland several times <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3> and, indeed, the flurry of international breaks in the early part of the season meant he was involved in Argentina’s World Cup qualifying fixtures during <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2016-09">September</TIMEX3>, <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2016-10">October</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2016-11">November</TIMEX3>. 

“I’m used to the travelling <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3>,” he says. “It’s a long journey, <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DURATION" value="PT12H" mod="APPROX">about 12</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DURATION" value="PT14H">14 hours</TIMEX3> and I have to catch a connecting flight in Holland or Germany to get to Buenos Aires. Argentina players based in England, like Marcos Rojo, and others from around Europe will catch the same flights. Yes, it gets tiring but I don’t think of it like that. 

“My family travel with me, too. It’s good because my wife gets to see her relatives and my son can play with his little friends. I sometimes get the chance to see my parents but not always because they live on the other side of the country [in a city called Mendoza]. They have only had the chance to visit England once before, back in <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2017-03">March</TIMEX3>. I showed them around and took them to a nice Argentina restaurant in Liverpool called CAU. I like to go out and try new foods but it has been nice to find a restaurant from home.” 

Away from his day-to-day work, Funes Mori enjoys the comfort of spending his spare time venturing out in public places without too much attention. Yes, there will be the occasional autograph to sign and photo to pose for, but it’s a complete contrast to his previous way of life in Buenos Aires. 

The defender was one of River Plate’s highest-profile players, a hero amongst supporters largely thanks to his famous match-winning goal in their ’Classico’ win at the home of their cross-city rivals, Boca Juniors, in <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2014">2014</TIMEX3>. His last-minute header was a vital contribution as River reclaimed the domestic title for the first time in <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DURATION" value="P5Y">five years</TIMEX3>. 

“Over here I feel free,” he explains with honesty. “I like to go to the park with my child and wife. It’s nice to get out because not too many people recognise me. I like to go to the shopping mall, just stroll around and buy things. I’m a humble person. 

“If I walked around Buenos Aires, people would all want pictures. When I go back home to Argentina it’s different because there are a lot of River Plate fans so I hardly go out, maybe just to a restaurant to eat. It’s part of my job and it’s not that I don’t like it, but sometimes it feels a little bit irritating. It’s normal though - when people see someone famous they like to get pictures. I’m playing in the national team and because of that the whole country looks at you.” 

This is where the conversation turns to Lionel Messi. 

Funes Mori is sat in the media room at USM Finch Farm holding his mobile phone. Stored away in the contacts list on the device is the number of the Barcelona superstar. He grins, somewhat embarrassingly, at the suggestion that he is good pals with one of the most distinguishable sportsmen on the planet. 

“Lionel is an uncomplicated person but everything he says or does becomes public,” Funes reveals. “He goes anywhere and he is recognised. Some of the things he does in training are incredible. I don’t get the chance to speak to him too much because I’m a shy person.” 

Messi announced he was turning his back on international football in <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2016-06">June</TIMEX3> in the wake of Argentina’s Copa America final penalty shootout defeat to Chile, before reversing his decision <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="FUTURE_REF">a couple of months later</TIMEX3>. 


 
“It’s great that he came out of retirement because we need him a lot,” continues the defender. “It’s not just Argentina, football needs him because he is the best player in the world. 

“For the national team, we were disappointed because we wanted to be champions. We did our best to win the cup and, unfortunately, because of penalty kicks we couldn’t do that. That’s how football is. But, for me, the first time playing in a Copa America and reaching the final, it was an unbelievable experience.” 

Funes <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> has 18 senior caps to his name. The standard of his performances have drawn acclaim and, in <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2016-11">November</TIMEX3>, legendary defender Daniel Passarella, the man who skippered Argentina to World Cup glory in <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="1978">1978</TIMEX3>, insisted the Everton centre-back should be handed the captain’s armband for his country. 
A huge compliment from one of the most respected figures in the game but one that Funes plays down. 

“There are lots of captains before me; Messi and [Javier] Mascherano,” he declares. “I worked with Passarella at River Plate when he was the president. He was one of the best defenders in the world so to hear that from him is good. I accept his opinion and I really like it but I don’t consider myself as a captain.” 

The interview ends with a glance to the future. Once Funes has realised his ambitions in England, he is resolute in a desire to return to South America to end his professional career at the place it started. 

“When I go back to River Plate as one of the experienced players, maybe I would like to be the team’s captain,” he states. “I would like to retire in Argentina because I won a lot of important things with River Plate and I think that it would be good to go back there.”
