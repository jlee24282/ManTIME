New Delhi: For more than 10,000 domestic and foreign visitors who visit Mahatma Gandhiji’s Samadhi at Rajghat in the national capital <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EVERY">every day</TIMEX3>, there is nothing much to engage the visitors about his life and and thoughts other than the black stone platform that marks the spot where Gandhiji was cremated. To address this deficiency and to enhance the engaging experience of the visitors, the Rajghat Samadhi Samiti, under the Ministry of Urban Development has undertaken several initiatives during <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P2Y">the last two years</TIMEX3> and they will be inaugurated <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-30">tomorrow</TIMEX3> on the occasion of the 69th death anniversary of the Father of the Nation. These initiatives come <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P15Y">15 years</TIMEX3> after last such major improvement works at Rajghat. 
 
For the first time, a 157 word brief profile of Mahatma and a 131 word description of Gandhi Samadhi have been put on display, both in Hindi and English,  at all the three gates of Rajghat. 
 
The profile says Mahatma espoused “Truth, Non-violence, Sarvadharma Samabhava, Gram Swaraj, Trusteeship and Swadeshi which are the building blocks of a new social order free from all kinds of exploitation, discrimination and domination”.  Profile on Rajghat says “ The Samadhi reflects the simplicity of Father of Nation, Mahatma Gandhi’s life”. 
 
30 Amrit Vachans (eternally relevant thoughts of Gandhiji) have been engraved on marble and displayed on granite stone pedestals for inspiring the visitors to Rajghat. These include-“Innumerable are the names of God; but if a choice were to be made of one, it would be Sat or Satya, that is Truth. Hence, verily Truth is God”, “He who is unable to rule over self, can never really succeed in ruling over others” and “He who is truly clean within, can not remain unclean without”.  These pedestals have been designed to merge with the ambience and architecture of Rajghat and each pedestal illuniated by LED light atop aesthetically designed light post. 
 
All the existing conventional lights at Rajghat Complex have been replaced by energy efficient and environment friendly LED lights and are placed atop 104 aesthetically designed poles replacing the old ones. These LED lights result in energy saving of 60,000 KWH <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="SET" value="XXXX">annually</TIMEX3>. Solar panels have been installed above roof tops and cycle shed at the parking area of Rajghat that will generate 52 KW of energy. 
 
For enhanced security and better monitoring of visitors, 27 CCTV cameras have been installed with a Central Control Room for monitoring.
