Amritsar, <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Jan 29</TIMEX3>: With the Punjab Assembly Elections <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> just round the corner, Congress chief ministerial candidate Captain Amarinder Singh on <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3> took a dig at Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and termed him as a ‘sneaky little fellow’. He further said that Kejriwal is very ambitious but that’s not the ambition Punjab needs. Talking about Kejriwal’s win in 2014 polls, Amarinder said that is little wary of the Delhi Chief Minister as he can’t take him for granted considering his victory in the 2014 polls. The state will go to vote on <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2017-02-04">February 4 2017</TIMEX3>. 
 
Slamming the Akalis, Amarinder said they are total mismanagement, corruption, trade loss, farmers hanging themselves and the party it is a total collapse. “Badal too old to understand & is busy doing his sangat darshan; giving step mother treatment to state”, he added.

On being asked what if he loses, Congress CM candidate Captain Amarinder Singh was quoted by ANI saying he never fights an election that he doesn’t win. He further added saying that he loves using social media as he love ‘thinking’ and arguing if someone says something he don’t think is correct. He said, “<TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DURATION" value="P4W">4 weeks</TIMEX3> I want to break drug nexus. We know who does it, it is question of govt being willing to do it”. 
 
Recalling his decision of the <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2004">2004</TIMEX3> Water Act, he was quoted by ANI saying that the reason for disagreeing to the construction of Satluj Yamuna Link Canal (SARYU) or SYL would have brought back terrorism in the state. “Had I agreed to build the canal, I could guarantee that terrorism would have come back to Punjab. That is why I say that the Supreme Court does not understand what it is doing. You have to first decide what the quantum of water available to us is and whether Punjab has had done justice to it,” Singh told ANI. 
 
The Congress Chief Ministerial candidate has also warned that Punjab will face a crisis similar to the 80’s that saw the emergence of Khalistani movement. The movement being a Sikh nationalist movement demanded an independent state for Sikh people, if the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) comes to power in the state.  Singh expressed fear that if Arvind Kejriwal comes in to power, Punjab will again witness the unrest of the 80’s crisis which killed around 35,000 Punjabis. In an interview to ANI, Singh alleged that the AAP cadre is accepting the extremist ideology and is accepting money from separatists.
