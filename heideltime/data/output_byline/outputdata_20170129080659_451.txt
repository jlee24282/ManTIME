WEISER — Until Ridley’s Family Market completes the rebuilding of its permanent retail grocery store building at 652 E. First St., the company will be operating a temporary store in Weiser that is also centrally located. And it could be open as early as <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-W05">next week</TIMEX3>. 
   
Barely half a small city block from the established Ridley’s lot, the former King’s Department Store building at 650 State Street was due to be occupied soon by administrative staff from Weiser Memorial Hospital. However, on <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-20">Jan. 20</TIMEX3>, the day after the roof collapse at Ridley’s, Weiser Memorial Hospital Chief Executive Officer Steve Hale called a special meeting of the hospital district’s trustees, who decided to delay the hospital’s use of the State Street building so that Ridley’s could temporarily use that space instead. 
   
“It was decided that due to the greater need of the community, the hospital would allow Ridley’s to lease the entire space for an interim grocery store while their damaged grocery store is being rebuilt,” the hospital stated in a post on its Facebook page. 
   
Layna Hafer, the hospital’s community relations manager, said the hospital had leased half of the former King’s building to serve as new offices for billing and several other administrative departments, most of which are not <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> housed at Weiser Memorial’s main complex on East Fifth Street. Plans call for offices, located in two different buildings the hospital <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> leases, to all move into the State Street building. 
   
Hafer said remodeling of the interior space in the State Street building was nearly complete at the time of the Ridley’s roof collapse, and Ridley’s has agreed to restore that remodeling after the grocery store is through using the building. She said there’s “not a hard and fast time-line” for Ridley’s to move out and for the hospital offices to move in. 
   
Mark Ridley, director of operations for Ridley’s Family Market, expressed his appreciation for the Weiser Memorial Hospital. He said if it wasn’t for the hospital’s voluntary gesture, it would not be possible to provide the community with a local grocery store. 
   
Ridley adds that the temporary store could be open as early as <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-W05">next week</TIMEX3>. In the meantime, residents with a Weiser zip code can have their groceries delivered for free from the Ridley’s store in Middleton. 
   
People can do that through an online shopping service that comes with a minimum purchase. But this is only temporary. 
   
“Once our temporary location opens at the former King’s store, that service will stop,” Ridley said. 
   
As for products that were left in the store at the time of the collapse, none of it has been retrieved given that the building has not been deemed safe, according to Ridley. 
   
“The new store will be completely stocked with new product,” he said.
