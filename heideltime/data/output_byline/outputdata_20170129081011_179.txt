Arsenal have made it comfortably through to the last 16 of the FA Cup, following a 5-nil victory against League Cup finalists Southampton with Theo Walcott scoring a hat-trick to go with Danny Welbeckâ€™s <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-H1">first-half</TIMEX3> brace. 
 

 
Welbeck, starting for the first time since a knee injury in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2016-05">May</TIMEX3>, put the Gunners in control of the match with two neat finishes inside the first <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="PT22M">22 minutes</TIMEX3>. 
 

 
The 26-year-old striker then set up Walcott who gave Arsenal a 3-nil lead before halftime, with a simple close-range strike. 
 

 
The Gunners, with manager Arsene Wenger watching from the stands due to a touchline ban, kept pressing for more goals after the break, and it paid off as Walcott completed his treble to help his side outclass Southampton at St Mary's.
