Southampton Township, New Jersey — 
The Southampton Township Committee on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-17">Jan. 17</TIMEX3> acted on several items which were tabled at previous meetings and announced progress with a few ongoing matters of interest. 

A resolution authorizing a memorandum of agreement between Southampton Township and the Hampton Lakes Emergency Squad (EMS) was passed unanimously. 

The resolution was previously tabled by the committee on <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2016-12-20">Dec. 20</TIMEX3>. A contract between Southampton Township and the Hampton Lakes EMS expired on <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2016-12-31">Dec. 31</TIMEX3>. 

“We have reached an agreement with the emergency squad,” said Committeeman Michael Mikulski. “They will continue to provide services under the existing contract and under the existing terms until we have completed dotting the I’s and crossing the T’s.” 

The Hampton Lakes EMS continued to provide ambulance services to the township as contract negotiations continued, despite no legal requirement to do so. 

Mikulski said he anticipated that a new contract will take effect on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-02-01">Feb. 1</TIMEX3>. 

“The last drafts I saw, I think we have probably the 99 percent solution,” Mikulski said. “I expect it will be completely resolved before the end of the month.” 

The memorandum of agreement establishes legal responsibility in the interim for Hampton Lakes EMS to provide ambulance services to the township while negotiations continue. 

“This just exists until we get a new contract in place,” said Township Solicitor George M. Morris. 

It is unclear whether the committee will pass an ordinance or resolution authorizing the township to enter into a new contract with the Hampton Lakes EMS at a special budget meeting scheduled for <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-01-31">Jan. 31</TIMEX3> at <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="TIME" value="2017-01-31T18:30">6:30 p.m.</TIMEX3> Such action is required before a municipality can enter into a contract for emergency services. 

“We have had very good negotiations,” said Kit Applegate, an attorney who represents the Hampton Lakes Emergency Squad. “Both sides have negotiated in good faith. We have had frank conversations and we are almost there. We just got to dot the I’s and cross the T’s. I tip my hat to the township.” 

The committee also unanimously passed a resolution authorizing the township engineer to prepare and file paperwork to obtain permits from the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJ DEP). 

The township is seeking permits from the NJ DEP so that they can begin to repair a bulkhead and embankment next to the Vincentown and Tabernacle Telephone Company building. 

“This is the necessary first step to get approval to do the work that we want to do,” Mikulski said. 

The permits are expected to cost between $10,000 and $14,000. 

The building has served as the home to the Southampton Historical Society since <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="1976">1976</TIMEX3>. It has been closed for <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="P5M" mod="MORE_THAN">over five months</TIMEX3> after a code enforcement officer condemned it for usage. 

Township officials took the unusual precaution of closing the building due to the possibility that further erosion of the embankment next to the building will cause the bulkhead protecting it to fail with little or no advance notice. While the structure itself has <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> been determined to be sound by a structural engineer, the erosion of the embankment is creating a precarious situation. 

Officials theorize that the building could collapse into the creek should the bulkhead, which holds back the creek’s water, fail. 

The committee has debated several options for a permanent fix, taking into consideration that the building is within a flood plain and was damaged by floods in <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2004">2004</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2007">2007</TIMEX3>. 

The committee appears to have narrowed their options by passing this resolution. The first option they have discussed is to raise the building and repair the bulkhead. The second option they have discussed is to only repair the bulkhead. 

The committee was entertaining the possibility of moving the building to avoid bulkhead repairs and applying for permits. 

However, Mayor James F. Young, Sr. said that the bulkhead would still have to be repaired to safely conduct the move. He argued that moving the building would cost the township just as much money as making the repairs, if not more money. 

Township Administrator and Clerk Kathleen D. Hoffman said that negotiations with the neighboring property owner’s insurance company are continuing. 

The overall project is estimated to cost a little over $100,000. 

The committee also granted permission to Verizon Wireless to upgrade and enhance its wireless network in the township. A resolution providing Verizon with the authorization to conduct the upgrades and enhancements was previously tabled by the committee in <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2016-12">December</TIMEX3>. 

The mobile carrier plans to install mini-cellular antennas, known as mini-nodes, on existing utility poles. The technology is designed to fill in coverage gaps and accommodate spikes in cellular traffic. 

Each mini-node provides about 1,000 feet of enhanced coverage and/or capacity. In comparison, a cell tower provides miles of capacity. The mini-nodes will be placed in identified areas that would benefit the most customers. 

Downtown areas, developments, and sections of a street with a concentration of homes would be especially targeted for the devices. 

The company has specifically targeted rural communities in the state for this technology since the existing wireless coverage is spotty. 

Since most of the mini-nodes would be installed on existing utility poles, the technology would not be subject to the Pinelands Commission’s Comprehensive Management Plan provisions, unless new pole installation is required. 

Washington and Medford granted Verizon permission to install mini-nodes in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2017-12">December</TIMEX3>. 

The township will require the company to submit a $750.00 escrow fee. The company also must provide a list of device locations to the construction office on a <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="SET" value="XXXX-XX">monthly</TIMEX3> basis. 

The committee also announced that communication had improved with the New Jersey State Police (NJSP) Red Lion Barracks which provides police services to the township. 

During <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> committee meetings, officials said that the township was not being notified of burglaries, could not get the commanding officer to agree to put a speed trailer on thoroughfares with speeding issues, and was having trouble arranging a meeting with the barracks leadership to discuss concerns. Young said the agency was “shorthanded.” 

Deputy Mayor Bill Raftery said that he, Young, and Hoffman met with the commanding officers of the NSJP Red Lion Barracks on <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2017-01-13">Jan. 13</TIMEX3>. 

He said they met for the sole purpose of requesting their help to monitor the speeding and traffic activity on New Road, Ridge Road and some sections in the middle of Main Street. 

“We spoke to them about putting a speed trailer up,” Raftery said. “I think it was a very good conversation. They were very supportive of our efforts and requests. Hopefully you folks will be able to see some presence very shortly, if not already.” 

In other news, the committee introduced and read an ordinance which will amend sewer service and connection fees. 

“This is an ordinance amending the sewer connection fees and service fees for the Village (of Vincentown) sewer system. 

Officials did not provide any further details to the public during the meeting. 

After the meeting concluded, Hoffman said that the ordinance increases the fees. 

Hoffman would not elaborate on why a fee increase was necessary. She also could not provide the proposed figures as of press time. The Pine Barrens Tribune has filed an Open Public Records Act request to review the proposed ordinance. 

The committee agreed to allow the township participate in the county’s aerial application of larvicides for mosquito control for <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3>. 

The green light was also given for the township to apply for New Jersey Department of Transportation municipal aid. 

The committee would like to use the municipal aid to make improvements to Hawkins Road. 

“It is a heavily traveled road for school buses,” Hoffman said. “So, we think we have a good shot at getting it.” 

She said there is no guarantee that the township will be able to secure the aid. She said that the township will find out at the end of the year whether they have been given financial assistance for the road improvements. 

Additionally, 11 businesses were granted trailer or truck licenses. 

A resolution authorizing the township to enter into a shared service agreement with Waterford Township for use of a truck was tabled. 

During public comment, multiple residents complained about a New Road auto salvage yard owned by Allied Recycling Inc. who leases the property to Modern Day Recycling. 

Once again there were calls for the committee to act on their concerns about nighttime activity, speeding, flatbed trucks failing to stop at a four-way stop intersection, a pile of 25,000 scrap tires, soil contamination, and truck noise. 

“The day before <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2016-11-24">Thanksgiving</TIMEX3>, I was out early doing some shopping,” said Nancy Kolankiewicz, a resident who lives in the vicinity of New Road. “I get home at around 10 or 11 in the morning and I am coming off of Route 206 and I make the right at the traffic light onto Ridge Road. I come to the stop sign and I stopped. I am going to make a right and I see this very large tow truck and it was pulling an even longer and larger RV. This thing was a monstrosity and of course it was over the yellow lines. It was as far over as it could be. It looked like the entire siding had come off the RV because the siding was actually protruding (the other lane).” 

She said that she believed the RV was coming from the auto salvage yard. She added that the RV was hitting trees and knocking things down. She also said the situation is not getting any better. 

“The road is not wide enough and I hope it is on the list of things to look at,” Kolankiewicz said. 

Resident Pat Topham said she saw the same vehicle on Route 206. 

“He was coming from the circle and heading down Route 206,” she said. “Like she said, it was huge. It looked like a can opener had opened up the side. The awning was bent in the middle. It was flapping up and down. I was two cars behind it and there was stuff flying off of it. Some things looked like cardboard and some things looked like insulation. Just before I got up to the motorcycle shop, a very large window flew off the camper.” 

Topham provided a picture of the window laying on the highway to the committee. 

“He kind of pulled over a little bit and then he just kept on going,” she said. “Somebody could get hurt.” 

Township officials said that the auto salvage yard owners will be making court appearances on <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2017-01-24">Jan. 24</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">27</TIMEX3>. 

The first appearance is scheduled to be in municipal court. The second appearance is scheduled in Superior Court Assignment Judge Ronald E. Bookbinder’s courtroom. 

“Having some people, especially in Bookbinder’s courtroom, can’t hurt,” Mikulski said. 

Young said the committee was going to take one step at a time. 



A contract between Southampton Township and the Hampton Lakes EMS expired on <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2016-12-31">Dec. 31</TIMEX3>. Under the terms of the contract, the township can extend the agreement for two additional <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">one year</TIMEX3> renewal terms. However, the committee did not take that action and was without a legally binding document until <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2017-01-17">Jan. 17</TIMEX3>. Photo Submitted.
