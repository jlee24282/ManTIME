St. Joesph, Mo. 
 
For a moment in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2016-H2">the second half</TIMEX3>, it looked as if the Missouri Western Men were going to pull of the unthinkable, upset the Number 1 team in the country. But Northwest flexed their muscles, and used a stout defensive effort in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2016-H2">the second half</TIMEX3> to beat the Griffons 74-58. 
 
"Defensively, we wore them down," Bearcats head coach Ben McCollum said of his teams defensive performance. "We just stuck with what we did, just did a little better. Over time, hopefully that happens where we wear teams down and were able to score enough to make a run yourself and that's what happened in that little stretch we had." 
 

"We can compete, but yet we're still a big step away. I'm not disappointed in how our mindset was coming in, I'm not disappointed in how we competed, I'm disappointed certainly in some of the execution," Griffons head coach Brett Weiberg said. 
 
Northwest (19-0, 11-0 MIAA) remains undefeated while the Griffons (7-13, 3-8 MIAA) are struggling to find a true identity. Northwest is back in action <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-01-26">Thursday</TIMEX3> 2/2 as they take on Lincoln University in Jefferson City. Missouri Western will hit the hardwood again on <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-01-26">Thursday</TIMEX3> as they travel to St. Charles for a date with Lindenwood. Both games are set for <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="TIME" value="2017-01-26T19:30">7:30 p.m.</TIMEX3> 
 
On the Women's side, Western was able to sweep their rivals from the North behind a strong defensive performance in <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2016-H2">the second half</TIMEX3> en route to a 78-57 win. 
 
Western forced Northwest in 30 turnovers in the game, while committing only 8 themselves. 
 
 "I was really pleased with our kids," Western head coach Rob Edmission said. " I thought defensively for the whole game we were pretty good, we just got in such severe foul trouble, it didn't allow us to stretch the game a little bit, be up one at half and their shooting 60 plus percent, I felt pretty good about that." 
 
 "Their kids that came in off the bench really did a great job keeping up their momentum and staying aggressive and keeping the pressure on us and we didn't do a good job of handling that," Northwest head man Buck Scheel said. "When you have 30 turnovers, that's pretty rough and you're not going to beat anybody playing like that." 
 
Missouri Western (15-5, 7-4 MIAA) is back in action <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2017-01-26">this Thursday</TIMEX3>, as they will travel to Lindenwood University. Meanwhile, Northwest (7-11. 2-9 MIAA) will also play on <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2017-01-26">Thursday</TIMEX3>, only they will play Lincoln in Jefferson City. Tip-off for both games is set for <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="TIME" value="2017-01-26T17:30">5:30 p.m.</TIMEX3>
