LISBON — Travis J. Riggs, 35, Monroeville Heights, Salineville, was sentenced to <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P2Y">two years</TIMEX3> in prison on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-26">Thursday</TIMEX3> in Columbiana County Common Pleas Court for several drug-related charges.

Riggs previously pleaded guilty to illegal conveyance of a drug of abuse onto the grounds of a detention facility, tampering with evidence and two counts of possession of drugs. Two other charges for possession of drug abuse instruments and possession of drug paraphernalia from the indictment will be dismissed. Riggs had cocaine and hydrocodone on <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-21">Jan. 21</TIMEX3>, which he tried to conceal from police.

Assistant County Prosecutor Ryan Weikart was requesting <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P2Y">the two-year</TIMEX3> sentence, citing Riggs’ lengthy criminal record dating back to juvenile court. He noted Riggs has been involved in other previous drug trafficking activities and has violated his probation in the past.

While requesting community control, Riggs told Judge Scott Washam he has not had much contact in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent years</TIMEX3> with his son, but the 10-year-old called him <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-W03" mod="APPROX">about a week ago</TIMEX3> stating his whole family had been killed in an auto accident and he wanted Riggs to come and get him. Riggs said he has never been given a chance at rehabilitating his drug addiction problems.

“I’m an addict,” 

Washam denied him the request.

Riggs was also sentenced on <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2017-01-26">Thursday</TIMEX3> in Columbiana County Municipal Court to <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DURATION" value="P120D">120 days</TIMEX3> in jail for resisting arrest and drug paraphernalia. Riggs had a syringe in his pants pocket after he fled on foot from police on <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2017-01-19">Jan. 19</TIMEX3>.
