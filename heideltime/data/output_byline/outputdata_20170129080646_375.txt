By <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Today</TIMEX3> there is talk of a Muslim registry and deportations and walls and bringing back torture. Bad signs, all of them. 
 
And I’m not even out of bed yet. The school bus won’t roll by for another hour. But in the few minutes that I’ve watched the morning news this is what they’re talking about. And it’s happening here, in this country’s capitol, in a city where I spent <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-W04-WE">this weekend</TIMEX3>, and all that keeps going through my head is, “What have we done?” 
 
I went to Washington, D.C. <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-W03-WE">last weekend</TIMEX3> with two friends from school. The three of us went to Orange County Community College together back in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="198" mod="END">the late '80s</TIMEX3>, a time when it seemed women had very little to complain about. I mean, we could go to college, we could vote and drive and play high school sports. There was even a woman, finally, on the Supreme Court. 
 
Of course, we had the benefit of timing. Women like Gloria Steinem and Betty Friedan and Bell Hooks had changed the landscape for us, and we were beneficiaries of their work and the work of generations before them. For me, being a girl was a breeze. 
 
It gets harder, of course, being a girl. Or, well, just being. The world is bigger than the OCCC campus, and the three of us – Bridget and Nicole and I – have collectively experienced many of the complications and conflicts that come with adulthood. And womanhood. 
 
So within days of Election Day, as soon as word of the Women’s <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2016-03">March</TIMEX3> was circulating on social media, Bridget booked us a room and we put in for days off from work and my Bella, who is 15, alerted her teachers that she’d be absent <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3> because we’d be heading to D.C. 
 
The <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2016-03">March</TIMEX3> has been mocked in some circles, that it was nothing more than a bunch of women who wanted to get out of the house. Or that we’re crybabies, upset that our candidate lost. Or that we’re spoiled, that we’ve forgotten just how good we have it here, that it could be a lot worse. And besides, who can even tell what the <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2017-03">March</TIMEX3> was about, every sign seemed to be about a different cause. 
 
And that’s true. I saw them. The signs were all over the place. My body my choice and black lives matter and Trump likes Nickelback and water is life and immigrants we get the job done and repeal misogyny and Resist and women in the sequel and love thy neighbor and build bridges not walls. There were rainbow flags and American flags and a Princess Leia was waving the flag of the Rebel Alliance. 
 
Why was I there? For all of it. I could carry any one of those. 
 
There was one sign, though, that I’ll remember above the rest. It was waved by a little girl with dark brown hair and she looked to be about 8. She was with her mom, who was wearing a knitted hat of Rastafarian colors. 
 
The little girl’s sign quoted Albus Dumbledore, and it said this: Happiness can be found in the darkest of times if one remembers to turn on the light. 
 
See? There are good signs these days, too.
