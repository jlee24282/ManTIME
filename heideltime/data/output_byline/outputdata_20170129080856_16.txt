When members of the Maryland State Firemen's Association plunged into the Chesapeake Bay <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3>, they weren't thinking about the cold, they were thinking about the cause. The team was part of <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3>'s Police, Fire & EMS, and Military Plunge. 
 
"No matter the temperature of the water, the warm feeling you feel inside supersedes that," explained Bruce Bouch, senior deputy state fire marshal and member of the Gamber & Community Fire Department. 
 
The Polar Bear Plunge holds multiple plunges over <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>, in addition to the <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P1D">24-hour</TIMEX3> Super Plunge. <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3> was dedicated to plunges for police officers, firefighters and emergency personnel. There are two public plunges <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>. 
 
Each participant must pledge at least $75, with Super Plungers aiming to raise $10,000. The money raised goes on to help Special Olympians by funding different competitions and activities, according to the Maryland Special Olympics . 
 
Bouch, who dons an embroidered fire safety cape for the event, said the plunge is "just another way to give back." <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017">This year</TIMEX3> is the sixth time he has participated. 
 
"Before you go in, you stand outside and acclimate to the air temperature," Bouch said. "When you enter the water it doesn't seem as bad. When you get out of the water, that's when you feel the coldest but you're at the finish point and all you need to do is change into dry clothes." 
  
When participants enter the heated tent after the plunge and start high-fiving, Bouch said "you think about doing it again but then go 'nah.'" 
 
"I do applaud those that reach the <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="P1D">24-hour</TIMEX3> plunger level because they are doing so much good for this group of great individuals," Bouch said. "If you don't have the time or are that fearful of colder temperatures, you can always donate to the team and bolster our efforts." 
 
Gamber & Community Fire Company member Shawn Chenoweth, of Gamber, is also a member of the MSFA team. He has participated for <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P5Y">five years</TIMEX3>. 
  
"Special Olympics is a great cause and the money goes to support the athletes," Chenoweth said. "It's fun being with a group of friends and raising money for a good cause." 
 
Chenoweth said the plunge is "something that everybody should do at least once." 
 
Past president of the MSFA Johnie Roth, of Brookeville, also took the plunge. He has participated with his family for <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P7Y">seven years</TIMEX3> and his son, Eric, is a Special Olympian. 
 
"We've always been supportive of Special Olympics," Roth said. "When you have someone in your family, you put in an extra effort. <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2016">Last year</TIMEX3> we plunged twice." 
 
Roth said being on the beach with hundreds of people helps "psych yourself into it." 
 
"To see these kids and young adults giving everything they've got is inspiring. I get a kick out of cheering the kids on," Roth said. "It's all for the Special Olympians."
