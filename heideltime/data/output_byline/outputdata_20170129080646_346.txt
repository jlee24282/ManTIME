For what it is worth in pre-season games the DHL Stormers smashed the Toyota Cheetahs on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> in their first warm-up match in Harare 43-7. 
 
Over the years we have come used to not read too much into these pre-season matches and take it for what it is, coaches trying different options and game plans to shape up for the Super Rugby. 
 
The Stormers however set out from the start with De Allende scoring in the opening minutes of the math with Jaco Coetzee and Godlen Masimla who dotted down as the Stormers led 21-7 at the break. 
 
Stormers coach Robbie Fleck made a number of changes in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2016-H2">the second half</TIMEX3> but that did not stop the men from Cape Town to dominate the match and run in another four tries. 
 
The Cheetahs was unable to to score any points in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2018-H2">the second half</TIMEX3> with the Stormers taking the game. 
 
Although Fleck made a number of changes after the break, the Stormers continued to dominate as they ran in four more tries, with the Cheetahs remaining scoreless in the second stanza. 
 
The Stormers will have plenty of confidence heading into their upcoming warm-up matches against SWD in George on <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-02-04">4 February</TIMEX3> and the Lions at Newlands on <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-02-11">11 February</TIMEX3>.
