Carly Wijs’s <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3> Edinburgh fringe hit tells the story of the <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2004">2004</TIMEX3> Russian school siege with clear-eyed audacity Us/Them: hostages and captors; Russians and Chechens; children and adults; heroes on tractors and baddies with their foot on detonators; actors and audiences. In one of the most surprising productions of the year, Carly Wijs has written and directed a show about the Beslan school siege. It was created for Bronks, a Belgian theatre company specialising in work for young audiences. String marks the tripwires of the terrorists, and the tiny spaces in which the captives manoeuvre In <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2004">2004</TIMEX3>, Chechen terrorists held 1,200 people captive in a school in North Ossetia, Russia. After <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P3D">three days</TIMEX3>, during which some captives drank their own urine and ate flowers that had been brought in for teachers, 385 adults and children were dead. Footage from the siege shows people running half-naked towards safety, bodies on stretchers, gunfire, fear. But in Wijs’s production, Gytha Parmentier and Roman Van Houtven, playing two of the children, explain the events with the earnest concentration of kids recalling the rules of a particularly absorbing game. ‘Mercurial’: Gytha Parmentier and Roman Van Houtven in Us/Them. Photograph: www.fkph.net The stage looks like a playroom. Parmentier and Van Houtven chalk out the layout of the school on the floor. Facts are scrawled on the blackboard. String marks the tripwires of the terrorists, and the tiny spaces in which the captives manoeuvre: the entire stage is enclosed in a cat’s cradle. Balloons are burst, with the effect of explosions.

There are no tears, no screams. No cuteness. The gaze on what is happening is steady, though the pair’s movement is mercurial: they dance some feelings and actions, slipping under and over the wires. In the background, occasional bursts of sonorous Slavic music hint at reverberations on the outside. It is an impressive evening, evoking the effects of trauma rather than the causes of the siege. It was one of the hits of last year’s Edinburgh fringe. I wish I had seen it then, unprepared for its clear-eyed audacity: forewarning lessens the impact. •
