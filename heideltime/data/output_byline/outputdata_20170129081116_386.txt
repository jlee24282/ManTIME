PEORIA — A Peoria Town Hall meeting <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> was marked by widespread participation in a discussion about how to end violence in the city. 

The meeting was the first in a series planned to be held in every ZIP code in the city until <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2016-04">April</TIMEX3>. <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>'s meeting addressed crime and violence in the 61605 area, and how police and the community can work together to restore their trust in each other.

About 30 people were present and involved in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="PT2H">the two-hour</TIMEX3> afternoon discussion held at Carver Community Center.

Peoria Police Chief Jerry Mitchell spoke about the Residential Officer Program and said results already are having a positive impact in certain areas of town. An officer moves to a neighborhood where there is a high rate of crime with the purpose of "bringing that community back."

"If you have an officer in your neighborhood, in your block, it has a tendency to quiet down," Mitchell said.

According to Mitchell, Peoria police had noticed in the past a 19.8 percent crime reduction in a period of <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P3Y">three years</TIMEX3> since an officer has moved in to an area of high crime. Mitchell said the city could use 10 of its officers in the residential program — at the moment there are four — but because of budget restraints it may take <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="PXY">several years</TIMEX3> to actually put the plan into action.

Mitchell said community residents need to join the conversation and point out what their priorities are when the City Council gets into budget talks.

"Crime can remain the same, but community relations can improve," Mitchell said.

Rita Ali, chairwoman for the Advisory Committee on Police Community Relations, addressed residents' concerns about figuring out the root causes of crime in town.

"One major problem we identified was being the lack of trust between police and the community," Ali said. "Another was perception, and related to the perception of the south side and the East Bluff in terms of the reputation of those sides of town in Peoria, and possible oversurveillance of police in those areas, so you're likely to be ticketed more in some of those higher crime places."

Ernestine Jackson, a member of the Peoria Public Schools Board of Education, said people need to understand the importance of speaking up when they see something wrong.

"We cannot sit back, as a community, knowing certain things are happening near your garage and not saying anything and then getting sad because someone is dead, or somebody's been shot," Jackson said.

Mitchell and Ali agreed there is a need to address the whole community to be able to make those changes, and that goes beyond law enforcement's job.

"I can't educate your children, I am not a teacher," Mitchell said. "I can't create jobs, I can't create those opportunities. All we can do is foster that relationship to say that we're not out here to cause you any issue, we're here to give you direction. This is community-based."

"I've been tired of it," he said of violence in the city. "There is nobody here that goes to bed with bad news and wakes up with more bad news than me, but it needs to come from the community, or we will not succeed. There has to be opportunity, education, awareness, jobs. Otherwise, we’re going to be talking about this for <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="PXY">several years</TIMEX3>."

Ali suggested that another meeting for the 61605 ZIP code was needed. It was tentatively set for <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2016-02-25">Feb. 25</TIMEX3>, although the date and location are yet to be confirmed.
