Admitting he is little wary of the Aam Aadmi Party in Punjab assembly election, Congress chief ministerial candidate Captain Amarinder Singh has said they can't take Arvind Kejriwal for granted. 
 
"Kejriwal is a sneaky little fellow but I am little wary of him as we can't take him for granted considering 2014 polls," Singh told ANI. He said there was resentment and so people thought of a new party - AAP. 
 
"Kejriwal is very ambitious but that's not the ambition Punjab needs," he said claiming that the performance of the Delhi CM is coming down which will show in the upcoming election. "He knows nothing about Punjab. He just considers Punjab as a stepping stone he wants to jump from a union territory to a major state," Singh said against Kejriwal.

AKALIS GIVING STEP-MOTHERLY TREATMENT 
 
Expressing confidence of forming the next government in Punjab, Singh has accused the Shiromani Akali Dal of providing step-motherly treatment to the state. "Akalis are total mismanagement, corruption, trade loss, farmers hanging themselves; it is a total collapse...Badal too old to understand and is busy doing his 'sangat darshan'; giving step mother treatment to state," Captain said. 
 
He also promised to break the drug nexus in the state in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P1M">a month</TIMEX3> if voted to power. "<TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P4W">Four weeks</TIMEX3> I want to break drug nexus. We know who does it, it is question of government being willing to do it," Singh said. 
 
On being asked what if he loses, he quipped: "I never fight an election that I don't win".
