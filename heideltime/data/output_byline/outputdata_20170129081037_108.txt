A GOOD turnout is hoped for at public consultation into Chiddingfold’s Neighbourhood Plan, being held <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P2D" mod="MORE_THAN">over two days</TIMEX3> in the village hall at <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01" mod="END">the end of this month</TIMEX3>. 
 
“We <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> hired Nexus Planning, a firm of consultants, to help us progress our plan as it had rather stalled,” parish council chairman Richard Hogsflesh told The Herald. 
 
“The idea of the consultation is to update villagers as to where we are with the plan and in particular to get feedback about where we should put the 100 houses we need to build <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P16Y" mod="MORE_THAN">over the next 16 years</TIMEX3>. 
 
“We are also keen to find out what people think about recreation in the village as we need to make some decisions about how best to use the various sites we have. 
 
“We are also taking the opportunity to find out whether people would support a campaign to have average speed cameras installed in the village. 
 
“We know that speeding traffic is a hot topic for many people so it will be interesting to see if this idea is one everyone likes.” 
 
The consultation takes place from 4-<TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="TIME" value="XXXX-XX-XXT21:00">9pm</TIMEX3> on <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday, January 27</TIMEX3>, and <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="TIME" value="2017-01-27T10:00">10am</TIMEX3>-<TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="TIME" value="2017-01-27T17:00">5pm</TIMEX3> on <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday, January 28</TIMEX3>.
