A lot has been said about the dye-pits of Kofar Mata in the ancient city of Kano. In this report, EJURA ADAMA who visited the sites and interacted with the men behind the age long trade of dyeing, reports on the spectacular nature of the dye-pits.Beyond the traffic around Kofar Mata, Kano, in the hot afternoon sun, lie the dyeing pits of Kofar Mata.A first-time visitor would be disappointed to see almost no activity within the walls and no queues of customers stretching from within the walls to without it. Very disappointed, after all that have been written about it.It is hard to believe Kofar Matas dyeing pits are half-a-millennium-old.It must have been covered in dust and the smell of dyeing ingredients filling the air back then, but, in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="XXXX-XX-XX">this day</TIMEX3>, it boasts of interlocking tiles and finely cemented dye-pits.But it is not what is used to be; not anymore.Secretary of the place, Haruna Baba, knows this much, seeing that, seven generations before him, his forefather was the first person to have begun the art. This was back in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="1489">1489</TIMEX3>.My family was the first to initiate this art, which was introduced by my forefather,Mallam Muhammadu Dabbo Sani, who was the first to start the art in the world.He must have attended to many other first-comers and getting to explain a few valid, historical facts was no issue for him.Kofar Mata is the Hausa word which literally means womens gate. Back in the days, the entrance, he stated, pointing to the gate of the settlement, was manned by women warriors, who defended the place from external attacks. That was why it was named kofar Mata.These dying pits were dug in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="1498">1498</TIMEX3>, <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="1517" mod="MORE_THAN">over 500 years ago</TIMEX3>. Every man working here inherited this art from either his father, grandfather or some other person in his family.The compound has 144 dyeing pits, though they are rarely put to use at the same time. It has about 200 workers, both men and women, but the women make their designs from home, while the men only come to the compound to work, to dye the fabrics.Islam, as you know, does not allow the women work in public, he said.The ingredients and procedure for dyeing are as old as the place itself. Very little has changed since Harunas fore-father began the art.Dying begins with getting an empty pit which is filled with about 1,550 litres of water. When you pour this water in, add 40 buckets of ash (straight from firewood), before mixing it with water. After mixing, leave same for <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="P3D">three days</TIMEX3> before adding indigo to it.Indigo is a flower that grows like henna. The only difference is that indigo gives you blue colour while henna gives brown. You add 200kg of the indigo mixed with the ash and leave it for another <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="P3D">three days</TIMEX3>. After the sixth day, you get some potassium chloride note, this is not potash sold in the market, it is made here. Get four buckets of it, mix it with the ash and indigo and let it be for <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P3D">three days</TIMEX3>, making it <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P9D">nine days</TIMEX3> in all.After <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="P9D">nine days</TIMEX3>, you allow all the ingredients to ferment for a total of <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="P4W">four weeks</TIMEX3>. After <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION" value="P4W">the four weeks</TIMEX3> of fermentation, filter the solution which is <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> brown after the process and leave it. Get a local stirring machine and stir the solution <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EVERY">every day</TIMEX3> for <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DURATION" value="P7D">seven days</TIMEX3>.After <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DURATION" value="P6W">six weeks</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DURATION" value="P3D">three days</TIMEX3>, you can start making the colour. We have four colours mixed into the solution: light blue, navy blue, dark blue and blue-black. Dark blue takes <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DURATION" value="PT1H">an hour</TIMEX3> before it changes to light blue, navy blue takes <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DURATION" value="PT2H">two hours</TIMEX3> and blue-black takes <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DURATION" value="PT6H" mod="EQUAL_OR_LESS">up to six hours</TIMEX3>.By the time this last step is accomplished, it is ready for use. The prepared solution can be used for <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">one year</TIMEX3> before it is discarded to make way for a new one.You see this mixture which Baba (he points to an aged man who is working a pit) is using' It will be changed <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2017-01">this January</TIMEX3>, because it is useless and cannot effectively dye a fabric, although, it is used as a traditional cure for diseases like sickle cell anemia and certain skin conditions, he scoops some of the solution into his mouth, as he says this. This is because the solution is without chemicals; it is natural and pure.Mixing the colours for a dyeing pit is far from easy work, but it hardly translates into good pay for those who do the back-breaking job.BalaAdo, who has been working the pits in Kofar Mata since he turned 15, makes up to N500 to N700 <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> when business is bad (which is almost always). Introduced to the art by his father, some of Ados five children have begun to take more than a passing interest in the work in the pitsjust like their father did at their age.He wouldnt stand in the way of their pursuit of education, so he only orders them to the pit after they return from school. Ado, who gives visitors a tour of the place, leaves the work to his children when he has to attend to visitors. After all, it is the only source of income the family has.Ado is not the only one who does not expect any salary from the pits. Many of those who work here earn no salaries; instead, they earn their keep daily.The secretary of the place, Haruna Baba, told LEADERSHIP <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3> that everyone works for themselves. Look at that old man (he points to the oldest of the lot), he has people who work for him. When the work is much, he passes it on to them to get some of the work done. If you want him to dye your cloth, he has to charge you N500 per yard.In <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DURATION" value="P1M">a month</TIMEX3>, how much we make is dependent on the season. Our main customers come from Niger, Mali, Chad and other West African countries. During the rains, they cannot come, because of the nature of the water from the Futa Jallon. So, they come here during the dry season, right after the rains. When they come, business booms again, because they come with plenty orders; although, this has reduced due to Boko Haram insurgency.The people from Niger only wash their clothes once, before they bring them for washing in the dry season. However, it is more useful to the people of Niger because of the relative famine in the country, these dyed clothes still look their best, even without washing for <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DURATION" value="P8M">eight</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DURATION" value="P9M">nine months</TIMEX3>.These are the kind of times they pray for and they cant wait for these days to arrive.In <TIMEX3 tid="t35" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3>, when business is good, someone can make up to N15000 from one pit, he said.<TIMEX3 tid="t37" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Today</TIMEX3>, it might just be another historical enclave to the state government which may think it is just a tourists attraction <TIMEX3 tid="t38" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3>, but, for the people who work there, they need more government presence. They believe that, if the government cannot make the place more <TIMEX3 tid="t41" type="DATE" value="20">21st century</TIMEX3>-compliant, at least, it should make the place a skills acquisition centre.The government has never called on us to impart the skills on any one; the only people we have been called to teach anything are the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) membersbut that is only when they are in camp and need to know what we do here, Baba said.For some, it is shocking that the government would allow the place rot away the way it is doing. Many of those working in the pits <TIMEX3 tid="t42" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3> could remember tailing their fathers as children when the former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher visited and many were in their teens when the President of Sudan Al-Bashir and other ambassadors stopped by to see the famous pits.
