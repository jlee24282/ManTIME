Schoharie County Deputy Fire Coordinator Greg Baxter said it took <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DURATION" value="PT4H" mod="APPROX">about four hours</TIMEX3> to get the fire under control because of the thickness of the roof.  
 
"The firemen were having difficulty with ventilating the roof because it had two roofs on it," Baxter said. "It had a metal roof with a shingle roof underneath it. We had to call in two ladder companies just to get the tin off the roof to extinguish the fire. Getting to the seat of the fire gave them the hardest time." 
 
No police or fire officials were injured and the scene is under control. 
 
State fire officials are taking the lead in the investigation.
