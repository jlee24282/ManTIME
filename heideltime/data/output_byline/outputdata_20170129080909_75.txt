“No one could’ve predicted what Jimmy did or that he’d do that, that morning. I’m fortunate enough to still have my life and the support I have received is unheard of!!! I thank everyone involved in making this an easier time for everyone else involved, and my family.

“As for me, I still got some recovery time to do, and it’s all looking good ...

“Still in disbelief, the realism of it all has yet to fully sink in, stay strong Melbourne!”

Dimitrious “Jimmy” Gargasoulas allegedly knifed younger brother Angelo, who is gay, in the early hours of <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="TIME" value="2017-01-27TMO">Friday morning</TIMEX3> before setting off on a <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="PT12H">12-hour</TIMEX3> rampage through Melbourne.More: Thalia Hakin’s sweet, haunting note

The siblings were with their mother Emily in her public housing apartment in Windsor.

The alleged attack was labelled a “homophobic” incident after Gargasoulas posted a series of unhinged posts on Facebook describing himself as “god himself in a human bodily form” and denouncing gay people.
