WESTERLY — Working as a substitute teacher would be ideal for Angel-Lena Smith, of Westerly, a certified paraprofessional who is studying part time for her teaching certificate. 
 
“I would like to get into the district to have my name known — the ideal schedule would be <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P3D" mod="APPROX">about three days</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P1W">a week</TIMEX3>,” she said. “It’s all about networking, so by the time I’m finished with school to be a teacher, that way I’d already be in the district.” 
 
Smith, 30, was among a steady stream of applicants who attended the school district’s <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-WI">Winter</TIMEX3> Open House at the Westerly High School cafeteria <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>. The event served as a job fair for substitute positions as teachers, paraprofessionals, custodians, and bus drivers.

Kimberly Sihavong, director of human resources, said 81 people had registered for the event as of <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28T10:00">10 a.m.</TIMEX3> 
 
“I’m really impressed with the turnout — it’s the first time we’ve done this so I was a little nervous,” she said. “Westerly is facing a substitute shortage, which is kind of a nationwide problem, and with all the kids that graduate from college in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-12">December</TIMEX3>, there’s a ton of people looking for jobs and there’s not a lot of jobs because it’s mid-school year and this it gives them an opportunity to become employed, to find a home in the district.” 
 
In Rhode Island, substitute teaching requires a bachelor’s degree but no longer requires a substitute certificate. In Westerly, the substitute per diem rate is $80, which Sihavong said was “pretty average” since $70 to $100 per day is the range statewide. 
 
Sihavong said she didn’t <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> have any full-time teacher openings and wouldn’t know until <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2017-SP" mod="END">late spring</TIMEX3> how many positions would open up because of retirements and resignations. 
 
Substituting can be a good career choice for those looking to get their foot in the door to eventually get a job as a teacher, but it requires dedication and commitment, she said. 
 
“Subbing is like test-driving a car — every school district is different and it’s a good way for them to see if it’s a good place for them to end up permanently,” she said. She noted that good candidates “care about the community, they care about the kids, they want to become involved; they’re not just coming in, doing the work and leaving — they’re engaging with us.” 
 
For Harvey Blanchette, 36, of Westerly, substitute teaching would mesh well with his parenting duties and his desire to teach. 
 
“I saw the ad online and I thought it was kind of a nice opportunity and I’ve been thinking about getting into education for a really long time,” he said. “I’m a stay-at-home dad with a lot going on so it seems like a nice chance to test the waters” 
 
Working on a per diem basis would provide flexibility, he said. 
 
“I’m responsible for my daughters most of the time and I’d be able to find coverage pretty quickly,” he said. “It’s tough to have a full-time job because then you’re paying for day care for the entire span of time — working a couple days <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P1W">a week</TIMEX3> is more manageable.” 
 
Nicole Fortunato, 23, came all the way from her home in Ramsey, New Jersey, to apply for the open house. A <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3> graduate of Roger Williams University, she has worked for <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="P2Y">two years</TIMEX3> as a teaching assistant in New Jersey. 
 
“They emailed that they were having the open house and I thought it was a good networking opportunity,” she said. “I am trying to become an elementary school teacher and I want to come back to Rhode Island. I’ve been a teaching assistant for <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="P2Y">two years</TIMEX3> and I’m ready to teach on my own.” 
 
Westerly High School Principal Todd Grimes said he was pleased with the caliber of applicants at the event. 
 
“I didn’t know what to expect but I’ve had some really great conversations <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3> with some potential employees,” he said. Substitute teaching, he added, “is a challenging position — you need to have strong communication skills, be flexible and adaptable and work well with people because you never know what to expect and every assignment may be different.”
