Oskar Blues has signed a <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DURATION" value="P10Y">10-year</TIMEX3> lease in the historic, four-story DeGraff Building located at 118 N. Tejon St. in downtown Colorado Springs. Old Chicago Pizza & Taproom closed in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2016-07">July</TIMEX3> after <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P33Y">33 years</TIMEX3> at the location. 

Longmont - A Bunyan-sized can of beer rises above the high plains like a friendly silo from the beer dimension. The landmark is empty of suds, of course, but the restaurant at the base of the giant version of Oskar Blues Brewery's star-spangled flagship, Dale's Pale Ale, is packed with cars after lunch on a <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-01-25">Wednesday</TIMEX3>. Same goes for the Tasty Weasel taproom, set up in a corral at one side of the massive warehouse down the street, where a 50-barrel brewhouse and canning plant churns out 200,000 barrels <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3> of Colorado suds shipped nationwide. 
 
Founded by Dale Katechis in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="1997">1997</TIMEX3>, the indie brand credited with kicking off the nano-beer-in-cans trend is the second largest craft brewery in Colorado and No. 14 nationwide among those producing 6 million barrels or less <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="SET" value="XXXX">annually</TIMEX3>. 
 
It all began in a basement in nearby Lyons, and small-batch specialty offerings still are made in a tin brewhouse Katechis constructed there. Since <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3>, though, a facility on Pike Road has served as the main hub for the brewery and a growing ecosystem of brands and products that <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">today</TIMEX3> includes a collection of craft-dining spots, a soda line, Hotbox Roasters coffee and REEB Cycles (that's "beer" spelled backwards, in case you didn't notice). 
 
"We have coffee, we have a bike company the next building over. On the restaurant side we have the brewpub in Lyons; CyclHOPS, which is a mile and a half away, and Homemade Liquids and Solids and CHUBurger are less than a mile. It's like a little hub," said marketing director Chad Melis. "We make our own coffee, we make our beer, make our bikes. We make the stuff we like to do." 
 
In <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent months</TIMEX3>, the Oskar Blues world has begun expanding beyond the area where it was formed, first to Denver's River North neighborhood, where a CHUBurger and Hotbox Roasters <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> opened, and soon to downtown Colorado Springs, where the company will open a signature dining spot and taproom in remodeled space inside the DeGraff Building at 118 N. Tejon St. Construction is due to start in <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2016-02">February</TIMEX3> and a grand opening is expected in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2016-06">June</TIMEX3>. 
 
"We're so rooted in Colorado culture, and taking those little pieces of Colorado and going to other states has just been really super exciting, (but) I think everybody has the same buzz of being able to go to Colorado Springs," Melis said. "This feels like a great way to try to become part of the community." 
 
Expanding the brand 
 
The concept eatery and beer bar will occupy 15,000 square feet on two levels in space formerly home, for <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DURATION" value="P3DE" mod="MORE_THAN">more than three decades</TIMEX3>, to Old Chicago Pizza & Taproom. A lower- level entertainment grotto will have two bocce courts, a stage and private party lounge, said chef and Oskar Blues Fooderies partner Jason Rogers. 
 
"This is really our retail side of the brand when it comes to food and liquid and people," said Rogers. "When Dale started this business in Lyons <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="1997" mod="APPROX">almost 20 years ago</TIMEX3>, this is where it started, as a restaurant that became a brew pub then became a production brewery, and so forth." 
 
Taps will feature a fixed and rotating selection from craft breweries around the country as well as the full lineup of Oskar Blues favorites, such as Dale's, the top-selling pale ale in the state, and Beerito, <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> judged the "most interesting" regional American beer by tasters in a Wall Street Journal competition. 
 
At the company's Longmont headquarters, fans can learn more about the backstory and enjoy those brews in the belly of the beast. 
 
"A lot of brewery taprooms, it kind of feels like you're in a bar, but we wanted it to feel like you were in the brewery and were part of the process," said Melis. "You can hang out and watch the canning line. Typically if you come in you're sitting next to somebody who works here and can chat them up about the beer." 
 
Official brewery tours are at <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28T16:00">4 p.m.</TIMEX3> weekdays and hourly from 2 to <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="TIME" value="2017-01-27T17:00">5 p.m. Friday</TIMEX3> and weekends, but "if you come here, somebody will take you around," Melis said. 
 
Personal touch 
 
One lucky group of out-of-town visitors who arrived on <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> when the brewery was closed got a backlot tour with the director himself. 
 
"Dale was here on <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="2017-04-16">Easter Sunday</TIMEX3> and some people came and the place was closed. He met them in the parking lot and they said they drove here from Indiana hoping to get a tour, so he gave them a tour," Melis said. 
 
Behind the scenes, the recipes of 35 brewers are brought to liquid life and retail-ready form by machinery, conveyor belt and person-power (plus the occasional canine mascot), beneath colossal vessels and towering Jenga-stacks of empty cans bound for an automatic depalletizer and then a machine that fills and seals in suds at a rate of about 300 cans per minute. 
 
For a seasoned witness such as Melis, it's testament to the craft beer trajectory at home and at large. 
 
"It's grown quickly. When I started in Lyons a little <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DATE" value="2008" mod="LESS_THAN">less than nine years ago</TIMEX3>, the depalletizer was a 5-gallon bucket and a broomstick," said Melis, pausing for a long gaze at the machine <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> tasked with the job. "I love watching this. It's relaxing and almost mesmerizing in a strange way." 
 
At the next station, another growth ring for the evolving microbrewing industry. 
 
"Yo, Crowler Team! That's Don. He's our resident drummer, too," said Melis. 
 
For the as-yet uninitiated, a crowler is a 32-ounce aluminum vessel that more small breweries are embracing as a to-go option, in addition to - or in place of - growlers. Oskar Blues is the creator and sole distributor of the machine used for crowler canning-on-demand. It also coordinates resale of the brewery-bound containers manufactured by the Broomfield-based Ball Corp. 
 
Go anywhere and see a crowler machine? Thank Oskar Blues and resident CANministrator Jeremy Rudolph. 
 
"He saw this machine that was for canning garden vegetables, and figured we could retrofit them, and he knew that Ball had (32-ounce) cans overseas," Melis said. 
 
The tabletop technology is gaining an audience among brewers and drinkers as a sanitary, hermetically sealed way to take a company's tap offerings, in peace, into areas where glass containers aren't allowed. Its uses extend beyond the bar counter, too, to coffee packaging. It's also allowed the company's charity wing, CAN'd Aid, to send supplies of clean water to residents in areas suffering from natural and manmade disasters, including Flint, Mich. communities affected by an ongoing water crisis. 
 
"We're able to send canned water as a response mechanism almost on a dime. We've helped out here and all over the country," Melis said. "CAN'd Aid is a really important part of what we do at Oskar Blues."
