HOUSTON/NEW YORK: As with many industries <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> fretting over the uncertain future of U.S. trade policy, the oil business is sizing up the potential impact of the various protectionist measures being bandied about Washington - which have sent crude markets into a tizzy.The trade proposal with the most momentum may be the controversial tax reform, pushed by Republicans in Congress, that could slap a tax of up to 20 percent on all imports, including crude oil. That would spark a rise in fuel costs across the country that would hurt East and West Coast refiners more than those near the Gulf of Mexico. 
 
It would also hit the pocketbooks of drivers and airline passengers, as refiners pass on the nearly $30 billion that the tax could cost them <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="SET" value="P1Y" quant="EACH">each year</TIMEX3> on crude imports. 
 
"The consumer is really the one that suffers," Cynthia Warner, executive vice president for operations at refiner Tesoro Corp, said <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-01" mod="START">earlier this month</TIMEX3> at a conference in Houston. Tesoro operates seven refineries: two in California, two in North Dakota and one each in Utah, Alaska and Washington.The "border adjustment" tax could also redraw trade maps for global flows of crude and refined products. U.S. crude producers would be the obvious beneficiaries as their overseas rivals bear heavy taxes on imports, which are used often by coastal refiners, especially those without direct access to U.S. pipelines. 
 
Higher prices for domestic crude would make pumping from more U.S. fields economically viable - encouraging higher output from the shale patch and giving more momentum to a nascent recovery in the U.S. shale industry after a brutal international price war. 
 
While that likely would not put a big dent in the 7.9 million barrels per day (bpd) that the U.S. imports, Goldman Sachs estimates that U.S. oil exploration and production firms would benefit to the tune of $20 billion from higher domestic crude price and increased production. 
 
Crude markets have been buffeted by the public back-and-forth between President Donald Trump and the Republican party over various tax proposals. 
 
Contradictory signals from Trump sent the oil markets up and down in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent days</TIMEX3>. U.S. crude fell to its biggest discount to Brent crude in <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="P5M">five months</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2017-W03">last week</TIMEX3> after Trump appeared to poured cold water on the idea as "too complex". 
 
<TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2017-01-30">The next day</TIMEX3>, he said the tax would be discussed - and U.S. crude rose relative to Brent. 
 
Traders had speculated on the tax with an options bet that the value of U.S. crude would rise above the global Brent crude benchmark. Trump's comments caused volatility in trade of those options, which in turn impacted benchmark oil prices. 
 
Investment bank Goldman Sachs estimated in a report <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2017-W04">this week</TIMEX3> the border tax proposal had a 20 percent chance of passing. But White House chief of staff Reince Priebus seemed to move the President closer to supporting the border adjustment tax on <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2017-01-26">Thursday</TIMEX3>, in the context of discussing how to make Mexico pay for a security wall on U.S. border with Mexico, his signature campaign promise.Â  Asked if Trump favored a border adjustment tax, Priebus said such a tax would be "one way" of paying for the border wall. 
 
Border taxes are part of a broader tax reform plan that is being pushed by Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan as an alternative to a variety of protectionist trade policies discussed in a more ad hoc way by Trump.While Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on specific industries or countries in an effort to boost U.S. manufacturing, Ryan's border adjustment tax would tax all imports at 20 percent. Exports would be tax-free. That could add more than $30 billion to the annual import bill for U.S. refiners, assuming an oil price of $53 per barrel on the 7.9 million bpd of imports that fuel the world's largest economy. 
 
A steep rise in import costs would squeeze the margins of refiners dependent on foreign crude shipments such as Chevron and PBF Energy.But all refiners would see feedstock prices rise if the tax pushed up domestic crude prices - and it would, because there is not enough U.S. crude to meet demand. 
 
To cover the costs to refiners, retail gasoline prices would need to increase by 13 percent, or 30 cents a gallon, energy consultant Philip Verleger estimated in a report <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2016-12">last month</TIMEX3>. Diesel would rise by 11 percent, or 27 cents a gallon. was posted in Business of TheNews International - https://www.thenews.com.pk on <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">January 29, 2017</TIMEX3> and was last updated on <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">January 29, 2017</TIMEX3>.
