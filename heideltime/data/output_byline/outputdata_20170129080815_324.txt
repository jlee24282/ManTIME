Alicia Lewis knows warmth — she knows the feeling that comes when <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-WI">winter</TIMEX3> nights are spent under blankets. 
This <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-26">past Thursday</TIMEX3>, Lewis shared the feeling and shared the warmth. She dropped off 158 blankets to the Northeast Parent & Child Society’s thrift store at the State Street Presbyterian Church. 
 
Northeast clients who need help battling chills of the season can pick up a couple blankets for free. 
“There are lots that are brand new, others that are used but in excellent condition,” said Lewis, 60, who drove a loaded silver van into the church parking lot during the early afternoon. It only took <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="PTXM">a few minutes</TIMEX3> for volunteers to carry about 30 bags full of blankets into the “Shop on Park” store. 
 
Lewis has organized a blanket drive <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="SET" value="P1Y" quant="EVERY">every year</TIMEX3> since <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2010">2010</TIMEX3>. As a part-time cashier supervisor at the Niskayuna Co-Op food market on Nott Street in Niskayuna, she begins the campaign <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="SET" value="XXXX-10" quant="EVERY" freq="1M">every October</TIMEX3> and gets plenty of support from Co-Op shoppers. The drive ends <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="SET" value="P1Y" quant="EACH">each year</TIMEX3> on <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2017-12-31">Dec. 31</TIMEX3>. 
 
Lewis always picks a charity for the blanket bonanza. “I’ve given them to Safe House on Albany Street, for homeless teenagers, to Bethesda House on State Street, the City Mission, the Women’s Family Life Center, part of the City Mission, and Sojourn House,” she said. 
 
She appreciates the assorted food drives and coat drives, but thought a blanket drive would be a different way to help out the community — especially when many families with financial trouble cut costs by cutting down the heat in their homes. 
 
“I always thought that blankets are something you don’t have enough of,” she said. “Having an extra blanket here and there is helpful.” 
 
Lewis also liked the chance to help out Northeast, where she’s worked as a residential counselor in the group housing program for <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="P15Y">the past 15 years</TIMEX3>. 
 
The three-room “Shop on Park” store includes skirts, shirts, children’s boots, adult shoes, kitchen items, children’s clothing, board games and stuffed animals. It is open, at the church located at State and Catherine Street, <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="SET" value="XXXX-WXX-2" quant="EVERY" freq="1W">every Tuesday</TIMEX3>, <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2017-01-25">Wednesday</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2017-01-26">Thursday</TIMEX3> from <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="TIME" value="2017-01-26T09:00">9 a.m.</TIMEX3> until noon. Only clients from Northeast Parent and the Parsons Child and Family Center in Albany may shop — everything is free — in the store. 
 
“The need is constant,” said Eugene White, a spokesman for Northern Rivers, the parent organization for both Northeast and Parsons. “Our families, many of them, face poverty and struggle to meet basic needs.” 
 
White added that the store helps out about 300 families <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="SET" value="P1Y" quant="EACH">each year</TIMEX3>. <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Right now</TIMEX3>, store clerks are glad to have the Lewis blanket collection in stock. 
 
“I don’t think we have very many at all <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">right now</TIMEX3>,” said store clerk Robin Herrmann. 
 
Some of the new arrivals are decorated with flowers. There are models with stripes and solid colors. All are guaranteed to warm up people reading books or watching TV in the <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2016-02">February</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2016-03">March</TIMEX3> cold, and Lewis said she’ll begin her next drive during <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2017-FA" mod="START">early autumn</TIMEX3>. 
 
“I have to keep it going,” she said.
