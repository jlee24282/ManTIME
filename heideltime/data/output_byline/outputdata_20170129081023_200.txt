A late strike by Cameron Murray sealed all three points for Scarborough Athletic in their 2-1 win over Ossett Albion at Queensgate <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">yesterday</TIMEX3> (<TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">28 January</TIMEX3>.)

Jacob Hazel squeezed in the opener for the home side with a deflected effort on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="PT19M">19 minutes</TIMEX3>, but failed to take the jnitiative.

The visitors were effective on the counter, and levelled up the scores when James Eyles netted an equaliser midway through <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2016-H2">the second half</TIMEX3>, rounding Boro keeper Jordan Porter to net from close range.

It looked like it would end honours even but with <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="PT2M">two minutes</TIMEX3> to go Murray showed a turn of speed to break clear of the Unicorns defence and fire in the winner for the home side.
