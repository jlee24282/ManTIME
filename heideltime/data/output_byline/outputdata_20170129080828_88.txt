BRIDGEPORT — The frustration finally got to be too much for Fairfield to take. 
 
After a lackluster <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-H1">first half</TIMEX3> against Marist, a half where the Stags found themselves down double digits and playing like a team that was just going through the motions, a collective look in the mirror, along with some ‘mad-as-hell-and-not-going-to-take-it-anymore’ moments, ala the movie ‘Network,’ saw Fairfield put together a solid <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2016-H2">second half</TIMEX3>, turning a six-point halftime hole into a 72-62 win <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TAF">Saturday afternoon</TIMEX3> at the Webster Bank Arena . 
 
“I don’t know if it was anything that was said but I think we prepared ourselves differently coming into this game,” Stags coach Sydney Johnson said. “We re-committed ourselves to playing better team defense so it had to come out. It wasn’t great in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-H1">the first half</TIMEX3> (allowing 40 points) but it came together in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2016-H2">the second half</TIMEX3>.” 
 
After allowing Marist to shoot 48 percent in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-H1">the first half</TIMEX3> and shoot 16 free throws (making 15), Fairfield held the Red Foxes to just 31.3 percent shooting over the final <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="PT20M">20 minutes</TIMEX3>, pressuring them into missing all nine 3-point attempts and letting them score just 22 points. 
 
“We talked a lot about our defensive intensity going into <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2016-H2">the second half</TIMEX3>,” senior forward Amadou Sidibe said. “And that’s exactly what we did. We didn’t wait to get punched, we threw the first punch and we kept punching.” 
 
And those punches knocked the Red Foxes — still winless in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2010">10</TIMEX3> career tries at the Webster Bank Arena — back against the ropes and never allowed them to fight their way out of the corner. 
 
“It’s been a common thing, we’ve had big leads before,” Marist coach Mike Maker said. “And when things start going South for us, we cave in, it goes really fast. Some of that is youth and immaturity, we have a very young roster … we’re just not mentally tough. I just think they’re settling for less than they’re capable of.” 
 
In <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2017-H1">the first half</TIMEX3>, with Kristinn Palsson scoring 11 points and Isaiah Lamb adding 12, the Red Foxes used mini-runs of six points and seven points to take a 36-23 lead over Fairfield with 3:21 left. But the Stags put together a half-ending 11-4 burst, highlighted by a 3-pointer from Curtis Cobb with <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="PT6S">six seconds</TIMEX3> left after Thomas Nolan had stolen the inbounds pass with <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION" value="PT10S">10 seconds</TIMEX3> to play to get the Stags back in the game at 40-34. 
 
“We were getting some good shots but they weren’t falling so we knew we had to keep defending,” Cobb said. “We knew the shots would start falling in <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2018-H2">the second half</TIMEX3> and as long as we continued our defensive effort, we’d be OK.” 
 
Down 44-37 with 18:37 to go, Fairfield went on a 23-4 run <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DURATION" value="PT11M" mod="MORE_THAN">over the next 11 minutes</TIMEX3> as that Stags defense forced Marist to miss seven straight shots and eventually, 10 of 11 shots in taking a 60-48 lead with 7:30 left. The Red Foxes never got closer than six the rest of the way. 
 
Tyler Nelson led Fairfield with 21 points with Cobb’s 20 right behind. Jerry Johnson Jr. added 14 and Jonathan Kasibabu scored six points, grabbed nine rebounds and blocked four shots. Lamb finished with 14 to pace Marist with Brian Parker scoring 13. For Cobb, it was his first double-figure game in the last five for the sophomore guard. 
 
“I’ve been a little down with some nagging injuries … they were bothering me a bit but the guys kept pulling me up,” Cobb said. “They kept telling me to shoot and be aggressive so that’s what it was.” 
 
Saturday’s win was the start of a four-game home stand at the WBA — Manhattan on <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2017-01-24">Tuesday</TIMEX3>, Niagara on <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2017-01-26">Thursday</TIMEX3> and Quinnipiac on <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2016-02-06">Feb. 6</TIMEX3> — make or break time for the Stags to get back into the upper half of the MAAC standings. 
 
“We took <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DURATION" value="PXD">a couple of days</TIMEX3> off after Monmouth (a 91-49 loss on <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2017-01-22">January 22</TIMEX3>) and when we came back we said we were starting over and we’re getting back to what we do well,” Johnson said. “We’re focusing on the strengths of the team. It all kind of came together <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3>.”
