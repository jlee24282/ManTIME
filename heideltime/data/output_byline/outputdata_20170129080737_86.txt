New year, new you. New job? New business? 

While <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3> was the year of the unexpected superlatives with Leicester City, Brexit and Trump, <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> will be <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3> for businesses in Cornwall to drive growth and put all their woes behind them.

Sam's diner in Fowey.

It's been a good year for the American-style Cornish eatery company Sam's. The small business is expanding with a fourth restaurant at the Cornucopia Food and Drink visitor attraction in St Austell, which is expected to open later in <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3>.

No stranger to the county, with long-established and successful restaurants in Fowey, Polkerris, Truro and Carlyon Bay, this new site will again combine classic American dishes with the diversity and flavour that the Cornish larder has to offer. Emma Sixton, from Sam's, said: "We're harking back to our original American influences but with a modern Sam's twist. We're really excited to be able to move forward with our plans for this site and enable more food lovers to be able to enjoy the unique Sam's style and great service.

"The façade will have a vintage 'Airstream' [caravan] aluminium-clad look that adds an extra bit of authenticity and the interior will be equally as quirky, which fits in well with our ethos of providing great food in a fun-filled and entertaining environment.

"We'll also be creating full and part-time jobs that will further add to the positive impact that the neighbouring Cornucopia development will bring when it opens <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2018">next year</TIMEX3>."

Malcolm Ball, the chief executive of WMC Retail Partners Plc, the organisation responsible for the site and the Cornucopia development, said: "I'm really pleased that Sam's will be joining us at the St Austell Bay Retail and Leisure Park."

Simon Lomax, managing director of Kensa.

Heat-pump manufacturer and installer Kensa has found a strong footing in the residential market, making it one of the fastest-growing companies in the region. Kensa has enjoyed 23% growth with a £2.4 million turnover.

At first, Kensa's products were considered somewhat niche with an appeal to those embarking on Grand Designs-style projects but without mass market appeal. As renewable energy started to gain in popularity and profile, the market grew larger, but so too did the competition, with much larger, European operations entering into the UK marketplace.

Continued uncertainty over government subsidies for the renewable heat sector has meant many of these larger rivals have focused their efforts on other markets or on other products, leaving Kensa as the <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> UK market leader. Managing director Simon Lomax said: "As a relatively small business that is competing against better resourced rivals with global and pan-European distribution networks, we have emerged as market leader in terms of the volume of sales. We survive because we have designed a product that can be assembled using semi-skilled workers so that we can quickly recruit production staff, train them and have them fully productive within a short period."

Furniture firm Julian Foye has enjoyed a good trading year.

It has been a good year for the furniture maker with the <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3>/<TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DURATION" value="P16Y">16 year</TIMEX3> up sales 5% on <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3> and 40% up in <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2016-11">November</TIMEX3> alone on <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2015-11">November 2015</TIMEX3>. The firm, which employs 40 staff, opened its latest showroom in Hayle <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2012">five years ago</TIMEX3> at an investment of £1.5 million.

A company spokesman said: "In <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> we are looking to develop our warehouse shop in St Blazey where we sell a good selection of British manufacturers' seconds as well as less expensive beds and bedroom furniture alongside second hand goods in good repair.

"We are also actively looking for a new site in Cornwall which must be at least 8,000 sq ft and have parking for our delivery vans and customers."
