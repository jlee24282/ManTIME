In South Omaha <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-W03">last week</TIMEX3>, retailer Carlos Jacobo of Jacobo’s Groceries ticked off some of the daily necessities required by cooks whose refrigerators and stoves overflow with the sweet and savory produce of Mexican cuisine: Jumex juice drinks, Dona Maria marinated cactus, Lo Costena enchilada sauce.

All are staples in kitchens where Mexican fare is on the daily menu, and all are imported from Mexico. And all would be subject to a 20 percent import tax proposed by the Trump administration <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-W03">last week</TIMEX3> as a means of paying for a border wall between the two nations.

Like many in both countries, however, Jacobo wasn’t quite sure how taxing imported goods to be sold to his U.S. consumers would add up to making Mexico and Mexican consumers pay for the wall, a campaign promise of President Donald Trump.

Rather than burdening Mexico, Jacobo said, such a tax collected by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials would end up being passed on to wholesalers in the United States, then to U.S. retailers and ultimately to his consumers.

“It’s like any other price increase,” said Jacobo, whose parents started the family grocery store <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="1977">40 years ago</TIMEX3>. “You have to pass it on to the customer, or what’s the point of being here?”

The White House said <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-W03">last week</TIMEX3> that a 20 percent border tax on imports from Mexico is one method the Trump administration is considering to equalize a $60 billion trade deficit and to pay for a barrier between the two nations to control the entry of illegal immigrants, drugs and guns.

A White House spokesman refused to detail exactly how taxing goods coming into the country — taxes surely to be passed on to U.S. consumers in the form of higher retail prices — would generate revenue from Mexico’s government or consumers for the construction of a wall.

Sean Spicer, the spokesman, later appeared to backtrack, telling reporters that the tax was “one idea” to pay for the wall and that his intent was not to “roll out” a new policy. Not all Republicans seemed to be on board, either: U.S. Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., posted on Twitter that “Tariffs are a tax on American families.” Colleague Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., called talk of an import tax “mucho sad.”

Some economists <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-W03">last week</TIMEX3> also were scratching their heads at the idea. They included University of Nebraska at Omaha economist and professor Christopher Decker.

“Unless I’m missing something, I’m not quite sure how that works,” Decker said. “If imports dry up as a result of the increase in tax, you’re not going to have a lot of tax revenue.”

On the other hand, if imports from Mexico remain high because consumers are willing to pay higher prices for valued goods, the people paying those higher prices are U.S. consumers. Instead of Mexico paying for the wall, Decker said, Americans who buy Mexican-made goods would be paying for the wall.

“It’s backwards,” Decker said. “That confounds me a little bit.”

It’s not just foodstuffs that are affected — many automobiles, some under American nameplates such as Chevrolet and Dodge — are assembled in Mexico. Presumably they also would be slapped with a 20 percent import tax as they made their way into the U.S — if automakers didn’t find somewhere else to make the cars.

There apparently is some hope that threat of a tariff, or tax, on imports to the U.S. from Mexico could spur carmakers to bring some production back to the U.S.

Dennis Williams, president of the United Auto Workers, generally expressed support for Trump’s idea of tariffs on Mexican imports, according to news reports after the <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-11">November</TIMEX3> election.

Such support was in short supply among agricultural interests in the Midlands: Farmers and others connected to the ag industry said they had much to lose if talk of an import tax ignited a full-on trade war.

Mexico is Nebraska’s second-largest trading partner, after Canada, with $1.2 billion in trade in <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3>, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.

Midlands ag folks were crystal clear <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3> when they said they do not favor any U.S. trade policy that will lead Mexico to retaliate with punitive border levies of its own that might cut deeply into the ability of Nebraska and Iowa farmers to sell their grain profitably south of the border.

“Any disruption of export markets would result in continued downward pressure on farm incomes and farm financial health,” said Steve Nelson, president of the Nebraska Farm Bureau.

“Agriculture exports account for roughly one-third of farm income,” Nelson said, “making trade critical to agriculture. Any actions jeopardizing Nebraska’s ability to access international markets is of great concern to our members.”

The leading categories are the usual suspects: processed food and grain. Mexico is the third-largest consumer of all U.S. agriculture goods, the second-largest consumer of U.S. corn, third of U.S. soybeans and fourth of U.S. beef. Nebraska, in turn, ranks in the top five nationally in the production of each, as does Iowa in corn and soybeans.

Major corporations with a stake in Mexico are monitoring the situation closely. In Omaha, that means Union Pacific Railroad, employer of 8,000 in Nebraska. The second-largest freight railroad in the United States, about 11 percent of U.P.’s volume is tied to Mexico. The company serves all six of the rail crossings between the United States and Mexico.

“A big chunk is vehicles and vehicle parts going back and forth,” Union Pacific marketing chief Beth Whited said in a conference call with analysts and investors <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2017-01">this month</TIMEX3>.

Daniel Sherman, a Wall Street transportation-industry analyst for St. Louis-based wealth adviser Edward Jones, said he doesn’t see any long-term threat to Union Pacific from the Mexican standoff because, politics and rhetoric aside, there are people on both sides of the border with their heads on straight. And that means, Sherman said, a long-term agreement wherein both sides prosper because it is not in anyone’s best interest for anything but.

“I see the <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> dust-up as the start of a long drawn-out negotiation process that likely ends better than it will look in the middle,” Sherman said in an interview. “The reason it ends better is because both sides realize that each is benefiting in a major way from the trade between our two countries.”

On the same conference call <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2017-01" mod="START">earlier this month</TIMEX3>, U.P. Chief Executive Lance Fritz said the economies of the two countries are inextricably tied.

“It is our perception that the United States is tightly woven with our trading partners,” Fritz said. “Our consumers benefit greatly from free and open trade.”

Such “free and open trade” is generally considered to be that in which neither trading partner levies import taxes at the border, fees known as tariffs. Fritz said free trade benefits the United States by allowing imports of goods that can be produced more cheaply overseas than domestically.

Free trade advocates say it also opens up exports, encouraging technological and productivity advances in U.S. manufacturing, and the concomitant job growth.

The opposite trading philosophy is known as “protectionism,” in which hefty tariffs are levied at the border to make imported goods more expensive than those manufactured domestically, a strategy designed to protect domestic agriculture, industries and jobs from foreign competition.

For the Midwest, it is the ag portion that resounds the loudest. Corn is selling for less than half the $8 a bushel record seen in <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2012">2012</TIMEX3>, farm debt is up and land prices are declining.

“Mexico has been an important and growing market for raw and processed agricultural goods,” said John Campbell of Omaha investment bank Ocean Park Advisers, whose work includes commodities analysis. “A trade war with them when farmers are already in a fragile financial situation would be disastrous for rural America.”

Back in South Omaha, Tony Vega’s Plaza Latina at 4938 S. 24th St. carries a wide range of goods, including Mexican-made cowboy boots costing up to $850 a pair. Customers will balk at a 20 percent increase and may bargain down the price, cutting into the store’s earnings.

The tax option is another negative message from the Trump administration, said Vega, who helps local people with travel plans and finding doctors or lawyers in Omaha. There’s a fear that the federal government will track down people who aren’t legal residents.

“The most important thing is we want to be the best citizens we can be, respect the law, respect everything,” Vega said. “We must be good neighbors. Don’t be afraid.” Mexico is our third-largest goods trading partner with $531 billion in total (two-way) goods trade during <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3>, <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2016">the last year</TIMEX3> with statistics available through the Office of the United States Trade Representative.
