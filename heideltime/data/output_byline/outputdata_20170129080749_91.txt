I was going to write this letter regarding the cabinet nominations, then I was going to write about that farce of a press conference, but as the news has been so fast and fluid <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EVERY">every day</TIMEX3>, I decided to go in a different direction. 
 
My name is Barbara Davis and I am a founding member of the Jefferson County Progressive Democratic Coalition. We started this organization after the election in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2016-11">November</TIMEX3>, as we felt the real and honest values of our party and of democracy were under attack. We are not only focused on local issues and candidates but also those on the national front. 
 
As I’m sitting here the day after the inauguration and as I’m watching the massive marches around the world of the people standing up for the rights of all people, I’m hopeful that in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P6M">six months</TIMEX3> when the cameras aren’t focused on them that those people marching <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3> will still be willing to do the hard work that is ahead of us. 
 
If you are concerned about the future of our little neck of the woods and would like to be a part of our organization that is endeavoring to get real progressive forward-thinking candidates into office to help move our valley into a world where everyone has equal rights and opportunities, if you want to help shape the conversations that our leaders, not only local but state and national, need to hear to build a great democracy for all people, then please join us, your friends and neighbors, in this important work. Our next meeting will be at <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29T18:00">6 p.m.</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-02-10">Feb. 10</TIMEX3> at 136 N. Fourth St. in Steubenville. 
 
When just <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> after taking the oath of office the new administration silences the voices of a government agency (the National Parks Service), when it erases civil rights, health care and LGBT rights from the WhiteHouse.gov website, it is imperative that all good and decent people stand up and shout that we, the American people, will not allow our voices to be silenced. 
 
The road ahead may seem dark but we can be the light and hope for others to follow.
