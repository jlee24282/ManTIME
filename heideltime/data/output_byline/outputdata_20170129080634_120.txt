Some 300 protesters gathered at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TEV">Saturday evening</TIMEX3> to demonstrate solidarity with Muslim immigrants and refugees detained under President Donald Trump's "Muslim ban."

Chanting "Trump has to go," "No Trump, No KKK, No Fascism in USA" and other slogans, the crowd called on people to defy <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3>'s executive order that slaps a <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P90D">90-day</TIMEX3> ban on travel to the country by citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries and a <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P120D">120-day</TIMEX3> suspension of the U.S. refugee program.

At least seven foreign nationals have been detained at LAX and told they were no longer welcome, the Los Angeles Times reported, noting that they were allowed to board flights before the order took effect.

The protesters' demand was echoed by Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, who tweeted <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TNI">Saturday night</TIMEX3> that "Los Angels will always be a place of refuge."

A candlelight vigil and protest were scheduled to be held <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3>.

Trump's travel ban, widely described as a "Muslim ban," has triggered confusion and chaos across the country and drawn concern and criticism from across the world.

Similar protests have erupted at airports in many other cities. In Chicago, more than 1,000 rallied at the O'Hare airport. In Denver, Colorado, dozens of protesters gathered outside the international airport to show support for refugees.

This was the second weekend of demonstrations in Los Angeles after Trump was sworn into the Oval Office. More than 1 million people came out <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017-W03-WE">last weekend</TIMEX3> for the Women's <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2016-03">March</TIMEX3>.
