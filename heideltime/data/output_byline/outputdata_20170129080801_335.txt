Is there any hope that this Detroit Red Wings team can turn it around in <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2018-H2">the second half</TIMEX3> and make a run at a playoff berth? 
 
Full disclosure, I don’t work for the Red Wings. I never have worked for the Red Wings. And odds are that I never will work for the Red Wings. 
 
The only reason that I mention it is that I think the <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION" value="P25Y">25-year</TIMEX3> playoff streak matters a lot to the people who work inside the organization. I don’t think that those of us who work outside the organization appreciate what it means to those people. This isn’t an excuse, it’s more of an explanation. For years, simply making the playoffs was a foregone conclusion for the Red Wings. It was merely a matter of where they’d be seeded and who they’d host in Game 1 of the first round. <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DURATION" value="PXY">The last few years</TIMEX3>, it’s been a matter of scratching and clawing their way in and sometimes relying on other teams losing to secure that final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. 
 
This hasn’t led to any postseason success. It clearly hasn’t led to any deep runs in <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2017-SP">the spring</TIMEX3>. But as Ken Holland likes to infer, once you’re in, anything can happen. The only problem is that “anything” has been a series of first round losses with only one playoff round victory (<TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2013">2013</TIMEX3>) in the past five seasons and zero trips to the conference finals since <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2009">2009</TIMEX3>. 
 
It’s led to a weird dynamic in this town where the team is fighting to get in and the fans are saying, “what’s the point?”

Detroit Red Wings head into break at bottom of Eastern Conference 
  
That brings us to this season where the Wings enter the All-Star break tied for last place in the East. They’re seven points out of both a wild-card spot and out of third place in the Atlantic Division. They’re tied for the second worst goal differential in the conference (minus-21) and they’re a preposterously good 6-0 in shoot-outs which A) inflates their point total and B) is a pretty risky way to go through the season. 
 
There is nothing going on that would make you think that this is a playoff team. There’s no hot goaltender. There’s no dynamic scorer. There’s no potential for an outlier where some player takes off and carries this team on their back. Is there a chance that the Wings can get hot and squeak into the playoffs? You never say never of course. But what’s the point?

We’ve heard from plenty of fans that want to see the team tank in <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2018-H2">the second half</TIMEX3> of the season. To me, that’s a ridiculous argument. Everybody from Jeff Blashill down owes it to themselves and to each other to try every night to win. That’s the DNA of a professional coach and a professional athlete. 
 
Above Blashill, namely Holland and his scouting staff, the focus must be on the moment the final horn sounds at the end of the <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2017-04-09">April 9</TIMEX3> game against the Devils. Buying at the trade deadline is out of the question. Standing pat at the deadline makes no sense when you have tradeable commodities like Thomas Vanek and Brendan Smith to put out on the open market. Holland needs to be an aggressive seller. Every fan has their personal list of untouchables, most of which include Dylan Larkin, Anthony Mantha and Andreas Athanasiou. Personally, not a single player is untouchable. The Red Wings need two Larkins and three Athanasious if they hope to get back to where this franchise once was. 
 
Having said that, I’d only trade the “untouchables” at the right price. They can still be moved in the off-season or in the future. The players who need to go at the deadline are Vanek and Smith since their contracts are up at the end of the season and there’s every chance they’ll walk away regardless. 
 
This is a rather somber way to mark the end of Joe Louis Arena. No building in Detroit has seen more glory than the Joe. But this is no longer about the building. If you want the Little Caesars Arena to ever approach the Joe in terms of important games played, you need to focus solely on the team and organization as a whole and less on nostalgia and the streak. 
 
The streak is an amazing accomplishment. Just like the Stanley Cups and the retired jerseys, it can never be taken away and can never be altered. The streak represents consistency unmatched in the rest of the NHL. But the streak shouldn’t define the next chapter in Red Wings history. This team has never, throughout it’s great history, been about just making the playoffs. It’s been about raising banners. The only way to contend for more of those is by building for the future starting immediately. 
 
Anything is possible in sports which is why a playoff berth is never dead until a team has been eliminated. But everyone who watches this team knows that it isn’t Cup-worthy. And being Cup-worthy is far more important for the Wings than simply being playoff-worthy.
