CONCORD - <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2016">Last year</TIMEX3>, New Hampshire State Police saved people from jumping off bridges and rescued a distraught woman who tried to drown herself in a river. They solved the <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2011">2011</TIMEX3> murder of 11-year-old Celina Cass, made numerous drug busts and helped capture a man who shot two Manchester police officers. 

On <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3>, more than 400 people gathered at New Hampshire Police Standards and Training Council to honor them. 

Trooper Nicholas Levesque, a <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P4Y">four-year</TIMEX3> veteran, received three awards: The Director's Award, for making 245 arrests <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3>, 90 of them related to drugs; a Medal of Service for his efforts in arresting a man charged with shooting those Manchester police officers, and a commendation for his efforts in the Drug Monitor Initiative. 

Levesque and Trooper First Class Francesco Campo were working a construction detail on Interstate 93 in Manchester on <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2016-05-13">May 13, 2016</TIMEX3>, when they heard the call that an officer had been shot. 

The two troopers arrived on scene, working with Manchester police officers to secure the area and track down the shooter. Levesque saw the suspect, later identified as Ian MacPherson, 32, of Manchester, who by then allegedly had shot a second officer. MacPherson ignored Levesque, who shot at him, but missed. 

Campo, who also received the Medal of Meritorious Service, and Levesque followed MacPherson to woods where he ran. A Massachusetts State Police helicopter flushed him out and MacPherson was arrested. He is charged with two counts of attempted murder and first degree assault. 

Levesque said the two officers who were shot, Ryan Hardy and Matt O'Connor, are good friends of his. They met while attending The Academy at the New Hampshire Police Standards and Training Council. 

Levesque said he was just happy he could do his job <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EVERY">every day</TIMEX3> and "work with the troopers that I do." 

Trooper Jonathan D. Minnich received a Lifesaving Award. He had tried to contact a man to return property to him. When, after <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DURATION" value="PXD">several days</TIMEX3>, the man didn't call back, on <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2016-05-03">May 3, 2016</TIMEX3>, Minnich went to his home where he found him on a floor, unable to move because of a medical issue. 

Without Minnich stopping by the man's home, "the individual certainly would have died," Col. Christopher Wagner said. 

Auxiliary Trooper Charles West received the Director's Award and the Lt. James J. Geraghty Investigative Award. Geraghty, who died in <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2014">2014</TIMEX3>, was with the major crimes unit for <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DURATION" value="P8Y">eight years</TIMEX3>. 

Cass went missing on <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2011-07-26">July 26, 2011</TIMEX3>, and her body was found <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2011-07-31">five days later</TIMEX3> in the Connecticut River, a short distance from her West Stewartstown home. 

No one was arrested until <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="2016" mod="APPROX">nearly five years later</TIMEX3> and after West pored over evidence, including hundreds of interviews, resulting in the arrest of Celina's stepfather, Wendell Noyes, on <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2016-06-20">June 20, 2016</TIMEX3>. 

Lifesaving Awards were given to Trooper Bryan C. Tracy , who went 100 yards into a river to rescue a woman trying to drown herself; Troopers Mark Dore, Geoffrey Rogan and Jacob Wood saved a man on <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DATE" value="2016-09-11">Sept. 11, 2016</TIMEX3>, who was dangling from a bridge after he ran from them following a police chase on the Everett Turnpike; Lt. Joseph Ebert, Sgt. John Hennessey, Trooper First Class Brian Gacek and troopers Jeffrey Costa and John Forbes saved the life of a woman as she tried to jump off the bridge spanning the Piscataqua River at the Maine/New Hampshire border.
