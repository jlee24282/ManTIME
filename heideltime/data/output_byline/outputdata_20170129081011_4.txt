Kuwaitis will mark <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P11Y">11 years</TIMEX3> since His Highness the Amir Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah stood before the Parliament to take his oath of office as the 15th ruler of Kuwait. His Highness Sheikh Sabah is a distinguished ruler who received both executive and legislative backing along with the support of the people at the start of his reign and continues to do so. 
 
Born on <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="1929-06-16">June 16, 1929</TIMEX3>, the fourth son of Sheikh Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah was handpicked as a potentially astute statesman. After studying at the local Mubarakiya School, his father sent him to the West to pick up on diplomatic skills he would soon be able to master. 
 
Upon his return in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="1954">1954</TIMEX3>, Sheikh Sabah was immediately handed the role of forming one of the sides of a committee tasked with restructuring state bodies despite being only 25 years old. <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="1955">A year later</TIMEX3>, he was appointed head of the state social affairs and labor unit, a position he would later thrive in. 
 
At a time of heavy regional and international labor migration into Kuwait, he was responsible for regulating the relationship between employee and business owner. He was also behind the formation of specialist training centers, sports clubs, welfare centers for women, children, the elderly and special needs cases and a traditional arts center. 
 
In <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="1957">1957</TIMEX3>, after being tasked with overseeing the state publishing department, the first edition of cultural magazine Al-Arabi was published. 
 
Culture 
It was to later become a huge hit amongst Arab readers and helped put Kuwait on the map as a serious advocate of culture and knowledge. A publications’ and media law, that placed Kuwait as the top Arab country in the World Media Index was another of his contributions. <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DURATION" value="P2Y">Two years</TIMEX3> after Kuwait’s independence in <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="1961">1961</TIMEX3>, he was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs — a position he would continue to fill over <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DURATION" value="P40Y">a 40-year period</TIMEX3>. His reign as foreign minister was marked by numerous shifts and turbulent circumstances. But thanks to his wise judgement the then minister Sheikh Sabah was able to steady the ship. After raising Kuwait’s flag for the first time at the United Nations in <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="1963">1963</TIMEX3>, he immediately set out to cover his role with fervor, becoming instrumental in his policy as a regional. His first task was to bring together the conflicting sides in Yemen’s civil war, including Saudi Arabia and Egypt who were backing separate sides in the struggle. All the parties were involved in reconciliation talks hosted by Kuwait. 
 
As the fighting continued between the north and the south of Yemen, he later paid a visit to both resulting in the signature of a peace agreement in <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="1972">1972</TIMEX3>. In <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="1980">1980</TIMEX3> he also mediated reconciliation between Yemen and its western neighbors Oman. He was also faced with difficult regional conditions which he managed to sail through smoothly like the eight-year-old Iran-Iraq war of <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="198">the 1980s</TIMEX3> and Iraq’s occupation of Kuwait in <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="1990">1990</TIMEX3>. The role of forming a government, in the place of Sheikh Saad Al-Abdullah, was given to him in <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="2001">2001</TIMEX3> after which he was appointed prime minister <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="2003">two years later</TIMEX3>. 
 
This is when his focus on economic affairs began. He launched a local fund for SMEs in order to support the youth. 
 
On international affairs, he looked eastwards to sign a total 10 agreements, MoUs and giant business projects with China, Japan, South Korea and Singapore in <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DATE" value="2004">2004</TIMEX3>. In <TIMEX3 tid="t35" type="DATE" value="2006-01">January 2006</TIMEX3>, former Amir Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah passed away. His successor was Sheikh Saad, however his extreme sickness prevented him from becoming ruler. It is then that the Cabinet sat down to agree that Sheikh Sabah would be the new ruler — a decision that later received the Parliament’s backing as well. His Highness the Amir’s development plans for Kuwait are truly underway. Some projects have been completed while some are in the pipeline, including Jaber Hospital, Mubarak Port, and the giant Jaber Bridge which links the north to Kuwait City, Al-Zour refinery, and the new airport. 
 
In <TIMEX3 tid="t38" type="DATE" value="2014-09">September 2014</TIMEX3>, and after Kuwait hosted three international conferences which helped raise billions of dollars in an unprecedented step for humanitarian efforts on the Syrian refugee crisis, His Highness was handed a ‘Humanitarian Leader’ award by UN chief Ban Ki-moon. Throughout his <TIMEX3 tid="t39" type="DURATION" value="P11Y">11-year</TIMEX3> reign His Highness the Amir oversaw the handing out of many other relief aid, grants and loans worth tens of millions to nations around the world, particularly to the Palestinians and impoverished countries in Africa and Asia. His love for his people was at its most evident when, moments after terrorists’ bombed Imam Al-Sadiq Mosque leaving behind 26 people dead, he showed up unguarded and unarmed to oversee rescue efforts. It was then he made the famous quote “those are my children.” 
 
In <TIMEX3 tid="t40" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3>, His Highness the Amir Sheikh Sabah continued to support the Syrian refugees, cohosting the fourth international donors conference for Syria which was held in the British capital London in <TIMEX3 tid="t41" type="DATE" value="2016-02">February</TIMEX3>. His Highness Sheikh Sabah also took part in humanitarian world summit which was held in Istanbul, Turkey, in <TIMEX3 tid="t44" type="DATE" value="2016-05">May of 2016</TIMEX3>. <TIMEX3 tid="t46" type="DATE" value="2016" mod="END">Late 2016</TIMEX3>, His Highness Sheikh Sabah added an another milestone to his credential, receiving King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud on his first visit to Kuwait since becoming Monarch of Saudi Arabia. Kuwait will rejoice on the day that their ruler celebrates <TIMEX3 tid="t47" type="DURATION" value="P11Y">eleven years</TIMEX3> in office. A humanitarian, a champion of the weak, a man of compassion and a patriot — long live His Highness the Amir Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah.

He also lauded His Highness the Amir’s efforts during the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in <TIMEX3 tid="t53" type="DATE" value="1990">1990</TIMEX3>, affirming that Sheikh Sabah was a key figure, along with late Amir Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah and late Father Amir Sheikh Saad Al-Abdullah Al-Sabah, in liberating Kuwait in <TIMEX3 tid="t54" type="DATE" value="1991">1991</TIMEX3>. Sheikh Meshal took the chance to wish His Highness the Amir evermore progress and wellbeing. 
 
On his part, Information Minister and Minister of State for Youth Affairs Sheikh Salman Al-Humoud Al-Sabah said that history will remember His Highness Sheikh Sabah for his relentless efforts in the regional and global scenes. Kuwaitis must follow His Highness the Amir’s vision for <TIMEX3 tid="t55" type="DATE" value="2035">2035</TIMEX3>, said the minister stressing that the <TIMEX3 tid="t56" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> occasion must be celebrated through the nation’s determination to further develop Kuwait under the banner held by the Kuwaiti leadership.
