     62nd NHL All-Star Game  
When: <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28T15:30">3:30 p.m.</TIMEX3> 
 
Where: Staples Center, Los Angeles. 
 
TV: NBC (Channel 4 in Detroit), CBC (Channel 9). 
 
Game notes: Not the traditional East vs. West matchup in this rendition of the midseason exhibition. Or the North American stars against the International. Or the young kids against the old veterans. The day will start with the Atlantic Division, featuring Red Wings forward Frans Nielsen, will take on the Metropolitan Division in a 3-on-3 game for <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DURATION" value="PT20M">20 minutes</TIMEX3>. Then the other two divisions will square off and the two winners will do the same to determine a winner.
