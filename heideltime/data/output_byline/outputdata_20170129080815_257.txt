A group led by survivors of sexual assault is pressing the University of Cincinnati to provide greater support. 
 
The group called "Students for Survivors" sent a list of demands in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2016-11">November</TIMEX3> that included calls to update the policy on sex offenses with adequate and correct information, create an accessible website with resources available to survivors and hire a full-time Title IX Coordinator and staff. The school in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2016-12">December</TIMEX3> said it hired four new Title IX staff members in the fall. The school also has updated its website to reflect <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> support services offered to survivors. The U.S. Department of Education is investigating UC for allegations it failed "to properly and equitably respond" to incidents of sexual violence it knew about.
