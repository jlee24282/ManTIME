Living pop legend Eddie Money did more than just take fans home <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TNI">Saturday night</TIMEX3> -- he brought spectators back to <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="198">the '80s</TIMEX3> (and even <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="197">the '70s</TIMEX3> for a cool <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="PT4M">four minutes</TIMEX3>) during his <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="PT25M">25 minute</TIMEX3>-long set fueled by nostalgia and collection of greatest hits. 
 
In his signature black suit, Money made a grand entrance by ripping the sunglasses off his face and launching his set with " Baby Hold On ," which he adorned with casual dance moves as he traveled the stage. Money -- accompanied by his daughter Jesse who provided the backup vocals -- kept the party going with a high-energy performance of classic hits including " Walk On Water ," Think I'm In Love ," and " Shakin' " before inspiring a sing along to his massive single " Take Me Home <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29TNI">Tonight</TIMEX3> " from his album Can't Hold Back .
