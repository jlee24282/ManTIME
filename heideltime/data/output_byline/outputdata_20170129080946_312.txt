A Eva (Gina Isaac), newly arrived from the UK, has high hopes, a high-level job in advertising and a strong determination to do things her way, <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="XXXX">following years</TIMEX3> of failed IVF treatments. Doctor Gupta (Syreeta Kumar) is cool, competent and in charge of a clinic so in demand from foreign clients that she is <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> investing in an ambitious expansion programme to meet their needs. Aditi (Ulrika Krishnamurti), the intended surrogate, will earn more in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P9M">nine months</TIMEX3> than she could through <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P10Y">10 years</TIMEX3>’ work in her village.

A dramatically potent situation is given added impetus (and conceptual complexity) when politics disrupt the personal agendas. State elections loom; a ban is introduced on foreigners paying for surrogacy in India. What follows is a revelation of the women’s characters under pressure (brilliantly multifaceted performances from Isaac, Kumar and Krishnamurti), which exposes questions surrounding surrogacy (without offering glib answers) and wider economic issues (a politician’s voiceover attacks the ban, claiming surrogacy allows "produce of India" to make "wealth flow back" to the country), as well as semi-submerged, postcolonial attitudes. Places are precisely evoked and yet also flow and twine thanks to the combined effects of Prema Mehta’s lighting, Arun Ghosh’s sound design (also original music) and Denno’s multiple screens, on to which are projected Shanaz Gulzar’s video images. Each element enhances the play’s competing tensions between fragmentation and cohesion, opposites tautly balanced by Katie Posner’s fine direction. The whole makes for an intellectually and emotionally stirring encounter.
