The left has gone crazy! The Women’s <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-03">March</TIMEX3> on Washington where the Media Research Center reports that George Soros pumped $90 million into over 50 organizations included in the march. 
 
Then you have Ashley Judd and Madonna. Wow, they were unhinged with their hate for Donald Trump, with Madonna saying she’s thought about blowing up the White House. Thankfully the Secret Service has opened an investigation on Madonna. 
 
And to the rioters who destroyed property in D.C., that’s a federal crime punishable by <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P10Y" mod="EQUAL_OR_LESS">up to 10 years</TIMEX3> in prison and a $25K fine. I hope all 200 plus get the maximum sentence. 
 
Then you have the media that has total disdain for the new president including this newspaper. The credibility of the media is at an all-time low. Journalists are no longer trusted to be impartial. Factual journalism has been replaced with opinionated journalism. 
 
Then there is social media that allows you to post whatever you want regardless whether it’s true or false and they don’t care what or whom they hurt. Look at the S.N.L. writer that made the despicable Tweet regarding 10-year-old Barron Trump. A 10-year-old? One can’t go any lower. 
 
Comedian Chelsea Handler told “Variety” that she would not interview First Lady Melania Trump because “she can barely speak English.” The First Lady speaks five languages, Handler speaks one. 
 
Then the letter writer who writes, “…President-elect Donald Trump equates our CIA agency to the Nazis" saying nothing about the left equating Donald Trump to the Nazis, most <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> MSNBC's Chris Matthews and CNN's Rachel Maddow. What hypocrisy! 
 
So to the Trump haters out there I say this, <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P8Y">eight years</TIMEX3> of the Obama administration is what gave us Donald Trump and those of you wondering what the Obama legacy will be, it’s Donald Trump!
