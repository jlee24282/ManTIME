To Address The Growing Market Demand Of The Extreme Kleaner Product Line, Extreme Energy Solutions Inc. Has Released A New Mobile App Aimed At Giving A More User Friendly And Convenient Experience To Customers.

Sparta, New Jersey (PRWEB) <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">January 27, 2017</TIMEX3> 

The Extreme Kleaner brand of green cleaning products from Extreme Energy Solutions has achieved notable growth, especially <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="PXM" mod="MORE_THAN">over the last several months</TIMEX3> in particular. Extreme Kleaner is a non-toxic biodegradable cleaning product line which includes an all-purpose cleaner-degreaser and window cleaner, both made in the USA.

Extreme Kleaner was first offered online directly on the Extreme Kleaner website, then shortly after, it was sold on Amazon. In <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2013">2013</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2014">2014</TIMEX3>, local New Jersey and North Eastern retailers began to offer the green cleaner in their stores. By year end <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3>, Extreme Kleaner was available in several hardware store chains, auto parts stores, and food stores coast to coast in various states. 

<TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3> brought many new opportunities for Extreme Kleaner including both a number of co-ops and larger big box retailers taking on the product. <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> carries the momentum by opening up with the launch of Extreme Kleaner in Menards.

Steady growth in market share has resulted in Extreme Kleaner <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> being available in a number of selected independently owned retailer locations nationwide, including many hardware stores, auto parts stores, grocery markets, and variety stores. Brand stores that <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> offer Extreme Kleaner include: Hardware Hanks, Trustworthy Hardware, Golden Rule Lumber, Ranch and Pet Supply, other stores affiliated with United Hardware, selected NAPA Auto Parts, selected Ace Hardware stores, selected True Value Hardware stores, stores affiliated with C&S Wholesale Grocers, and <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> Menards.

Menards, one of the largest home improvement chains in the Mid-West, <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> stocks Extreme Kleaner in all of its 300 plus retail locations and also offer the eco-friendly cleaner in their online store.

“We are very grateful and appreciative of the opportunity to partner with Menards. This was one of our long term goals for our company and for Extreme Kleaner, and we have found the Menards team to be very helpful and knowledgeable,” commented Samuel K. Burlum, CEO and President of Extreme Energy Solutions, Inc. Extreme Energy Solutions has opted not to be left behind in the mobile app movement. They are <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> joining the ranks of the majority of businesses that are seizing the opportunity to increase customer engagement, revenue and brand awareness.

“With the rapid market adoption of the Extreme Kleaner product line, the next logical step was to create a mobile app for the product to enhance the customer experience. This new tool allows us to offer the customer more ease and convenience of service and it also provides a platform for us to increase customer engagement which helps foster community and build more brand loyalty” commented Jeff Smith, Communications Director of Extreme Energy Solutions.

The Extreme Kleaner mobile app is <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> available for download and use at the iTunes / Apple Store as well as the Google Play / Android store.

Customers who install the app can expect many benefits. They can order product right from the app, they can easily access the company’s social media and brand websites, locate a nearby retailer, and receive special coupons, discounts and promotions, as well as several other benefits.

Just like <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="1997">20 years ago</TIMEX3>, when companies that did not create a website for their business were quickly left behind in the market, business is experiencing a similar revolution <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3> with mobile apps. Companies and brands that do not have a mobile app available to their customers are quickly being left behind. The vast majority of internet use <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3> is through mobile devices. Extreme Energy Solutions wanted to stay ahead of the curve and offer a user friendly mobile app for Extreme Kleaner right when the product was starting to take off in popularity with national chains and suppliers.

During <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3>, the Extreme Kleaner team made a “Tour of Stores” road trip where they visited many retailers including the United Hardware family- Hardware Hanks, and other retailers such as Ace Hardware and True Value to deliver product, set up in-store promotions and spread the word of Extreme Kleaner’s availability.

<TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> will also include a Tour of Stores, where the Extreme Kleaner markting team will again take to the road for dozens of in-store visits and promotional appearances. However, <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2017">this year</TIMEX3> they will have an additional value to offer their customers. The mobile app is expected to tie in seamlessly with existing promotions and marketing campaigns, including the successful motorsports sponsorship program.

The Extreme Kleaner mobile app is expected to be utilized vigorously <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2017">this year</TIMEX3> by fans of the brand. Extreme Energy Solutions plans on maximizing the use of this tool by creating several exciting promotions, special discounts and holding fun contests and drawings for its mobile app users in <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3>.
