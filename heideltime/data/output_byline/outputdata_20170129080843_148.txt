A PERVERT who spied on women in swimming pool changing rooms has been spared a jail sentence. 
 
Magistrates decided Tom Duhigg would not face a custodial sentence for taking pictures and recording videos of women while they were changing at the King Alfred Leisure Centre in Hove – even though he was already ordered by the court to complete a sexual behaviour course before the offences. 
 
Diana Hurrell, the presiding magistrate, said it was disappointing to learn the unemployed 31-year-old, of Hill Side, Newhaven, had previously attended a sex offenders’ course and then re-offended. 
 
She said custody was considered but she believed he would benefit from a <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P3Y">three-year</TIMEX3> community order and enrolling on the course again. 
 
He has to take part in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="P30D">30 days</TIMEX3> of rehabilitation and will be on the sex offenders’ register for <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P5Y">five years</TIMEX3>. 
 
He will be subject to a curfew with an electronic tag for <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="P6W">the next six weeks</TIMEX3> from <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="TIME" value="XXXX-XX-XXT20:00">8pm</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="TIME" value="XXXX-XX-XXT07:00">7am.</TIMEX3> 
 
He also has to pay £180 in compensation as well as an £85 victim surcharge and £85 in court costs, to which he responded: “I can’t afford that.” 
 
“That is what we are imposing,” Mrs Hurrell replied. 
 
She also ordered the iPod he used for the crimes to be destroyed. 
 
A mobile phone seized by police was found to be “entirely innocent” of material and will be returned. 
 
He is banned from visiting any gym or leisure centre with unisex changing rooms. 
 
Duhigg was arrested after being accused of peering over cubicles, taking pictures and recording videos while two women were changing after swimming at the centre on <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2016-10-12">October 12</TIMEX3>. 
 
He was released on bail and charged before pleading guilty to observing a person doing a private act for the “purpose of obtaining sexual gratification” by observing another person in private and “knowing that the person did not consent to being observed for your sexual gratification”. 
 
Chris Lovelock, area manager for Freedom Leisure, which runs the centre for Brighton and Hove City Council, said: “We are pleased the quick and efficient actions of our staff at King Alfred Leisure Centre proved pivotal. 
 
"We wish to reassure our visitors that this is a rare and isolated case and that their safety and experience is our priority.” 
 
Stephen Harris, defending, said Duhigg wanted to “stay out of trouble” and get work, adding: “He does accept causing a great deal of distress to his victims.”
