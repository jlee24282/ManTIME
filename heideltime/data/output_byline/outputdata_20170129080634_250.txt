There is a long wait list for users 

It seems that the fans of the new BBM for Android and iOS cannot download the app soon enough, as the millions of users trying to download it has caused a long wait list. The BBM for Android and iOS is available <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> in iTunes App Store and Google Play and fans are eager to get the app.

Unfortunately though, these millions of users have become increasingly frustrated by the fact that a wait list registration has been implemented. This means that you are asked to register your email address to reserve your spot, before then being put in a wait list for the new app. 

It is no secret that users are not fans of the wait list process but Blackberry feel that it is the best way to get things to run as smoothly as possible. They have insisted that they will try and make the wait as short as possible, saying, "We are focused on moving millions of customers through the line as fast as possible."
