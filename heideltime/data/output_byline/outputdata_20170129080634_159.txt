In keeping with the promise of bringing even more arts and entertainment to Coweta County, the Donald W. Nixon Centre for the Performing and Visual Arts <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> offered audiences one of the most unique performances ever to be enjoyed locally. 

 
Nearly every seat was filled in the Newnan theatre for the Golden Dragon Acrobats, a Chinese acrobatic touring company that performed at the Centre <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-22">Jan. 22</TIMEX3>. Regarded as the only acrobatic company of its kind, the nearly 20 total performers offered audiences everything from traditional Chinese dance to breathtaking balancing acts and awe-inspiring stunts. 
 
The team included groups of both men and women performing in a variety of acts designed to entertain an audience of all ages. Children stood with mouths agape watching seemingly impossible tumbling acts, contortionists, and balancing acts reminiscent of the offerings of Cirque du Soleil. Audience members awarded performers with a standing ovation following the show.
