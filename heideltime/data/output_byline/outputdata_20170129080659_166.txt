Dear Advice Columnist : 
 
There’s some new cookies in town that keep hitting on me. 
 
They said they’d be <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="PXM" mod="APPROX">around a couple of months</TIMEX3>, but are wanting me to hang with them <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3>. They seemed harmless at first, but every time I see a box, they sweet talk me in to joining them for a bite. I graciously decline, but they are quite convincing and are persistent with their luring, unwanted advances. 
 
I attempt to ignore them and walk away with strengthened willpower, but there’s one that always tries to Tagalong . 
 
Another asked point-blank if I wanted S’more ? 
 
“Some more what?” I asked, flabbergasted. He didn’t say a thing ... just stared at me with marshmallowy eyes. Sigh. 
 
The third one suggested we Do-si-do. Seriously? Does he have peanut butter between his ears? He doesn’t even know my name. 
 
The fourth was a little flaky and flashed his jailbird-like stripes as he whispered softly in my ear, 
 
“Samoa.” 
 
Stunned, I replied, “some more ‘a what?” 
 
These cookies and their friends are really sweet and tempting, but I’m not interested. How do I resist this temptation and end the incessant flirting? I’m afraid I might crumble and give in, throwing away my thin-meant New Year’s resolution. 
 
— Cookie Jar Fling? 
 
Dear Cookie Jar: 
 
It is with a big smile — perhaps a Savannah Smile , that I quote The Borg from Star Trek: “Resistance is futile.” 
 
Beginning <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3>, these cookies will be all over the Grand Valley. They are Girl Scout Cookies: Thin Mints, Samoas, Tagalongs, Trefoils, Dos-Si-Does, Savannah Smiles, and Toffee-Tastic (the gluten-free choice). 
 
<TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2017">This year</TIMEX3> marks <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="P100Y">100 years</TIMEX3> of Girl Scouts selling cookies and <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION" value="P100Y">100 years</TIMEX3> of Girl Scouting in Colorado. Cookie purchases support girls in developing goal setting, decision-making, money management, people skills and business ethics. And, in return, your mouth is happy.
