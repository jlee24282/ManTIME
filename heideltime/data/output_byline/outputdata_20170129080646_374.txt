Simon Says 
"Well another season and straight into another dramatic match right from the get go! I think both teams played hard and did what they could. The conditions were extremely changeable, we started in relatively good conditions and the end was played in quite cool blustery winds. It's early in the season and our best tennis is still ahead of us. We managed to come through some really tight moments on a couple of courts and that got us through. I'd like to say the doubles point was the difference and that's very important for us but ultimately Martina and Claudia pulled this one out when we had our backs to the wall. It's funny because Martina had 3 matches points in the 2nd set reminiscent of her 1st match this <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2016-FA">past Fall</TIMEX3>, however she hung in there, played very tough points on both of Oparenovic's match points. Happy for her as a senior to see her get that match and give Claudia the opportunity to play a deciding point. Claudia's made a ton of progress since <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3> and I've got a lot of faith in her and what's she capable of. She was close to making a break-through <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2017-FA">this Fall</TIMEX3> on a couple of occasions and this was the perfect moment for it to happen. Proud of our effort all round <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">today</TIMEX3> and looking forward to tomorrows match with Pepperdine. Go Pack!!!"
