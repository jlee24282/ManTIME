John Terry v The Sun 

For the second time in just <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DURATION" value="PXD">a few days</TIMEX3> Chelsea legend Jon Terry has again gone after the Sun for fake news

 

Terry has continued to use Instagram Stories as his platform of choice for calling out the biggest tabloid newspaper in England

 

The Blues centre-half was originally vexed by the red-top <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-W03">last week</TIMEX3> when they falsely reported that Terry had missed a Chelsea group dinner outing

 

Terry called out the Sun by posting a picture of him at the event

 

<TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> it’s time for round two as Terry takes on more inaccurate reporting regarding his England career

 JT & England 

There’s <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> a story on the Sun which is headlined ‘The FA vetoed an attempt by Sam Allardyce to bring John Terry out of international retirement’

 

In the article it was claimed that the <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> Crystal Palace boss tried to bring Terry back into the England fold but he was prevented by the FA

 

Allardyce is said to have asked the FA‘s permission to recall the Chelsea captain however the top brass concluded it would be seen as sending the national team backwards

 

The Chelsea legend has called BS on the article with a sarcastic post on Instagram which read "another piece of fantastic journalism"
