SAN DIEGO – After so many big names were sent home <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3>, <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-W03-WE">the weekend</TIMEX3> stage was cleared at Torrey Pines for the guys wearing visors and white belts who want to make a name for themselves on the PGA Tour. 
 
And, of course, for Brandt Snedeker, whose name is becoming linked with success at the Farmers Insurance Open. 
 
Snedeker, the defending and two-time Farmers champion, is tied for the lead with Patrick Rodgers and in position to win his third tournament title at Torrey in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P6Y">six years</TIMEX3> going into Sunday’s final round. 
 
“This place, for whatever reason, always seems to bring out my best,” Snedeker said <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> after a 2-under 70 moved him to the top of the leaderboard at 9-under 207, a total Rodgers matched with a 5-under 67. 
 
Tony Finau (67) and Cheng Tsung Pan (69) – two of the lesser names trying to establish themselves on tour – are one shot behind the co-leaders at 8 under, and there’s an eight-player logjam at 7 under, including 36-hole leader Justin Rose (73), San Diego native Pat Perez (67) and Stewart Cink (69). That puts 12 players within two shots of the co-leaders. 
 
Former Santa Margarita High star Beau Hossler, making his first PGA start as a professional at age 21, struggled to a 2-over 74 on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> to drop to even par, one shot ahead of Saturday’s secondary cut, and is tied for 58th. 
 
Suffice it to say, it was much more surprising that tour stars Tiger Woods, Jason Day, Dustin Johnson, Rickie Fowler and Jimmy Walker all missed the 36-hole cut than it is that Snedeker is contending again at Torrey Pines. 
 
“My rookie year I finished third here and ever since then, it’s had a special place in my heart,” Snedeker said. “It’s hard to quantify, but I definitely think there are certain golf courses (where) you show up and your attitude – the way you go about things – and your confidence level kind of wills you to have a good week. . . . This is a place that I love and play great on.” 
 
Two of Snedeker’s eight career tour victories came at Torrey Pines. He won the 2012 Farmers in a playoff after Kyle Stanley triple-bogeyed the 72nd hole to open the door for him, and he won last year’s storm-delayed tournament after shooting 69 <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3> in a driving rain and heavy winds that suspended play and then watching the leaders falter on <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-01-23">Monday</TIMEX3>. 
 
The only two players who have won the Farmers more often are Woods (seven of his 79 tour titles) and Phil Mickelson (three of his 42 tour titles), who moved up the leaderboard to 18th <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> after a third-round 68.
