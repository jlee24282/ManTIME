PROVINCETOWN — This Provincetown condominium offers significant space for a house so close to downtown. 
 
When entering from the back, a wooden gate leads to a quaint, well-landscaped yard, complete with a hot tub and small deck. 
 
The sliding glass door opens to the ground floor. On the right, there’s a living room with a gas fireplace and room in the wall for a television. To the left, the house has a fully modern kitchen. 
 
Windows line the stairs leading to the second floor, and a sunny master bedroom with a skylight and master bathroom. The loft-style room overlooks one end of the living room. 
 
The upstairs deck is what makes this property special. From the bedroom, a glass door takes you to the spacious, wooden deck and gorgeous views of Pilgrim Monument to the right and the landscaped yard straight ahead. 
 
With modern amenities and that coveted Provincetown charm, this home is a more than comfortable one for <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-SU">the summer</TIMEX3> or the whole year.
