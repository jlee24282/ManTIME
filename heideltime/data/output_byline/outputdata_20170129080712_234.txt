On <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="1914-02-19">Thursday, Feb. 19, 1914</TIMEX3>, the Irving Index newspaper reported: 
  
Mr. and Mrs. Charles Percy Schulze threw open their beautiful new home <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TEV">Saturday evening</TIMEX3> to one hundred and fifty invited guests. The housewarming was in the nature of a Valentine Party – the decorations and color scheme throughout being hearts, arrows and cupid in reds and yellows. 
  
Just as in the <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="1914">1914</TIMEX3> article description, there will be strings of hearts from the chandeliers. The lace draperies at the windows and dining table will have festoons of hearts and arrows. Rose Cannaday and Betty Fulbright are serving as co-chairs of this year’s event.
