A re-match was very close to not happening, though, with Nadal needing <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="PT4H">four hours</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="PT56M">56 minutes</TIMEX3> on Rod Laver Arena to finally see off a courageous Grigor Dimitrov 6-3 5-7 <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-07-06">7-6</TIMEX3> (7-5) <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-06-07">6-7</TIMEX3> (4-7) 6-4 in the match of the Australian Open so far. 
 
There are a range of reasons why the great Roger Federer is playing on <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29TNI">Sunday night</TIMEX3> in the final and Stan Wawrinka, who has won three majors since Fed's last grand slam title in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2012">2012</TIMEX3>, is not. Worryingly for Federer, three of these were on hard courts, including the <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2014">2014</TIMEX3> Australian Open semi-final. 
 
Swiss maestro Federer had defeated compatriot Wawrinka in the first semi-final on <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017-01-26">Thursday</TIMEX3> to enter the final that will be held at Melbourne Park on <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3>. 
 
The ninth-seeded Spaniard fought off two break points in the eighth game of the fifth set, then hit a backhand victor down the line to break Dimitrov in the next game and take a 5-4 lead. As the clock ticked <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28T24:00">past midnight</TIMEX3> and the match approached its fifth hour, Nadal drew on all his experience to prise a break in the ninth game and a chance to serve for the match . 
 
The big takeaway is Federer gets the extra day off to recover any adductor, as he says, issues he has and luckily for Roger it wasn't that long of a match nor that physical. 
 
"We never thought that we had the chance to be, again, in a final, and especially in the first of the year", Nadal said. I saw him (Federer) with a youthful attitude. 
 
Federer has won the Australian Open four times , the last being in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2010">2010</TIMEX3>. After losing his previous four 2006 meetings with Nadal, Federer dominated at the All England club over four sets to register his fourth consecutive Wimbledon title. The 14-time grand slam winner's familiar muscular groundstrokes continued to heap pressure on his younger opponent, playing in only his second slam semi. 
 
The record - 23-11 in Rafa's favour and a one-sided 9-2 in grand slam events - would suggest Roger should be on bended knee, praying that Grigor Dimitrov takes out his nemesis, as Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray were conveniently removed. Four of those losses came at Roland Garros, and, speaking immediately following his win over Wawrinka, Federer admitted that he may have allowed those early battles on Nadal's favored surface of clay to dictate the tone of their rivalry. 
 
Thirty-year-old Nadal, who was pushed all the way in a five-set match against German teenager Alex Zverev in the third round, disagreed that it was getting easier for the old guard at the grand slams. 
 
He was almost undone here by Dimitrov, who came within a whisker of reaching his first major final and showed why many still consider him to be a multiple champion of the future. 
 
The <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3> five-set epic final at Wimbledon is regarded by many as the best ever tennis match . "I worked hard to try to make that happen", Nadal said. "And I know he's leading in Grand Slam finals but I can push that aside". Nadal looked to be the favourite heading to the final set after taking the fourth 6-2, but Federer proved his quality by taking the decider 6-2. More importantly, Nadal has won the French Open nine times . 
 
The victory at Rod Laver Arena also ensured Serena Williams will regain the top ranking, which she lost in <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2016-09">September</TIMEX3> after 186 straight weeks when Angelique Kerber won the U.S. Open.
