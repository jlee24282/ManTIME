Night Ranger stepped out with their slamming electric guitar arrangements and brought classic rock 'n' roll to the SAP Center for the iHeart80s Party in San Jose, California on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TNI">Saturday night</TIMEX3> (<TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">January 28</TIMEX3>). 
 
The band -- Jack Blades , Brad Gillis , Kelly Keagy , Kerri Kelly , and Eric Levy -- brought the crowd to their feet with their guitar shredding classics " Rock In America ," " When You Close Your Eyes ," and " Don't Tell Me You Love Me ." The five-piece group also remembered a few highlights from their heyday ( Ronald Reagan 's presidential term, the birth of their album Midnight Madness , and the release of the original Ghostbusters film) before they performed their chart-topping power ballad, " Sister Christian ."
