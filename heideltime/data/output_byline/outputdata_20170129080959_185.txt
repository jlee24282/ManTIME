Mick Schumacher closed in on championship leader Joey Mawson after winning the third MRF Challenge race at the Buddh International Circuit.  
The German made a clean start to head the field with Harrison Newey losing a place to Mawson going into the Turn 1. 
 
While Schumacher kept his lead, Newey and Mawson were involved in a race long battle for the second position, with the Australian defending hard from the British driver. 
 
Eventually, Newey had to settle for third with Schumacher claiming a dominant win over championship leader Mawson to bridge the gap in the points table. 
 
Behind the leaders, Felipe Drugovich finished a distant fourth chased by Rinus van Kalmthout, the Dutchman once again ending up fifth <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-W04-WE">this weekend</TIMEX3>.
