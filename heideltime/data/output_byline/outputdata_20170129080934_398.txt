<TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01">January</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2016-07">July</TIMEX3> - That was how long Marcia Silva Rodriguez spent at my Montgomery County high school as an exchange student from Rio De Janeiro in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="1980">1980</TIMEX3>. 

I was a busy college student at the time. My sister Dana McAllister, Marcia, and I would spend time together on weekends going bowling and enjoying family dinners and fun times. 

After her studies at Plymouth Whitemarsh High School, Marcia returned to Rio to attend college and begin a career as a piano professor. This was pre-Facebook, so we rarely heard from her again, but for an occasional card at the holidays. 

Fast-forward <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P32Y">32 years</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2012">2012</TIMEX3>. I had such fond memories of befriending an exchange student I decided to become a host parent. From <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2012-08">August 2012</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2013-01">January 2013</TIMEX3>, I hosted a 16-year-old Brazilian girl, Isabella Corbi Silva, at my home. 

In a strange twist of serendipity, I got a friend request on Facebook from Marcia just after Isabella left the United States. "Come to Rio, you will like it here," she wrote. We emailed each other often, but traveling out of the country wasn't in the cards for me. 

After <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DURATION" value="P3Y">three years</TIMEX3>, I made a plane reservation for <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DURATION" value="P2W">two weeks</TIMEX3> in <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2016-08">August</TIMEX3>. The timing lined up with the <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3> Olympics in Rio, my birthday, and a <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DURATION" value="P3W">three-week</TIMEX3> vacation break for Marcia. 

Before the trip, I wanted to learn the language and rented a Portuguese CD to learn some basics: obrigado (thank you) and bom dia (good day) were my go-to phrases. 

My plane left JFK Airport for the <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DURATION" value="PT10H">10-hour</TIMEX3> flight from New York to Rio. With all the planning behind me, I finally had time to think about what was ahead. I hadn't seen Marcia in <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DURATION" value="P30Y" mod="MORE_THAN">more than 30 years</TIMEX3>. 

Would we get along? Would I like Brazilian food? Would I understand the language ? 

Marcia greeted me at the airport with a big smile and hug. Right away, I felt at ease. Her small apartment faced the lagoon not far from Ipanema Beach. <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EACH">Each day</TIMEX3> was filled with new adventures: strolling the famous streets of Rio, shopping at the Olympic store, seeing the famous Christ statue and the amazing views at Sugarloaf. There was never a dull moment. 

I was exhausted at night. The views from all over Rio left me mesmerized. I was welcomed by her family and friends. A bike-riding adventure started with a breakdown and ended with a windstorm and the kindness of a stranger to repair the bike again. 

As for my concerns about whether I would enjoy the food? I enjoyed it all, particularly a Brazilian treat, brigadeiro , a type of bonbon, in a variety of forms, including gelato, ice cream, and hot chocolate. 

During our adventures, we met people from all over the world: France, Poland, England and more. During our tour of the favela , or shantytown, we witnessed living conditions that were well beyond cramped. The residents struggle <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EACH">each day</TIMEX3> and, unfortunately, never leave their neighborhoods. We traveled by cab, bus, subway, car, and on foot. My birthday was memorable: I witnessed an Olympic rowing race; (Germany won), walked on the beach, and bought a sundress from a beach vendor. Then we had lunch next to the beach and listened to a band playing samba music. 

Although it was <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2017-WI">winter</TIMEX3> in Rio, the weather was just right, 65 to 75 degrees <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EACH">each day</TIMEX3>. 

Marcia loves to shop, and we managed to see every mall as well as a movie (in English with Portuguese subtitles) and a concert. I was constantly converting the prices in my head. We shared many laughs, fun times, and great memories. Yes, it was a long time coming but our friendship was renewed and I look forward to seeing her here in the U.S. in <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2017-08">August</TIMEX3>.
