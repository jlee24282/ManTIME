The United Nations Security Council resolutions on Cyprus remain the legal basis for a solution to the Cyprus problem according to Russia. 
 
Speaking to Phileleftheros, Russia’s Permanent Representative to the EU, Vladimir Chizhov, says that Russia’s presence and interest in the solution of the Cyprus problem is not to take a share of the bounty, but because it is a matter of international law. 
 
“The UN resolutions on Cyprus remain the legal basis for a solution. There are also the <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="1977">1977</TIMEX3> and 1979 agreements between Makarios- Denktash and Kyprianou-Denktash which have been forgotten by most,” explained Chizhov. 
 
“It was then when the Greek Cypriots accepted for the first time a bizonal, bicommunal federation,” added Chizhov. 
 
Although Cyprus is an EU member state, Chizhov points out that the Cyprus problem is an international issue. 
 
“As opposed to other states, Russia does not want to impose anything on Cyprus,” explained Chizhov continuing to say that Russia will accept whatever the Cypriots decide but again pointed out the international importance surrounding Cyprus. 
 
“The Cyprus problem has international ramifications that do not concern the two communities; it has to do with international law and Cyprus’ geographical position in the area – that is why Russia is involved,” he said. 
 
The major investments by Russian businessmen in Cyprus, according to Chizhov play a stabilising factor both economically and politically, that along with Russia’s continuous support for the UN presence in Cyprus are two important links in Russian-Cypriot relations. 
 
Although supporting every effort for a viable and just solution to the Cyprus problem, Chizhov believes that <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> is not the most opportune time as Turkey is moving to make some major constitutional changes and her leadership is firmly focused on the issue.
