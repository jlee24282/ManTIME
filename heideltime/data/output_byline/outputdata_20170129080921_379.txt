Louise Brown believes playing the Warrnambool Seaside Carnival will provide a sound platform for the club’s return to Big V competition. 

MERMAIDS coach Louise Brown believes the experience of playing the Warrnambool Seaside Carnival will provide a sound platform for the club’s return to Big V competition.

The Mermaids fell to Melbourne University in the carnival’s grand final on <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3>, but used it to blood a host of new players ahead of the Big V return <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017">this year</TIMEX3>.

Warrnambool’s top women’s team went by 10 points, while the Seahawks lost to Melbourne University by nine.

Brown was impressed by the new players on show and said the side was buzzing for the Big V season to begin.

“We came together <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-W02">two weeks ago</TIMEX3> as we held our trials in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-01" mod="START">early January</TIMEX3>. We have a squad of 17 girls at the moment which is really, really good,” she said.

“We had nine or 10 girls play over <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-W03-WE">the weekend</TIMEX3>, and it's been really pleasing to see how the new girls in the group. We have some girls from Portland who had never played with the group before.

“It was good for them to get some games with the girls to really get into our style of basketball and how we want to play. “From our point of view, <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-W04-WE">this weekend</TIMEX3> was a good success for us. Losing the final was disappointing but we won every other game.”

Brown said good performances at the carnival meant Mermaids coaching staff would have selection headaches when it was time to trim the squad to 12.

“All of the girls stood up and performed at some stage throughout the carnival. They are very promising signs and will make my job very difficult,” she said.

“Because the season doesn’t start until <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017-03-18">March 18</TIMEX3> we have <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="P1M">a month</TIMEX3> and half of pre-season and at the moment, we’re training twice and doing a fitness session <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="SET" value="P1W" freq="1">once a week</TIMEX3>.

“Because we have so many new girls too we just need to play together and to get used to each other so we’re fit and ready to go from round one.”

She earmarked youngster Taylah Nelson as one of the Mermaids’ most promising youngsters for the upcoming season.

Brown also conceded the return of Holly Green from Melbourne would be a godsend for the side.

“Taylah could play in a guard-type position – not quite a point guard – but she is a very nice shooter,” she said.

“She’s a very exciting junior and is quite raw but has a lot of potential. 

“Holly is another who is great to have in Mermaids colours again. She’s had a short break from the game but you wouldn’t be able to tell.” The Warrnambool Seahawks – led by playing coach Matt Alexander – were unable to get the job done on the back of success in the pool games. Hotel Warrnambool – the south-west over <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="194">40s</TIMEX3> team – went down by 31 points in the grand final to State Bank.
