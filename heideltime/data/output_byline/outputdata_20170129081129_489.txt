Demonetisation may have negligible impact on power sector as output grew by 8.53 percent in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2016-11">November</TIMEX3> and 6.13 percent in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2016-12">December</TIMEX3> year-on-year but the power ministry could not achieve the targeted electricity generation during the respective months. 
 
There was a fear that junking high-value currency notes of Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 will lead to slowdown in all segments in the economy including power sector. 
 
According to the Central Electricity Authority <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="SET" value="XXXX-XX">monthly</TIMEX3> report, total power generation in the country was 95.123 billion units (BUs) in <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2016-12">December 2016</TIMEX3>, which was 6.13 percent higher than 89.625 BUs electricity generation in the corresponding month <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2016">previous year</TIMEX3>. 
 
However, as per the report, the electricity generation target of 96.999 BUs could not be achieved in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2017-12">December</TIMEX3>. 
 
Similarly, the CEA report said power generation grew 8.53 percent in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2016-11">November</TIMEX3>, <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3> to 93.235 BUs compared to 85.904 BUs in <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2016-11">same month</TIMEX3> year ago. However, the target of 93.236 could not be achieved. 
 
"The generation in the month of <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2016-11">November</TIMEX3> was almost on track as there is not much difference in the actual output and target. But power generation is 1.8 BUs short of the targetted output in <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2017-12">December</TIMEX3>," said an expert. 
 
According to the CEA data, the per capita consumption of electricity was 1,075 units in <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3>-<TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2016">16</TIMEX3> as per provisional estimates. Therefore, output of 1.8 billion units could have lit thousands of houses in the country where a large number of people either live without electricity or face outages due to shortages in supply. 
 
However, Power Ministry data indicates that distribution companies collections increased by more than Rs 3,000 crore from <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2017-11-10">November 10</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2016-12-15">December 15, 2016</TIMEX3> compared to <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3> i.e. after the demonetisation move. 
 
According to the power ministry, this will help achieve affordable tariffs. 
 
North Bihar Power Distribution Company saw a 204 percent increase, NESCO in Odisha 251 percent, APDCL in Assam 97 percent and TANGEDCO in Tamil Nadu witnessed 97 percent rise in collections. 
 
However, the experts think that this has happened because people have parked their black money with discoms to pay their electricity due in advance for <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DURATION" value="PXM">many months</TIMEX3>. 
 
They think that such practice will not continue as utilities have already stopped honouring junked high-value currency notes of Rs 1,000 and Rs 5
