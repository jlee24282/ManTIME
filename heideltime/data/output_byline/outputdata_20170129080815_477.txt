The government will pay its top post-Brexit international trade negotiator, tasked with sealing deals from North America to New Zealand, more than the prime minister, according to a job vacancy advertised on an internal civil service website. “Soft” Brexit campaigners say the £160,000 salary is a sign of the struggle the government is having in attracting the skilled staff it needs after decades of trade deals being handled from Brussels. In particular, there are fears the UK’s much-vaunted move to “the front of the queue” for a deal with the Trump administration will see inexperienced officials overwhelmed by tougher US counterparts.Critics also think the salary is a waste of money for the first <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P2Y">two years</TIMEX3> of <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P5Y">the five-year</TIMEX3> contract because the UK will be unable to reach agreements until the terms of divorce from the EU are finalised in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2019">2019</TIMEX3>.Headhunter Russell Reynolds Associates is leading the search for the Department for International Trade’s chief trade negotiation adviser. The company says that even more than £160,000 “may be available for an exceptional candidate”. Theresa <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2016-05">May</TIMEX3> is paid just over £150,000 <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3>, while international trade secretary Liam Fox and other cabinet ministers are paid nearly £142,500. Angus MacNeil, who chairs the House of Commons international trade select committee, says a lack of domestic expertise means this and other senior negotiator roles will have to be filled by overseas candidates.He adds: “It is indicative of the fact the UK is desperately thinking ‘What <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3>? What next?’ that it is paying top dollar. People complained about a Brussels bureaucracy, but this is probably going to end up being doubled in a Westminster and Whitehall bureaucracy just to replicate that work.”Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron says: “Appointing a trade envoy on £160,000, who will be paid more than the prime minister, who cannot actually do their job for <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P2Y">two years</TIMEX3>, shows how frankly stupid this government is being over Brexit.” James McGrory, co-executive director of Open Britain, says: “The country desperately needs trade negotiators, but they’ve got to do a lot more than sit around while Liam Fox twiddles his thumbs for <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="P2Y">two years</TIMEX3> unable to start negotiations.”A Whitehall source insisted the salary reflected the “extensive experience” needed for the role. The job description asks for candidates who “have a personal reputation of the highest order among global trade professionals” and who can make sure the department will “develop and negotiate free trade agreements and market access deals with non-EU countries”.Final interviews for the job will take place in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2017-03">March</TIMEX3>, when the government will trigger the article 50 process that formalises Brexit negotiations. Fox hired Toby Orr, a senior partner at PR firm Portland, as his department’s director of communications, a role that was advertised with a salary of £120,000.A spokeswoman for the Department for International Trade says: “The new expert chief trade negotiation adviser will lead and support the establishment of a world-class trade negotiation function as the UK moves towards leaving the EU.“This role is part of our ongoing recruitment, enabling us to build a team from the widest pool of talent in the civil service and externally, across a range of policy expertise and international experience.” Go to MSN Home Up Next More in News AdChoices AdChoices More from The Guardian The Guardian View the Full Site Home News Weather Entertainment Sport Money Lifestyle Horoscopes Health & Fitness Food & Drink Cars Travel Dating © <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> Microsoft Privacy & Cookies Legal About our Ads Feedback Help MSN Worldwide Anti-Spam
