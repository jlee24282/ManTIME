While talking about board examinations and the stress which is borne by the students, PM Modi said, “Why should exam time be a time of stress or sadness? Do not think about exams as pressure; they should be celebrated as festivals. Smile more and score more. During exams there should be an environment of festivity, it will turn P for pressure into P for pleasure. When you are relaxed, the recall value will be more. Relaxation is the best tonic for memory. A happy mind is the secret of a good mark sheet. Exams are not a benchmark of your success in life. If your mission and ambition are in sync, marks will follow. Take small breaks, return to books feeling fresh. Try deep breathing it is very relaxing. P for prepare and P for play, the person who plays, shines. Deep breathing is beneficial during exams, it’ll keep you feeling fresh; Proper sleep will increase your concentration.” 
 
He gave the example of former President APJ Abdul Kalam and said, “He wasn’t able to get into the forces but this did not hamper him, otherwise we wouldn’t have had a great man like him.” While asking the students not to compete with others but to our own selves, he said, “You should compete with yourself to see how can <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="2017-01-30">tomorrow</TIMEX3> be made better than <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">yesterday</TIMEX3>. Only studying for marks will lead to shortcuts and one will limit himself or herself; It’s important to study for knowledge.” To make this more understandable he gave the example of cricket ledgend Sachin Tendulkar , “For <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DURATION" value="P20Y">20 years</TIMEX3> he kept breaking his own records hence getting better everytime. Root of problems are expectations, it is acceptance that makes things easy. Competing with others can make you unhappy and jealous. Compete with yourself and you will be energised & more determined to excel.” 
 
He even urged the parents of the students “to accept rather than expect”, he further said, “Our expectations from our children should not get heavy. Parents’ expectations are much heavier than the school bags of students.” Cheating is never beneficial, no one must resort to it. If you do it what will you tell your children?” 
 
PM Modi congratulated the Indian Coast Guards for completing <TIMEX3 tid="t37" type="DURATION" value="P40Y">40 years</TIMEX3> on <TIMEX3 tid="t34" type="DATE" value="2017-02-01">Feb 1, 2017</TIMEX3>. He said, “I thank all jawans and officials for serving the nation. They not only look after coastal vigilance but also coastal cleanliness, as they under took a cleanliness drive <TIMEX3 tid="t38" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3>. Not many know that our Coast Guard has women personnel also and they work at par with their counterparts.” In the end he gave his best wishes to the students by saing that,”Be confident, do well. My best wishes are with you. Make the best of it.”
