Thousands took to the streets of Broadway in downtown Los Angeles on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> for a festival that celebrated the movie palaces, architecture and urban beat of the famed street.

The event — which stretched from Third Street down to Olympic Boulevard — included performances on 10 stages as well as a variety of attractions.

Before the event, the office of Los Angeles City Councilman Jose Huizar estimated 60,000 would attend “Night On Broadway <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3>,” though no official numbers were available (an LAPD captain on Twitter estimated the crowd at more than 40,000) .

Night on Broadway started as a way of drawing attention to the commercial district, which in downtown L.A.’s heyday was home to many of the city’s grandest movie houses and its top shopping destination.

Most of the theater closed as demographic change swept downtown L.A. after World War II. But in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent years</TIMEX3>, Broadway has seen a revitalization that brought new restaurants and shops, notably the revival of Grand Central Market.

There are <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> plans to build a streetcar on Broadway.
