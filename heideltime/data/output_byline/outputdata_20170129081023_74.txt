Artist Rosie Ablewhite with Squadron Leader George 'Johnny' Johnson and her picture of him that has pride of place in his home. 
 Rosie Ablewhite, 27, who grew up in Long Bennington and studied fine art at Lincoln University, is <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> a professional artist. 
Her picture is of Mr Johnson as he is <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3> and when he was a young airman in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="0617">617</TIMEX3> Squadron, which took part in the daring raid to destroy German dams with bouncing bombs during the second world war. 

Rosie said she had read his book, The Last British Dambuster, which details his life, before deciding to do the picture. 

She used the book to help the research for the portraits, which took <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P3D">three days</TIMEX3> to complete. 

Rosie presented the picture to Mr Johnson at a meeting arranged through his friends in North Hykeham. 

“When they suggested I could see him and give him the picture I jumped at the chance,” she said. 

“It was a privilege. He knew I had done the portrait and was pleased with it.” 

The original <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> hangs on the wall above one of his favourite armchairs in his home. 

Prints have been sold in aid of the International Bomber Command Centre at Canwick Hill, Lincoln. 

One of the prints, signed for Rosie by Mr Johnson, has a special place in her studio in Lincoln. 

Mr Johnson, who grew up in Collingham and was a teacher at Highfields School, Newark, after the second world war, lives near Bristol. 
'He is inspirational'  
The only surviving British airman who took part in the <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="1943">1943</TIMEX3> Dambusters raid, he received the Distinguished Flying Medal for his part in it. 

A petition spearheaded by television personality Carol Vorderman, calling for Mr Johnson to be honoured with a knighthood, has been supported by more than 200,000 people. 

He previously told the Advertiser he would accept the honour if he could dedicate it to his Dambuster comrades and the other men of Bomber Command. 

Rosie said a knighthood would be a fitting honour to acknowledge the bravery of the airmen and the fundraising that Mr Johnson has since been involved in. 

“He is inspirational and needs to be recognised,” she said.
