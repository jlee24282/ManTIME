I’ve heard reports of people in public settings encountering someone who makes the assumption that everyone within their hearing agrees with their particular political stance and feels welcome to make comments that denigrate those they consider in opposition. Fortunately, I’ve never found myself in the path of this type of individual — but my husband did.

Upon entering a big box store where he and another individual worked to free shopping carts from their locked position with adjacent carts, the other shopper said to my husband, “Thank heaven we have only <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DURATION" value="P9D">nine more days</TIMEX3> to go.” My husband looked at him quizzically and the man replied, “. . . to get that (expletive) out of the White House.”
