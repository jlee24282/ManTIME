French Socialists are set to choose their candidate for <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017">this year</TIMEX3>'s presidential election <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3> in a runoff pitting pro-business ex-premier Manuel Valls against hard-left lawmaker Benoit Hamon. Hamon, who is often compared to British Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn , is favourite to beat Valls in the primary's head-to-head vote, but has little chance of winning the presidential race proper after <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P5Y">five years</TIMEX3> of unpopular Socialist rule.
