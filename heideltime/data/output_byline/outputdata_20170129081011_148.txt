It's a frosty start <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3> and drivers are urged to take care if they are on the road early. 
 
However, as with <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent days</TIMEX3>, the frost will lift and there should be some sunny spells but the late morning will see cloud and rain. 
 
Again temperatures will range from 6 to 8 degrees Celsius and winds will be moderate in strength, south to south east in direction.
