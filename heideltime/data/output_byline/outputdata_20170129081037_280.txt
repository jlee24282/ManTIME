Lying, cheating, lust, envy. Sin takes different forms, but it can all be traced back to one, common cause- the rejection of Christ’s kingship. On The Bible Study Hour, we’ll study Psalm chapter 2 - a complex passage with a mysterious purpose. Join us as Dr. Boice explains how we each have an important role to play in proclaiming Christ as King.

Out of that meeting came "The Cambridge Declaration," a document calling Christians to repent of their cultural worldliness and to recover the great salvation doctrines of the Bible as the Reformers did in <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DATE" value="15">the sixteenth century</TIMEX3>. This organization <TIMEX3 tid="t34" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> produces The Bible Study Hour, Modern Reformation and God's Word <TIMEX3 tid="t35" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Today</TIMEX3> magazines, and sponsors many conferences and seminars. 

A prolific author, Dr. Boice wrote or contributed to over sixty books on a wide variety of biblical and theological themes. His 4-volume commentary on Romans was named one of the best books of <TIMEX3 tid="t36" type="DATE" value="19">the twentieth century</TIMEX3>. Other popular titles include Standing on the Rock, The Parables of Jesus, The Christ of <TIMEX3 tid="t37" type="DATE" value="2017-12-25">Christmas</TIMEX3>, Christ's Call to Discipleship...
