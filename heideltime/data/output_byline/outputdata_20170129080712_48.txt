Ryan Scholz, 20, has been bowling in leagues for only <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P6Y">six  years</TIMEX3>. In his Walkill Valley Regional High School League, he was put on the varsity bowling team in his freshman year. 
 
More <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3>, though, he has had coaching sessions by PBA Hall of Famer Teata Semiz at Sparta Lanes. “He taught me everything. I watched some YouTube videos with him, then I kept practicing and practicing to get better.” 
 
And <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3>, in the <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="TIME" value="2017-01-26TNI">Thursday Night</TIMEX3> Mixed League at Sparta Lanes, he rolled 234-203-300 for a 737. It should be noted that he also rolled back-to-back 279s for his high of 780 <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017-W03">the previous week</TIMEX3>. For perfection, he used a Storm Punch Out drilled by Phil Rapavi of the former Precision Fit Pro Shop at Circle Lanes. 
 
Was he nervous? “My friends said that I was shaking, so I was a little nervous at first. Generally, though, I don’t get nervous. The (12th) shot was clean off my hand and boom, was there. I stay focused and consistent.  That’s how you can be a good bowler.” 
 
He will be bowling in the upcoming Masters tournament at Sparta and hopes to do well. His <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2017-02-02">Thursday</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2017-02-03">Friday</TIMEX3> leagues will provide some good practice before the <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2017-02-12">Feb. 12</TIMEX3> tournament. 
 
He dedicated his 300 to “my mother, Valeire, because she got me into bowling so that I could make friends. She is an amazing mother. I also thank Teata for all of his coaching and my other coach, Kaitlyn Egan. They are both awesome bowlers and without them I probably wouldn’t be bowling.” He also cited Tink Washer for letting this writer know about his achievement. 
 
Speaking of Washer, Tink saw his 23rd perfect game, this in the <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="TIME" value="2017-01-26TNI">Thursday Night</TIMEX3> Mixed League at Sparta Lanes.  He used a DV8 Grudge Hybrid drilled by Tom Laskow of the Pro Edge Pro Shop. He was subbing in the league and posted 247-235-300 for 782. 
 
The Professional Bowlers Association bowling community as well as the University of Akron (OH) and many more mourn the loss of Margaret “Peggy” Elias, widow of PBA founder Eddie Elias, who passed on <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2017-01-24">January 24th</TIMEX3>. This former Miss Ohio went from being a beauty queen, model and performer to being a wife and mother. I was fortunate to have met her at my first and subsequent Firestone Tournaments of Champions. She asked me to take a photo of her with Eddie at our “celebrity” pro-am following the victory banquet. This was before cell phones and selfies.  I was at her table at the PBA 50 banquet and you would never know who she was, and all she had achieved, even after her husband’s death. Peggy was kind to everybody and anybody. 
 
She was instrumental in creating the Edward G. Elias Bowling Center at the University of Akron (OH). The annual college bowling Tournament is the country’s only collegiate bowling competition that offers cash prizes toward tuition. “In lieu of flowers, Peggy hopes you will consider helping young people with a gift to the Edward G. Elias Bowling Tournament at www.uakron.edu/donate or with a donation to St. Jude’s at www.stjude.org/give.” <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Today</TIMEX3>, the wake will be in Fairlawn OH from 6-<TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29T20:00">8 p.m.</TIMEX3> with services <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2017-01-30">tomorrow</TIMEX3> at the Faith Lutheran church in Fairlawn. Condolences may be expressed at www.catavolosfuneralhome.com.

For the girls it was Lauren Marks, 249 (old record was 247), Paige Piombino, 212 and Emma Thies, 212. Montville won the team event with <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="1140">1140</TIMEX3>.
