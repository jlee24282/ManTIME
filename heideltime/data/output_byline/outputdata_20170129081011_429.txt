Joachim Blichfeld scored with just <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="PT4S">four seconds</TIMEX3> remaining in the third period to complete a four-goal rally, as the Portland Winterhawks downed the Kelowna Rockets 5-4 in WHL action <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> at Prospera Place. 
 
The Winterhawks fought back from a <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="PT4S">4</TIMEX3>-<TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="PT1S">1 second period</TIMEX3> deficit to hand the Rockets their fifth loss in the last six games—all by one goal. 
 
Nick Merkley had a goal and two assists for Kelowna, while Reid Gardiner, Kyle Topping and Gordie Ballhorn also scored in the loss. 
 
Former West Kelowna Warriors goaltender Shane Farkas made 31 saves in the Portland goal, while Michael Herringer stopped 31 shots for Kelowna. 
 
The loss, combined with a Victoria win over Vancouver, dropped the Rockets two points back of the Royals for third spot in the B.C. Division. 
 
The Rockets (27-19-4-0) were without defenceman Cal Foote and forward Kole Lind who were on their way to Quebec City for <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-01-23">Monday</TIMEX3>'s NHL/CHL Top Prospects Game. 
 
Kelowna returns to action on <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="TIME" value="2017-01-25TNI">Wednesday night</TIMEX3> at Prospera Place against the Calgary Hitmen.
