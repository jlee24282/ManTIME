Page 3 of 6 News Qatar  Qatar's trade surplus reaches QR10.75bn in <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DATE" value="2017-12">December</TIMEX3> – A surge in value of crude exports, ahead of the <TIMEX3 tid="t34" type="DATE" value="2017-01-01">January 1</TIMEX3> deadline for production cuts, helped Qatar's trade surplus reach QR10.75bn in <TIMEX3 tid="t35" type="DATE" value="2016-12">December 2016</TIMEX3>, showing a stupendous growth of 21.7% YoY and 10.7% MoM. Japan, South Korea, India, China and Singapore were among the largest export markets of Qatar, while imports mainly came from the US, the UAE, China, Japan and Germany in <TIMEX3 tid="t38" type="DATE" value="2016-12">December 2016</TIMEX3>, figures released by the Ministry of Development Planning and Statistics showed. Higher exports and lower imports had resulted in Qatar's MoM gain in trade surplus, while on a yearly basis, imports decelerated much faster than exports. A robust expansion in shipments to Singapore and China led the country’s total exports (valued free-on-board) grow 2.6% MoM to QR19.29bn. On a yearly basis, total exports had fallen 2.6%. The country’s total exports of domestic products increased 3.5% MoM to QR18.58bn in <TIMEX3 tid="t41" type="DATE" value="2016-12">December 2016</TIMEX3>, while it recorded 3% YoY decline. (Gulf-Times.com)  CI affirms Qatar’s foreign, local currency ratings, upgrades outlook to ‘stable’ from ‘negative’ – Global credit rating agency Capital Intelligence (CI) has affirmed Qatar’s long-term foreign currency and local currency ratings of ‘AA-’ and its short-term foreign and local currency ratings of ‘A1+’, while upgrading the outlook for ratings to ‘stable’ from ‘negative’. The outlook revision reflects the resilience of the Qatari economy to low hydrocarbon prices, as seen by the continuation of positive economic growth and maintenance of comfortable fiscal and external buffers, CI said, adding the revision also factored in its expectation of narrowing fiscal and external <TIMEX3 tid="t44" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> account deficits in <TIMEX3 tid="t42" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3>-<TIMEX3 tid="t43" type="DATE" value="2018">18</TIMEX3>. The Qatari economy is expected to have grown by about 3.4% in <TIMEX3 tid="t45" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3> against 3.3% <TIMEX3 tid="t49" type="DATE" value="2015">a year ago</TIMEX3>, underpinned by a 6% expansion in non-hydrocarbon gross domestic product (GDP) and is slated to grow at a similar rate in <TIMEX3 tid="t46" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3>-<TIMEX3 tid="t47" type="DATE" value="2018">18</TIMEX3>. The public finances remain “manageable”, despite budget “deterioration”, it said, adding the budget is expected to have posted a deficit of 2.7% in <TIMEX3 tid="t52" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3> against 1.2% surplus in <TIMEX3 tid="t53" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3>. Assuming a modest rise in hydrocarbon prices in the short-to-intermediate term and government measures to rationalise public spending, CI expects the deficit to decline over the <TIMEX3 tid="t54" type="DATE" value="FUTURE_REF">coming years</TIMEX3>. (Gulf-Times.com)  Private healthcare spending to grow at a faster pace – According to BMI, a Fitch company, Qatar’s private healthcare expenditure is expected to grow at 8.8% in <TIMEX3 tid="t58" type="DURATION" value="P10Y">the next 10 years</TIMEX3>, faster than the 5.8% in public healthcare, offering abundant opportunities especially for global drug manufacturers. Highlighting that the healthcare expenditure in Qatar is slated to grow steadily from QR15.4bn in <TIMEX3 tid="t59" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3> to QR27.1bn in <TIMEX3 tid="t60" type="DATE" value="2026">2026</TIMEX3>, it said, this is a moderate <TIMEX3 tid="t61" type="DURATION" value="P10Y">10-year</TIMEX3> CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 5.8% in local currency and US dollar terms. Qatar’s public expenditure was about 84% of overall health expenditure in <TIMEX3 tid="t62" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3> but as healthcare costs increase rapidly on an ageing population and a rising chronic disease burden, the model of almost-free medical services will be increasingly seen as “unsustainable”, and the private sector is being engaged to share some of the financial burden, it said. (Gulf-Times.com)  Qatar economic growth to pick up in <TIMEX3 tid="t63" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> – According to Qatar Investment Fund (QIF) report, the recovery in oil price and a strong expansion in non-hydrocarbons should help Qatar effectively manage the future interest rate hikes, helping the country's economic growth to pick up in <TIMEX3 tid="t64" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3>. London Stock Exchange-listed QIF in its report for 4Q2016 said, "The investment adviser expects Qatari economic growth to pick up in <TIMEX3 tid="t65" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3>, amid the recovery in oil prices and a strong growth in the non-hydrocarbon sector.” Its investment adviser is Qatar Insurance Company. This should help the economy to face the rate hike over the course of the year, whose top 10 Qatari portfolios include QNB Group (19.4% of its net asset value), Industries Qatar (11.7%), Masraf Al Rayan (9.2%), Qatar Electricity and Water (7.9%), Qatar Islamic Bank (7.4%), Nakilat (6.4%), Ooredoo (5.9%), Barwa (4.9%), Gulf International Services (3.8%) and Commercial Bank (3.6%). (Gulf-Times.com)  QIF's exposure to UAE market rises in 4Q2016 – Qatar Investment Fund’s (QIF) exposure to the UAE market has grown up. The exposure of the Fund in the market has reached 6.8% of net asset value (NAV) by the end of 4Q2016. It was 4.3% in 3Q2016, latest data released by the UK-based closed- ended investment company showed. According to the QIF’s fourth quarterly investment report, the Fund had 23 holdings, 16 in Qatar and seven in the UAE, while in 3Q2016 it had 22 (17 in Qatar and five in UAE) at the end of 3Q2016. The report revealed that QIF added three holdings during <TIMEX3 tid="t66" type="DATE" value="2016-Q4">the quarter</TIMEX3>, which included Qatar International Islamic Bank (QIIK), Air Arabia and First Gulf Bank, while the Fund sold its holdings in Vodafone Qatar and Qatar First Bank. Providing sector wise investment exposure, the report said that QIF remains overweight in the Qatar banking sector (including financial services) at 42.4% of NAV (market weighting 38.4%). QNB group remains QIF’s largest holding accounting for 19.4% of NAV. For the period from <TIMEX3 tid="t71" type="DATE" value="2016-01">January</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t70" type="DATE" value="2016-12">December 2016</TIMEX3>, credit in Qatar grew 12.1%, mainly driven by the public sector (up 25.7%). The Investment Adviser believes that public sector loan growth will remain strong, driven by the government’s infrastructure development plans and a rising population. Industrials remain QIF’s second largest exposure at 25.8% of NAV, mainly in Industries Qatar (11.7% of NAV). (Peninsula Qatar)  QNBK: IMF tinkers with growth forecasts, but is still too optimistic – QNB group said that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has kept its forecasts for global growth in <TIMEX3 tid="t72" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> unchanged at 3.4% in the latest update of its World Economic Outlook. QNBK said the overall number “masked some tinkering” with the composition of global growth since the IMF’s last round of forecasts made in <TIMEX3 tid="t75" type="DATE" value="2016-10">October 2016</TIMEX3>. The projection for growth in advanced economies (AEs) was revised up by 0.1 percentage points (pps) to 1.9%, while growth for emerging markets (EMs) was revised down by 0.1 pps to 4.5%. QNBK said, “However, we view the forecasts as over-optimistic and expect them to be revised down in the future, particularly given the IMF’s track record in <TIMEX3 tid="t76" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent years</TIMEX3> of consistent downward revisions to global growth projections.” (Gulf- Times.com)  4.

(Gulf- Times.com) International  US economy slows on wider trade gap; business spending rises – US economic growth slowed sharply in 4Q2016 as a fall in shipments of soybeans weighed on exports, but steady consumer spending and rising business investment pointed to sustained strength in domestic demand. Gross domestic product increased at a 1.9% annual rate, the Commerce Department said in its first estimate of 4Q2016 GDP. The economy grew at a 3.5% annual rate in 3Q2016. The slowdown masked a surge in home building spending and a rebound in business investment on equipment after four straight quarterly declines. The economy expanded 1.6% for all of <TIMEX3 tid="t93" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3>, the worst performance since <TIMEX3 tid="t94" type="DATE" value="2011">2011</TIMEX3>, as it struggled with weak oil prices, a strong dollar and efforts by businesses to reduce a large inventory overhang. (Reuters)  UK consumers turn more confident after <TIMEX3 tid="t95" type="DATE" value="2017-12">December</TIMEX3> dip – British consumer confidence showed its biggest <TIMEX3 tid="t99" type="SET" value="XXXX-XX">monthly</TIMEX3> improvement since <TIMEX3 tid="t97" type="DATE" value="2016-SU">last summer</TIMEX3> in <TIMEX3 tid="t96" type="DATE" value="2017-01">January</TIMEX3>, a latest sign that the Brexit vote has yet to unsettle the households who are driving Britain's economy.

Their spending power is expected to be hurt by rising prices caused by the fall in the value of the pound after the Brexit vote.

(Reuters) Regional  Projects spending in <TIMEX3 tid="t141" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> are likely to grow in GCC– According to Ed James, Director of Content and Analysis at MEED Projects, the best case scenario for projects spending in the GCC in <TIMEX3 tid="t142" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> is $151bn, whilst the worst case is $112bn. He said, “Our analysis suggests that Saudi Arabia and the UAE will be the largest markets in the region in <TIMEX3 tid="t143" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> for projects. With all countries in the GCC, bar Kuwait, experiencing a budget deficit in <TIMEX3 tid="t144" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3>, we will start to see greater diversification of revenue, including more initial public offerings (IPOs) and borrowing, and a decrease of spending commitments in non-project areas, such as reducing exposure to tariffs and subsidies, employee perks and bonuses.” (GulfBase.com)  Saudi Arabia banks likely to outperform GCC counterparts – Despite challenges, with a return on assets of 1.9% as of year- end <TIMEX3 tid="t145" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3> versus 2% in <TIMEX3 tid="t146" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3>, Saudi Arabia banks’ profitability are expected to continue to outperform other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) banking systems. In <TIMEX3 tid="t147" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3>, Saudi Arabia banks reported a 5.4% YoY decrease in net profits, mainly because of rising provisioning charges, a credit negative. The provisioning increase reflects asset quality challenges amid low oil prices. Keeping in view the 2016 results, Moody’s expect that Saudi Arabia banks’ profits will remain challenged in <TIMEX3 tid="t149" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> amid an increasing cost of risk and subdued credit growth that, despite easing funding costs, will negatively affect top-line revenues.

The outlook is stable. The downgrade reflects an accumulation of government debt above our expectations for <TIMEX3 tid="t153" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3> and our revised assumption of elevated fiscal expenditure over <TIMEX3 tid="t154" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3>-<TIMEX3 tid="t155" type="DATE" value="2020">2020</TIMEX3>, leading to a slower fiscal consolidation path. Sharjah's debt as a percentage of GDP has rapidly increased since <TIMEX3 tid="t156" type="DATE" value="2014">2014</TIMEX3>, due to persistent fiscal deficits and increased capital spending. Although S&P project the Emirate's economy will gradually recover in <TIMEX3 tid="t157" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3>-<TIMEX3 tid="t158" type="DATE" value="2020">2020</TIMEX3>, fiscal consolidation will be slower than they initially anticipated. S&P said they expect interest expenditures to stay above 5% of revenues over this period, despite the likely introduction of revenue-raising measures. Sharjah's fiscal underperformance below their expectations has resulted in a rapid increase in the Emirate's debt burden.
