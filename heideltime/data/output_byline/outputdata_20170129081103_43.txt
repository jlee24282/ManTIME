Ozark Christian College's men couldn't hold an early lead and the women's struggles from the floor continued as both squads were upended by Barclay College on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> at OCC. The men lost 86-79. The Lady Ambassadors fell 58-57. 
 
OCC men 
 
Coming out hot, the Ambassadors held the biggest lead of the game, 33-17, over Barclay midway through <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-H1">the first half</TIMEX3>. But a 27-8 run by the Bears to close out the half erased the lead and sent the Ambassadors to the locker room trailing 44-41. 
 
From there, the Bears would remain in the driver's seat.  
 
In a game that was close most of the way, the Bears were able to distance themselves thanks to performances at the free throw line and from their bench. Committing just 11 fouls in the game, the Bears held the Ambassadors to just seven free throws off 13 attempts. Barclay, meanwhile, hit 26-of-37 attempts thanks to 27 OCC infractions.  
 
Bench play was also one of the few lopsided stats, as Bears reserves outscored the Ambassadors 29-16. 
 
Jay Bradley led the Bears with 18 points and eight rebounds, while Quinton Walker had 16 and 7, respectively. Tommy Leach scored 11 in the win, while Key Maloney added 10. 
 
Dawson Allmoslecher had a big game for the Ambassadors, scoring 24 points and pulling down 10 boards. Miles Dressler followed with 15 points, while Andrew Mayes had 14. 
 
OCC fell to 7-13 and 2-5 in conference.

A close game that featured nine lead changes and four ties, Barclay played superb defense before holding off a huge surge by the Lady Ambassadors in the first. 
 
Holding OCC to single digits in each of the first (nine) and third (eight) quarters, Barclay needed 23 points of its own in the fourth to stave off a 29-point rally from the Lady Ambassadors. 
 
Despite cranking 71 shots, the Lady Ambassadors hit just 20 (28.2 percent) — including a 4-of-20 (20 percent) from beyond the arc. OCC's struggles weren't exclusive to any area of the floor — the Lady Ambassadors made just 13-of-28 free throw attempts. 
 
Patrolling the paint, Sarah Easterwood paced the Bears with 21 points, while Leilani Carrasco chipped in 13 points and 10 rebounds. 
 
Kameryn Dennis had a big game for OCC, netting 15 points with 20 rebounds, five assists and two blocked shots. Baylee Hilton led the Ambassadors with 18 points, while Madison Brost added 10. 
 
The Ambassadors return to action on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-01-24">Tuesday</TIMEX3> at Ecclesia College in Springdale, Arkansas.
