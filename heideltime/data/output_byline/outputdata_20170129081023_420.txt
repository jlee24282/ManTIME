It's a song built on self-narration and proclamations of gratitude -- perhaps a kind of State of the Union address for the big 3-6? "That's What's Up" would have been right at home on her <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3> album Here. 
 
"You want me to give you a testimony about my life/ And how good he's been to me/ I don't know what to tell you about him/ I love him so much with all my heart and my soul/ With every bone in my body I love him so much/ Because he's done so much for me," she wails.
