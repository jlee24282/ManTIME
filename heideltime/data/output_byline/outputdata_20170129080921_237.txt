Out of the 403 assembly seats in Uttar Pradesh, Congress will be contesting in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="0105">105</TIMEX3> and SP in the rest of 298 seats. Days after stitching up an electoral alliance for the upcoming Uttar Pradesh assembly polls, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi and Samajwadi party president Akhilesh Yadav arrived in Lucknow for a joint press conference on <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3>. This will be followed by a joint road show in the state capital. The meeting also assumes significance as this would be the maiden outing of the two leaders since reaching a seat-sharing agreement for the polls, which starts from <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-02-11">February 11</TIMEX3>. Out of the 403 assembly seats, Congress will be contesting in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="0105">105</TIMEX3> and SP the rest of 298 seats. With an aim to tell people that the two parties were their choice in the elections, Rahul and Akhilesh would launch a poll campaign with a tagline – UP ko ye saath pasand hai (UP relishes this alliance). The duo are expected to send out a strong message to party cadres from both sides, urging them to work together to ensure the defeat of BJP and BSP.
