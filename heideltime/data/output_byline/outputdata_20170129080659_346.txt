Throughout his adult life, Oklahoma has looked to Boren for leadership as a legislator, governor, U.S. senator and university president. 
   
As governor, he was a reformer when Oklahoma desperately needed reform. The state’s open government laws, requirements for recorded votes by the Legislature, campaign finance disclosure and competitive bidding reforms all date from the days of the Boren Broom Brigade. 
   
In <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="1979">1979</TIMEX3>, he moved on to the U.S. Senate, where he was a consistent voice of moderation and compromise. Boren joked that while the Democrats sat on one side of the Senate aisle and the Republicans on the other, he sometimes felt the need to pull his desk into the aisle. 
   
He was consistently the most popular elected official in the state because he spoke not for party or for personal promotion, but for the people of Oklahoma. 
   
Oh, that there were a few more David Borens in the Senate <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3>. 
   
In <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="1994">1994</TIMEX3>, Boren left the Senate to become the 13th president of the University of Oklahoma, and, as remarkable as it may seem, he has managed to overshadow his record in elective office with his work in academic office. 
   
Under Boren’s leadership, OU has gone through a golden era of physical and academic rebuilding. The university has initiated more than 35 new programs and raised more than $2.5 billion in private gifts. The Norman campus has been rebuilt virtually from end to end. The number of endowed faculty positions has risen from 94 to 562. The number of private scholarships for students have quadrupled. And the school has consistently been among the top universities in the nation in recruiting National Merit Scholars. 
   
In Tulsa, Boren’s leadership was critical in the establishment of the Schusterman campus and the School of Community Medicine, jointly built with the University of Tulsa. 
   
Did we mention that he was a Rhodes Scholar? Or that he led the efforts to free Nelson Mandela? Or that he established the Oklahoma Foundation for Excellence as governor and continues as its chairman <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3>? 
   
There is more, but one editorial is not sufficient to sum up David Boren’s lifetime of accomplishments. 
   
Congratulations, President Boren on an outstanding record. We hope you’re planning to stick around. We’ve still got work to be done.
