Ipswich Town manager Mick McCarthy says there is no way Tom Lawrence will be joining Leeds United in the <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01">January</TIMEX3> transfer window. 

Lawrence is <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> on a season-long loan with Ipswich from Premier League champions Leicester City but the <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P23Y">23-year</TIMEX3>-olds form has seen a number of clubs being linked with a <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01">January</TIMEX3> move for the forward, including Leeds in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent days</TIMEX3>. 

Sunderland, Newcastle, Derby, Cardiff and QPR have also been linked but McCarthy says, Lawrence, who netted his sixth goal in his last six games in the draw at Preston North End on <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>, is not leaving Portman Road before the end of the season. 

"I spoke to Leicester, I spoke to (Foxes director of football) Jon Rudkin the other day and as far as they`re concerned he`s with us," McCarthy told The Green Un . 

"We`ve a commitment to them to the end of the season and they`ve a commitment to us. 

"And the only way that can be broken if we say 'We don`t want Tom Lawrence`. Well that`s going to happen, isn`t it? 

"There are clubs interested. I think Cardiff are interested, I was told that QPR are interested and I`ve also been told that Leeds were interested and I also spoke to Leeds and told them that he`s with us to the end of the season so they`re kind of p***ing in the wind. It`s not going to happen. 

"Leicester haven`t received any bids. He`s with us. No way, any how will I be sanctioning Tom Lawrence going anywhere else. That categorical enough?" 

With just <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P2D" mod="MORE_THAN">over two-days</TIMEX3> remaining before the <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2017-01">January</TIMEX3> transfer window closes, Leeds are still to add to the squad <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017-01">this month</TIMEX3> with only on loan Pablo Hernandez turning his loan deal with the club into a permanent move. 

Three players have left the club with midfielders Luke Murphy and Toumani Diagouraga leaving the club on loan and Alex Mowatt making a permanent switch to Barnsley on <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3>. 

The sale of Mowatt to Barnsley had Leeds head coach Garry Monk telling the press ahead of the clash with Sutton United <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3> that Leeds needed to bring in a couple of additions before the window closes at <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29T23:00">11pm</TIMEX3> on <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="TIME" value="2017-01-24TEV">Tuesday evening</TIMEX3>.
