NEW BRAUNFELS â€” A 30-year-old Dallas man is charged in New Braunfels with human trafficking and is accused of prostituting a 14-year-old runaway girl from Dallas. 
 
Authorities said Roderick Tasby was pulled over for speeding on Interstate 35 and when a New Braunfels smelled marijuana in the vehicle, Tasby and his teenage passenger were detained. Authorities subsequently determined she was listed as a runaway and had multiple online escort ads indicating she was involved in prostitution in Austin, San Antonio and Louisiana. The Austin American-Statesman reported police also determined Tasby was involved in facilitating her prostitution.
