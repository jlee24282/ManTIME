Keen to spend <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P1WE">a weekend</TIMEX3> away in the great outdoors? Here are five excellent camping options that are driving distance from Dubai…  White Sands Beach  
Perfect for: Beach-loving campers

The lowdown: White Sands Beach isn’t an official area, but rather a nickname given to a stretch of coastline in Oman located between Fins and Wadi Shab. We won’t lie – it’s a long drive, but well worth it to pitch your tent on a cliff above an empty sandy beach and fall asleep to the sound of the waves. Plus, the remote nature of the area means you hopefully won’t have to share your spot with many other campers. 
 
Things to do in the area: For water babies, it’s the perfect camping spot. Bring your snorkels and paddleboards for exploring the coastline (keep an eye out for sea urchins near the beach though). Be sure to visit Wadi Shab just a short drive away, where you can hike through the dramatic wadis and cool off by diving into the deep, emerald green pools. 
 
Difficulty rating: 3/5.  Medium. It’s not a complicated route, but the long drive is not one you’d want to take alone. 
 
4×4 needed? Not essential, but recommended. 
 
Time: <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="PT7H">Seven hours</TIMEX3> 
 
Directions from Dubai: Drive towards Muscat but just before you get to the city, get on the new Muscat Expressway. Head in the direction of Sur and follow the coastline until you find a good spot.

 Liwa  
Perfect for: Desert adventurers and Star Wars fans

The lowdown:  It’s been <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P1Y" mod="LESS_THAN">nearly a year</TIMEX3> since Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens hit our screens, and we’re still excited at the prospect of visiting one of the filming locations. Liwa is located in the Empty Quarter, or Rub Al Khali, the largest sand desert in the world. We can’t guarantee that you’ll find an abandoned Millennium Falcon, but you will experience incredible (and massive) sand dunes, miles of wilderness and some of the brightest starry nights you’ll ever see in the UAE. 
 
Things to do in the area:  We recommend renting a couple of fat bikes beforehand (you can pick one up from Adventure HQ for Dhs150 per day): there’s nothing better than zipping across the dunes on their puffy tyres, especially as the sun is setting. Experienced off-roaders will have a blast doing a bit of dune bashing, but keep in mind that this is not an easy area to get out of if you get into trouble: carry plenty of food and water, and don’t travel in convoys of less than three 4x4s, just in case someone needs towing. 
 
Difficulty rating:   4/5.  Medium to hard. It’s relatively simple to find, but you’ll need some off-roading skills if you want to head off the beaten path and into the dunes. It’s not one for beginners – we recommend travelling with an experienced group. 
 
4×4 needed?  Essential  
 
Time:  <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="PT4H">Four hours</TIMEX3> 
 
Directions from Dubai:  Drive from Dubai to Abu Dhabi, take the E11, turn on to E65 to Emirates National Auto Museum. Keep following the E65 until you see the sign to Qasr Al Sarab. Ignore it – follow the road right instead. 
 Al Qudra Lakes  
Perfect for: Beginners 
 

 
The lowdown:  Al Qudra Lakes is the ideal location if you’re new to camping in the UAE, or just looking for a low-key break from the city that won’t require a huge amount of effort. You won’t need a 4×4 to reach these picturesque lakes, and the area is within half an hour’s drive of the city. Keep in mind that because it’s so easily accessible, it’s popular with   weekend warriors. 
 
Things to do in the area:  Al Qudra Lakes might be manmade but it’s still a picturesque slice of greenery, with plenty of trees and wildlife, especially birds, to be spotted in and around the water. If you’re feeling sporty you could also go for a bike around the nearby Al Qudra Cycle Track, where you might also spot wild oryx and gazelle (rent a bike from the Trek store). If the great outdoors get too much for you, there’s always Bab Al Shams Resort And Spa nearby for a little R&R. It’s unlikely you’ll need it though, as there are plenty of amenities in the area. 
 
Difficulty rating: 1/5.  An easy to reach spot with minimal off-roading. 
 
4×4 needed?  No 
 
Time: Half <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="PT1H">an hour</TIMEX3> 
 
Directions from Dubai: Take Hessa Street to the start of Al Qudra Cycle Track, turn left, turn right and take the off-road track. Follow it until you find a good spot. 
 Fossil Rock, Sharjah  
Perfect for:  Day trippers and desert newbies 
 

 
The lowdown:  Fossil Rock is one of the most popular hangout spots for Dubai’s weekend warriors, from dune bashers and dune buggy riders to trail runners. The surrounding dunes are the perfect location to set up camp, especially for large groups who don’t mind a bit of noise and excitement. It’s also close enough to civilisation that newbies can feel comfortable knowing their home comforts are not too far away. 
 
Things to see and do: This is one of the best places in the UAE for a spot of dune bashing, but we recommend it for experienced off-roaders only. The Camel Rock nearby is also worth a visit, as is Big Red, a huge red dune that’s popular with dune buggying daredevils. 
 
Difficulty rating: 2/5.  E asy to medium – it’s simple to get to, but requires some off-roading skills. 
 
4×4 needed?  Essential for navigating the sand dunes. 
 
Time:  <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="PT1H">One hour</TIMEX3> 
 
Directions from Dubai:  Take the 611 towards Sharjah. Turn right onto the Sharjah-Kalba Road, then turn right again at the big junction surrounded by pylons. 
 Jebel Shams, Oman  
Perfect for: Outdoor explorers 
 
Photo: Pete Maloney 
  
The lowdown:  If you’ve never been to Oman before you need to add Jebel Shams to your bucket list. Also known as the ‘Grand Canyon Of Oman’, the scenery here is breathtaking – rugged mountains, towering cliffs and the canyon itself. There’s an official campsite near the start of the hike, but bear in mind that temperatures are likely to be lower than you’re used to in Dubai. 
 
Things to do: The main attraction of Jebel Shams is the balcony walk inside the canyon itself. Despite the awe-inspiring scenery, the single-track hike itself is actually very easy and relatively flat. Out and back takes <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="PT1H">about an hour</TIMEX3> – there’s an old, historic mud village at the end of the track where you can take a break to have a bite. We also recommend a drive to nearby Misfat Al Abriyeen, an old traditional village that’s home to stunning architecture and a lush date plantation. 
 
Difficulty ratin g:  3/5.   Medium. It’s a popular tourist site, but the drive is long. 
 
4×4 needed?  Not essential, but highly recommended to navigate some of the hills. 
 
Time:  <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DURATION" value="PT5H">Five hours</TIMEX3> 
 
Directions from Dubai:  Drive to Al Ain and through the border. Don’t forget your passport. Head south towards Nizwa and drive through Ibri and Bala.
