“It will be mainly cloudy with one or two light rain patches,” he said. “Visibility will be relatively low in some areas. There will be sunny intervals in the afternoon and moderate to fresh easterly winds, occasionally strong offshore and on high ground at first.” 
 
In the ambitious pyrotechnic display, 23,888 firework shells are to be deployed over the harbour from three barges. 
 

 
The display, which will be broadcast live on the Post ’s Facebook page, is estimated to cost HK$8 million. The production is sponsored by Unique Timepieces by Halewinner, a luxury watch company chaired by Karson Choi Ka-tsan, a son of billionaire toy maker Francis Choi. 
 
The display’s first scene is to feature a time tunnel image incorporating the pattern of the figure “20” to mark the 20th anniversary of Hong Kong’s establishment as a special administrative region of China, a Halewinner spokesman said.
