The Academy Awards will go down at end of <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-02">February</TIMEX3>, likely providing us with a gorgeous collection of red carpet gowns , plenty of PDA-friendly couples , and some truly spectacular moments . It will be the 89th iteration of the annual award show, and although they're sure to be great, we have a feeling it'll be hard to top what happened at the Oscars <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="1997">20 years ago</TIMEX3>. That's right â€” the red carpet at the 1997 Oscars was, as the kids say, f*cking lit. The dress code included crop-tops, t-shirts, and velvet capes, and couples who seem bizarre to us <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> were getting cozy all over the place. <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3>'s show might have Ryan Gosling , but the one in <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="1997">1997</TIMEX3> had someone legitimately dressed as the Oscar statue. There's no coming back from that.
