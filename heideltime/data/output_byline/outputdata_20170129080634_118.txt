More than 1,000 people gathered at the international terminal of Chicago's O'Hare airport <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TNI">Saturday night</TIMEX3> to protest against what is known as President Donald Trump's "Muslim ban."

Protesters started gathering at O'Hare's Terminal 5 in the late afternoon, and their number kept growing until more than 1,000 of them blocked the driveway outside the terminal.

The crowd chanted slogans like "Let them in" and "No hate, no fear, refugees are welcome here" and held signs that read "Do the right thing, let them in," "Stop profiling Muslims" and "Refugees Welcome."

Police and law enforcement members were present at the scene but were careful not to intervene. Traffic came to a complete stop as vehicles lined up on the driveway leading to the terminal.

According to local WGN-TV, <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29TAF">earlier this afternoon</TIMEX3> several local groups called for an "emergency solidarity rally" in response to Trump's signing of an executive order that includes a <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P90D">90-day</TIMEX3> ban on travel to the United States by citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries and a <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P4M">four-month</TIMEX3> suspension of the U.S. refugee program.

The measure has triggered confusion and chaos across the country and drawn concern and criticism from across the world. Similar protests have erupted at airports in many other cities.

Since the executive order took effect, as many as 18 people were believed to have been detained at O'Hare alone, some of them being green card holders with Muslim backgrounds, local daily Chicago Tribune reported.
