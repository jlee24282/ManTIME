By The members of the Wampanoag Kennel Club certainly know how to have a lot of fun and they are also learning a great deal about Man’s Best Friend. 
 
For decades, club members from as far away as Greater New Bedford, Southeastern Massachusetts and Cape Cod, continue to enjoy the sport of purebred dogs, friendship and fellowship at the club’s training hall located in Acushnet. 
 
Club member Gail Harrop Zurawski, a longtime cocker spaniel fancier, looks forward to training her dogs at the club hall every <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="TIME" value="2017-01-25TNI">Wednesday night</TIMEX3>. 
 
“It’s been a ball,” says Zurawski, noting that’s she’s been a member of the kennel club for <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P20Y" mod="MORE_THAN">more than 20 years</TIMEX3>. “It’s been an absolute blast.” 
 
The passionate dog fancier and Swansea resident has owned five cocker spaniels, a Lhasa apso and a friendly golden retriever during her along association with the organization, but it’s the enthusiastic and energetic sporting breed that continues to win her heart and capture her interest. 
 
“They are just great little loving dogs,” Zurawski says of her beloved cocker spaniels, adding that her dogs “are just simply a lot of fun.” 
 
According to the dog fancier, two of Zurawski’s top stars, Woofie and Madison, continue to win titles and ribbons at dog shows held throughout the region. 
 
Woofie, a <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P10Y">10 year</TIMEX3>-old buff-colored male, has earned several obedience degrees and awards, and joins his friend Madison, a rare merle-colored female that Zurawski predicts is also destined to achieve much success in obedience circles. 
 
Another dog fancier who enjoys the sport of dogs is New Bedford resident Andrea Tavares, who enjoys training Lucy, a <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="P4Y">four year</TIMEX3>-old boxer female. 
 
“I love to train my dog and I enjoy going to the shows,” Tavares shares. 
 
The experienced dog fancier adds that she once owned a black standard poodle, but soon discovered that the dog required a great deal of grooming. Lucy, the dog’s <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> canine companion, needs just a little tidying and nail trimming. 
 
“I wanted a dog that was easy to groom,” Tavares continues, adding that she enjoys large breeds, such as boxers and Dobermans. “Big dogs get into a lot of mischief but they are a lot of fun.” 
 
Another local dog fancier who has a lot of fun is Paul Brown of Middletown, Rhode Island, who travels weekly to train at the Wampanoag club. 
 
Brown has owned Australian shepherds for <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P15Y" mod="MORE_THAN">more than 15 years</TIMEX3>, and enjoys competing in obedience. 
 
“They have high intelligence and they have a lot of drive,” he says of the breed that was developed to herd livestock, often on large tracts of land. 
 
Brown says he’s particularly enjoyed his long association with the Wampanoag Kennel Club. 
 
“It’s been a lot of fun,” he says. “It’s helped me to learn more about obedience. I’ve always enjoyed having the dogs. They keep me going.” 
 
Longtime obedience trainer and Rottweiler enthusiast Ed Dupont has served as the kennel club’s trainer for <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="P16Y" mod="MORE_THAN">more than 16 years</TIMEX3> and assumed the role following the death of the late Al Kirby of Westport. 
 
Kirby, a breeder of Pembroke Welsh corgis and Great Danes, trained dogs for <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="PXDE">several decades</TIMEX3> and was considered to be a legend in the local canine community. 
 
Dupont has exhibited champion Rottweilers, Chesapeake Bay retrievers, toy fox terriers and many other breeds. He has also exhibited at the prestigious Westminster Kennel Club held <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="SET" value="XXXX">annually</TIMEX3> at Madison Square Garden in New York City. 
 
“It’s different all the time,” Dupont says, adding that each training class presents new challenges and opportunities. 
 
Zurawski adds that while some participants enroll is a basic obedience class and stay for just <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DURATION" value="PXW">a few weeks</TIMEX3>, others get hooked and become active participants in the sport. 
 
Some people, like Zurawski, train their canines in obedience to earn degrees, while some owners train their dogs to earn therapy titles and visit nursing homes and health care centers. 
 
“It’s been exciting,” says Dupont. “I enjoy the sport. I like dogs and it’s fun to take a new young dog and train it to become an obedience champion.”
