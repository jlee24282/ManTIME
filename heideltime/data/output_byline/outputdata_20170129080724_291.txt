Love could be in the air for KISS 100 radio presenter Adelle Onyango who shared a little secret on her social media. 
 
If her captions are anything to go by, the petite beauty could have found her prince charming. The photo cuts out the identity of the mystery man but from her face reaction she is one happy lass. 
 
To reveal how she felt about the whole arrangement, she used a love heart emoji alongside the photo. 
 
The media personality had a nasty breakup some time back in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2013">2013</TIMEX3> after calling off her engagement to her ex-fiancé one doctor Christopher.  
 
The wedding that was to take place in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2014">2014</TIMEX3> did not happen as infidelity rumors were blamed as the cause of the breakup.
