The Cohasset boys basketball team may not have won the game, but gave visiting Mashpee a tremendous battle in a 69-62 loss <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday Jan. 28</TIMEX3> at Cohasset High School. 
 
In a battle of two of the top teams in the South Shore League Tobin Division, it was no surprise that the game would be a tight battle, even if the last meeting wasn’t. 
 
<TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-W02">Two weeks ago</TIMEX3>, Mashpee beat Cohasset 59-34 at Mashpee, but the Skippers played that game without leading scorer Chase Bomeisler, and had a 27-22 halftime lead before the Falcons outscored Cohasset 27-2 in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2016-Q3">the third quarter</TIMEX3> on the way to the win. 
 
This time, Bomeisler was back and Cohasset was on a four-game win streak heading into the game. 
 
The game did not disappoint. 
 
The Skippers gave Mashpee everything it had, but in the end, a few mistakes, misses and even a bit of luck going the other way were the difference. 
 
The biggest misses were on the free throw line when Cohasset had two shots in a tie game with <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="PT7S">7 second</TIMEX3> to play in regulation. 
 
Both shots missed, sending the game to overtime. 
 
In the first overtime, the Skippers had the ball with <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="PT10S">10 seconds</TIMEX3> to play, but weren’t able to score, forcing a second overtime, where Mashpee took control. 
 
Still, getting to the first overtime was impressive, with Cohasset coming back from a five-point deficit keyed by a three-pointer from Thatcher Stone and a turnaround jumper from Bomeisler (off a beautiful pass inside from Sam Lelio) in the closing minute to force the tie. 
 
Stone had a big game, scoring a team-high 23 points, including five three-pointers, while Bomeisler added a solid 21 points with 12 rebounds. 
 
Liam O’Connell had 9 pts and Lelio had 7 points 
 
“I told my team ‘They all received A + for effort and passion and competiveness but our offense on special situation plays was not honor roll material,” Cohasset coach Bo Ruggiero said. “Terrific game to take Mashpee to double overtime after getting destroyed in our first game early in the season shows the tremendous improvement the team has made with the way they are approaching practice sessions getting better <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EACH">each day</TIMEX3>, but we need to learn to execute in close games if we are going to be considered an Elite team.” 
 
Going back to some of the luck, in the closing seconds of <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2017-Q1">the first quarter</TIMEX3>, Stone hit a three-pointer to tie the game 15-15 with <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DURATION" value="PT2S">two seconds</TIMEX3> on the clock, but Mashpee tossed up a bomb that dropped from about three-quarter court for an 18-15 lead. 
 
It wasn’t all luck though, as Mashpee’s Devan Ford had a game high 32 points to lead all scorers. 
 
For Cohasset, the game is already just a memory. 
 
“We are already on to Norwell,” Ruggiero said. “This game is over. Tough loss, but its unique about basketball. We play on <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2017-01-24">Tuesday</TIMEX3> and will need to regroup. I am looking forward as they are to improving reach day.”
