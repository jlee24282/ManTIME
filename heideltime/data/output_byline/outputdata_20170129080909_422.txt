I was under the impression that gang warfare was prohibited. However, witnessing the conduct of our elected representatives, I see it has been legalized.Â Democrats versus Republicans. Not just in Illinois, either; it is a national epidemic in our legislatures. Regardless of whether a solution is beneficial to the public who pay the taxes, it is vetoed because "the other side thought of it." 
 
Meanwhile, because of this deadlock and legalized gang warfare, many people suffer due to cuts in services. I would suggest that not only should our elected representative pay be withheld, so should their benefits, per diems, etc. Once they are forced to survive without health insurance, travel assistance, etc. perhaps they will understand the position they have placed many citizens in. Maybe they will get off their lazy butts and do the job they were hired to do. 
 
One other thing, the lack of an Illinois budget is not a new concept. This situation has come up many times in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="PXY">the past several years</TIMEX3>. One constant that I see in the equation is House Speaker Michael Madigan. I don't know him, he may be a great guy, but it would appear that regardless as to who the governor is, Mr. Madigan blocks all progress. After 30 <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="PXY">some years</TIMEX3>, isn't it time to change?
