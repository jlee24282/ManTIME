Bafana Bafana assistant coach, Owen Da Gama,believes that for any coach, it would be an honour to coach the national team. 
 
Following Shakes Mashaba’s dismissal at <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2016" mod="END">the end of last year</TIMEX3>, the South African national team is <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> coachless, with Roger Da Sa, Milutin Sredojevic, Gavin Hunt, Muhsin Ertugral, Carlos Queiroz, Hervé Renard and Pitso Mosimane rumoured to be shortlisted for the role. When asked about how a new coach could change the dynamics of the team, Da Gama said that it will depend on circumstances, before saying that he is also considering the next step for his own future. 
 
“It all depends on who the person is, coming in, and what the situation is. And, obviously, for myself as well, I’m a very experienced coach. I’ve gone over 54 matches with Bafana and over 30 matches with the under 23s,” he told Soccer Laduma. “That’s a lot of matches at national level and, for me, I can’t just be a journeyman, I can’t just be an assistant coach all the time. So, I’ve got to weigh up my options, see what the bosses say and then just take it from there.”

Da Gama was then asked directly whether he’d be interested in taking over the hotseat, to which he replied by providing reasons why he’s suited to the role. 
 
“It would be an honour to be Bafana coach <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P1D">one day</TIMEX3>, I think any coach in South Africa would be interested,” he continued. “There’s that natural progression, so why not? I’ve got the experience and I’ve coach at the highest level in the PSL, I’ve played at the highest level in Europe, and we’ve got immediate knowledge of the team, so why not? I’ve got a lot of confidence in myself and my ability, but I will wait for my bosses at SAFA, however, to give me directions.”
