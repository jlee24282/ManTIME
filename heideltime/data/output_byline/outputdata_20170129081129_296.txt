SALT LAKE CITY — Kyle Kuzma had 18 points and 12 rebounds as Utah raced to a commanding lead <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> and held off Oregon State’s late rally for an 86-78 victory. 
 
David Collette had 13 points, and Parker Van Dyke and JoJo Zamora added 11 apiece as Utah (15-6 overall, 6-3 Pac-12) led by as many as 28 points before subbing in the seldom-used reserves midway through <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2016-H2">the second half</TIMEX3>. 
 
Once Kuzma and the starters sat down, the Utes collapsed. 
 
Stephen Thompson Jr. had a career-high 30 points and JaQuori McLaughin scored 22. 
 
“He was one guy that was fighting from the first second,” coach Wayne Tinkle said of freshman guard McLaughlin, who had no turnovers and made all four of his foul shots. “He played a great game.” 
 
A furious comeback got Oregon State (4-18, 0-9) within six points in the final minute. 
 
“A couple of their guards had tremendous nights,” Utes coach Larry Krystkowiak said. “They were a focal point for us coming in here, and we still didn’t have much of an answer for them. … They made some plays down the stretch to make it interesting.” 
 
Utah’s bench players let the lead slip within single digits as Thompson scored on a dunk and two free throws to make it 78-70 with 2:00 remaining. 
 
The Utes’ starters returned but Thompson scored again and then drew a foul on a 3-point attempt with 51.1 seconds left. He made two of three free throws to pull the Beavers to 81-74. 
 
“I kind of figured a comeback could happen because we kept taking our foot off the pedal. Even in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-H1">the first half</TIMEX3>, we weren’t really playing with energy. It came back to haunt us,” Zamora said.
