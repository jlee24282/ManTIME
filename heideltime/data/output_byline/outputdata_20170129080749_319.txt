Brendan Rodgers has admitted to the Scottish Herald that Celtic have not completed as much business as he had hoped <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01">this month</TIMEX3>. 
 
Celtic have brought in Kouassi Eboue from Krasnador, but they have been unable to complete any other signings. 
 
Rodgers had hoped to be active in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01">January</TIMEX3>, despite seeing his Celtic side dominate Scottish football since the start of the season. 
 

 
The Northern Irish boss felt that <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> was the perfect time for any new players to settle in ahead of next term. 
 
Celtic’s business is being completed with one eye on next season, with the Scottish Premiership title seemingly wrapped up already. 
 
Rodgers wanted to give any new signings <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P6M">six months</TIMEX3> to settle in, before next term’s Champions League qualification process starts up. 
 
However, Rodgers admits that Celtic will not have finalised all the business he wanted to do by the end of the month. 
 
"We won’t be as close [to having the squad ready for the Champions League] as I would want it, I don’t think, by the end of the window,” he admitted. 
 

 
“But if we don’t get the players that I would want through them not being available, then OK. I’m happy with the players in the squad that we have. I’ll just have to wait until <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-SU">the summer</TIMEX3> in order to do the next bit. It’s through no fault of the club. 
 
“This window is always tough. I won’t just bring in anyone. It has to be a player who’s going to improve our squad. If that isn’t available, for whatever reason, then there’s not much you can do. It’s not Football Manager on the computer, where you just pull them out and transfer them. It’s a wee bit more than that. So if it doesn’t happen, OK. I’d want it to but if it doesn’t, we just have to wait and be patient.” 
 
Celtic are <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> sat at the top of the Scottish Premiership, 19 points clear of their nearest rivals, Rangers.
