NH Public TV launches online STEM lessons 
DURHAM - With the launch of New Hampshire Public Television's free online STEM from the START animated lessons, teachers and parents of pre-kindergarten to third-grade students have a fun new way to help kids learn about science, technology, math and science. 

The free, downloadable lessons blend animated adventures starring three curious characters called the Quinks with hands-on activities and games for young learners. Discovery Guides for teachers, childcare providers and parents supplement each lesson. 

STEM from the START is a collaboration between NHPTV and Learniverse poEducational Media. 

"What's unique and exciting about STEM from the START is that it integrates video lessons with fun activities that support learning," says Susan Adams, educational services manager at NHPTV. "It captures their imaginations and engages them in challenging material, like finding out how motion works or how temperature is measured." 

Teachers and parents can download lessons and learn about the STEM from the START initiative at stemfromthestart.org . Teachers who wish to schedule professional development workshops for their school should contact Susan Adams at sadams@nhptv.org.
