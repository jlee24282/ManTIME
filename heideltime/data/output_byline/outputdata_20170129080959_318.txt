A BBC investigation has revealed the extent of knife crime across the UK.

Figures show that a knife or blade was used in a crime every <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="PT16M">16 minutes</TIMEX3> on average <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3>.

The number of incidents involving machetes has risen by more than 60% <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P3Y" mod="MORE_THAN">over the last three years</TIMEX3> in England and Wales - that is according to Freedom of Information request responses from just over half of police forces.

Knife crime across England and Wales is up 11% in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2016">the last year</TIMEX3> and nearing levels of <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2012">five years ago</TIMEX3>.

The Home Office says knife crime remains below levels in <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2010">2010</TIMEX3> but it recognises there is more to be done.

The BBC's Ed Thomas visited Liverpool to meet people who say they carry knives <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EVERY">every day</TIMEX3>.
