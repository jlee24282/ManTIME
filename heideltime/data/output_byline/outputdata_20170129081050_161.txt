Arsenal are reported to have joined Manchester United in the race to sign Atletico Madrid forward Antoine Griezmann. 
  
United boss Jose Mourinho is said to be leading the race to sign the French star at the end of the season, but <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> the Gunners have emerged as serious rivals for the player's signature. 
The 25-year-old is <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> one of Europe's hottest properties following his performances for Atleti and France at Euro 2016, and the La Liga outfit <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> face a huge fight to keep hold. 

 
Reports claim that Arsenal are ready to steal a march on United by making their move and are ready to match the £85million valuation and the player's wage demands of £250,000 <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P1W">a week</TIMEX3>. 
Whether Wenger is lining up Griezmann to replace Alexis Sanchez remains to be seen, but he appears to be the Frenchman's top <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2017-SU">summer</TIMEX3> target. 
Chelsea and Manchester City are also likely to enter the running, should Atletico make him available.
