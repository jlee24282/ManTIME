FOXBORO - Mansfield High hockey coach Mike Balzarini saw the potential of his squad on the ice at the Foxboro Sports Center <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> as the Hornets scored a goal in each period while blanking King Philip Regional High, 3-0, in their Hockomock League clash.

"In a game like that, the shutout was huge," said Balzarini of Mansfield senior goaltender Brendan McKenna, who made 20 saves for his first shutout of the season. "He came up big for us to play that well in a game we really wanted."

In a penalty-marred contest, KP was assessed 10 penalties and Mansfield seven. However, the Hornets killed all seven of their man-down situations, protecting a two-goal lead <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="PT5M">five minutes</TIMEX3> into the third period after being whistled for a <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="PT4M">four-minute</TIMEX3> major boarding infraction.

"That was a huge kill for us," said Balzarini. "We struggled with the power play all game, even though we were getting good looks, but the penalty-kill has been great for us all year."

Hornet senior captain Matt Farragher netted the first goal in the sixth minute of the first period off assists by freshman Chris Jenkins and senior Joe Olsen.

"We've been trying to get guys to use their bodies to gain control of the puck," said Balzarini. "Farragher used his body and kept his feet moving around the net."

Mansfield had nearly a 5-on-3 advantage for nearly 1:30 in the first period, but Warrior goaltender Shane Frommer (38 saves) held strong against the Hornet attack, giving his team a chance.

Mansfield had 19 shots on net in the first period, outshooting King Philip 41-20 for the game. The Warriors had their best scoring chance when sophomore Garrett Maxwell teed a shot of the crossbar.

"The last game against Oliver Ames, we were held to just three shots in the third period," said Balzarini. "We aim for 10 (shots) a period so <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3> was a lot more like what we want to see."

At the 11:56 mark of the second period, Jenkins took the puck from a KP skater and was able to beat Frommer with a wrist shot near his own bench to extend the Mansfield lead to 2-0. It remained that way until 2:44 of the third period when Hornet junior defenseman Tim Arnold made it 3-0, assisted by junior Patrick McCafferty.

"Overall, that's how we want to get it done," said Balzarini. "It was a good win and we fought hard all three periods."

Mansfield (6-5-1, 3-2 in the Hockmock) will take on North Attleboro at New England Sports Village on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3>, while King Philip (3-10, 3-3 in the Hockomock) will resume play <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-01-25">Wednesday</TIMEX3> against Franklin at Pirelli Veterans Arena.
