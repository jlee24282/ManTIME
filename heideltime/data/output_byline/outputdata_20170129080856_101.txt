LAS VEGAS >> Mikey Garcia on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> entered his challenge to lightweight champion Dejan Zlaticanin of Montenegro having fought just once in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P3Y">three years</TIMEX3>, no thanks to a contract dispute with his former promoter — Bob Arum — that caused Garcia to sit for 2 1/<TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P2Y">2 years</TIMEX3>. 
 
Garcia came back in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2016-07">July</TIMEX3> and defeated Elio Rojas via fifth-round TKO. But at least on paper he figured to be in deeper waters against Zlaticanin, who, like Garcia, came in undefeated. 
 
But this was a blowout. After dominating the first two rounds but not hurting Zlaticanin, Garcia knocked Zlaticanin cold in the third round. The final punch in the flurry was a vicious right hand that sent Zlaticanin crashing to the canvas. It followed a brutal right uppercut that really hurt Zlaticanin. Time was 2:21. 
 
Garcia (36-0, 30), who grew up in Oxnard and trains in Riverside, has <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> won world titles in three weight classes. He previously won championships at featherweight and super featherweight. 
 
“I think it was a great performance,” said Garcia, 29. “I fought smart, I controlled the distance.” 
 
Garcia described what took place after he landed the uppercut that wobbled Zlaticanin. 
 
“When he turned back to look at me, I knew he was hurt and I came with the overhand right,” Garcia said. 
 
Zlaticanin (18-1) came in as Montenegro’s only world champion in history. He was on the canvas for <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="PTXM">several minutes</TIMEX3> before being helped to his feet. 
 
The bout was contested underneath the featherweight title fight between Leo Santa Cruz and champion Carl Frampton at MGM Grand. 
 
Garcia’s brother and trainer, Robert Garcia, believes his brother will fight for another <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="P5Y">five years</TIMEX3>. He said it will take that kind of time for him to realize all of his goals. 
 
“He wants to get 135, 140 and 147,” Robert Garcia said in the days leading to Saturday’s fight. He was referring to titles in the lightweight, junior welterweight and welterweight divisions. If it comes to fruition, that would be championships in five weight classes. 
 
Also, Jerry Perez of Harbor City made his pro debut a successful one when he stopped Javier Cepeda (0-4) of Roswell, N.M., at 2:54 of the first round of their featherweight bout that was scheduled for four rounds. 
 
Ledaun Barthelemy Cuba is <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> 12-0 after he won a six-round unanimous decision over Jesus Aguinaga (5-5-1) of Phoenix in the junior lightweight division. Barthelemy won by scores of 58-56, 59-55 and 59-55. 
 
Antonio Santa Cruz (5-2), a cousin to Leo Santa Cruz, won a four-round unanimous decision over Victor Torres of Modesto (2-5-1) in the bantamweight division. He won by three scores of 38-37. 
 
 
Lee Selby of Wales was supposed to defend his featherweight title against Jonathan Barros of Argentina, but Barros was denied a boxing license by the state of Nevada for medical reasons.
