Pinelands Regional School District On The Right Track: 
Kudos to voters in Bass River, Eagleswood, Little Egg Harbor and Tuckerton who approved the Pinelands Regional School District Bond Referendum in a special election held on <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-24">Tuesday, January 24</TIMEX3>. 

The $53.6 million bond will address the critical structural issues at Pinelands Regional High School (PRHS) that have closed numerous classrooms. It also will fund basic repairs, no-frills renovations, and upgrades at the district’s two schools. 

We will be checking in periodically with district officials to update our readers on the progress and potential challenges that may arise from the construction. It is important that the money is spent wisely, checks and balances remain intact, and the repairs are conducted correctly and expeditiously. 

Lenape Regional High School District On The Wrong Track: 

In today’s paper, there is an article which covers the latest Lenape Regional High School District Board of Education meeting. We urge you to read it. It sure is an eye opener. 

<TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="PXM">The last few months</TIMEX3> have been tumultuous for this school board. There hasn’t been a meeting without a notable gaffe. 

There has been an admission of wrongdoing, shouting at a constituent, attempts to censor the press, failure to honor a teacher who passed away suddenly, resolutions placed onto agendas without prior discussion, a board member absent for his swearing in, and other incompetence. 

Most of the towns and school districts that we cover post a copy of the meeting agenda on their website <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="PT12H">12</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P2D">48 hours</TIMEX3> in advance of a meeting. In a few cases where the agendas are not posted online, officials comply with our request and provide an agenda prior to a meeting. 

At the beginning of the year, we sent a request asking for the district to provide our staff with a copy of the meeting agenda in advance of their board meetings. The district’s custodian of records said that she would not comply with our request. 

That is not acceptable. It is imperative that public bodies provide their meeting agendas to the public and media prior to the meeting. 

We encourage citizens to attend upcoming board meetings, call the district offices at (609)-268-4600, ext. 5546, and consider filing a petition to become a candidate for the school board. The deadline is <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2017-04-03">April 3</TIMEX3> to run for office. 

Fixing this mess and finding ways to improve transparency and accountability should be a priority for the board, not drones.
