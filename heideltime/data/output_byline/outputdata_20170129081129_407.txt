Exeter Chiefs skills coach Ricky Pellow lavished praises on Italy centre Michele Campagnaro after his tremendous performance in the Anglo-Welsh encounter against Wasps.

Campagnaro scored hat-trick of tries as Exeter Chiefs went on to complete a 52-5 victory at Sandy Park that saw them climb to the pole position in Pool 2.

The 23-year-old last played for Italy in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2016-06">June last year</TIMEX3> but is likely to be included in the Six Nations squad based on his terrific performances for Exeter Chiefs.

"It's been a solid set of <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> performances from Michele and, while we are sorry to temporarily lose him from our squad, he'll be excited about bringing that form into the Six Nations to show what he can do," Pellow said.

"It was a great performance from us and I'm especially pleased with the defensive effort in <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="PT10M">the last 10 minutes</TIMEX3> to keep our line intact."

"It's <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> in our hands but it will be a tough game as Bristol have turned a corner but we are anxious to progress to the next round."

Apart from Campagnaro, Mitch Lees, Stu Townsend, Sam Simmonds, Shaun Malton and Lachie Turner also crossed over for the home side while Will Rowlands was the lone try-scorer for Wasps, who fielded a young side.

Assistant coach Lee Blackett said: "It was a great eye-opener for the young lads as it showed how tough it can be when you step up to the next level.

"We had four guys who played for the under-18s <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2017-W03-WE">last weekend</TIMEX3> but I'm still disappointed with the result as we made too many individual errors in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2017-H1">the first half</TIMEX3>.

"I'm proud at the way we reacted in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2016-H2">the second half</TIMEX3> but Exeter were very clinical as they've got massive strength in depth and they took their opportunities and we didn't."
