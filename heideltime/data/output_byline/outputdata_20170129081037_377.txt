Chairman Senate Mian Raza Rabbani says literature is the driving force in a living society that inculcates compassion, tolerance and mobilization in the people. 
 
He was addressing a Literary Festival organized by Parveen Shakir Trust in Islamabad on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3> to commemorate <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P39Y">the thirty nine years</TIMEX3> of late poet`s famous Book 'Khushbu'. 
 
The Chairman said poets and writers act as an impetus of change in history and have rendered tremendous services for social awareness and mobilization. 
 
In the context of Pakistan, he said the great names like Faiz Ahmad Faiz and Habib Jalib were the forerunners of movements for restoration of democracy during the dictatorial regimes. 
 
He said the modern states have deliberately muffled the development of literature because literature reflects new thought and genre against the weary patterns of Governance. 
 
Raza Rabbani said nations become passive and numb when the creative minds and invigorating voices of poets and artists are silenced. 
 
On the occasion, Parveen Shakir Aks-e-Khushbu awards were given to poets and writers.
