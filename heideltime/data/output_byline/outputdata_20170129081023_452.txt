Glasgow Rangers boss Mark Warburton has ducked the question when asked whether his side have made a bid to try and bring Jak Alnwick to Ibrox ( The Scotsman ). 
 
Rangers have been linked with the Port Vale goalkeeper <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3>, and are said to be closing in on a £250,000 deal for the 23-year-old ( Daily Mail ). 
 
However, Warburton insisted that he would not speak about any potential transfer for Alnwick before it was officially announced. 
 
"We never discuss our business,” Warburton said, when asked whether the reports about Alnwick were correct. “We are linked with so many players. Apparently, I have signed 17 players in the window. Let’s wait and see. When something is completed, then we’ll talk about it.” 
 

 
Alnwick’s arrival at Rangers would add competition for places in their goalkeeping position. 
 
Rangers’ number one is <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> Wes Foderingham, and experienced stopper Matt Gilks is reserve choice. 
 

 
Alnwick has generally impressed since moving to Vale from Newcastle United, but it is unknown whether Warburton intends to sign him as he sees the 23-year-old as his new first choice goalkeeper. 
 
Alnwick started in Vale’s last League One match, which came <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">yesterday</TIMEX3> against Scunthorpe United, despite the rumours over his future.
