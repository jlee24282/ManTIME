The Capital High boys basketball team gave a very good Missoula Sentinel club all they could handle for 3 1/<TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P2Q">2 quarters</TIMEX3> on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>, before a run by the Spartans did the Bruins in during a 50-39 decision.

Capital actually led late in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2016-Q2">the second quarter</TIMEX3> of the Western AA tilt in the Bears' Den, 18-14, and again early in the third, by one, before Missoula got some separation.

Trailing 33-29 heading into the final frame, moments into the fourth Conor McCarvel's 3-point bomb closed the gap to two, 35-33. But that's as close as they'd get.

Sentinel went on a 7-0 run on baskets by Matt Messerly, Sam Beighle and Griffin Line. Suddenly the cushion swelled to nine points, and the visitors had enough for the win, although they padded the margin outscoring the hosts 8-6 down the stretch.

Beighle finished with a game-high 21 points, followed by CHS' McCarvel, who drained a trio of treys from downtown in three attempts, with 11.

"It's like having the same old film, and just hit replay," said Bruin coach Guy Almquist, referring to the opposition's runs during their 11-game losing skid. Capital slides to 1-11 overall and 0-4 in conference play with the loss. "I just feel real bad for the kids after another great effort and not coming away with a W.

"We played good enough defense to keep them under 50 points, if not for having to foul and them making their free throws; but we just can't put the ball in the hole."

Capital shot just 33 percent from the floor (12 for 36), compared to Sentinel's 44 percent (18-41).

The Spartans led 10-9 after <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-Q1">the first quarter</TIMEX3>, and 19-18 at halftime.

Next in the scoring column for the brown-and-gold were Brad Haller and Xavier Melice, at eight and seven points.

Sentinel's Mitch Roberts was the game's top rebounder with nine boards, while Melice was high for the home team with four rebounds. CHS teammate Mark Northey passed for four assists.

"Defensive stops and knocking down shots," answered Sentinel coach Jay Jagelski, when asked the keys to pulling away from the Bruins in the end. "Capital did a good job staying in the game; they played tough defense. But we just ground it out -- we did well in the post, and our full-court man press was what made the difference."

Amquist said his team is "actually are doing a lot of things better," except shooting

"Not only did we miss shots, but we missed layups; and you can't win in AA by shooting 33 percent," he said. "But I'm impressed by our guys, despite the losing streak. They're keeping their heads up, and they're coming to practice and working hard. They are a resilient group."
