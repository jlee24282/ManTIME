WASHINGTON — A bill that would hold off any pay raises for Congress until balancing the federal budget is achieved was introduced on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-25">Wednesday</TIMEX3> by Rep. Vern Buchanan (R-Longboat Key). 
 H.R. 646 , or the No Pay Raise for Congress Act, prevents pay raises for Congressional lawmakers if they do not pass a balanced budget for <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017">the current fiscal year</TIMEX3>.  
The legislation is <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> awaiting action by the U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. Text of the bill is not yet available. Its summary reads: "To provide that rates of pay for Members of Congress shall not be adjusted under section 601(a)(2) of the Legislative Reorganization Act of <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="1946">1946</TIMEX3> in the year following any fiscal year in which outlays of the United States exceeded receipts of the United States." 
 
In a statement, Buchanan said, "Successful businesses do not reward an employee who fails to do their job. This same common sense must be used in Washington. Members of Congress should not be eligible for pay raises if they cannot fulfill one of their most basic responsibilities." 
 
Buchanan also cited the looming $20 trillion number of the federal debt, calling its continued growth "downright immoral" on the part of lawmakers. 
 
"Forty-nine states, including Florida, are required by law to balance the budget. In Florida, passing a balanced budget is priority number one for the state legislature. Washington should not be held to a different standard," Buchanan also said in his statement.
