CLEVELAND, Ohio --- Do you have a question that you'd like to have answered in Hey, Hoynsie? Submit it here or Tweet him at @hoynsie. 
 
Hey, Hoynsie: Has the front office indicated if <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> will be the year for a big attendance boom at Progressive Field? - Nick Walsh, Cleveland. 
 
Hey, Nick: I think that will depend on the fans rather than the front office. I'm sure the Indians organization is working toward that goal after winning the pennant and reaching Game 7 of the World Series, but here's the catch -- they sell the tickets and the fans buy them. 
 
Owner Paul Dolan said <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3> after  MLB awarded the Indians the <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2019">2019</TIMEX3> All-Star Game that season ticket sales have increased from about 8,500 <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3> to an estimated 11,000 <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017">this year</TIMEX3>. So that's a start. 
 
Hey, Hoynsie: I'm happy to see that the Indians are honoring Frank Robinson this season with a statue. For <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="PXY">many years</TIMEX3> I was puzzled by the fact that the franchise did not acknowledge Robinson or its role in hiring the first black manager in the big leagues. The Indians should be proud of this distinction as they rightfully are about signing Larry Doby, the first black player to appear in the American League. Do you know if Robinson plans to attend the unveiling? - Ken Krizner, Wickliffe. 
 
Hey, Ken: I never got the impression that the Indians downplayed the importance of hiring Robinson as the game's first black manager. They named him to their Hall of Fame <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3> and I think he's always been respected by the organization. The Indians are expecting Robinson to attend the unveiling on <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2017-05-27">May 27</TIMEX3>. 
 
Hey, Hoynsie: Do you believe the Indians will move if the attendance problems continue, particularly with the lease ending in <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2023">2023</TIMEX3> and Progressive Field being 30 years old by then? I noticed from looking at old records that even when they were contenders in <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="195" mod="MID">the mid-1950s</TIMEX3> attendance was low. Only in <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="194" mod="END">the late 1940s</TIMEX3>, <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="195" mod="START">early 1950s</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="199">1990s</TIMEX3> was attendance good. - Richard Lyman, Caldwell, Idaho. 
 
Hey, Richard: Attendance is always going to be a concern. But with the Indians reaching Game 7 of the World Series <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3>, owner Paul Dolan taking on a limited partner in John Sherman, Progressive Field in its third year of renovations and MLB awarding the Indians the <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2019">2019</TIMEX3> All-Star Game, it's hard to imagine the team being on a more solid footing in Cleveland. 
 
Hey, Hoynsie: What are  Edwin Encarnacion's stats at Progressive Field? - Barry Elliot. 
 
Hey, Barry: Encarnacion is a .275 (25-for-91) career hitter with two homers and 11 RBI in 22 games. 
 
Hey, Hoynsie: I refuse to accept the results of the World Series. When <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2017-SP">spring</TIMEX3> training starts, I'll be protesting, picketing and forming support groups. Contact me at #notmyworldseries. - AZCardman, Gilbert, Ariz. 
 
Hey, AZCarman : In the name of Keith Olbermann, "resist." 
 
Hey, Hoynsie: Assuming Cleveland's goal is a world championship, having half of its power at DH (Edwin Encarnacion and Carlos Santana) seems to a significant disadvantage. I really think they need Mike Napoli back so they can play Santana in left field. It would also give them protection if Michael Brantley isn't at 100 percent. - Gordon Weller, Evansville, Ind. 
 
Hey, Gordon: Having half their power at DH and first base (Mike Napoli and Santana) didn't seem to hurt the Indians <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3>.  As for Santana in left field, no disrespect intended, I'd rather see him at first base. 
 
Hey, Hoynsie: Does Abraham Almonte have a minor league option left? Just thinking what if Michael Brantley is healthy and Austin Jackson outplays Almonte and ends up platooning in center field with Tyler Naquin? - Jack Bacevice. 
 
Hey, Jack: In the Indians' postseason guide for <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3>, Almonte is listed as having one minor-league option left.
