BERLIN (Kyodo) -- Japan's Nao Kodaira continued her perfect start to the season with another World Cup win on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>, making it six from six in the women's 500 meters. 
 
The 30-year-old logged a 37.57-second time to finish well ahead of Karolina Erbanova of the Czech Republic (38.28) and American Heather Bergsma (38.43), but could not match her 37.43-second performance from <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">a day earlier</TIMEX3>. 
 
"Ideally, I would have surpassed the record from <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">yesterday</TIMEX3>," Kodaira said. "I started off well with the right stance...but I then carried on with a calm mindset rather than being battle-ready and I ended up adjusting my movements along the way." 
 
Japan's Maki Tsuji came fourth in 38.44, and Erina Kamiya sixth in 38.58.
