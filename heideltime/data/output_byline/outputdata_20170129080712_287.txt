Chevron Corp. posted its first annual loss since at least <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="1980">1980</TIMEX3> as the world's biggest oil companies struggle to emerge from the worst collapse in a generation. Investors punished the stock, wiping out about $5 billion in market value. 
 
The company had a $497 million loss <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3> and failed to replace all of the crude and natural gas it pumped with new reserves, the San Ramon company said <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3>. 
 
<TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2016-Q4">Fourth-quarter</TIMEX3> net income of $415 million ( 22 cents per share) was lower than analysts had expected. 
 
Shares fell $2.76 , or 2.4 percent, the most in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P4M">four months</TIMEX3>, to close at $113.79 . 
 
Chevron announced plans <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2016-12">last month</TIMEX3> to curtail spending on drilling and other projects for a fourth straight year. 
 
Despite the belt-tightening, Chevron is on pace to spend about $2 billion on shareholder dividends <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="SET" value="P1Q" quant="EACH">each quarter</TIMEX3>. That equates to about $1 million <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="PT1H">an hour</TIMEX3>. Exxon Mobil is set to disburse about $3.1 billion per quarter in payouts.
