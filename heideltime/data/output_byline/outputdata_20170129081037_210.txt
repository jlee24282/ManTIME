Indian TV channels Star Jalsha, Zee Bangla and Star Plus can be broadcast in Bangladesh as the High Court has rejected a petition seeking ban on them. The bench of justices Moyeenul Islam Chowdhury and JBM Hassan gave the order on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3> after concluding the hearing on a previous rule issued on the matter.

Star Jalsha and Star Plus were represented by Abdul Matin Khashru while Samsul Hasan stood for Zee Bangla.

Deputy Attorney General Motahar Hossain Saju argued for the State.

"The verdict means there's no more legal barriers for airing of the three Indian channels in Bangladesh," Saju told the media.

The petitioner's counsel, however, said they will challenge the verdict. 

"We will appeal in the higher court and hope to get justice," said lawyer Ekhlas Uddin. 

In <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2014-08">August 2014</TIMEX3>, Supreme Court lawyer Shahin Ara Laily filed the petition seeking a rule asking why broadcast of those channels should not be banned.
