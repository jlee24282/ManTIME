½tsp soy sauce (gluten-free soy sauce is available in most supermarkets)

1 carrot, cut into ribbons or fine strips 
 
¼ red onion, sliced very thinly

50g mixed seeds (such as pumpkin or sunflower) 
 
50g mixed nuts (such as cashews or peanuts), roughly chopped

A few fresh coriander leaves, roughly chopped 
 
Method 
 
To make the salad dressing, combine all the ingredients in a bowl and whisk together using a fork. Whisk again just before serving. 
 
 To serve, divide the leaves between four plates, top with the tofu and add the rest of the salad ingredients, finishing with the seeds and nuts. 
 
Just before serving, drizzle a little dressing over each salad and scatter with the coriander.
