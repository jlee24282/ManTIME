Leo Santa Cruz reclaimed the World Boxing Association featherweight world title <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>, handing Carl Frampton the first defeat of his career and avenging his <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3> loss to the Northern Ireland boxer. 

In an explosive rematch that lived up to their bruising encounter <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2016-07">last July</TIMEX3>, it was Santa Cruz who this time emerged with a majority decision, with two judges scoring it 115-113 for the US-based Mexican while the third scored it a draw at 114-114. 

"I wanted revenge," said Santa Cruz, whose loss to Frampton <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3> was his first defeat. "I did what I had to do. I knew it was going to be another tough fight and like I said, let’s make it a third fight." 

Santa Cruz improved to 33-1 with one drawn while Frampton fell to 23-1. 

Although Frampton landed plenty of telling blows in a fight filled with frenetic exchanges, he was repeatedly pushed out of position by Santa Cruz’s effective jab. 

After a strong 11th round, Santa Cruz withstood a desperate attack from Frampton in the final round.

"He was very clever. He used his reach," Frampton said. "I think he deserved it. I’m being honest. I think he deserved it, but it was a very good fight. No excuses." 

On the same card, American Mikey Garcia won his third world title with a ruthless third-round knockout of World Boxing Council lightweight champion Dejan Zlaticanin of Montenegro. 

A right uppercut followed by a monstrous overhand right from Garcia knocked Zlaticanin out cold at 2:21 of the third round. 

Garcia’s in-ring celebrations gradually turned to expressions of concern as medical personnel worked for <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="PTXM">several minutes</TIMEX3> to revive Zlaticanin, who endured his first defeat in 23 fights. 

"I’m glad my opponent is OK. We never wish that anything bad happens in the sport," said Garcia, a former featherweight and super featherweight titlist who improved to 36-0 with 30 knockouts. 

Garcia had used an effective jab to control the bout from the first round. 

"I think it was a great performance," he said. "I fought smart. I kept the distance, I controlled the range. The left hand was key to keep him at that distance that best suited me and follow through with that right hand. We were able to connect, hurt him and put the end to the night."
