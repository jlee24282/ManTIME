<TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">Recently</TIMEX3>, Rep. Monroe Nichols, D-Tulsa, introduced a bill that could end the state’s continuous revenue failures that total in the high hundreds of millions of dollars <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="SET" value="P1Y" quant="EACH">each year</TIMEX3>.

House Joint Resolution 1003 asks lawmakers to give voters the chance to change how revenue-related bills are approved. Revenue bills require either a three-fourths supermajority and the governor’s signature or a statewide vote of the people to become law. If approved, Nichols’ bill would ask voters to return the requirement to pass revenue bills to a simple majority vote of each chamber and the governor’s signature. This bill is not only smart from a policy perspective; it is an important first step in improving core services in the state.
