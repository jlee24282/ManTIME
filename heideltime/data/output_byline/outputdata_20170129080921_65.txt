This is the season of exams. Exams are trying times for the entire family. 
 
Panic prevails during exam times. It is more depressing than inspiring. 
 
One tends to forget important things at exams. We may recall it after coming out of the exam hall, since we get relaxed after the exam is over. We need to be relaxed during the exam too.
