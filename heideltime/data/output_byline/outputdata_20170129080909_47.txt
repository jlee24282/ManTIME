Women compete with synchronization in colorful dresses while riding side-saddle, while the men perform the more masculine events of La Charreria, the official sport of Mexico. And it’s all done so gracefully atop a quarter horse. 
 
The new “Nacidos Charro: Born Charro” exhibit celebrating the Mexican rodeo is <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> open at the American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame and Museum, where it will continue through <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-07-29">July 29</TIMEX3>. 
 
“It’s our first bilingual exhibit,” said Crystal Phares, the AQHA curator who worked to create the exhibit with Melissa Loftin, community outreach liaison. “We want to celebrate <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-Q3">the quarter</TIMEX3> horse throughout the world.” 
 
La Charerria is quite different in pageantry from the American rodeo. 
 
“We wanted it be colorful and tell the story of the family values and tradition,” Loftin said. “La Charreria is so much more than a rodeo.” 
 
Indeed, the first thing a visitor sees when walking in is a colorfully dressed woman who competes as an escaranauz (a mounted lady) representing the women’s event, drill teams on horseback. 
 
“It’s like synchronized swimming on quarter horses,” Phares said. 
 
The exhibit was a natural fit for the museum, according to Phares and Loftin. 
 
“We have an international membership,” Loftin said. “La Charreria is quarter horses, and we’re about quarter horses.” 
 
The exhibit is included with general admission to the museum, which hopes to attract a diverse population to see the facility’s many exhibits and learn more about the history of <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-Q3">the quarter</TIMEX3> horse and their Hall of Fame, as well as the Mexican sport. 
 
“The exhibit hits all levels — from people who enjoy history, horses, Mexico, culture and just about anyone,” Phares said. “It includes artifacts from <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="180">the 1800s</TIMEX3> to the present.” 
 
“The event is a festival and about family,” Loftin said. 
 
“Their fathers and grandfathers were Charro (cowboys). They are cowboys for life. Charros were the gentlemen. This is very much the gentlemen’s sport.” 
 
Many of the nine La Charreria events are pictured in the exhibit with two events recognized by the AQHA — bull trailing and reining. 
 
“There is a difference in competitions from what our American, European and Australian memberships know as rodeo in the competitions, and it always has a parade,” Loftin said. 
 
The color and costumes are on display along with the typical cooking utensils used during the festivals. 
 
“We hope the exhibit expresses the life, speed and color,” Phares said. “It’s so vibrant.”
