In response to <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> events, I want to commend local fine art sculpture artist, Sten Hoiland, for responding by crafting a hand sculpted “Love” with a card attached: “Share the Love. Love is something if you give it away you end up having more! Please pass the love (sculpture) on within <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P2D">the next 2 days</TIMEX3>.” So far he’s made 400 with a goal of 1,000. 
 
Well done, Sten.
