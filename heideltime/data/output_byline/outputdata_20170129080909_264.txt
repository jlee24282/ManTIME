VICTORIA - Matt Hall led his Ontario rink past Northern Ontario's Tanner Horgan in an extra end on <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TNI">Saturday night</TIMEX3> to advance to the men's Canadian junior curling championship final. 
 
Hall's team from Kitchener — vice-skip Jeff Wanless, second Joey Hart and lead David Hart — will play for a gold medal on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29TAF">Sunday afternoon</TIMEX3> against B.C.'s Tyler Tardi. 
 
Both Ontario teams will be playing for gold on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3>. Skip Hailey Armstrong from Ottawa will take an unbeaten record into the women's gold-medal game against Alberta's Kristen Streifel in the morning. 
 
"It's been an amazing week; no matter how <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-W04">this week</TIMEX3> ends, we've got nothing to be ashamed of," said Hall. "It's always been a dream of mine to have that shot having a Maple Leaf on my back, and I'm so happy I'll have the chance to do that <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-01-30">tomorrow</TIMEX3>." 
 
Hall and Ontario's men took advantage of a miss in the seventh end to score a game-changing four, erasing what had been a two-point lead for Northern Ontario and turning it instead into a two-point lead for Ontario with just three ends to play. 
 
Horgan was attempting a tough double takeout that, best-case scenario, was going to hold Ontario to a deuce. But he wrecked on a guard to give Hall the open look at a draw for four. 
 
Northern Ontario would tie the game with a 10th-end deuce, but Hall got two perfect tick shots from David Hart that kept the house open, and in the end, Hall had an open hit for the victory. 
 
One province has claimed both the men's and women's titles in <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2017">the same year</TIMEX3> on eight previous occasions: Alberta (Jocelyn Peterman and Brendan Bottcher) in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2012">2012</TIMEX3>; Ontario in <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2010">2010</TIMEX3> (Rachel Homan and Jake Walker); Saskatchewan in <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2003">2003</TIMEX3> (Marliese Miller and Steve Laycock); Manitoba in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="1995">1995</TIMEX3> (Kelly Scott and Chris Galbraith), <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="1984">1984</TIMEX3> (Darcy Kirkness and Bob Ursel) and <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="1981">1981</TIMEX3> (Karen Fallis and Mert Thompsett); and Alberta in <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="1978">1978</TIMEX3> (Cathy King and Darren Fish) and <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="1977">1977</TIMEX3> (Cathy King and Paul Gowsell). 
 
The winning teams <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3> will represent Canada at the <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> world junior championships, <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2017-02-16">Feb. 16</TIMEX3>-<TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2017-02-26">26</TIMEX3> in Gangneung, South Korea.
