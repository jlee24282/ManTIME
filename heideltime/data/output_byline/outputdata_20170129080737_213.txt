It was <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> of continued celebration for the Rome Braves <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> at the team’s annual Hot Stove Gathering at the Forum River Center. 
 
The event became more than just a way for fans to get their offseason fix of new information on the Atlanta Braves’ organization as executives and officials with both the major and minor league programs signed autographs and spoke about the impact of the Class A affiliate’s <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3> South Atlantic League championship. 
 
“This is a special, special group,” said Jonathan Schuerholz, the Braves’ assistant director of player development. “And we knew when we put this team together in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-SP">spring</TIMEX3> training, we knew they would take their lumps in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-H1">the first half</TIMEX3>. But we knew the make-up of these young men and the staff we put together.” 
 
From a rough <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-H1">first half</TIMEX3> emerged a new team after last year’s All-Star break that raced to first in the Southern Division and defeated Lakewood for the Rome Braves’ first title since <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2003">2003</TIMEX3>. 
 
Saturday’s festivities, which included a fan question and answer session and a celebration concert by country music artist Colt Ford, also turned into a kind of homecoming for a group of players from last year’s team. 
 
Pitchers Mike Soroka, Max Fried, Patrick Weigel, Kolby Allard and Touki Toussaint were some of the ones in attendance and drew praise from Braves President of Baseball Operations John Hart. 
 
“These are kids that we drafted, a lot of high school guys, young guys … I mean it was a really big group of young arms that were here,” Hart said. “These guys, a lot of them were our first draft, but the next group we’ve got coming is going to be competition for these guys as they go up the line. I think you’re going to see another really good group of pitchers up here <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2018">next year</TIMEX3> as well.” 
 
Braves General Manager John Cop­polella also joined the event, as did new Atlanta manager Brian Snitker, who was excited by the fact that three of the Braves’ minor league programs played for their league championships last season. 
 
“It’s wonderful. That’s a sign that we’re getting this thing back to where it needs to be and what it’s all about,” Snitker said. “Our minor leagues are in a good spot and they’re going to continue to get better.” 
 
The event included a proclamation from the City of Rome, presented by commissioner Wendy Davis, extending an appreciation and congratulations to the Rome Braves. 
 
Pitchers and catchers will report for <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2017-SP">spring</TIMEX3> training <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017-02-15">Feb. 15</TIMEX3>.
