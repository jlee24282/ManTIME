Resentments among youths of Udaipur, Shantirbazar, Belonia and Kumarghat sub-divisions over offer letters have become obvious on similar cause <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3>. The alleged most of the offer letters went to candidates belonging to affluent families and added, "Even members of youth wing of ruling CPIM have been overlooked."
