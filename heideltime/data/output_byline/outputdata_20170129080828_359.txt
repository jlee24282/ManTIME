Ira Township Supervisor Robert McCoy speaks to the crowd at the Anchor Bay Chamber of Commerce’s State of the Bay address on <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2017-01-25">Jan. 25</TIMEX3>. 

Local leaders from four area communities <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> came together to mark the Anchor Bay area’s inaugural State of the Bay address.

The new event was launched <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2017">this year</TIMEX3> by the Anchor Bay Chamber of Commerce in an effort to bring citizens, businesses and local government under one roof and help residents stay informed. Officials from New Baltimore, Chesterfield Township, New Haven and Ira Township took part in the event, which took place <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2017-01-25">Jan. 25</TIMEX3> at Zuccaro Banquets and Catering in Chesterfield Township. Catherine Green, executive director of the chamber, said the group’s first State of the Bay address was a success, with about 120 people attending. She said the chamber intends to host the event <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="SET" value="P1Y" quant="EACH">each year</TIMEX3> in <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2017-01" mod="END">late January</TIMEX3>.

Guest speakers included Chesterfield Township Supervisor Daniel Acciavatti, New Baltimore Mayor John Dupray, New Haven President Pro Tem Kevin Chandler and Ira Township Supervisor Robert McCoy. Each took time to address various <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> events, business concerns and government issues.

Acciavatti joined the Chesterfield Township Board after ousting incumbent Michael Lovelock from the supervisor’s seat in the <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2016-11">November</TIMEX3> election. Lovelock was arrested <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2017-02-01">the following week</TIMEX3> by FBI agents as part of an ongoing federal investigation into public corruption. In his first couple of months at the helm, Acciavatti has led the board in adopting a budget for <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DURATION" value="P2017Y">the 2017 fiscal year</TIMEX3> while also diving into the township’s policies and procedures.

“My <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3> in this position was very turbulent,” he said at the address. “We came in in pretty rough times… My Chesterfield Township team has been very, very supportive as we go through this process.”

Officials are <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> working to rebuild the township, starting with a foundation based on integrity and “clear and transparent processes and procedures,” the supervisor said. He outlined a handful of other focus areas:

* Public safety: “Without safe streets we’re in big trouble,” he said. “We have an amazing public safety team.”

* Public works: “There’s no bigger highlight than the heavy civil infrastructure disaster in <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DATE" value="2015">15</TIMEX3> Mile Road that’s going on <TIMEX3 tid="t34" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">right now</TIMEX3> to provide those public utilities, not only clean water and sewer and cable and electricity, everything that falls under public works and lumps into transportation and being able to move goods and service effectively (and) safely.”

* Leisure services/culture and recreation: “I’m kind of appalled at the state of our sidewalks, our paths, how non-mobile our community is,” Acciavatti said, also noting ground is expected to be broken at the Webber Paddle Park off of Jefferson Avenue <TIMEX3 tid="t35" type="DATE" value="2017-FA">this fall</TIMEX3>.

* Investments and development: Acciavatti said “a lot” of new developments and investments are coming into the community. The new Cabela’s outdoor merchandise store near Interstate 94 and M-59 is expected to be up and running by <TIMEX3 tid="t38" type="DATE" value="2017-SP" mod="END">late spring</TIMEX3> or <TIMEX3 tid="t39" type="DATE" value="2017-SU" mod="START">early summer</TIMEX3>.

“We’re all excited about that,” the supervisor said to applause. “That whole development has got a whole lot of potential down the road.”

* Government efficiency: “General government being efficient, being transparent, being effective.”

“We have so much potential,” he added. “There’s so much opportunity on not only the waterfront — how we can synergize with neighboring communities, with our friends in New Baltimore in Ira, village of New Haven up into Lenox — it’s exciting that Ira Township, we’re spanning county lines there, and there’s a whole lot of common ground we have with St. Clair County.”

The city of New Baltimore will mark its sesquicentennial, or 150th anniversary, <TIMEX3 tid="t40" type="DATE" value="2017">this year</TIMEX3>. Plans are in the works to celebrate the milestone <TIMEX3 tid="t41" type="DATE" value="2017-SU">this summer</TIMEX3>.

During the address, Dupray highlighted the city’s <TIMEX3 tid="t43" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> growth while sharing potential plans for future development and some of the challenges the city is <TIMEX3 tid="t44" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> facing.

“We have a lot of exciting things planned; we really, really do,” he said. “And it’s going to get a lot better.”

* The city <TIMEX3 tid="t45" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> made an official offer to purchase Schmid Marina. If acquired, the site will continue to be operated as a marina, but as a self-sustaining public recreational area rather than private as it is <TIMEX3 tid="t46" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3>.

“I’m very excited because this will be 17 acres of lakefront property with over a quarter-mile of shoreline that will be owned by the residents of New Baltimore,” Dupray said.

* “(A developer) purchased a piece of property across form where the Dairy Queen is which had this ugly, terrible blighted building on it. This developer tore it down, built two restaurants, Burger King and Popeyes — a great addition.” The former Christie Funeral Home site is also being renovated by a new developer.

“Wait till you see it <TIMEX3 tid="t52" type="DATE" value="2017-SU">this summer</TIMEX3>; you’re going to be impressed,” the mayor said.

* “Harbor Oaks Hospital put on a new addition to help autistic children — a great thing.”

He also mentioned a handful of challenges that lie ahead.

* “Every city has challenges, and believe me, we have our challenges,” he told the crowd. “The biggest challenge that I see is revenue sharing, the money that we get from the state… <TIMEX3 tid="t55" type="SET" value="P1Y" quant="EVERY">Every year</TIMEX3> since <TIMEX3 tid="t54" type="DATE" value="2003">2003</TIMEX3> the state has given the cities less money.”

“Our roads in our subdivisions are just deteriorating and people are really upset. We have a project <TIMEX3 tid="t56" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> where we’ll be able to plan to fix these roads. We can’t fix them all at once, but we have to do this.”

* “Our big, big problem is the non-funded health care liability that’s hanging over our heads; everybody has that and we can’t just ignore it,” the mayor said. “So we’re going to take care of that — I don’t know exactly how, but you have to keep plugging away and I’m confident that somehow were going to solve this.”

Chandler provided updates on <TIMEX3 tid="t58" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> happenings in the village and offered a look at what’s ahead for the village <TIMEX3 tid="t57" type="DATE" value="2017">this year</TIMEX3>.

“While we have a lot of work to do, we’ve made some great strides and progress over the course of <TIMEX3 tid="t60" type="DURATION" value="P2Y">the past two years</TIMEX3> and we intend to continuously improve the village, look to forage collaborative relationships with our partners and build a strong community for our residents and businesses,” he said.

* “In <TIMEX3 tid="t61" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3> we started a $1 million infrastructure project on our storm drain,” Chandler said, referring to the construction on New Haven Road. “That was much needed, obviously, and it’s coming along really, really well. We have a little bit to finish up on some side streets, but we had some great success in finishing that project.”

* “We started working with an accountant; we ended up hiring a firm out of Roseville and then actually hired an in-house accountant,” he added, noting the village’s <TIMEX3 tid="t62" type="DATE" value="2014">2014</TIMEX3> audit has been completed and the <TIMEX3 tid="t63" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3> audit is underway. “We had a little bit of an issue with some of our audits and things like that, but we’ve really strived to keep that in progress, on time and in check, and so we’ve actually put some really good initiatives together in order to make that happen.”

* “We adopted a balanced budget in <TIMEX3 tid="t64" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3>, increased our fund balance by cutting costs and moving to secure our water debt carry over. We had about a quarter-million dollars in water debt that was outstanding and we whittled that down to about $30,000.”

* Residents who are unable to attend village council meetings <TIMEX3 tid="t70" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> have other ways to stay in the loop. Chandler said the village created a Facebook forum for residents and is working with NEMC Channel 6 in Armada to televise all meetings on the cable station and YouTube.

* “One thing that we are really looking at is blight within the village,” Chandler said. “We’re looking at demolishing houses and putting a new violation process in place.”

* “We’re going to streamline a permit process for those that want to build within the village of New Haven. We want to bring business to the village and we’re certainly going to pursue commercial development, too,” he said, noting it plays an important role to both the village and its residents.

McCoy shared updates involving various projects, developments and plans.

* “We are quite a boating community and it seems like more and more marinas are being expanded, more and more boats are coming into Ira Township, which is really good — it’s an excellent revenue for the businesspeople in <TIMEX3 tid="t71" type="DATE" value="2017-SU">the summer</TIMEX3>.”

* “The fire department was able to acquire a GPS that locates every fire hydrant in the township, McCoy said. “So whether it be stormy, rainy, snowy, as your approaching that hydrant there is a signal inside the fire truck that lets you know you’re within 50 feet.”

* “Our building permits have skyrocketed; they’ve gone right off the charts, residential and commercial,” he added.

* “We’ve had a tripling of the Rock Church on County Line Road. They’re completing construction <TIMEX3 tid="t72" type="DATE" value="2017-02">next month</TIMEX3>. I believe that’s an asset to our community.”

“We also have in place <TIMEX3 tid="t73" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">right now</TIMEX3> and almost nearing completion by <TIMEX3 tid="t74" type="DATE" value="2017-SP">spring</TIMEX3> is the Thunder Cats indoor soccer field (next to Anchor Bay High School). That’s supposed to be a pretty big thing.”

* “We just approved a Dollar General store to the east of the Post Office in Fair Haven.”

* “(Tin Fish on M-29) was dozed down and seven beautiful condo apartments have been put in there at a half-million dollars apiece. They’re beautiful and they’re really an asset to our community. We also have at the end of Long Island Court, better known to some of the locals as Vernier Point, 10 new condominiums going in there as well, which will really be an asset to the township.”

* “Near the Macomb border, we have a new RV park that is just about completed with 30 units going in on the water, replacing an old small trailer park,” McCoy said, adding that there has also been talk of a senior housing complex possibly being built on M-29 near the New Baltimore-Ira Township border.

McCoy also echoed Acciavatti’s sentiments regarding integrity.

“It’s my prayer, my hope, that all of us as leaders, businesspeople and residents, that integrity be at the top of our lists,” he said.
