WHILE the ultimate Torrey Pines specialist, Tiger Woods, bowed out of the tournament on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3>, another with a great record over famed Southern Californian layout, Brandt Snedeker, shares the lead with Patrick Rodgers heading into tomorrow’s final round of the Farmers Insurance Open. 
 
Snedeker has twice won this event and on four other occasions been inside the top three and <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-30">tomorrow</TIMEX3> he stands a great chance of adding to that stunning record. 
 
Rodgers has yet to win on the PGA Tour, his best being when runner-up at the Wells Fargo event in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3>, but he opened up the possibility of that sought after breakthrough win with his round of 67 <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3>. 
 
The pair lead by one over Tony Finau and Taiwanese PGA Tour rookie, CT Pan. 
 
MARC LEISHMAN PUTTING FAMILY FIRST: 
 
Australian Marc Leishman, another with a great record at Torrey Pines having finished runner-up on two occasions, is in a share of 5th position and just two from the lead following his third round of 68. 
 
Given his record at the venue and his very solid <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> form the chances of a second PGA Tour title look good for the Victorian.   
 
A massive 23 players are within four shots of the lead heading into tomorrow’s final round, however, suggesting <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3> over the South Course will be some sort of shootout.    
 
Of the other Australians, Cameron Smith is 42nd, John Senden 58th and Cameron Percy 69th.
