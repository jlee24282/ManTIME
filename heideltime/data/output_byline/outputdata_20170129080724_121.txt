KUALA LUMPUR: Contrary to the morning report that traffic will be smooth on all highways on the second day of the Chinese New Year <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3>, certain stretches of the North-South Expressway were reported to be congested as at noon. 
 
A PLUS Malaysia Berhad spokesman said there was congestion from Slim River to Sungkai and Rawang to Sungai Buaya. 
 
"Port Dickson to Senawang and Senai to Kulai were also congested (as at noon). Traffic is backed up for about six kilometres at Bukit Beruntung in the direction of Lembah Beringin due a three-vehcile pile up," he said. 
 
The situation was the same at Km282 (southbound) from Putra Mahkota to the Seremban R & R also due to an accident. 
 
Elsewhere traffic was reported to be smooth.
