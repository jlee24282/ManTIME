NEW DELHI: All eyes will be on Finance Minister Arun Jaitley this <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="FUTURE_REF">coming week</TIMEX3> as he tables his fourth Union Budget of the BJP-led NDA government. In the run-up to the event, the S&P BSE Sensex has already rallied about 2,000 points in last <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P1M">one month</TIMEX3> or so. The S&P BSE Sensex witnessed strong momentum despite muted global cues this <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-W03">past week</TIMEX3> and closed 3.1 per cent higher, while the Nifty50 ended 3.5 per cent up. Foreign portfolio investors have sold equities worth Rs 2,139 crore so far <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-01">this month</TIMEX3>. This has been far better than Rs 8,176 crore outflow seen in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2016-12">December</TIMEX3> and Rs 18,224 crore outflow in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2016-11">November</TIMEX3>. It will be a busy news-heavy week for investors and volatility cannot be ruled out. However, analysts say given the fact that the long-term story remains intact, investors should use every opportunity to buy on dips. "After the <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> surge, we might see a pause for a session or two and it will be healthy for the market ahead of the Union Budget. We suggest traders to book some profit and wait for some consolidation or correction in the index before going for fresh longs," Jayant Manglik, President, Retail Distribution, Religare Securities, said. "Individual stocks, on the other hand, will continue to see volatile moves across the board in anticipation of Budget announcements and also in reaction to the earnings," he said. <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">The last days</TIMEX3> of <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2017-01">January</TIMEX3> will see Motilal Oswal, Bajaj Auto, Cadila Health, Dabur, ICICI Bank, IDFC, IOC, Oil India, and ONGC announcing their results. Going by the buzz on Dalal Street, here is a list of five factors that could chart market direction during the week: Market likely to react to GAAR clarification: One thing foreign investors do not like uncertainty. The tax department's clarification on General Anti-Avoidance Rule (GAAR) on <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3> post market hours was a step in the right direction. The clarification has come as a relief for the overseas portfolio investors, who use off-shore derivative instruments known as participatory notes (P-notes) to bet on Indian stocks. The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) on <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3> clarified that GAAR will not be invoked against those foreign portfolio investors (FPIs), who can prove their main purpose is not to obtain tax benefits by locating in a certain jurisdiction. Economic Survey and Union Budget <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3>: The big event to track this <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="FUTURE_REF">coming week</TIMEX3> will be the Union Budget <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3>, which is scheduled for <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2017-02-01">February 1</TIMEX3>, as well as the Economic Survey, which will be tabled on <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2017-01-31">January 31</TIMEX3>. Some analysts on Dalal Street think it will be a populist one to compensate the common man reeling under the impact of demonetisation. A Budget skewed towards populist measures might not go down well with foreign investors. Some experts think it will be a balanced one with a focus on reducing tax liability for individuals to boost consumption, higher infrastructure spends and at the same time adhering to the fiscal consolidation path. "This time Budget expectations would be more on reducing tax liability for individuals, infrastructure development, strengthening and increasing spending on defence sector," Yogesh Mehta, VP-Equity Advisory, MOSL, told ETMarkets.com. "The Nifty50 has rallied pre-Budget, sustaining and continuation of the rally is dependent on various announcements on direct and indirect taxes and fiscal deficit target, among othera. Any major correction would provide an opportunity to investors," he said. <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2017-01">January</TIMEX3> auto sales numbers: Four-wheeler and two-wheeler stocks will be in focus in the <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="FUTURE_REF">coming month</TIMEX3> as auto sale numbers for <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2017-01">January</TIMEX3> will be announced starting from <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2017-02-01">February 1</TIMEX3>. Stocks like Maruti Suzuki, Hero MotoCorp, Bajaj Auto and Ashok Leyland will be on the watch list. FOMC Meet: Investors will be watching the US Federal Market Open Committee (FOMC) meeting scheduled for <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="2017-01-31">January 31</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DATE" value="2017-02-01">February 1</TIMEX3> for the outlook for the US economy and interest rates in <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3>. However, the US Fed is expected to keep the Fed funds target range unchanged <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DATE" value="2017-W05">next week</TIMEX3>. Technical outlook: The domestic market is likely to start on a soft note when it resumes trading on <TIMEX3 tid="t34" type="DATE" value="2017-01-23">Monday</TIMEX3>, as traders may unwind some of their long positions built in the closing hours of <TIMEX3 tid="t35" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3>. Volatility cannot be ruled out ahead of the Budget as well as after the event. Hence, traders are advised to trade with strict stop losses. The Nifty50 has rallied by around 780 points in last <TIMEX3 tid="t41" type="DURATION" value="P5W">five weeks</TIMEX3> and it might move in the overbought territory, which may creatw a pause or less risk-reward ratio for fresh long positions. "The index has to hold above 8,580 level to extend its upward move towards 8,700-8,720 zone, while holding below 8,550 might drag it due to profit booking towards 8,510 and then 8,480 levels," Chandan Taparia, Derivatives & Technical Analyst - Equity Research at Anand Rathi Financial Services, told ETMarkets.com. On the options front, fresh Put writing was seen at strike prices 8,600, 8,500 and 8,700 while Call writing was seen at strike prices 8,900, 9,000 and 9,100. Option data indicates immediate hurdle at 8,700 level while on the downside, the 8,580 level might provide immediate support to the Nifty5
