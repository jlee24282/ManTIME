Elton John to write ‘Prada’ musical 
 
NEW YORK — Elton John has been tapped to write the songs for a devilish upcoming musical — “The Devil Wears Prada.” 
 
Producer Kevin McCollum said <TIMEX3 tid="t176" type="DATE" value="2017-W03">last week</TIMEX3> that John, the composer of Broadway hits “The Lion King” and “Aida,” will supply the music for a stage adaptation and playwright Paul Rudnick will write the story. 
 
No timetable was revealed. 
 
“The Devil Wears Prada” began as a best-selling novel by Lauren Weisberger, inspired by the author’s own experiences working as an assistant for Vogue magazine Editor Anna Wintour. It was adapted into a hit film starring Meryl Streep and Anne Hathaway. 
 
The new musical will be produced by McCollum, Fox Stage Productions and Rocket Entertainment. It’s part of a big new push by movie studios to adapt films for the stage, including “Mrs. Doubtfire.”
