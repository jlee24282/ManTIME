Eighty-one percent of evangelicals voted for Donald Trump because of the Supreme Court. Was it worth it? 
 
What did you sacrifice for Rowe vs. Wade? For one, the planet, and two, Donald Trump with the nuclear codes. It seems you couldn't see past the end of your noise when you voted. 
 
If you voted for Donald Trump because of jobs, thinking he has a crystal ball that tells him where the jobs are, and how to get them back, then you have wasted your vote. 
 
Manufacturing jobs weren't outsourced as much as they were automated. Robots, and multitasking machines have eliminated more jobs than outsourcing. Corporations have for a lot of years been automating manufacturing jobs, because an individual always has cost them more than a machine. Do you think a corporation is going to bring back high-overhead jobs (with pensions and benefits) that they will have to pay years after that person is no longer useful in the manufacturing of their product? No! 
 
<TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DURATION" value="P2Y">Two years</TIMEX3> will tell us what Donald Trump has done to our America! 
 
Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh, and all the rest won't be able to spin Trumpty Dumpty back together again in those <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P2Y">two years</TIMEX3>. 
 
Republicans <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> control everything that happens in Washington, and to us for those <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P2Y">two years</TIMEX3>. The ball is in their court! 
 
As of <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-01-19">Jan. 19</TIMEX3>, a snapshot was taken by history. <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3>, we wait for what's next.Â
