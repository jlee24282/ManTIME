Florida State found its rhythm offensively for the first time on the road all season. 
 
Unfortunately the Seminoles, who played with visibly more intensity and enthusiasm during a furious comeback attempt at Syracuse on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>, fell just a bit short. 
 
Jonathan Isaac led FSU with 19 points and 12 rebounds, Dwayne Bacon came alive with 19 points and Xavier Rathan-Mayes heated up in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2016-H2">the second half</TIMEX3> to finish with 16 points, but the Seminoles fell 82-72 to the Orange. 
 
FSU, which earned a No. 6 ranking at the beginning of the week, will likely be on the cusp of the top 10 after losing back-to-back games for the first time this season. FSU also suffered a 22-point defeat at Georgia Tech on <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-25">Wednesday</TIMEX3>. 
 
The Seminoles (18-4, 6-3 Atlantic Coast Conference)  looked well on their way to another head-scratching blowout loss, down 18 points at halftime to the Orange. 
 
But Leonard Hamilton depended on his best four players in Isaac, Bacon, Rathan-Mayes and sophomore forward Terance Mann with senior center Jarquez Smith to mount a comeback. 
 
FSU trimmed Syracuse’s lead down to two points after a Bacon 3-pointer with 1:48 left, but the Seminoles simply ran out of energy at the end of the game. 
 
The crowd in the Carrier Dome rushed the floor to celebrate while the Seminoles lost their second straight game to an unranked, in-conference team after winning 5 of 6 against top 25 teams. 
 
FSU falls in a third-place tie in the conference standings with Notre Dame, which lost at Georgia Tech on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>, behind North Carolina and Virginia. 
 
The Seminoles will play their third straight road game at Miami on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-01-25">Wednesday</TIMEX3>.
