Old Man <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-WI">Winter</TIMEX3> will still be with us for <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="PXM">a couple of months</TIMEX3>, so it is time to plan some adventures to make good use of the splendor. While the temptation is great to just stay inside where warmth and technology surround us, the crisp and stark natural landscape offers something a little different from the ho-hum daily sedentary inclination. We feel like hibernating like the bear, but so much more awaits us outside our cave.

It will be necessary to dress appropriately for the day you venture out. Providing children with proper clothing will ensure they have a warm and satisfying experience. Local suppliers can assist you in selecting warm gloves and boots. Dressing in layers is also a great strategy. An outer shell windbreaker or breathable rain jacket provides an extra buffer to <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-WI">winter</TIMEX3> chill.

Whether you live in town or in the country, opportunities abound for getting out and enjoying nature’s magic. Wildlife observation is certainly enhanced by the long lines of sight and lack of leaf cover. Bring binoculars and a bird guide out to the woods or open fields. But the intricacies of fine detail are also very visible, so have the kids concentrate on those as well.

In the woods consider woodpecker holes in trees — bring a magnifier along, but also a small ruler. Look for insects but also have the child insert the ruler into the hole and find its depth. Then measure the actual size of the hole. Is it rectangular? Circular? Oval? If there are ash trees, investigate the telltale “D” holes and tell the kids about the emerald ash borer and how exotic species can damage the native ecology. Use extra caution around dead ash trees, however, as dead limbs are occasionally falling. Speaking of invasive species, you may be able to identify <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-WI">winter</TIMEX3> forms of some of these, like wintercreeper and honeysuckle, although <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-SP">spring</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-SU">summer</TIMEX3> will make it easier to find them. If your child needs a school project, consider documenting your adventure with photos.

If you can access a shallow, rocky creek, there is much to observe, especially if it is frozen over or at least partly so. Notice rocks protruding through the ice near the edge. Are these limestone, sandstone, shale, etc.? How did they get to this location? If there are geodes or fossil rocks this can add to the excitement. Along the edge notice the color of the ice and perhaps if there are fascinating air bubbles trapped.

Children always like stomping off some of that weak edge sheet, so let them do it, being careful that the foot does not plunge down into cold water. At any point of your exploration that the child gets really wet, head for the car.

In the snow, see if you can track creatures, large and small. There are guides to animal tracks that are very good. These guides can be found at local bookstores or the Hoosier National Forest bookstore in Bedford. In the guide it will show measurements, so use your ruler with the child to see if the size matches up. Estimate how far you can track the animal, being careful not to disturb it if you reach its sanctuary or resting place.

There are many more <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017-WI">winter</TIMEX3> activities including sledding, introduction to snowshoeing and even cross-country skiing. Tobogganing at Pokagon State Park is another unique experience. Once again, proper clothing is a good investment to assuring the child’s comfort. If your activities take place at a state park, reward the family with hot chocolate at the Inn. Or have warm drinks and snacks available in the car. Granola bars can be a staple for the hike itself or carried in a daypack. Remember, liquid is still essential, as dehydration can occur, especially during activities with lots of exertion.

Going as a group of families is another way to bond and share adventures and watch the actions of your children. <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2017-WI">Winter</TIMEX3> activities are also found as part of programs conducted by state, county and city parks or the YMCA. Here you have guided and interpretive programs. But being part of a large group takes away that close intimate family-only bonding that can be so rewarding, so perhaps try your own adventure first. Additional ideas, activities and experiences can be found on websites from around the country. See what other families do in our vast <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2017-WI">winter</TIMEX3> landscapes. Visit the website “Tales of a Mountain Mama “ or “Taiga Trekkers” and you will be thrilled to know that almost everywhere you live families are getting out there in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2017-WI">winter</TIMEX3> to celebrate just like you!
