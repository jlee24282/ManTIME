OK, enough is enough. All you folks with <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-12-25">Yule</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-12-25">Christmas</TIMEX3> wreathes on your door, take 'em off.

Don't you know it's bad luck?

My wife and I were driving someplace the other day and on the way she counted 30-something wreathes still adorning doors and windows.

First of all, common lore say that wreathes still hung in the new year prolong <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-WI">winter</TIMEX3>.

Look it up.

Years ago when I heard that, I took the wreath off my door and tossed it off the porch into my snowy front yard.

When I moved years later, there was a brilliant 30-foot holly tree in the spot.

<TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3>, unless you're like Debbie Reynolds and Carrie Fisher - who kept <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2016-12-25">Christmas</TIMEX3> trees up and decorated all year long - it's time for the greenery to go.

<TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2016-12-25">Christmas</TIMEX3> trees, by the way, were banned in all Christian religions and in the Bible (Jeremiah 10:1-5) until Queen Victoria (see Masterpiece on Channel 2) had one after returning from a trip to Germany.

Trees in Germany, and other pagan places, were decorated with what people wanted the new year to bring:

Coins, corn and other crops, flowers, lights for the return of the sun.

Back to the wreathes - the name, by the way, comes from the Old English word "to twist," like in a circle - they were hung on doors in ancient Rome to represent victory and frequently laid on graves to honor the dead.

The wreathes' circular shape represents eternity, or life never ending, or the reincarnation of Jesus.

Traditionally, wreaths and other greens were taken down on Twelfth Night, the eve of <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2016-02-06">Epiphany</TIMEX3>, or <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-01-06">Jan. 6</TIMEX3>.

In an Old English tradition you would have on <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29TNI">this night</TIMEX3> a bonfire to burn the greens of <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2017-12-25">Yule</TIMEX3>.

Hey, wreathes and trees still up after <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2017-01-06">Jan. 6</TIMEX3> bring bad luck.

And some hardliners believe greens not taken down on <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2017-12-31">New Year's Eve</TIMEX3> take all the woes and troubles of the old year into the new.

That might be a little rash, but I can see their point.

The Coptics, and there's a Coptic church in Attleboro, celebrate <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2017-12-25">Christmas</TIMEX3> as late as <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Jan. 27</TIMEX3>, but in any case, we are past just about all of these dates.

So, take down those wreathes.

I'm going to be driving around looking for them.

I don't want to be shoveling snow <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2017-W05">next week</TIMEX3> just because you've been procrastinating ... "Opinions founded on prejudice are always sustained with the greatest of violence."
