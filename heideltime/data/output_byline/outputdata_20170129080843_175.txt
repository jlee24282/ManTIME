During their high-octane performance of " Remix ," Donnie Wahlberg deviated from the group's synchronized dance number and went into the photo pit where he danced with a few lucky fans in the front row. 
 
The group -- comprised of brothers Jordan and Jonathan Knight , Joey McIntyre ,   Wahlberg, and Danny Wood -- were introduced by actress Candace Cameron Bure , whose <TIMEX3 tid="t35" type="DURATION" value="P30Y">30-year</TIMEX3> dream came true when NKOTB appeared on the Netflix revival, Fuller House , for a collaborative sing and dance performance of " You Got It (The Right Stuff) ."  
   
Ahead of their performance, NKOTB did a Facebook Live with iHeartRadio during which they played with the world's largest etch-a-sketch, remembered <TIMEX3 tid="t36" type="DATE" value="198">'80s</TIMEX3> dance moves over a Simon game, signed Connect Four pieces, and talked about dating in <TIMEX3 tid="t37" type="DATE" value="198">the '80s</TIMEX3> versus dating in the social media age.  
 
When Jonathan was asked to compare his past relationship with <TIMEX3 tid="t38" type="DATE" value="198">'80s</TIMEX3> icon Tiffany during a time when social media was nonexistent, to Selena Gomez and The Weeknd 's romance that is being chronicled 24/7 on Twitter and Instagram, he said:  "I think everything back in <TIMEX3 tid="t39" type="DATE" value="198">the '80s</TIMEX3> was so much easier. I mean <TIMEX3 tid="t40" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> everywhere you go, you're being filmed, you're being watched ... Everything's on a phone and you just pull it out." 
  
NKOTB are set to headline their Total Package tour <TIMEX3 tid="t43" type="DATE" value="2017-SU">this summer</TIMEX3> featuring musical guests Boyz II Men and Paula Abdul , who will hit the road for the first time in <TIMEX3 tid="t46" type="DURATION" value="P25Y">25 years</TIMEX3>. The trek launches on <TIMEX3 tid="t49" type="DATE" value="2017-05-12">May 12</TIMEX3> with a show at the Schottenstein Center in Columbus, Ohio and will run through <TIMEX3 tid="t50" type="DATE" value="2017-07-16">July 16</TIMEX3> with a concert at Hard Rock Live in Hollywood, Florida. 
 
The iHeart80s bill also featured Reagan-era acts including UB40 , Men at Work's Colin Hay , Starship , Eddie Money , Night Ranger , and headliner Rick Astley .
