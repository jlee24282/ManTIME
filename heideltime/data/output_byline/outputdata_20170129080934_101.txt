SQ286 was meant to depart for Singapore <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29TAF">this afternoon</TIMEX3> but was forced to abort its departure at the last minute. 
   
Hundreds of Singapore Airlines passengers remain stuck on the tarmac at Auckland Airport after their plane failed to take off because of a potential fault. 
 
The delay, already stretching to <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="PT7H" mod="MORE_THAN">more than seven hours</TIMEX3>, means many of the 300 people on board will miss their connecting flights in Singapore. 
 
However, passenger Gabriel Xie, who is heading to Tokyo with his wife for their honeymoon, said most were fairly relaxed about the extra wait. 
   
Gabriel Xie and his wife will miss their connecting flight to Tokyo thanks to the delay. 
   
"Everyone's pretty chilled actually, either getting boozed up or watching movies," he said. 
 
Xie said passengers appreciated the lengths staff were going to to make sure everyone was OK. 
 
"They're trying to arrange everything for connecting flights, but we'll have to confirm them once we arrive in Singapore," he said. 
   
Passengers are relaxing with movies and drinks as they wait on the tarmac at Auckland Airport. 
   
"It's frustrating, but at the same time the crew is doing their best and the passengers are civilised, so it's not too bad." 
 
Flight SQ286 was supposed to depart at 1.30pm but aborted due to potential issues with the nose wheel of the aircraft. 
 
Xie thought wind was buffeting the plane as it headed down the runway on its first attempt.

"The plane was wobbly when we tried to take off, going from side to side," he said. 
   
However, the aircraft then came to a stop on the tarmac and had to be towed back to the terminal. 
 
"The captain said there's something wrong with the nose wheel," Xie said.

An airport spokesman said those on board would not be told to disembark. 
 
"The passengers are <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> on the aircraft . . . we will await a report from Singapore [Airlines]. They want to look at the nose wheel and they're going to keep the passengers on-board the aircraft at this stage." 
 
The flight was initially rescheduled for a <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29T17:00">5pm</TIMEX3> takeoff, but that has been repeatedly pushed back.

The Singapore Airlines office was contacted but refused to comment about the failed takeoff. 
 
The runway was "closed for a short time" <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29T15:00" mod="APPROX">about 3pm</TIMEX3>, possibly to remove debris, the airport spokesman said. 
   
Emirates flight 406 refuelled at Ohakea air base before continuing to Auckland. 
   
One plane was diverted from Auckland Airport due to the runway closure. 
 
Emirates flight 406 from Melbourne was due to land at 3.20pm but was diverted to the Ohakea New Zealand Defence Force base, near Bulls, the spokesman said. 
 
Locals in Ohakea remarked on Twitter it was unusual to see an Airbus A380 at the base. 
 
There were about 430 passengers on the Emirates flight, which arrived in Auckland just after <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29T18:00">6pm.</TIMEX3> 
 
Meanwhile, Emirates flight 345 to Brisbane and Dubai was also delayed on the tarmac at Auckland Airport. 
 
It was supposed to depart at 6.10pm, but it's understood a passenger on board fell ill, and the flight eventually left at 7.55pm.
