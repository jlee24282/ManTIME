SIOUX CITY (KTIV) - 

We started our <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> with a little sunshine but gradually the clouds moved back in and we even got some light snow showers going by the afternoon hours.

We'll continue to see a few of these track through the area <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29TNI">tonight</TIMEX3>.

There will be little to no accumulation with these snow showers.

They will end overnight with <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3> dry but cloudy with highs near average in the mid 3
