For the second-straight week, Penn State team found itself in a close match. 
 
But unlike <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-W03-WE">last weekend</TIMEX3>, the Nittany Lions came out of <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>'s match with a loss, falling to James Madison, 4-3, at the Indoor Tennis Center. 
 
The match was the fourth in an extended six-game home stand to open the season for Penn State. 
 
“We’ve been in a number of these battles already this season,” Penn State head coach Chris Cagle said. “Unfortunately we were not able to come out of this one victorious like we did <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-W03">last week</TIMEX3>, but I’m still pleased with the overall team effort <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3>.” 
 
The Lions couldn't capture the early doubles point, despite the strong showing from the top pairing of Devan McCluskey and Katia Blik. James Madison got wins from its pairings of Tiema Guibe/Kimmy Herrock and Jona Roka/Abby Amos. 
 
In singles for Penn State, Katia Blik defeated Rachel Nelson in straight sets 6-1, 6-4, while Shannon Hanley downed Abby Amos 6-4, 6-4, and Samantha Smith prevailed over Jona Roka 7-5, 6-4. 
 
In singles victories for James Madison, Tiema Guibe defeated Devan McCluskey 3-6, 6-4, 7-6, Emma Peterson beat Dasha Sapogova 1-6, 6-1, 6-4, and Kimmy Herrock downed Bennett Dunn in straight sets by a score of 7-5, 6-3. 
 
“<TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Today</TIMEX3> was another case of a 4-3 match that came down to a couple points here or there, and you have to credit James Madison for handling the pressure points better than we did," Cagle said. “I still think that these types of games are learning experiences that we can benefit from as the season progresses.”
