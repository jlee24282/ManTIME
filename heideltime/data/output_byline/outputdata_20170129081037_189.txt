BERKELEY, CALIF.:  The Pepperdine men’s tennis team fell to Cal Poly in a close 4-3 battle at the Hellman Tennis Complex to close out the ITA Kick-Off Weekend, hosted by No. 3 California.  The Waves fell in doubles action and then eventually dropped a tough 4-3 match to the Mustangs. 

The Waves dropped the doubles point, but rallied back to tie the dual at 3-3 with the sixth court still in action.  Freshman  Dane Esses  (Houston, Texas/Memorial HS) played tough for the clinch, winning the first set 6-4 before falling in the second 4-6.  He and his opponent, Axel Damiens went point-for-point to a tie-break third set, but the opposition had the advantage and edged Esses out with a <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2016-07-06">7-6</TIMEX3> (5) final. 

In doubles action, Waves’ two’s pair senior Guilherme Hadlich ( Balneário Camboriú, Brazil/Colégio Energia ) and sophomore Gabriel Sidney ( Curitiba, Parana, Brazil/Anglo Americano ) picked up the first Waves’ win of the morning with a commanding 6-1 victory over 53 rd -ranked Timothy Tan and Garrett Auproux.  

 Cal Poly’s 21 st -ranked Corey Pang and Ben Donovan then countered with a 6-2 win on court one over  senior Stefan Menichella ( Santa Barbara, Calif./University HS) and sophomore Jack Van Slyke (Toronto, Ontario, Canada/Laurel Springs HS (Calif.)). 

On court three, Esses and junior Pedro Iamachkine (Lima, Peru/Nebraska HS) were going head-to-head Antoine <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2016-12-25">Noel</TIMEX3> and Karl Enander to the 5-5 mark, but the Mustangs eventually took the next two games for the 7-5 win. 

With the 1-0 advantage heading into singles, both teams were looking to get some quick singles wins.  The Mustangs struck first, collecting wins on courts four and two to go up 3-0 on the day.  

Pepperdine’s number one single, Hadlich, faced off with 45 th -ranked Ben Donovan, downing the Cal Poly player with a pair of 6-4 sets to start closing the gap.  Iamachkine as the next Wave to take his singles match, felling Auproux in three sets, 6-3, 5-7, 6-3 on court three. 

Van Slyke then tied the match for the Waves, 3-3, with a 6-2, 2-6, 6-0 win over Antoine <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2016-12-25">Noel</TIMEX3> to put all eyes on court six and Esses for the close bout.
