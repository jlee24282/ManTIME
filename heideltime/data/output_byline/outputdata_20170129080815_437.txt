Set against a quintessentially Parisian backdrop, these photos of a beautifully specified black Ferrari Testarossa facing off against a new 488 Spider remind us why classic cars will always prevail over modern machines in terms of charm and romance… 
 Paint It Black  

 

 
This fabulous example of the collector favourite ‘Monospecchio’ Testarossa, so named after its distinctive ‘flying mirror’, is finished in menacing jet-black, complementing the wide and brooding lacerated rear arches. On the contrary, its elegant burgundy leather interior is a gentle reminder that <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="198">the 1980s</TIMEX3> weren’t all about excess. From the contemporary Parisian classic car dealership L’Art de L'Automobile , these photos stand as evidence that this black beauty will almost certainly outshine any modern Ferrari out in the wild.
