Even as a young girl, Corbie Mitleid always felt there was something out there beyond the natural world. 
 
“When I was 9 I read ‘The Witch Family’ by Eleanor Estes, and instead of thinking ‘ooh, or that’s scary, or ha, ha, ha,’ I thought to myself, ‘yes, there is magic in the world and I want to find it.’ ” 
 
That was <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="1967">50 years ago</TIMEX3>. Since then she has refined what many people describe as her “gift,” and since <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2001">2001</TIMEX3> Mitleid has been working full-time as an intuitive counselor, professional tarot reader, psychic, trained medium and motivational speaker. She’s comfortable with any or all of those job descriptions. 
 
A Cherry Hill, New Jersey native who lives in Cobleskill with her husband Carle Kopecky, Mitleid works <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P6D">six days</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P1W">a week</TIMEX3> and is on the road <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="P40WE">40 weekends</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3> visiting clients and appearing at psychic fairs. 
 
<TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2017-01">This month</TIMEX3> she’s been anxiously awaiting the release of her new book, “Clean Out Your Lifecloset,” available <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2017-01-24">Tuesday</TIMEX3> for purchase in paperback and digital formats on Amazon and iTunes. 
 
“<TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2016">Last year</TIMEX3> I started doing blogs on Facebook and <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="SET" value="P1M" quant="EACH">each month</TIMEX3> had a different theme,” said Mitleid, who majored in theater at Brown University. “People always asked me, ‘why don’t you write a book,’ and halfway through the year of writing blogs I realized I had a book right there. It’s based on four things we wrestle with so much: clarity, simplicity, adaptability and stress. It’s <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="20">the 21st Century</TIMEX3>. We all have stress.” 
 
Before focusing on spiritualism, Mitleid worked as an actor in New York City, a television producer and an executive recruiter. In <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="1994">1994</TIMEX3>, she says she “hung out her shingle part-time.” 
 
“I had always had trouble finding a place for my passion,” she said. “But all of a sudden in <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="1994">1994</TIMEX3> I found I could do hands-on healing and talk to dead people with no training. Then I was watching the Twin Towers burn on 9/11 and I said to my husband, ‘I’m going to need to do this full-time. People need to know there’s something besides fear in the world.’ ” 
 
Mitleid says she isn’t in the business to tell us who’s going to finish first in the Kentucky Derby, how to win the Lottery, or predict tomorrow’s weather. She’s here to help people make it through their trials and tribulations. 
“I’m not a fortune teller and I don’t want to take over your life,” she said. “Don’t ask me if you’re going to be a success. That’s the wrong question. Ask me how to make things work.” 
 
Mitleid, who is recognized as a non-denominational minister by the Sanctuary of Beloved of New York, says her value is clearly demonstrated by the number of repeat customers she has. 
 
“Even the best of us are only 85 percent accurate,” she said. “The only one who is 100 percent accurate is God and he doesn’t show up at psychic fairs. I know I’m good because people come back to me and tell me how accurate I was, and I am humbled to hear them say that.”
