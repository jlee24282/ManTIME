No sunshine was observed <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>, marking the seventh consecutive day of complete overcast across the city. Cloudy skies are expected to hold firm again on <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3> as low pressure deepens over eastern Canada. Should the area indeed receive zero sunshine through <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3>, we will lie on the cusp of setting a record for cloud cover persistence in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01">January</TIMEX3>. Chicago climatologist Frank Wachowski has noted that only <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="1992-01">January of 1992</TIMEX3> produced more prolonged cloudiness, with no sunshine observed from the 1st, through the 9th. <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017-01">January</TIMEX3>, <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> is also set to become the second cloudiest since records began to be kept in <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="1893">1893</TIMEX3>. Through <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>, the month has produced a mere 23 percent of possible sunshine. The record is 20 percent in <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="1998">1998</TIMEX3>. Peeks of sun are possible <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2017-01-23" mod="START">early Monday</TIMEX3> before low pressure sweeps across the Great Lakes, bringing more clouds.
