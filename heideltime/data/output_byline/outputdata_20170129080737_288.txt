COOLIDGE — State Rep. T.J. Shope has introduced a bill complementing the Pinal Regional Transportation Authority plan. 
 
However, the bill’s opponents stand their ground, alleging misuse of funds under the <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> transportation half-cent tax rate. 
 
Shope, R-Coolidge, said he’s backing House Bill <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2156">2156</TIMEX3>, relating to the county transportation excise tax, at the request of the county government, including the Board of Supervisors, and the Pinal Partnership organization with what they’ve been working on for the RTA plan. 
 
“Being the good representative that I am, I said, ‘sure, I’ll introduce (the bill) for you,’” Shope said. 
 
The Pinal RTA has a plan consisting of road and public transportation projects anticipated to be developed between <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2036">2036</TIMEX3>. If approved by voters, the plan and half-cent excise tax would set aside about $640 million in transportation funding over a <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P20Y">20-year</TIMEX3> timespan to establish and enhance the transportation network in Pinal County. 
 
Shope’s bill would mean a levy, if enacted in a countywide election, for the regional transportation authority in any county and collection of a transportation excise tax up to the rate specified in the bill in addition to existing taxes. 
 
The tax would be levied beginning either <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-01-01">Jan. 1</TIMEX3> or <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-07-01">July 1</TIMEX3>, depending on which comes first after voters approve the measure. It would remain in effect for <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P20Y">20 years</TIMEX3>. 
 
Shope said the bill would mean flexibility to counties setting different rates at different dollar thresholds, which is something that certain cities, such as Coolidge, already do. 
 
“(The bill would mean) allowing counties to have that same flexibility,” he said. “(But) this would still have to go to the voters,” as opposed to individual cities and towns, which would typically adopt the tax via their city or town councils. 
 
But others disagree. 
 
The Arizona Free Enterprise Club posted a press release <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2017-01-19">Jan. 19</TIMEX3> explaining its reasoning to oppose the legislation. 
 
“The Club <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> shed light on the effort in Pinal County to ask voters to approve an additional half-cent transportation tax increase on top of the <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> transit tax,” the release states. “Following a series of State Auditor General reports, the existing tax — which dates back to the late ’<TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="198">80s</TIMEX3> — has a long recorded history of misuse and misallocation of funds. 
 
“Transportation dollars have been used to give <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2017-12-25">Christmas</TIMEX3> bonuses to city employees and the majority of the dollars are being allocated to the politically powerful municipalities in the county and not going toward needed regional road projects.” 
 
It goes on to state that because auto dealers, home builders and taxpayer watchdog groups put pressure on the Pinal RTA with their opposition, it backed down from “forcing a vote” and has had to bounce back from criticism over an apparent $640 million spending spree. 
 
That, the release alleges, is why Shope was brought into the mix to introduce the legislation. 
 
At Wednesday’s Board of Supervisors meeting, County Manager Greg Stanley called the critique “kind of a bogus reference,” to the existing half-cent sales tax and insisted that the county has never misused transportation dollars, though some issues pertaining to the half-cent sales tax have come from some of the smaller cities and towns. 
 
It was not clear which ones Stanley was referencing. 
 
Scot Mussi of the Arizona Free Enterprise Club told PinalCentral that through the club’s own research, “the components of the tax probably are misguided,” and “the bill itself is very narrow.” The club’s opinion, he said, is to prioritize construction of regional — not local — projects. 
 
Because the bill has yet to be heard in committee, Mussi said it’s difficult to gauge where many lawmakers stand, but the club’s representatives will likely come forward to lawmakers and policymakers with their concerns that the bill is “providing carveouts in the tax code.” 
 
“The last thing we should be doing is providing exemptions for particular industries,” he said. “It doesn’t make any sense.” 
 
Shope didn’t make any kind of a response to the Arizona Free Enterprise Club’s criticism. 
 
“I don’t have anything to do with how Pinal County (government) operates,” he said. “I’m just a humble legislator… I’m the vehicle to move that bill.” 
 
But one organization remaining in his corner is Pinal Partnership, one of the advocates for the RTA. 
 
Jackob Andersen, vice chairman of the Board of Directors and president of Saint Holdings, said no one from the Arizona Free Enterprise Club has ever talked to him about the matter, but regardless, he thinks the bill makes sense. 
 
“Infrastructure in roadways is very important for economic development,” he said, adding that in order to attract business and manufacturers to Arizona, access to good transportation is essential. 
 
There would be a much higher chance, he said, of attracting industries and commerce to the area with existing infrastructure, which would “benefit the entire community” when those workers buy or rent local homes, use local gas stations, send their kids to local schools and more. 
 
“It’s a positive bill that really allows the county to be in the same place a city would be (and) be able to reduce the taxes (which is) only good for the taxpayer,” Andersen said. “It’s only a positive thing.” 
 
But it’s still uncertain — the bill still has to be approved by the House and then the Senate in order to go to the voters to ultimately decide whether it becomes reality.
