Egypt have waited <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P30Y" mod="MORE_THAN">over 30 years</TIMEX3> for a victory over Morocco a run they are desperate to end in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3>'s Africa Cup of Nations quarter-final in Port-Gentil

The Pharaohs have won the competition on each of their last three appearances in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2006">2006</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2010">2010</TIMEX3> and hold the overall record of seven titles

And after impressively beating Ghana to first place in Group D the pressure is on to delivery glory

However Egypt have not beaten Morocco since <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="1986-03">March 1986</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> come up against AFCON specialist Herve Renard

Morocco came through the group stage for the first time in five attempts as a crucial 1-0 matchday three win over Ivory Coast saw Renard dump out the nation with whom he won the tournament <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2015">two years ago</TIMEX3>

The Frenchman is continuing his magic touch in the competition This is his fifth appearance and he has only lost two of his 22 games at the event 

He is also the only head coach to have won it twice having also taken the title with Zambia in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2012">2012</TIMEX3>

Egypt and Morocco - who finished second to DR Congo in Group C - are both eyeing a run to the final and will believe their chances are strong with favourites Senegal in the other half of the draw

The winners of this tie will face either Burkina Faso or Tunisia in Libreville on <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2017-01-25">Wednesday</TIMEX3>

PLAYERS TO WATCH 

Egypt – Mohamed Salah

Egypt only scored twice in the group stage and Roma star Mohamed Salah was involved in both goals

He set-up Abdallah Said's late winner in the 1-0 victory over Uganda before scoring the only goal of the game in the decisive final match against Ghana

Playing at his first major tournament winger Salah - arguably the tournament's best player - will be crucial to Egypt's hopes of further progression

Morocco – Faycal Fajr

Deportivo La Coruna playmaker Faycal Fajr has been hugely impressive at AFCON <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3>

His two assists which both came in the emphatic 3-1 win over Togo have him joint-top of the tournament's creative charts Fajr's crosses and throughballs from open play along with his set-piece delivery will ensure Egypt's defence – one that is yet to be breached in the tournament – will be given a stern examination
