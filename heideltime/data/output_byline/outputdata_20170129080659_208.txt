IDF troops entered the refugee camp overnight to carry out arrests. Dozens of local youths threw stones and firebombs at the soldiers, who responded by firing tear gas, rubber bullets and live bullets. 

                                                                                         
                
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
A local resident, Mohammed Mahmoud Abu Khalifa, was wounded by a live bullet to his back and died shortly afterwards at a Jenin hospital, according to reports.
