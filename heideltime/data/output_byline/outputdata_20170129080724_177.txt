MARIETTA — Twenty-nine organizations in the community received grants valued at $52,500 provided by the Marietta Welfare League during the Grant Recipients Reception at the Betsey Mills Club on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="TIME" value="2017-01-24TAF">Tuesday afternoon</TIMEX3>. 
 
“From shower chairs to multi-use trails, playground equipment to musical instruments…” said Amy Elliott, finance chairwoman. “We were able to fill $52,500 worth of need in Washington County.” 
 
Since <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="1929">1929</TIMEX3>, the Marietta Welfare League has been giving back to the community by donating more than $1 million for <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="P90Y">the last 90 years</TIMEX3>. 
 
“This is what the Marietta Welfare League is all about,” said President Dee Arnold. “It’s just fun to be able to help out the community.” 
 
All the money is from proceeds made at the League Shop, a coffee and gift shop located in Marietta Memorial Hospital. 
 
“Since being located in Marietta Memorial, our grant amount has more than doubled,” said Arnold. “They are very supportive with us in helping making things like this possible.” 
 
The league does not disclose how much money each organization receives.

Susan Allender, interim executive director of Harvest of Hope, said she feels to have an opportunity like this to serve the community. 
 
“To be able to provide frozen ground beef for all 11 food pantries in the area is wonderful,” she said. “We would not be able to do this without the Marietta Welfare League. Meat is scarce among the pantries and <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> we can provide it.” 
 
Heather Warner, executive director for Marietta GoPacks, thanked the community for the ability to provide meals for students within the schools. 
 
“We have a give and take program and without community support, wouldn’t be as successful,” she said. “We want to provide ways to help families better and expand our programs beyond just food. This will allow us to.”
