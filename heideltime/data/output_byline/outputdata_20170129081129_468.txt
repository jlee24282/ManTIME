LIBREVILLE (Reuters) - Concerns surrounding captain Asamoah Gyan's fitness could scupper Ghana's bid to reach a sixth successive African Nations Cup semi-final when they take on the Democratic Republic of Congo in the last eight in Oyem on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3>.    Gyan's fitness woes have clouded Ghana’s preparations for the encounter against a fast-emerging Congolese side, who finished top of their first-round group. It was the same group from which holders Ivory Coast were eliminated.    "Two giants, Ivory Coast and Algeria, are out of the way so it's a good wake-up call to all the people that think they are a big team and that it's enough," said Ghana coach Avram Grant.    "It's not enough. You need to prove it on the pitch."     <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2016-Q4">The last quarter</TIMEX3>-final pits Egypt and Morocco, who are both enjoying a revival in their fortunes in Gabon. 
    
Egypt, despite a record seven titles, did not qualify for the last three Nations Cup finals while Morocco got past the group stage for the first time since <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2004">2004</TIMEX3>.    Difficult pitch conditions in Port Gentil await both teams on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3>. 
    
“It is always necessary to have a remarkable capacity of adaptation,” Morocco coach Herve Renard told reporters.    The winner of the Egypt v Morocco clash will take on Burkina Faso, who beat Tunisia 2-0 on <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>.    Cameroon, who eliminated Senegal on penalties, will take on either DR Congo or Ghana on <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-01-26">Thursday</TIMEX3> in Franceville.
