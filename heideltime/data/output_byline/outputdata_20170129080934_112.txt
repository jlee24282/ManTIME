BOULDER, Colo. — Derrick White scored 17 of his 23 points in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2016-H2">the second half</TIMEX3>, keying Colorado’s 74-65 upset of No. 10 Oregon that snapped the Ducks’ 17-game winning streak on <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TNI">Saturday night</TIMEX3>. 
 
Xavier Johnson added 13 points as the Buffaloes (12-10, 2-7 Pac-12) kept the Ducks winless in seven trips all-time in Boulder. 
 
Payton Pritchard’s 19 points led the Ducks (19-3, 8-1), who lost for the first time since <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2016-11-21">Nov. 21</TIMEX3> against Georgetown. The loss dropped Oregon a game behind No. 7 Arizona in the Pac-12 standings. The Wildcats host Washington on <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29TAF">Sunday afternoon</TIMEX3>. 
 
White had a pair of 3-pointers early in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2016-H2">the second half</TIMEX3> that put the Buffaloes ahead 45-39 while Colorado’s stifling defense was keeping the Ducks out of rhythm at the other end of the court. And he had a 3-pointer, a three-point play and two free throws in an 11-1 run that gave Colorado a 64-52 lead. 
 
The Buffs are just the third team to top 70 points against the Oregon this season. 
 
The Ducks trailed 35-34 at halftime, just the fourth time they’ve trailed at the break this season. All the other times came back in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2016-11">November</TIMEX3>, in losses to Baylor and Georgetown and in an overtime win against Boise State. 
 
BIG PICTURE 
 
Oregon: Unable to shake off their dry spells, the Ducks failed to close out a perfect <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2017-01">January</TIMEX3> to go with their perfect <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017-12">December</TIMEX3> and in doing so probably blew a chance to rise in the rankings. 
 
Colorado: After snapping their seven-game skid — their longest of the Tad Boyle era — with an 85-78 win over Oregon State, the Buffs played an inspired game that left the Pac-12 with just one unbeaten team in league play: Arizona. 
 
UP NEXT 
 
The Ducks return home to Matthew Knight Arena, where they’ve won a school-record 38 consecutive games — second-longest in the nation to Kansas’ 50-game streak — and will host Arizona State on <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="TIME" value="2017-01-26TNI">Thursday night</TIMEX3>. 
 
The Buffaloes visit Stanford on <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="TIME" value="2017-01-26TNI">Thursday night</TIMEX3> seeking to snap a five-game road losing streak since their last win away from home, on <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2016-12-19">Dec. 19</TIMEX3> at Air Force.
