<TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Jan 28</TIMEX3> (Reuters) - A Sudanese student with U.S. legal
residency said on <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> she was briefly handcuffed at a New
York airport, following President Donald Trump's order
restricting entry into the United States for people from seven
Muslim-majority nations. 
    
Nisrin Elamin, 39, a Stanford PhD student in anthropology
who has lived in the United States since <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="1993">1993</TIMEX3>, said she landed
at John F. Kennedy International Airport on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="TIME" value="2017-01-27TNI">Friday night</TIMEX3> and was
detained for <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="PT5H" mod="APPROX">about five hours</TIMEX3>. 
    
Trump's order signed on <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3> upended the travel plans of
people without U.S. citizenship who were arriving in the United
States from those seven countries, including Syria, Iran and
Sudan, causing confusion and sparking protests at airports as
immigrants and refugees were stranded. 
    
Elamin said she had been in Sudan for academic research and
boarded a plane on <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="TIME" value="2017-01-27TMO">Friday morning</TIMEX3>. After presenting her U.S.
green card, a designation of legal permanent residence, at JFK, 
she said she was questioned, patted down and handcuffed. 
    
"It was an uncomfortable pat down, they touched my breast
area and my groin area," Elamin said in a phone interview. "Then
I got handcuffed and I just started crying." 
    
Elamin said the handcuffs were soon removed and it appeared
authorities were using them to escort people between areas of
the airport. 
    
Elamin was released, but she worried about leaving the
country again and about her parents in Sudan, whom she hoped <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P1D">one
day</TIMEX3> to help immigrate to America. 
    
"It scares me that I'm not able to see them if I want to,"
said Elamin, who lives in New Jersey.
