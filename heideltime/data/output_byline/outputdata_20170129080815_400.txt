There is a lot happening on the table of a cosmetic surgeon. A number of things have changed the way one looks at cosmetic surgery and how it is performed. Gone are those days where one was looking for over augmented looks to steal the show. Through <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3>, it was all about getting the natural look. It will stay around for a while and will continue to be patients first request during <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3>. 
 
A bigger change coming our way is the increase in demand to perform major surgeries using techniques that are minimal invasive, meaning lower downtime and are driven by advanced technology. A good surgeon would have already invested in these technologies, to stay ahead in the game. There are a number of surgeries that can be performed minimal invasively, ranging from facelifts, to breast augmentation to liposuction in various parts of the body. 
 
Botox and Fillers, will continue to rule the cosmetic industry. The need to look young, wrinkle-free and beautiful will never die. Injectables will be in high demand and are expected to take a new leap further. For minor fat pockets, injectable based fat dissolving is also gaining popularity, especially around the face and neck. 
 
Combination injectables based contouring – aimed at achieving a desired change in the face is not new, but is getting popular <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> and will boom in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3>. Procedures designed on beauty icons like – Cleopatra, Nefertiti, Adonis, etc. are based on combination injectables and endless experience. These procedures are designed to give symmetrical proportions, define a desired contour, address sagging skin, take care of facial fat loss and even remove hollows. These procedures also rejuvenate the skin and obviously gives a younger, energetic and pleasing look. 
 
Liposculpting, which was popular through <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3>/<TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3>, is also making new leaps ahead. It was restricted to the body and used to define or contour, the abs, ab-crack, waistline, arms, biceps definition, legs, chest, calves etc. It was still not performed at a Microlevel, but it will be <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3>. I <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> presented a new concept at one of the leading international conference – called Microliposcutpting. The concept takes liposuction two prongs ahead – <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> one can perform liposuction on the face with no marks and also go a level ahead while contouring small pockets of fat on the body with precision. It is extremely beneficial for people who spend a lot of time in the gym trying to get the fat-free-muscle-defined look. Microliposuclpting will gain practice in <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3>. Definitely in my Clinic. 
 
For the overweight and obese, 360 degrees slim-sculpting will gain popularity. It is not about getting the perfect lean, gym goers look. It’s about looking great in the clothes they wish to wear. It is achieved by addressing the right fat pockets and strategically combining multiple procedures. It’s also termed as the Instant Slim look or a SlimFit procedure. A perfect confidence booster. 
 
<TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3>, also saw significant improvement in using the body’s own cells to address cosmetic and non-cosmetic issues. It has been identified scientifically, that body’s own cells are a good resource for many problems not only in the beauty industry but in people with sports injuries and joint problems. Platelet enriched plasma, autologous fillers, adipose derived stem cells or growth factors are some of the new technologies to look for…. We may even call them Organic cosmetic solutions.
