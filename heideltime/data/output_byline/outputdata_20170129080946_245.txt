<TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01">January</TIMEX3> can certainly seem glum once the celebrations of the holiday season are behind us. Still, I’m thankful we’re finally having a real <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-WI">winter</TIMEX3> to refresh our lakes and streams. That said, a few rainstorms needn’t keep anyone housebound. Especially, not when you live in the heart of Central Coast wine country where our creative wineries offer some pretty great events <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="SET" value="P1M" quant="EVERY">every month</TIMEX3> of the year. 
   
With Valentine’s Day a little <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P2W" mod="MORE_THAN">over two weeks</TIMEX3> away, I’ve found some very special ways of saying "I love you" to your sweetheart by taking part in a winery event, featuring great wines and delicious treats in Santa Ynez wine country. And more great news, some events will last through the month of <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-02">February</TIMEX3> in Paso Robles. 
  
 Santa Ynez Wine Country  
  
Zaca Mesa, founded in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="1973">1973</TIMEX3>, is notable because most wine industry insiders think of it as the university where many of our greatest local winemakers got their start. Not only that, most of them stayed here to create their own noble brands in Santa Barbara County. So the minds behind Zaca Mesa <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3> have created Zaca University, naturally. They offer wine classes that are open to the public to help you better understand the magic that goes into the making of a bottle of fine wine. The upcoming class, “Seduced by Syrah,” takes place at their tasting room <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-02-11">Feb. 11</TIMEX3> from <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="TIME" value="2017-02-11T11:00">11 a.m.</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="TIME" value="2017-02-11T14:00">2 p.m.</TIMEX3> It will provide a tasting experience to allow you to truly get to know their five unique syrahs during a tasting with the winemaking team and a certified sommelier. They describe the tasting as a “deeper look into the remarkable <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2013">2013</TIMEX3> vintage.” They will teach you to recognize the impact from each factor of making the wine, from farming the vines, the effects of the vintage (the year it was grown) to winemaking, has on each wine even though they are all grown in their estate vineyard. It’s not only informative, it’s fun. The price is $75 per person (wine club members get in for $60 per person), which includes lunch with Zaca Mesa’s great team of people who are quite passionate about winemaking.

 Solvang Wine Country  
  
There are many new tasting rooms in Solvang. This quaint little town just keeps on growing better all of the time. But this special event, Solvang’s Third <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2017-01-25">Wednesday</TIMEX3> Wine and Beer Walk, which only happens <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="SET" value="P1Y" freq="1">once a year</TIMEX3>, is on <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2017-02-15">Feb. 15</TIMEX3> from 4 to <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="TIME" value="2017-02-15T19:00">7 p.m.</TIMEX3> It’s a great way to help you get to know some new tasting rooms. For only $20 per person, you can taste two samples at five wine and beer tasting rooms. The ticket price gets you a souvenir glass, and a map to make it convenient to find them all. You must be 21 or over. Purchase your tickets (cash only) on the day of the event at one of these three businesses: the Olive House at <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="1661">1661</TIMEX3> Mission Drive, Wandering Dog Wine Bar at <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="1539">1539</TIMEX3>-C Mission Drive and Sort This Out Cellars at <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="1636">1636</TIMEX3> Copenhagen Drive, where you will also be able to pick up the Wine & Beer Walk logo glass and head out to make some new favorites.

 Paso Robles Wine Country  
  
Whether you live nearby or <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DURATION" value="PT1H">an hour</TIMEX3> away, Vina Robles in Paso Robles offers some compelling reasons to rank them among your favorite Central Coast tasting rooms. On three Saturdays during the month of <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2017-02">February</TIMEX3>, they will provide free concerts at the tasting room. Not only is it complimentary, but reservations are not necessary. Their fine wines will be available, which you can purchase in flights (small pours of several different white and red wines), by-the-glass or by-the-bottle. They only ask that you do not bring in alcoholic products that they haven’t made. They will also have tapas available for purchase to sate your hunger. The free events take place on <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2017-02-04">Feb. 4</TIMEX3>, 18 and 25. 
   
On <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2017-02-11">Feb. 11</TIMEX3>, they are offering a pre-Valentine’s Day early evening tasting from 5 until <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="TIME" value="2017-02-11T20:00">8 p.m.</TIMEX3>, featuring a “Chocolate Festival.” They have invited other wineries and several chocolate vendors in for a wine and chocolate tasting that will be exceptional. The cost is $40 per person ($35 per person for wine club members), with a portion of the proceeds going to the Big Brothers Big Sisters of SLO County charity. Singer-songwriter Melody Flemin will perform. She will also appear during the free concert on <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2017-02-04">Feb. 4</TIMEX3>. Other artists will include Kenny Taylor on <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2017-02-18">Feb. 18</TIMEX3> and Whitherward, a nationally touring indie-folk duo, on the <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="2017-02-25">Feb. 25</TIMEX3>. Learn more about the free concerts and other concerts in their spectacular amphitheater (I saw Tony Bennett <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3>) at www.vinarobles.com . 
   
There are many more events going on, but I picked the ones that appealed most to me. Although I will steer you right, you may find something more appealing for your taste on the vintners associations’ webpages of events for the entire year of <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3>. I recommend visiting pasowine.com , www.slowine.com , and sbcounty.com .
