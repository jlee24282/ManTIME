“It marks the start of a new and deeper trading relationship with Turkey, and will potentially secure British and Turkish jobs and prosperity for decades to come,” <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-05">May</TIMEX3> said as she arrived <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> in Ankara, <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> after meeting US President Donald Trump. This first agreement, worth $125.6 million, could facilitate “multi-billion pound” deals between the two countries in the future, the government said in its statement. (Joe Easton/Bloomberg)
