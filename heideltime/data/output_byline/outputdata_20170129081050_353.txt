The Mexican statement added that Foreign minister Luis Videgaray Caso visited the Israeli embassy only <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">a day earlier</TIMEX3>, on <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3>, to express solidarity and friendship to Israel on the occasion of International Holocaust <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2017-11-11">Remembrance Day</TIMEX3>. 

                                                                                         
                
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
"Mexico and Israel share the historic rejection of racism and xenophobia, and Mexico will continue to work closely with Israel to combat any form of discrimination in the world," it said. 

                                                                                         
                
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
The Prime Minister's Office and Israel's Foreign Ministry published a clarification hours after Netanyahu's original tweet, prompted by Mexico's outrage on the matter, according to a senior official in Jerusalem. 

                                                                                         
                
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
"The prime minister was addressing Israel's unique circumstances and the important experience we have and which we are willing to share with other nations. There was no attempt to voice an opinion regarding U.S.-Mexico ties," according to the clarification. 

                                                                                         
                
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
The heads of the Jewish community in Mexico also issued a statement condemning Netanyahu's words. 

                                                                                         
                
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
"The Jewish community of Mexico disapproves of the announcement by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about a wall on the border. We don’t agree with his approach and strongly oppose his position. 

                                                                                         
                
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
"As Mexicans and Jews, we support the steps taken by our government, headed by President Enrique Pena Nieto, in negotiations with the U.S. We identify with our citizens who live, work and contribute to the U.S., who must receive fair treatment and protection of human rights at any time," it said.
