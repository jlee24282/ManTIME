I've never seen a president.

I've interviewed politicians who have tried to become president. Ted Kennedy. Mike Dukakis. Paul Tsongas. John Kerry. Mitt Romney.

Heck, I've never even seen anyone who eventually because president. It had escaped my memory that one of the most popular players in the pro-am for the Deutsche Bank Championship - the PGA Tour event held <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="SET" value="XXXX">annually</TIMEX3> at TPC Boston in Norton, which <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017">this year</TIMEX3> will be renamed the Dell Technologies Championship - was Donald John Trump, a New York billionaire most famous for his reality series, "The Apprentice" and <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> the 45th president of the United States. <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="SET" value="P1Y" quant="EACH">Each year</TIMEX3>, his group drew a big crowd, with many fans pointing at him and saying, "You're fired."

I've been lucky enough to cover the tournament in each of its <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="P14Y">14 years</TIMEX3>, and <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">one year</TIMEX3>, <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3>, I decided to follow Trump around. His group was smaller than usual because, instead of his usual afternoon tee time, Trump began play at <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="TIME" value="XXXX-XX-XXT07:00">7 a.m.</TIMEX3> (those early-morning tweets are no surprise, then). He was partnered with one of golf's leading men, Sergio Garcia of Spain.

The buzz in the crowd was that Trump's trademark hair resembled cotton candy even more than the past.

One spectator drew a chuckle when she had Trump autograph a $100 bill.

By <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="TIME" value="XXXX-XX-XXT13:00">1 p.m.</TIMEX3>, a helicopter buzzed over TPC Boston, the letters T-R-U-M-P on the bottom, its passenger presumably headed back to New York.

It gave me a glimpse of the magnetism Trump has with many Americans.

Trump owns several courses, some ranked among the best in the world by golf magazines.

He's also a very good player. <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2016-12">Last month</TIMEX3>, Tiger Woods teed it up with then-President-elect Trump at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Fla.

Woods called it a "great day" with "perfect weather" as he and Trump walked 18 holes.

"At the time I think we only had, what, 10 security carts," Woods said <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2017-01-23">Monday</TIMEX3> while preparing to play a PGA Tour event in Los Angeles. "I think his might be increased <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3>."

When asked about Trump's golf game, Woods commented on Trump's power.

"For a person who is 70 years old, he hits it hard," Woods said. "People don't realize he's that old and he can rip it and hit it as far as he does. He keeps himself in pretty good shape and pretty good health, and has an inordinate amount of energy."

That's what I remember too. Trump swings hard. And not just at golf.
