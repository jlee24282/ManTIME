The Australian Greens has issued a slap down to the formation of formal factions just weeks after the establishment of the controversial anti-capitalist group Left Renewal within its ranks. 
 
A statement issued by the Australian Greens National Council on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3> declares formal factions "incompatible" with the party's principles. 
 
The statement comes amid escalating tensions between former party leader Bob Brown and Senator Lee Rhiannon over the party's direction under Senator Richard Di Natale. 
 
Ms Rhiannon - who is on the left of the party - <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-W03">last week</TIMEX3> said the Greens are at a "crossroads" and should consider adopting the policies of former US presidential candidate Bernie Sanders. 
 
But she was criticised by Mr Brown, who blasted her as the "Greens version of Tony Abbott". 
 
In its statement, which was emailed to every Greens member, the National Council said one of the Greens' greatest strengths is that it is a member-driven organisation. 
 
"We reject, as fundamentally inconsistent with our principles of egalitarian and collaborative consensus-based decision making, the formation of formal factions in the party," it said. 
 
"Furthermore, the formation of formal factions is incompatible with our party structure and rules".
