Q: I have been taking melatonin for years to help me sleep. I read that as your body ages, it makes less of this natural sleep substance. 
   
I try to avoid sleeping pills. The TV commercials for such medications scare me when they describe horrible side effects. 
   
I <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> read the fine print on my melatonin bottle. It said take it for <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P2M">two months</TIMEX3>, then wait <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P1W">a week</TIMEX3> before taking it again. 
   
I can do this, but I don’t want to take sleeping pills while I am off melatonin. I do not need anything that makes my memory worse, which is what I fear from the help-you-sleep stuff advertised on TV. At age 85, I’d like to stay safe. Is there a problem taking melatonin? 
   
A: We appreciate your concerns. Many over-the-counter sleeping pills contain DPH or other sedating antihistamines. A study in JAMA Internal Medicine (<TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2015-03">March 2015</TIMEX3>) linked regular use of first-generation antihistamines like diphenhydramine (DPH) and other anticholinergic drugs to dementia. Some prescription sleeping pills also have been associated with a higher risk of cognitive decline (Expert Opinion on Drug Safety, <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2015-05">May 2015</TIMEX3>) . 
   
Although melatonin usually is considered safe (Clinical Drug Investigations, <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2016-03">March 2016</TIMEX3>) , a British study <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> found that older people taking melatonin are at a greater risk for fracture (Age and Ageing, <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2016-11">November 2016</TIMEX3>). 
   
That may be because of dizziness or a morning “hangover” effect. An alternate approach to overcoming insomnia without side effects is cognitive behavioral therapy. 
   
Q: I took simvastatin for <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DURATION" value="PXY">many years</TIMEX3> to control my cholesterol. Soon after I started taking it, I received a diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes. I don’t know if there is a connection. 
   
<TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2016-07" mod="APPROX">About six months ago</TIMEX3>, I stopped taking simvastatin; my hips and knees no longer hurt. My latest lab results show an increase in LDL to a bit over standard range. HDL is OK. 
   
I also had experienced sexual problems, but I attributed those to the paroxetine I took for depression. I stopped taking the paroxetine <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2016-11" mod="APPROX">about two months ago</TIMEX3>, and the sexual difficulties have completely disappeared. I feel much better after eliminating both drugs. 
   
A: Simvastatin can raise blood sugar and make people more prone to Type 2 diabetes. A fascinating study showed that people taking a different statin, pravastatin, together with paroxetine had elevated blood-glucose levels not caused by either drug alone (Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2011-07">July 2011</TIMEX3>).

Q: You have written about white-coat hypertension. My solution is to have my physician take my blood pressure after the exam rather than before. That way, I have time to relax and get through the exam. My blood pressure usually is fine, whereas at the start of the visit it is often elevated. 
   
A:Your approach is sensible. Perhaps others will benefit from your experience .
