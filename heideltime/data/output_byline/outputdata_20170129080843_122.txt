A Nigerian Christian has a message for Apostle Johnson Suleman of Omega Fire Ministry. 
 
Suleman will appear before DSS on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-23">Monday</TIMEX3> over his comments on murderous Fulani herdsmen. 
 
He had told his church security personnel to “kill and behead any herdsman who enters here by mistake”. Suleman said he will not apologise for the comments because they were directed to murderous herdsmen. 
 
The DSS tried to arrest him but he resisted with the help of Ekiti governor Ayodele Fayose. 
 
DSS later invited Suleman for a chat. He will appear before the secret service on <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-23">Monday</TIMEX3>. 
 
Some Christians say they want to march for the man of God but Godswill Jumbo thinks people are missing the point. 
 
“The Christian faith cannot be defended by any world government, political establishment or even civil society. It defends itself amidst the fires of persecution,” Jumbo wrote. 
 
“If a pastor or Christian feels he is being persecuted, let him follow the footsteps of our Lord Jesus Christ…non-resistance, non-retaliation. 
 
“Christianity is fueled by holy passion generated in the heart of the believer by the Holy Spirit not by politics. We are not called to retaliate or even self defense. We are also not called to civil disobedience except where asked to recant our faith. 
 
“When Jesus was arrested by Roman soldiers He never resisted. Before Caiaphas, the high priest and Pilate the Roman governor he refused to defend himself in the face of false accusations. He willingly offered to be condemned, tortured and crucified. He even prayed for his persecutors cum oppressors. That’s the way to go for every Christian. Not the other way around. Let no one attempt to change the Christian narrative. 
 
“Every Christian should be like Christ!”

I love to have unfettered conversations about the media, religion, education, human rights, politics and everything in between. Aside creating web content, I also cherish causing the world some trouble as I, despite a looming global water crisis, drink three litres of the liquid on a daily basis thereby shortening the ration of the rest of humanity.
