Manu has made a smart move, considering he had lesser chances of winning the show compared to Manveer, Bani and Lopa. Even in the ticket to finale task, he lost to Manveer after getting way lesser votes than him. In the Mela task, Bani and Manveer got positive feedback from outside, which proves that they are more popular than Lopa and Manu.
