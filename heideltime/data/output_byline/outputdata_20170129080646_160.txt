The dire predictions of an epidemic drug problem in the homes of countless Americans were foretold by the world’s leading non-drug health care professionals, the chiropractic profession. Overdose death caused by narcotic prescriptions have nearly quadrupled since <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="1999">1999</TIMEX3>. From <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="1999">1999</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2014">2014</TIMEX3> the number of prescription related deaths exceeded more than 165,000 people — three times the number of U.S. military deaths from the Vietnam War. The numbers of overdose prescription pain medication deaths has risen in every county of every state reaching a new peak in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2014">2014</TIMEX3> at 78 deaths per day or three per hour. Simply put, the <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> health care treatment policies fail the very people seeking help. 
  
In a bold and pioneering move, the St. Joseph’s Regional Hospital in Paterson, N.J., <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> announced it has become the first hospital in the country to implement a program that will manage patients’ pain in the emergency room with integrative care and without narcotic painkillers. Painkillers most frequently used in the emergencies rooms are OxyContin, Vicodin, and Percocet, according to Dr. Mark Rosenberg, the Emergency Department Chair. Dr. Andrew McLachlan, professor of the University of Sydney, reported narcotic use for chronic pain control exceeding <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P3M">three months</TIMEX3> has no clear studies, yet one point is understood, these medications do have harmful side effects including addiction and death. 
 
Answers to address this public crisis are <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> available, but not utilized to their fullest potential here in the Mid-Ohio Valley or the surrounding counties. Here is what we know when the public has greater access to chiropractic services: cost savings of 40 percent; back surgeries when choosing a surgeon occurred 42.7 percent versus 1.5 percent when going to a chiropractor first; reduced disability, 9.1 out of 10 patients reporting satisfaction with care, and most of all, saving lives. 
 
It is time for an open and honest forum between the medical and chiropractic communities. We must put aside past harmful and deceptive rhetoric and work to integrate services that best serve the public. Discussion and demonstration for improved access of chiropractic services in the emergency rooms, pain management facilities, and physician offices is a great first step. Let us start <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> to reduce our drug epidemic for the love of the patients and public we all work to serve.
