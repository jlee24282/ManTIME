Tsogo Sun has come on board as the event's principle sponsor going forward and as such, the name had to be changed.  
 
What hasn't changed however is the fashion stakes. <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="SET" value="P1Y" quant="EACH">Each year</TIMEX3> still operates according to a theme and <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017">this year</TIMEX3>'s theme is "Decades of Glamour." 
 
Sun Met attendees have therefore been given 9 different decades of glamour to choose from and we at ZAlebs came up with some suggestions for who we'd like to see pulling off <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EACH">each decade</TIMEX3>. Take a look  
 
<TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="192">1920's</TIMEX3> - The Great Gatsby  
 
This era is characterised by the fact that women started to wear more comfortable clothing such as shorter skirts and trousers. They also started to exercise a bit more freedom (both in how they looked and behaved). The Great Gatsby narrative was also set in this era and it was all about opulence and glamour.  
 
As such, we'd like to see Khanya Mkhangisa (who usually goes uber-sexy with her looks), Nomuzi Mabena and Minnie Dlamini pull off looks from this era.

<TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="193">1930's</TIMEX3> - Vintage  
 
Vintage is NOT the second hand stuff sold to you in Braamfontein <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="SET" value="P1W" quant="EVERY">every weekend</TIMEX3>, nor is it that cool skirt you stole from your mom's suitcase of stuff that she doesn't wear anymore.  
 
Vintage clothing refers to anything produced around <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="192">the 1920s</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="PXDE">a few decades</TIMEX3> after that. So that cool dress you got from your grandma may count.

Vintage looks often have an a-line design or feature lace in their patterns like the looks worn below by Boity, Leigh Ann Williams and K Naomi.

<TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="194">1940's</TIMEX3> - Retro 
 
Short for retrospective fashion, retro takes a look back at the fashion of the West's war years with a-line dresses, shoulder pads, white gloves and shades of grey to reflect the mood of the era. Three piece suits were also still a vibe for the fellas.  The celebs we'd like to see in looks from <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="201">this decade</TIMEX3> of glamour are Katlego Maboe, Dineo Moeketsi and her boo Solo (who loves suits) as well as (with Brandon in tow).

<TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="195">1950's</TIMEX3> - Rockabillies /Sophia Town 
 
This era was all about polka dots and frocks paired with wing-tip eyeliner and a red lip. The local beauties we'd love to see rock this are Roxy Burger, Mbali Nkosi and .

<TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="196">1960s</TIMEX3> - Flower Power  
 
It's all about bright colours, big hair and bold patterns for <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="201">this decade</TIMEX3>. We think the likes of Thuli Pongolo, Linda Mtoba, Amanda Du-Pont, Loot Love, Thando Thabethe and could really work looks from <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="201">this decade</TIMEX3>.

<TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DATE" value="197">1970s</TIMEX3> - Disco  
 
This is a self explanatory look - big/super long hair, metallic and reflective fabrics, and just overall drama so who better to rock this look than some of SA's biggest divas? Bonang, , SK Khoza and possibly Gail Mabalane. Ok, that last one may not be a diva but she's so damn gorgeous that we'd love to see her pull off a super long wig paired with a jumpsuit a la Cher, circa <TIMEX3 tid="t34" type="DATE" value="1970">1970</TIMEX3>.

<TIMEX3 tid="t41" type="DATE" value="198">1980's</TIMEX3> - Glam Rock 
 
Rock n Roll was all about the lifestyle in this era and naturally, fashion started to play a big role in this lifestyle. We'd love to see Maps Maponyane is some guy liner and leather pants, Jay Anstey in a strappy sexy leather number with some wild hair and AKA in a full on Micheal Jackson vibe.

<TIMEX3 tid="t46" type="DATE" value="199">1990's</TIMEX3> - Denim 
 
Although Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake wore that iconic denim look in <TIMEX3 tid="t49" type="DATE" value="200" mod="START">the early 2000's</TIMEX3>, denim was a fabric characteristic of <TIMEX3 tid="t48" type="DATE" value="199">the 90's</TIMEX3> and the likes of Shane Eagle and LeAnne Dlamini need look no further than Brit and Justin for inspiration.

<TIMEX3 tid="t53" type="DATE" value="200">2000s</TIMEX3> - Modern Fashion  
 
We are in the fastest evolving era of them all and as such, I can't think of one look that is characteristic of the time. Jonathan Boynton-Lee and Nomzamo Mbatha could therefore go crazy with this era and surprise us with any kind of look they please. After all, they have the kind of gorgeous bodies that allow them to wear anything.
