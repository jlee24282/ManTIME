Just when you thought it was over, our homegirl Denise Zimba went and landed a new gig with M-Net. We <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> caught up with her at M-Net’s <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> showcase for their upcoming local shows to chat about the new job. 
 
It’s a show called Wedding Bashers and she will be travelling all across South Africa to attend and judge the weddings featured on each episode. 
 
She will be joined on the judging panel by Siba Mtongana, Cindy Nell and Zavion Kotze. 
   
Siba Mtongana is a multi-award winning celebrity TV chef, food judge and freelance food writer with a show on the Food Network called Siba's Table. We guess she’ll be bringing her expertise to the culinary aspect of each wedding.  

 
Zavion is a wedding planner and former Survivor SA contestant. Once described by Channel 24 as “the stereotypical image of an out-and-proud gay wedding planner,” he actually brings so much more to the table than that. He has been the SA Student Decathlon Champion for <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P4Y">the past four years</TIMEX3> and trained for the Sharks Rugby Academy under-21 side. 
 
But he is quite the perfectionist so the couples better beware. 
 
Cindy Nell first came into the spotlight when she won the Miss South Africa title and she has since gone to feature on reality shows such as Survivor SA and Strictly Come Dancing. 
 
She <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> juggles the roles of TV Host, wife, mommy, business-woman, and model.

The judges will often have to attend themed weddings so we can expect to see them dressed to the nines in a variety of looks. 

 
While the outfits may get crazy, Denise says she won’t. 
 
“One thing a lot of people are going to be surprised by is the fact that I am not going to come as crazy Denise, the Denise that I’ve always been. People grow and mature. You also end up wanting to direct yourself and your career into a different place as you get older.” 
 
She’s not doing a complete 180 though. 
 
“There will be a little bit of the crazy Denise but I will also be smart and critical about what I say because I’ll be judging the entertainment side of things but I’ll also keep it cool and collected. For the most part, it’s not going to be Looking-For-The-Loerie crazy” 
 
She was one of our highest viewed stories this <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2017-W03">past week</TIMEX3> for THAT comment she made about Ayanda Thabethe and she says she will be bringing that same honesty to Wedding Bashers. 
 
“I always believe you’ve just gotta be yourself and be real. Whoever likes you does and whoever doesn’t like you doesn’t.” 
 
In addition to the new show, she also plans to genuinely get back into music. 
 
“I don’t care what anyone thinks. Guys... I am THE SH** when it comes to my music.” 
 
And it is for that exact reason that she will be pursuing it with a passion <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017">this year</TIMEX3> and knocking down anything that stands in her way. 
 
“I’ve learned that in life, if you wanna do something, pursue it, put it out into the universe and then keep it moving”
