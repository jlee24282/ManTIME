Gluten free: Has a lifestyle 'trend' helped Scottish coeliacs?  Creative Commons 2.0 by Yasmina Haryono / cropped  
Another early morning arrives for Lewis Gill and his team, and under the cover of darkness they prepare tray after tray of Snickers bars. 
 
But rather than layering nougat with caramel and thick coatings of chocolate, Lewis' popular cakes are made with blended nuts and dried fruits - and just so happen to be gluten free. 
 
It wasn't the 28-year-old's intention to create a line of aesthetically pleasing and naturally sweetened gluten free cakes, but it was just how the recipe worked. As his small Stockbridge stall grew in popularity, he opened Grams in Edinburgh <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3> to cater to a growing number of diets from dairy free to vegetarian and vegan. 
 
But gluten was one aspect of the cafe that Lewis consciously added to the menu. While 80% of the dishes are gluten-free, he still wanted to offer the usual breads and wraps to customers without an intolerance or the autoimmune disease coeliac disease, which affects one in 100 people in Scotland.

Acutely conscious of cross contamination, a dedicated space in the cafe's kitchen was set up for the preparation of the bread and wraps for his sandwiches, but Lewis says the majority of customers asking for gluten free products aren't doing so out of necessity, but for lifestyle reasons. 
 
"I think about 99% of them are self diagnosed, a lot of people come in and they'll ask 'is that gluten free?' and we'll say no, and they'll say oh that's fine [and have it anyway]," he says. 
 
"It must be really annoying when [coeliacs] hear people asking for gluten free options when they're clearly not making a big fuss about it." 
 
The 28-year-old says he instantly recognises a customer with coeliac disease or a gluten intolerance as they will ask a number of questions about how Grams prepares its food before ordering anything. 
 
Coeliac UK estimates that there are around 52,000 people in Scotland living with coeliac disease, but that the majority fall under the radar or are misdiagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome. It's <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> campaign, Is It Coeliac Disease? aims to help those who may be living with the disease unknowingly. 
 
An autoimmune disease, coeliacs are affected by a reaction of the immune system to gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley and rye. When foods containing gluten are consumed, the immune system reacts by damaging the lining of the small intestine.

It is a painful disease and is often accompanied by other symptoms such as bloating, diarrhoea, fatigue and in some cases weight loss. The only way to treat the disease is to strictly adhere to a gluten free diet. 
 
Since the discovery of the disease and it's advised treatment in <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="195">the 1950s</TIMEX3>, coeliacs have been forced to check every label, ask a number of questions while eating out and to keep a close eye on what they are consuming. 
 
Cross contamination is the biggest issue they can face, a single crumb of bread could cause stomach problems or a dish of ketchup that has made contact with breaded chicken posing a risk. 
 
These issues are not faced by those who chose the strict diet without the necessary health demands, and Lewis believes many people can be scared of gluten unnecessarily without knowing why or doing enough research. 
 
Lewis explains: "The thing about gluten is that it can make you feel a bit bloated at times if you're eating loads of bread and [non-coeliacs] just freak out and think that is the gluten so they try and avoid it. 
 
"They could probably still eat bread and not eat so much of it." 
 
While coeliacs have no choice but to eat a gluten free diet in order to stay healthy, there are some people who have a gluten intolerance or sensitivity to wheat and are advised by doctors to remove it from their diet. 
 
There can also be confusion over the idea that leading a gluten free lifestyle is healthier, despite many gluten free replacement products containing high amounts of sugar to compensate for the lack of gluten which binds a typical bread or cake together. 
  

  Grams is one of many cafes offering gluten free alternatives.  Grams  
While the so-called 'trend' for removing gluten from a diet without medical advice can be a source of frustration for coeliacs, it has also driven a massive overhaul of the gluten free product industry. 
 
Where once coeliacs could only eat expensive bread through prescription, most supermarkets <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> carry large sections offering everything from high quality gluten free pasta to cakes, breads and crackers. 
 
Myles Fitt, Scotland lead at Coeliac UK says: "There are many others who do not have the condition but who also choose to follow a gluten-free diet and this has a significant impact on increasing the size of the gluten free market. 
 
"According to Mintel, the UK free from market is <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> valued at £365 million and forecast to grow by 50% by <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2019">2019</TIMEX3> and the gluten free market alone is worth an estimated £210 million. 
 
"This is welcome and has led to greater choice, quality and supply of gluten free products and dishes for those with coeliac disease." 
 
As the phenomenon of gluten free steadily rises in the public's conscious, restaurants have become far more in tune with their customers offering a variety of gluten free dishes on their menus. 
 
But as awareness increases, regulations are tightened and in Scotland an amendment to the Food Safety Act <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="1990">1990</TIMEX3> was introduced <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3> to ensure products listed as gluten free are labelled properly. 
 
Local authorities across Scotland are becoming more aware of the importance of gluten free areas and are starting to check sites for their policy over cross contamination. 
 
Myles says: "The challenge is to make sure that those businesses who are meeting this market do not lose sight of the medical importance of a gluten free diet for people with coeliac disease. 
 
"Coeliac UK works with retailers and caterers to ensure the gluten-free food they supply is safe to eat and has the confidence of customers with coeliac disease."

The charity offers companies advice on how best to avoid cross contamination, with an audit scheme which allows accredited sites to publish the charity's trusted gluten free symbol on its menus, providing a sense of assurance for it's service users. 
 
Chains such as Pizza Hut, Carluccio's and Pizza Express have all been accredited by the charity while Harrods have introduced a gluten free afternoon tea option for customers which has passed Coeliac UK's rigorous testing. 
 
But as cross contamination continues to be a major issue with coeliacs and taking a chance on eating out in a situation where they have no control over how food is prepared, 100% gluten free restaurants and cafes have started to open and among the most trusted are those run by coeliacs themselves. 
 
Adam Conway, who was diagnosed with coeliac disease in <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2014">2014</TIMEX3>, launched his gluten free bistro GF in <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2017-01" mod="END">late January</TIMEX3>, the Edinburgh cafe born from his own frustrations at being unable to eat out without feeling anxious. 
 
He says: "Many of my favourite restaurants before being diagnosed turned out to have fantastic gluten free menus, however after tucking into several different dishes at different places, sometimes you feel ill effects and you are left going over everything you have consumed the last couple days trying to work out possible causes." 
 
It's an issue many coeliacs face, and while an upset stomach could be caused by cross contamination or simply a stomach bug, the simple act of reassurance is something which has become a top priority when catering for coeliacs as the diet rises in prominence in the public psyche. 
 
Adam adds: "Hopefully GF can become the place to go for those with coeliac disease or any other food allergens."

While GF has only just opened to the public, the reaction from coeliacs in Edinburgh has been very positive. Yet pursuing a 100% gluten free business isn't necessarily a success story waiting to happen. 
 
Fiona Kozak, who runs Fifi's Cafe and Bistro in Aberdeen, <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> reintroduced items containing gluten to the menu to appease her customers after going 100% gluten free in <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3>. 
 
She explains: "From a business point of view, I had to look at the fact I'm a community cafe in a really strong community and I had to look at what people in that community really wanted. 
 
"The majority weren't really necessarily wanting gluten free, they wanted normal bread. I gave it <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3> and I think my response was to the majority of my customer base." 
 
While Fiona isn't a coeliac, she and her husband follow a gluten free diet at home and says that while she changed the menu to entice a larger clientele, she also offers reassurance to her regulars that the gluten free element would still make up 90% of the menu and an importance would continue to be placed on minimising cross contamination. 
 
As gluten remains a hot topic for the hospitality industry, Coeliac UK note that there have been positive steps for Scotland's coeliacs even if the charge isn't necessarily being led by those with the autoimmune condition. 
 
To wander into a supermarket and pick up frozen gluten free pizzas, cake mixes and loaves of bread at increasingly reasonable prices like any other shopper has been great achievement for the community. 
 
And to be able to walk into a restaurant with friends and family with a quiet knowledge that it has achieved an accreditation or is 100% free from gluten, helps to bring a sense of normality to a coeliac's life as they tuck into a plate of pasta that looks the same as everyone else's.
