Efforts to minimise track bias on the Geelong turf track have failed with jockeys steering a path to the outside rail at <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3>'s meeting. 

The Geelong Racing Club has acknowledged the problem and says it will work with Racing Victoria during planned renovations <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P6W" mod="MORE_THAN">over the next six weeks</TIMEX3>. 

In an RV statement, Geelong Racing Club chief executive Daniel Salter accepted there was a clear track bias despite aeration of the outside section before the meeting. 

"...I do acknowledge that with the rail out <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3> at nine metres this has not worked as well as we would have hoped," Salter said. 

"We will <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> look at making significant improvements to the track surface during our annual renovations <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P6W" mod="MORE_THAN">over the next six weeks</TIMEX3> prior to our return to racing on <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-03-18">March 18</TIMEX3>. 

"We understand the concerns raised by participants and the racing public regarding <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3>'s meeting at Geelong, and will discuss the matter with stewards and Racing Victoria in the <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="FUTURE_REF">coming days</TIMEX3>. 

"The club, as stipulated in the pre-race comments by our track manager Mark Jennings, did foresee a possible issue with the section nearest the outside rail and in light of this, we took action to prevent any bias in that area prior to <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3>'s meeting. 

"I have every confidence that we will not see an incident like this when we return to racing on <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2017-03-18">March 18</TIMEX3>."
