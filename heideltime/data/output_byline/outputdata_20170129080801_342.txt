The Westport Cinema Initiative (WCI) <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3> presented a screening of the <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="1997">1997</TIMEX3> film “In & Out” as part of the Westport Library’s WestportREADS “Bettyville” book selection. The book by George Hodgman explores the author’s identity as a gay man. The movie stars Kevin Kline who plays a popular teacher, who is gay, and is “outed” by a former student. After the Town Hall showing, Westport filmmaker Doug Tirola (l) discussed the film with Westport writer, author, and soccer coach Dan Woog, who described his own decision to disclose his homosexuality. While he was worried about the reaction, he said he was relieved to find that he received nothing but kind words. “I am sure things were said behind my back but most comments were of support,” Woog said.
