According to Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine, evidence in the case was discovered over the course of the ongoing investigation into the killing of eight members of the Rhoden family. 
 
Josh Rhoden, 38, of Peebles, was arrested and charged with drug trafficking. Pike, Ross and Pickaway counties are working together on the case, as well as the US 23 Pipeline Major Crimes Task Force.
