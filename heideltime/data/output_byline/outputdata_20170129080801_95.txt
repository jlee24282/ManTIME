The Herald-Tribune’s BuilderFest event on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-02-11">Feb. 11</TIMEX3> will bring together executives of three master-planned communities that are changing the map of Southwest Florida. 
 
Martin Black of the West Villages in North Port, Rick Severance of Babcock Ranch in Charlotte County and Laura Cole of Lakewood Ranch in Manatee County will take part in an <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="TIME" value="2017-02-11T11:30">11:30 a.m.</TIMEX3> panel discussion on how master-planned communities are built and what they mean to the region. 
 
It will be among several panel discussions planned for BuilderFest, a “marketplace of ideas” to be held on the plaza of the Herald-Tribune building at <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="1741">1741</TIMEX3> Main St., Sarasota. Admission is free. Hours are <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="TIME" value="2017-02-11T10:00">10 a.m.</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="TIME" value="2017-02-11T15:00">3 p.m.</TIMEX3> Host Harold Bubil will moderate the panel discussions; Kathryn Parks is co-host of the event. 
 
Michael Saunders & Co. is the presenting sponsor. The real estate brokerage, <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> in its 41st year, can expect to earn more than a few commissions selling houses in those communities in the <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="FUTURE_REF">coming decades</TIMEX3>. Both the West Villages and Babcock Ranch could have close to 50,000 residents by <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2050">2050</TIMEX3> or so. Lakewood Ranch has about 22,000 <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> and continues to grow. 
 
In fact, the West Villages, in just <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">one year</TIMEX3>, has become the No. 4 community on the list of fastest-selling master-planned communities in the nation. Lakewood Ranch, for <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="PXY">several years</TIMEX3> perched at No. 9 on the same list, has moved up to No. 5. 
 
“Having two of the top fastest-selling master-planned communities in the country continues to reinforce that Sarasota County is desirable and we’re attractive,” Black said, “not only as a retirement community but from a lifestyle perspective — people wanting to live here, establish businesses and bring their businesses to our community.” 
 
The West Villages scored a major coup in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2017-W03">the past week</TIMEX3> by earning a commitment from the Atlanta Braves to move its Major League <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2017-SP">spring</TIMEX3>-training camp to North Port, along with minor-league player development operations and a sports rehabilitation academy. 
 
BuilderFest will include home builders and remodelers discussing the building process, the remodeling decision, new-home design and green building. Michael Saunders and developer-builder Pat Neal of Neal Communities will join a panel discussion on the outlook for the real estate market in the <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="FUTURE_REF">coming months</TIMEX3>. 
 
Throughout the day, audience members can meet with builders and developers to learn about home building and remodeling.
