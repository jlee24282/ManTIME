<TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-WI">Winter</TIMEX3> break is great. That is, until it's time to go back to school and you realize just how fucked up your sleep schedule, diet, drinking habits and priorities are. Can't we just hibernate until <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-SU">summer</TIMEX3>? Read below for 15 things that prove your priorities have  never  been more wrong. 
 

 1. You stay up until <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="TIME" value="XXXX-XX-XXT02:00">2 a.m.</TIMEX3> each night  

 
…and wake up at 12 <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-01-30">the next day</TIMEX3>. Brunch exists for a reason, right?  
 2. "I'm definitely not blacking out <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29TNI">tonight</TIMEX3>."  

 
You're definitely blacking out <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29TNI">tonight</TIMEX3>. 
 3. In theory, you want to eat healthy  

 
But in reality, ain't nobody got time for a diet! Bring on the pizza. 
 4. Your bar tabs are going up  
And your bank account is going down. 
 5. You can't even fake motivation for class at this point  

 
It's even a struggle to sit through class during syllabus week. 
 6. You peaked <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3>  

 
And you are <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> on a slow decline to total self-sabotage. 
 7. The Netflix binges are at an all-time high  

 
Don't blame us, though! There are too many good shows out there <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">right now</TIMEX3> to resist.  
 8. Your roots are growing in and your ends are split  

 
"Take me as I am or watch me as I go." 
 9. Taking L's doesn't even surprise you anymore  

 
Oh, I failed a test? Whatever. Oh, I got a flat tire? Whatever. Oh, the guy I like just ghosted me? What-fucking-ever. 
 10. Swimsuit season is coming up soon  

 
But dinner is even sooner. Pass us a buttered roll pls.  
 11. "I'm never drinking again."  

 
You tell yourself. Repeatedly. Only to drink again <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="FUTURE_REF">a few hours later</TIMEX3>. 
 12. You wait to schedule your classes until the last possible second  

 
*Two weeks into class* "Did you make your schedule yet?" "Nah dude, I gotta go to advising <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2017-01-30">tomorrow</TIMEX3>." 
 13. You barely even remember to take your birth control on time  

 
Seriously, it can't get much worse than this. 
 14. "I'll try again <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2017-W05">next week</TIMEX3>..."   
We doubt it.
