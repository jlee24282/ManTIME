The Queen is to make history when she becomes the first British monarch to reach their Sapphire Jubilee. 
 
On <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2016-02-06">February 6</TIMEX3> - the anniversary of the day she became Queen  - Elizabeth II will have reigned for <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P65Y">65 years</TIMEX3>. 
 
But there are no grand festivities planned to mark the head-of-state's new milestone. 
 
The Queen is, at this stage, not due to be out and about on official engagements on the landmark day.  
 
The sovereign, who missed church over <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2016-12-25">Christmas</TIMEX3> due to a heavy cold, will undoubtedly be matter of fact about this historic occasion. 
 
In <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3>, when she thanked the nation for its kind messages after overtaking Queen Victoria to become the longest-reigning monarch in British history, she admitted bluntly that the royal record was ''not one to which I have ever aspired''. 
 
She added: "Inevitably, a long life can pass by many milestones. My own is no exception." 
 
The Queen celebrated her 90th birthday <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3> and had a busy schedule commemorating the occasion, with a walkabout, beacon lighting and a black tie dinner for family and friends in Windsor on her actual birthday. 
 
<TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="P1WE">A weekend</TIMEX3> of national celebrations, including a party on The Mall, was held for her official birthday in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2016-06">June</TIMEX3>. 
   
It is likely that any large-scale jubilee celebrations will be reserved for the Platinum Jubilee in <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2022">2022</TIMEX3> - although any events will take into account the fact that Queen is due to turn 96 that year. 
 
The Duke of Cambridge is about to become a full-time royal <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2017-SU">this summer</TIMEX3> and will increase his official duties on behalf of the Queen. William and the Duchess of Cambridge are carrying out an engagement on <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2017-02-06">Monday February 6</TIMEX3>, but not to do with the Queen's record-breaking reign. 
 
They will be attending Place2Be's Big Assembly at a primary school in north London to mark Children's Mental Health Week. 
 
The anniversary of Elizabeth II's accession to the throne in <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="1952">1952</TIMEX3> is a poignant time for the Queen, marking the day her father George VI died. 
 
She often spends Accession Day privately at Sandringham, having staying there through the <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2017-12-25">Christmas</TIMEX3> period. She usually makes her return to Buckingham Palace <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="FUTURE_REF">a few days later</TIMEX3>. 
 
Royal gun salutes will be staged in London on <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2017-02-06">February 6</TIMEX3>, as is the tradition. 
 
A 41-gun salute will be fired by the King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery in Green Park at noon, 
 
The Band of the Royal Artillery will play a selection of celebratory music close to the firing position, and 89 horses will pull six First World War-era 13-pounder field guns into position in the park. 
 
A 62-gun salute by the Honourable Artillery Company will be fired at the Tower of London at <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="TIME" value="2017-02-06T13:00">1pm.</TIMEX3>
