Texas State Library and Archives Commission Director and librarian Mark Smith 
 The  basics : Married, one grown child. Austin native. Austin High School/University of Texas alum. Has been in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> position for <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P3Y">three years</TIMEX3> and a professional librarian for <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P33Y">33 years</TIMEX3>.  Basic job responsibilities: “I direct the operations of a state agency with a mission of ensuring that Texans have access to the information they need to be informed citizens. I do a lot of planning, project management, budgeting, and many meetings with staff, the public, and our board to make sure that all our projects stay on track and that we are developing in ways that help the state and our customers. I meet daily with the outstanding staff of our four major programs tasked with maintaining the archival historical record of the state.”  Favorite/least favorite parts of the job: “I most enjoy travelling the state and seeing the direct impact of our work, such as a student who learns a new technology skill in a library makerspace we funded with a grant, a historian who discovers some hidden treasure in our archival collections, or a person who reconnects with an ancestor via our genealogy collections. The least favorite part of the job is not having the resources to serve all the people who need our services.”  Hobbies/spare time: “My wife and I love to travel, cook, hike and swim, and of course you expected this from a librarian — read!’’  Guilty pleasure: “Binge watching Netflix on a <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="TIME" value="2017-01-27TNI">Friday night</TIMEX3> and the occasional chicken fried steak are about as guilty as I get.”
