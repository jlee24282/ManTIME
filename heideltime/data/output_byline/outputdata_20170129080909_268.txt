Elena Hight has notched a few, very impressive X Games NBDs, including the first 900 in womenâ€™s competition (<TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2003">2003</TIMEX3>) and the first double alley-oop backside rodeo in the pipe, ever (<TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2013">2013</TIMEX3>). Elena has medaled five times, but until <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3>, the top of the podium in Aspen had elluded this incredibly talented pipe rider. No longer, though, as on <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday, January 28th</TIMEX3>, with a mass of spectators lining the decks of the pipe and a screaming, excited crowd at the bottom, Elena put down two stellar runs in a halfpipe that was challenging to begin with. Elena deftly combined style and technical riding, beginning her run with a kicked-out method and tied up her first place finish with back-to-back nines and an alley-oop rodeo. Congrats on the X Games Aspen gold, Elena!
