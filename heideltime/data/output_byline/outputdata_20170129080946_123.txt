I have a special friend 
 
Her name is Audrey Byers 
 
She is such a pleasure to know. 
 
She would make you smile. 
 
She has gone to “Skyline Estates” 
 
Yes, it’s senior care. 
 
Assisted living, with a trained and caring staff 
 
You will find it there. 
 
You can have your own room 
 
Or maybe share one too. 
 
Don’t worry about your meals and medications 
 
They will take care of you. 
 
Soon they will be opening 
 
A secured memory care. 
 
So if you don’t remember 
 
They will remember there. 
 
<TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3>, if you’re into social 
 
They have activities for you. 
 
Everyday you may dine with others. 
 
May I introduce 
 
Nadine and Barbara to you? 
 
They have a common area 
 
Where you can chat about. 
 
But if you’re not into talking 
 
You can shut your door 
 
And just hang out. 
 
This really isn’t about dying. 
 
But, in the end 
 
How will you dwell? 
 
With their kind and caring staff 
 
You will have a quality of life. 
 
And they will treat you well.
