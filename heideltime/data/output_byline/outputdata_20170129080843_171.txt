The Seaholm High School band <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> returned from taking a group of 130 students, staff and chaperones to Rome for <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="P1W">a week</TIMEX3>. 
 
The highlight of the trip was the band marching in the Rome <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2017-01-01">New Year's Day</TIMEX3> Parade, along with several other high school and college bands from the U.S., in front of a crowd that was estimated at 50,000 people. 
 
The band also had the opportunity to perform in the small hilltop town of Frascati,12 miles outside of Rome. One of the interesting aspects of the Frascati performance, band leaders said, was they met two Seaholm alumni (one from <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="195">the 1950s</TIMEX3> and the other from <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="197">the 1970s</TIMEX3>) who lived in nearby towns and came out to see the performance. 
 
In addition to their performances, students had the opportunity to experience many of the amazing historical treasures in Rome and the surrounding areas, including the Colosseum, Forum, Circus Maximus, Pantheon, Vatican City and Pompei. Band leaders said they had "a great time on the trip and were outstanding representatives of our community." 
 Roeper gala  
The Roeper School is celebrating its 75th anniversary with a Gala & Golden Apple Awards Ceremony at <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="TIME" value="2017-01-27T19:00">7 p.m. Friday</TIMEX3>, Feb. 17, at the Royal Oak Music Theater. Founder and executive director of the Equal Justice Initiative, lawyer and best-selling author Bryan Stevenson will be presented an award and will be the keynote speaker. In his critically acclaimed memoir, "Just Mercy: A Story of Justice and Redemption," Stevenson writes about the many cases in which he challenged bias against the poor, minorities and children in the criminal justice system. His book will be on sale at the gala, with an opportunity for signing. Stevenson will visit Roeper to meet with students the morning of the gala to inspire and to share his message. 
 
Also being honored are Shamayim “Mama Shu” Harris, Sally Booth and Rudy Simons. Ellen DeGeneres referred to Mama Shu as “the Amazing Mama Shu” who is rebuilding her blighted Highland Park neighborhood into a community to be proud of “house by house”. Booth, <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> in her 90s played an integral role in the school’s early beginnings, assisting founder Annemarie Roeper. Simons, a Roeper alum parent, is a well-known Detroit human rights activist, was a board member of both the Michigan Coalition for Human Rights and the Center for Peace and Conflict Studies at Wayne State University as well as a member of many international peace delegations. 
 
The Roeper Gala & Golden Apple Awards tradition began in <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="1990">1990</TIMEX3> to commemorate the school’s 50th anniversary and to honor individuals who embodied the school’s founding principle: each of us should strive to fulfill our potential and use our gifts to better the community.
