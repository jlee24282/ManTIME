These two rookies not only held down the fort for the team, but they also led the team to an unexpected 13-3 record and a number-one seed in the NFL playoffs. People thought that Prescott would just calm the sea for some games before Tony Romo came back from his  plaguing back injuries. Instead, Prescott played on another level and took Romo’s starting spot from him, leading the Cowboys on an 11-game win streak en route the NFL’s best record. 
 
With the Cowboys getting a bye for the first round of the playoffs, every Cowboy fan, media member and analyst not named Stephen A. Smith or Shannon Sharpe had them going to Houston to play in the Super Bowl, but thank God for the Green Bay Packers. 
 
I am a die-hard Green Bay Packers fan, so unlike all the other Dallas Cowboys fans out there, including my uncle, I can give the other teams credit. The Cowboys were the best team in the NFL. They had the best offensive line, the best rushing attack and a consistent defense and passing attack. However, even though they beat the Packers once during the season, I knew the playoff game would be a different story. 
 
All Cowboys fans thought they were going to destroy the Packers like they did the first time around. My Green Bay Packers came into Jerry’s world and set the tone. 
 
Aaron Rodgers and company scored 21 unanswered points on “America’s Team.” <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-Q1">The first quarter</TIMEX3> was still in progress, and the Cowboys’ players and fans already looked  defeated. Of course the Cowboys got their act together and made a game out of it, but when the deck was stacked, my main man Rodgers made an all-time-great pass to tight end Jared Cook who did the Michael Jackson slide on the sideline to secure the catch that set up the game-winning field goal by kicker Mason Crosby. 
  
Crosby was the real hero of this game, making three 50-plus-yard field goals that tied and won the game for the Packers. 
 
After the game was over, Cowboys fans all over were making up excuses, as usual, as to why the Packers won. I heard many excuses, but I never heard the truth. The truth was the Dallas Cowboys underestimated the Green Bay Packers, and they dug themselves too deep of a hole to get out of. Never underestimate the heart of a champion. 
  
<TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="XXXX-XX-XX">The following days</TIMEX3> were brutal for Cowboys 
 
fans as they couldn’t seem to get over how their team lost. On the <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-23">Monday</TIMEX3> following the game, the world just seemed quiet. The air didn’t feel the same, TV didn’t look the same and people seemed dead. 
 
It was great watching my Packers defeat the Cowboys in the most watched playoff game of all time, but it was even greater to see and hear all the reactions and excuses from the saltiest fan base known to man. 
 
I understand the football in Texas is a r eligion, and the Dallas Cowboys are God to some people, but at the end of the day, it’s just a game.  
  
I personally have no ill-will toward the Cowboys, and I couldn’t care less what they do. They can win all the games they want, just as long as they’re not playing the Packers. 
 
I believe the young and promising backfield the Cowboys have, along with the offensive  line and all the talented receivers, will be a force to reckon with for years to come, but <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017">this year</TIMEX3> wasn’t their time. As long as Rodgers and the Packers are in the NFC, the Cowboys will have to cut the cheese. 
 
I have a message for Dallas Cowboy Nation: your team had a great year, but they lost fair and square. Prescott, Elliott and Dez Bryant all showed up to play, but the Cowboys still lost. 
 
So quit crying, complaining and losing your mind over a team that doesn’t even know you exist. If you want to blame anybody for the loss, blame the coaching staff because they dropped the ball on numerous occasions throughout the game. 
 
Jerry Jones doesn’t pay your bills, Elliott doesn’t put your kids through college and Prescott doesn’t put food on your table every night. The Dallas Cowboys lost, and the Green Bay Packers won—plain and simple. Go Pack go.
