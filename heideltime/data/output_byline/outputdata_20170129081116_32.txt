The Maluch, built in Bielsko-Biala from <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="197" mod="START">the early 1970s</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2000">2000</TIMEX3>, has developed a following that apparently includes at least one prominent fan. 
 
Tom Hanks is a fan of the Polish-made Maluch, so he's getting one shipped to him with an invitation to visit Bielsko-Biala.
