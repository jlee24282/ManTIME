(HERALD PHOTO/Bethany Lange)       EVANSTON — School districts around Wyoming are bracing for impact after the introduction of HB 236 on <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-25">Wednesday</TIMEX3>. 
HB 236, also known as the education omnibus bill, attempts to deal with education funding shortfalls. 

If the bill is passed, Evanston’s school district will see an additional 2.13 percent budget cut <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2018">next year</TIMEX3>, or $872,500, on top of the anticipated budget cuts. 

According to the HB 236 Bill Summary Impact document, Evanston enrollment will decrease by 44 students in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2018">2018</TIMEX3>, compared to 2017 projections. 

The Subcommittee on Education Deficit Reduction Options issued a document <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2016-12-28">Dec. 28, 2016</TIMEX3>, detailing the state’s education budget crisis and some options to address it. That document, “Wyoming K-12 Education Funding Deficit White Paper,” is available at http://tinyurl.com/gnjdums. 

Wyoming expects an annual shortfall of $360-400 million at least through <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2022">2022</TIMEX3>. This is both caused and exacerbated by the state’s mineral industry crisis. 

“Due to the overwhelming dependence on the mineral industry to fund education in Wyoming, we <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> find ourselves in a budget phenomenon known as the ‘double-whammy,’” the document states. 

In short, the state is required to prioritize public education funding; the state needs mineral revenue to operate schools; and mineral revenues are declining. 

In <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3> alone, 5,400 oil and gas employees were laid off; total numbers for <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3> are still pending. Wyoming also saw its first population drop since <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="1990">1990</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3>. 

Schools are already dealing with the <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3> “penny cut” and enrollment drops (which means less money), and will have to cut even more <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2017">this year</TIMEX3> as it is. 

The Subcommittee on Education Deficit Reductions Options provided five options to deal with the education funding deficit, saying each option could fix up to $80 million of the problem. These options are as follows: 

• Adjust the funding formula for school districts and reduce appropriations from the School Foundation Program Account (including reducing total funding by .06 percent <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="SET" value="P1Y" quant="EVERY">every year</TIMEX3>, changing the funding formula to “cost-based” levels, consolidating school districts, purchasing instead of leasing school buses, reducing administrative salaries, reducing student activity funding, cutting the instructional facilitator program and cutting professional development days from 10 to five) 

• Find savings to offset shortfalls (using the Legislative Stabilization Reserve Account, or LSRA, to balance the School Foundation Program Account, or SFPA) 

• Find existing revenue (increase taxes or increase mineral royalties to the SFPA) 

• Recalibrate spending policies (increase the balance of the Common School Permanent Land Fund Reserve Account or send more investment income to the SFPA) 

• Enhance revenue (increase mill levies for education, impose a tax on health and professional services and increase sales tax) 

The omnibus bill reflects many of these suggestions. 

HB 236 proposes to raise the state sales tax from 4 percent to 4.5 percent as soon as the LSRA has less than $500 million and continues the funding cuts begun in <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3>. 

Furthermore, personnel will see a sharp impact. Superintendents, assistant superintendents and business managers would see their salaries cut by 10 percent; the instructional facilitator program would be cut in half; and the school year would be cut from <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DURATION" value="P185D">185</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DURATION" value="P180D">180 days</TIMEX3>. 

Bus purchases and leases and alternative school building would be frozen. 

Committees would be created to study alternative schools and recalibrate funding to a cost-based funding model, including for transportation and special education. 

Also, the LSRA would maintain the SFPA at $100 million <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="SET" value="P1Y" quant="EVERY">every year</TIMEX3> unless the LSRA has less than $500 million in the account. 

The Uinta County School District No. 1 heard about the omnibus bill at Tuesday’s school board meeting. 

Superintendent Ryan Thomas said he is keeping in touch with Rep. Garry Piiparinen about it. The omnibus bill is only one of many education-related bills; others propose to increase class sizes, while the omnibus bill focuses on cutting school days instead of class sizes, which would in turn cut salaries — possibly by $1,800 per teacher. 

Assistant superintendent Doug Rigby termed it the ‘ominous bill.’ 

Rep. Piiparinen, who is also a schoolteacher, told the Herald that he was the only member of the education committee who did not put his name on the bill. When the committee was asked to sponsor the bill, he had not had a chance to read the 53-page bill yet and did not want to put his name to it. 

“It would be hard for me to defend a lot of those things,” he said. 

Piiparinen said the bill was run through quickly but that it seems to put the responsibility for the state’s budget issues on education. He added that he would like to see other measures investigated as well, such as putting the Capitol Square Project on hold (including the Herschler building remodel and expansion) and working on the general fund. 

“They’re just expecting education to solve this,” he said. “... It’s a state problem; it’s not just an education problem.” 

The Legislature is accepting public comments on the bill at http://tinyurl.com/zfo9y6e. It will come to a vote on <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="TIME" value="2017-01-23TEV">Monday evening</TIMEX3>.
