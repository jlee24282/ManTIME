German sprinter Nikias Arndt was the surprise winner of the Cadel Evans Great Ocean Road Race in Victoria on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3> after he pipped Australian Cameron Meyer on the line to claim his first <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P1D">one-day</TIMEX3> win at World Tour level. 
 
Meyer had made a bold solo bid for victory with 600 metres to go in the 174-km race that starts and finishes in Geelong but Sunweb rider Arndt reeled him in with a well-timed late sprint while holding off Orica-Scott's Simon Gerrans.

Australia's Gerrans finished in second place as Korda Mentha's Meyer held on for third. 
 
Arndt needed a helping hand over the steep Chalambra climb, where a late attack was expected, with his Dutch team mate Wilco Kelderman pacing him to the front of the peloton. 
 
"I thought OK, if he (Kelderman) has done such a big pull, you also have to come back, you cannot give up," the 25-year-old Arndt told reporters. 
 
"<TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="PXD">The last few days</TIMEX3>, we could also see some tennis matches (at the Australian Open) and they also said something like 'never give up, just focus and try again and try again'. 
  
"That was actually a good motivation for <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3>." 
 
With the climbers unable to make significant ground on the inclines, the large leading group saw late attacks from Richie Porte, Nathan Haas, Chris Froome and Rafa Valls before the sprinters moved into position in the final kilometre.
