Captain of another boat, also loaded with China nationals for Chinese New Year cruise, reported to his bosses he saw boat go missing halfway to port <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">yesterday</TIMEX3>. 
 

 
PETALING JAYA: A boat captain who left port at the same time as the boat that has gone missing off the coast of Sabah, says he saw children on board that boat. 
 
“There were children on the missing boat but I don’t know how many,” Skipper Arwin Musbir told NST Online. 
 
NST also reported that it has learnt the missing boat has no means of communication or a radar system. 
 
Captain Arwin said his own boat left Tanjung Aru jetty at <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28T09:00">9am</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">yesterday</TIMEX3>, about the same time as the boat that has gone missing with 28 China nationals and three crew on board. 
 
He said his own boat had 31 Chinese nationals on board and headed to Pulau Mengalum, just like the other boat. But he noticed they were “left behind” midway. 
 
“As we passed Pulau Sapi, I could no longer see the boat,” Arwin told NST Online. 
 
Pulau Sapi is halfway between Tanjung Aru on the mainland and Pulau Mengalum up north of the South China Sea. 
 
Arwin said he told his boss of the other boat’s disappearance when he returned to the Tanjung Aru jetty.
