Cameroon have edged out Senegal fromÂ the African Nations Cup race. 
 
The Cameroonians qualified for the semi-finals, beating Senegal on penalties 5-4, after the two teams played goalless, even after extra time. 
 
Burkina Faso qualified earlier, beating Tunisia 2-0, with a late brace . 
 
Substitute Aristide Bance scored with a low drive from a free-kick only <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DURATION" value="PT5M">five minutes</TIMEX3> after coming off the bench for Burkina Faso.. 
 
Prejuce Nkoulma made sure of the victory on the counter-attack, after Tunisia had thrown everyone forward, rounding the goalkeeper 40 yards out before putting the ball into an empty net. 
 
The Stallions will face either Morocco or Egypt in the last four on <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-25">Wednesday</TIMEX3>, while Cameroon will battle either Egypt or DR Congo. 
 
In the Cameroon-Senegal match, Mane, Africa's most expensive player, was denied by Fabrice Ondoa, before Vincent Aboubakar hit the winning penalty kick after both sides were level after four kicks each. 
 
Much-fancied Senegal had a great chance to win it in normal time but Moussa Sow volleyed wide from close range to leave the game scoreless after <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="PT2H">120 minutes</TIMEX3> of play. 
 
The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Cameroon are four-time winners of the tournament. 
 
The result means Mane is likely to make a swift return to his club Liverpool, which suffered a surprising defeat by Wolverhampton Wanderers in the FA Cup fourth round on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>. 
 
There were striking similarities to this game and <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2002">15 years ago</TIMEX3>, when Cameroon and Senegal met in the <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2002">2002</TIMEX3> final in Mali. 
 
On that occasion, Cameroon beat Senegal 3-2 on penalty kicks after a goalless <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="PT2H">120 minutes</TIMEX3>.
