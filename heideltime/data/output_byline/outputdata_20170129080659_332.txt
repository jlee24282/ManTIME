Editor’s note: This is part of an ongoing series of question-and-answer segments with college athletes that will appear in the sports section on Sundays.

Question: How does it feel to get to 1,000 career points?

Answer: Really good. I was a little bit nervous at first, I just wanted to get it over with so it wasn't on my mind. It feels good.

Q: You've been a cornerstone of this program for as long as you've been here. What does it feel like to see this program grow the way it has?

A: It's rewarding. I think my first year we came in and we won three games. <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> we're up to six. Every game <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017">this year</TIMEX3>'s been close whereas other years we've been beat by 40 or something. It's nice to be in the game. Feels good.

Q: Why did you decide to come to Presentation and what do you like about it?

A: I wanted to be a nurse and they had a good program that works with basketball. I'm from Atwater, Minn., <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="PT3H" mod="APPROX">about three hours</TIMEX3>, three and a half. I like that it's small. You know everybody, you have friends everywhere, your class sizes are small and you're close with your professors. I like that.

Q: What kind of a nurse do you want to be?

A: I don't really know (laughs). I've got to figure it out I guess, I graduate in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2016-05">May</TIMEX3>.

Q: What's something people might not know about you?

A: My brother plays on the men's team, nobody probably really knows that.

Q: What's something you like to do when you're not playing basketball?

A: I like to take naps, when I can. Other than that just hang out with friends.

Q: Favorite kind of music?

A: Not anything really, I listen to it all. Probably favorite is country.

Q: Who's your favorite country guy or gal?

A: I don't know, anybody really.

Q: What do you want to do when you're done here? Do you want to go back home?

A: Probably, I don't know, right away anyway. In the long run I want to probably become a travel nurse, traveling around the country.

Q: What are the biggest memories you'll take away from your time with the team?

A: Those conference wins are always big memories, after not winning any to winning two, then three, it feels good. Good to win those.

Q: Is there a message you'd want to leave for those who come to the program or remain after you leave?

A: Don't take this time for granted because it goes by super fast. We're already at <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P5W">five weeks</TIMEX3> left in the season. That's crazy. I feel like I was just a freshman, <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> I'm at the end of my career.
