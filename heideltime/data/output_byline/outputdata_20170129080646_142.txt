The state of California has begun process to secede from the United States. 
 
Reports emerged at <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-W03-WE">the weekend</TIMEX3> that the proposal has been submitted to the Secretary of State’s Office. 
 
The proposed “Calexit” initiative – borrowed from the UK’s “Brexit” departure from the EU – would ask voters to repeal part of the state constitution that declares California an inseparable part of the U.S. 
 
A <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> poll found that one in three California residents would support a possible secession from the U.S. due to their opposition to President Trump. 
 
If the proposal qualifies for the ballot and is approved by voters, it could be a step to a future vote on whether the state would break away from the rest of the nation. 
 
Secretary of State Alex Padilla said the group behind the proposal, Yes California Independence Campaign, was cleared to begin attempting to collect nearly 600,000 voter signatures needed to place the plan on the ballot. 
 
“In our view, the United States of America represents so many things that conflict with Californian values, and our continued statehood means California will continue subsidizing the other states to our own detriment, and to the detriment of our children,” the Yes campaign’s website says. 
 
The proposed constitutional amendment, titled California Nationhood, would also ask voters to repeal language that states the U.S. Constitution is the supreme law. 
 
If approved, it calls for scheduling a vote in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2019">2019</TIMEX3> to ask voters, “Should California become a free, sovereign and independent country?” 
 
“America already hates California, and America votes on emotions,” Marcus Evans, vice president of Yes California told the Los Angeles Times. “I think we’d have the votes <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3> if we held it.” 
 
The campaign must submit the valid voter signatures by <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-07-25">July 25, 2017</TIMEX3> to qualify for the ballot.
