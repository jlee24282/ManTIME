Washington, <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">January 29</TIMEX3> ( QNA ) - A US judge has issued a stay temporarily halting the deportation of visa holders or refugees under an executive order from President Donald Trump. 
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed a legal case early on <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> in response to the order. 
The judge's stay prevents those "caught up" in the aftermath from being deported, the ACLU said. 
The group estimates that between 100 and 200 people were being detained at airports or in transit, according to the (BBC). 
Trump's executive order, signed on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3>, halted the entire US refugee programme and also instituted a <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P90D">90-day</TIMEX3> travel ban for nationals from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. ( QNA ) The ruling, from US District Judge Ann Donnelly, prevented the removal from the US of people with approved refugee applications, valid visas, and "other individuals... legally authorised to enter the United States".
