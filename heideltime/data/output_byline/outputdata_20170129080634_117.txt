The number of arrests in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3> for failing to register as a sex offender exceeded figures from <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2016">previous years</TIMEX3>, according to data from the Midland Police Department and Midland County Sheriff’s Office. 
 
The MPD attributes its agency arrest numbers to diligence about tracking sex offenders, according to a city spokeswoman. People who work with sex offenders said those arrested might have not complied because of personal factors or state registration requirements. 
 
<TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2016">Last year</TIMEX3>, 79 people were arrested for failing to register as sex offenders in Midland County, according to the sheriff’s office. That number topped figures in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3> — when there were 53 arrests for the offense — and <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2014">2014</TIMEX3>, when there were 37 arrests. 
 
Sara Bustilloz, spokeswoman for the city of Midland, said MPD has been diligent about holding sex offenders accountable for registration. She also said the department has <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> reached out to other area offices for help. 
 
“Over <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2016">the past years</TIMEX3>, instead of placing all the burden on ourselves, we can communicate,” Bustilloz said. “We talk to parole or probation officers if they hear something about a sex offender changing addresses. We interact with them to see if they’re moving.” 
 
Texas law requires sex offenders to register while on probation or parole. During this time period, a child safety zone perimeter prevents those registered from living within 500 or 1,000 feet of schools and parks. The city of Midland doesn’t have an ordinance that restricts residency after probation or parole, Bustilloz said. 
 
State law requires many sex offenders to provide updated personal information to law enforcement agencies for the rest of their lives. They also have to check in <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="SET" value="XXXX">annually</TIMEX3> or quarterly, depending on the severity of their offenses. Failure to meet the registration requirements results in a felony charge. 
 
Allen Bell, director of adult probation for Midland County, said his department reviews probation conditions with sex offenders. He said they face more than two dozen conditions that others on probation don’t have. 
 
“We peel all that apart in excruciating detail,” Bell said. “We go over what that condition means and how we’re going to enforce that condition.” 
 
With sex offenders, the probation department focuses half of its efforts on enforcement while the other half goes to treatment. 
 
“We contract with a therapist to make sure they go there,” Bell said. “They’re getting to the root of the problem to make sure they don’t offend again.” 
 
Bill Magee, a psychotherapist who counsels convicted sex offenders in the area, said they have ways of justifying their actions and often struggle with responsibility. He said those factors could have influenced <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> arrest numbers. 
 
“It’s relative to several things,” Magee said. “The values, thoughts and beliefs individuals convey is the primary one. The second is the economy has gone down in <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3>. Things like that are becoming paramount in their minds, and they let their responsibilities slip.” 
 
The Texas Department of Public Safety informs residents about sex offenders living in the state through a registry that includes names, physical descriptions, birth dates and addresses. MPD has a liaison working with the DPS to update public information about sex offenders in the city, Bustilloz said. 
 
<TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">Recently</TIMEX3>, sex offenders have been required to provide additional information to law enforcement officials. Mary Sue Molnar, executive director of the nonprofit Texas Voices for Reason and Justice, said the requirements constitute a burden that can lead to arrests throughout the state. 
 
“Laws have evolved so much throughout the years for people who are sex offenders,” Molnar said. “It’s grueling. A lot of violations of these laws are technical offenses — they don’t let them know <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION" value="P7D">seven days</TIMEX3> before they intend to move or <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DURATION" value="P7D">seven days</TIMEX3> after they move. If they don’t register a change in their vehicle or social media site, it can amount to a failure to comply.” 
 
As people move into the city, Bustilloz said the MPD has considered ways to track newcomers who should be registering as sex offenders. 
 
“The number of arrests for failing to register — it’s not necessarily due to an increase in the population,” Bustilloz said. “Obviously, we have more people needing to register if they’re moving to Midland from a different town. People moving to Midland need to register within <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DURATION" value="P7D">seven days</TIMEX3>.” 
 
The county’s population rose 17.7 percent from <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2010">2010</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3>, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates. On <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3>, 451 people on the DPS registry lived in Midland County. 
 
Magee has seen an uptick in clients over the years. When he started working in the area in <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="1994">1994</TIMEX3>, he had 30 clients; <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> he has more than 150 clients, Magee said. He thinks the number of people on the registry in Midland-Odessa will keep growing. 
 
“Sex offenses continue to happen <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="SET" value="P1Y" quant="EVERY">every year</TIMEX3>,” Magee said. “People come out of prison, and the numbers increase <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="SET" value="P1Y" quant="EVERY">every year</TIMEX3>. Some people should go off of the paper, but they mess up. Some people who get out are truly changed and enter the treatment program and are truly successful.” 
 
Still, Magee said there are hurdles for people who have been convicted of sex offenses. He said some of his local clients experienced challenges with finding or maintaining employment or housing. 
 
Statewide, Molnar thinks the failure to find hosing is most directly related to arrests. She said it’s often difficult for people on the registry to settle outside child safety zones during probation or parole periods. Even after that period, she said sex offenders have to fight negative public perceptions about them. 
 
“The majority of apartment complexes’ property management companies won’t let anybody with a sex offense live there,” Molnar said. “If they’re renting from an individual, they do a background check. Whether they’re on parole or probation or not, housing is difficult.” 
 
To combat the issue, Texas Voices for Reason and Justice tries to convince state legislators that registration should end when sex offenders complete probation or parole. 
 
“One thing we focus on is we would like to see at some point a reduction in the public registry,” Molnar said. “Most require registry for life without removal from the registry. We would like to see it go down.”
