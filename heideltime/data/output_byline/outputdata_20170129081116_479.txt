When Steve Jobs unveiled the first iPhone in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2007">2007</TIMEX3>, he instigated a revolution in gadget design with the introduction of touchscreens. <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3>, renowned French designer Philippe Starck and peer Jerome Olivet are challenging the undisputed norm <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017">ten years later</TIMEX3> with their concept design for a post-iPhone smartphone. Called the Alo, the phone features no screen and instead relies on holograms, voice control and haptic feedback. An always-on camera would also track the user's face to aid with 3D hologram displays. 
 
Completely removing the screen allows for Alo's much more fluid form. It incorporates a molded aluminum alloy core coated by a translucent, gelatinous exterior layer that not only provides vibration and heat-based feedback, but also heals itself in case of any scratches. While far from becoming reality -- the phone's operation relies on voice recognition far advanced than what's available <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3> -- it's an interesting thought experiment on the <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> smartphone form. Also check out Starck's <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> design for Xiaomi's Mi Mix "edgeless" smartphone.
