On <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3>, US President Donald Trump dropped a bomb when he indefinitely stopped all Syrian Refugees from entering the USA. He even suspended the entire refugee program temporarily. Even though the order does not mention Muslim or Islam, it does forbid people from Yemen, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Iran, Syria and Iraq to enter America for <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P3M">the next 3 months</TIMEX3>.

This decision has left the entire world in a fix including Hollywood. Celebrities and many other people took to Twitter to protest against the executive order and in no time #MuslimBan started trending. 
 
Hailing from Pakistan, Silicon Valley actor Kumail Nanjiani posted a series of tweets that point out the damaging effects that the policy will have on Muslims both in and outside America. 
  
As someone who was born in Pakistan I can tell you coming into America is VERY difficult. A #Muslimban accomplishes nothing but hate.

Hey @mike_pence  @SenJohnMcCain  @SpeakerRyan , you should be ashamed of yourselves. On your deathbeds you will know you made the world worse.

You're saying to a billion people "You're all the same. You're all dangerous to us." Children hear this. You breed evil here & everywhere.

To the dude who said I don't belong in America, I started a fundraising page for Syrian Refugees in your name. https://t.co/NOR5P48fBi  pic.twitter.com/jtJOsK9GrU

To our Muslim neighbors in the world: I & tens of millions of others are so very sorry. The majority of Americans did not vote 4 this man.

Don't Miss 
        
Donald Trump has no fucking clue. His desperate need for self aggrandizement is destroying US. Nothing will fill his black heart. #MuslimBan

Donald Trump is an unwell, evil human being. To the core.

1. Trump's #MuslimBan is against the law. The <TIMEX3 tid="t45" type="DATE" value="1965">1965</TIMEX3> Immigration & Naturalization Act eliminated national origins as a basis for immigration.

We've lost something very precious. 
And traded it for a cowardly, foolish illusion of safety. 
I'm ashamed. #MuslimBan
