Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals should remain in place. 
 By The American dream describes an ethos at the root of our national identity. This ideal conveys that all should be given equal opportunity to achieve success through hard work, determination and initiative. 
 
The original architect of this phrase, James Truslow Adams, envisioned a nation in which all would have the opportunity to achieve their “fullest stature” regardless of the situation of their birth. A group in our nation that uniquely embodies these ideals is the “Dreamers.” 
 
Dreamers are our neighbors, co-workers and friends who were brought to the United States unlawfully when they were very young. For many, the U.S. is the only country they’ve ever known. 
 
Most Dreamers identify as American. However, due to circumstances outside their control, they face significant barriers to integrating fully into our communities. Before <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2012">2012</TIMEX3>, Dreamers could not legally work or obtain driver’s licenses. They lived in constant fear of deportation and have faced significant challenges to pursuing higher education. 
 
To help prioritize immigration enforcement and remove some of the barriers to achieving the American dream, the Obama administration implemented Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2012">2012</TIMEX3>. DACA provides temporary deportation protection and renewable work permits to those who qualify. 
 
DACA recipients must be in school, have a high school diploma or be a veteran, and pass background checks. More than 740,000 DACA recipients <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> are able to contribute more fully to their communities through the ability to secure a job, pay more in taxes, attend college (although they are not eligible for any federal aid) and obtain driver’s licenses. 
 
While polls show that most Americans believe this group should be protected, many criticized President Barack Obama’s use of executive action to protect Dreamers. President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to overturn Obama’s executive orders, though what he will do about DACA and Dreamers remains uncertain. 
 
It is clear that repealing DACA would have disastrous results on our national and state economy. The Center for American Progress <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> reported that ending DACA would reduce the overall gross domestic product by $433.4 billion <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P10Y" mod="MORE_THAN">over 10 years</TIMEX3>. The hit to South Carolina’s GDP would be $247 million <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="SET" value="XXXX">annually</TIMEX3> if workers with DACA were removed from the workforce. This is money that goes back into our local economy and community. 
 
Public schools rightly invest in students and desire for them to be “college and career-ready” regardless of their immigration status. Starting in elementary school, students are taught the value of a college degree and the skills needed prepare them for a successful career. 
 
Yet for Dreamers, college and a career are within reach with a big asterisk at best. For most students, high school graduation is <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> of boundless opportunity, but for Dreamers, it can be <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> of anxiety and disappointment. 
 
Through my work at SC Test Prep, an area nonprofit that provides college readiness to students who are college bound but have financial need, and as a local leader with Bibles, Badges and Business for Immigration Reform, I have had the privilege of working with Dreamers. These are students who achieve good grades, volunteer in their communities and aspire to contribute fully to American society — despite the constant threat of deportation for those who have not received deferred action. 
 
A growing movement in Spartanburg, through the Spartanburg Area Chamber of Commerce and the Spartanburg Academic Movement, encourages a higher level of bachelor’s degree attainment among its residents. The goal is for 40 percent of Spartanburg residents to have bachelor’s degrees by <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2030">2030</TIMEX3>. We cannot overlook how Dreamers can be a part of helping Spartanburg meet this goal. 
 
With bipartisan support, Sen. Lindsey Graham has introduced the BRIDGE Act, which would temporarily extend protection for those who qualify for DACA while Congress works out a longer-term solution. The BRIDGE Act is a short-term answer for those who believe in what DACA has achieved but believed it was an overreach in presidential power. 
 
The new Congress has much work to do. For the new administration, repealing DACA and placing Dreamers in jeopardy of losing their jobs, licenses and ability to contribute economically to their communities — not to mention deportation — should not be a priority. Members of Congress should quickly pass the BRIDGE Act. Then they should direct their attention to passing long-term immigration solutions. 
 
America is great when all who consider themselves American have the opportunity to pursue success and upward mobility. Protecting the vulnerable and providing opportunities for individual achievement embody the values that make our country great. 
 
Here at home, we are one Spartanburg. Our entire community will thrive when each resident, regardless of the situation of his or her birth, has the opportunity to pursue the American dream.
