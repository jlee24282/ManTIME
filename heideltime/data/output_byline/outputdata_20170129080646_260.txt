The Georgia Northwestern Bobcats matched the visiting Oxford-Emory Eagles basket for basket in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-H1">the first half</TIMEX3>. But when <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2016-H2">the second half</TIMEX3> began, the Bobcats simply couldn't keep up the pace. 
 
The Eagles from Covington used a decisive 22-4 run to open <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2018-H2">the second half</TIMEX3> on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> and knocked off the Bobcats, 77-61, sending a Rec League Night crowd home from the Rossville Athletic Center disappointed. 
 
Georgia Northwestern, who had been riding a four-game winning streak, has <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> lost two in a row to drop back to .500 on the season. 
 
The first <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="PT20M">20 minutes</TIMEX3> on <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> saw the lead change hands four times and witnessed three ties, though neither team led by more than a handful of points. 
 
Oxford-Emory's biggest lead was four points, while Georgia Northwestern enjoyed a six-point cushion late in the half. 
 
The Eagles would score six straight points to tie things up at 28 with just <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="PT1M">over a minute</TIMEX3> left before intermission. But Alec Rattanaxay would hit a pull-up, 15-foot jumper with 60 ticks left and, following an Eagle miss, Darrius Fugh connected on an 8-foot jumper with <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="PT22S">22 seconds</TIMEX3> remaining to give the Bobcats a 32-28 lead at the break. 
 
But Oxford-Emory would heat up in <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2018-H2">the second half</TIMEX3> behind the shooting of Sean Wickman. Wickman, who scored 14 points in the opening <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DURATION" value="PT20M">20 minutes</TIMEX3>, connected on 6-of-8 from behind the arc in <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2016-H2">the second half</TIMEX3> to end his night with 36 points. 
 
The big run, which spanned the first <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DURATION" value="PT6M">six minutes</TIMEX3> of <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2016-H2">the second half</TIMEX3>, saw the Bobcats' four-point lead evaporate and become a 14-point deficit (50-36) with just under <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DURATION" value="PT14M">14 minutes</TIMEX3> to go. 
 
Georgia Northwestern would try to chip away at the gap <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DURATION" value="PTXM" mod="MORE_THAN">over the next few minutes</TIMEX3>. They closed it down to seven points with <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DURATION" value="PT7M">seven minutes</TIMEX3> to play, but Wickman would bury treys on back-to-back possessions to end any hopes of a Bobcat comeback. 
 
Zach Breathwaite added 20 points on the night as the Eagles avenged a 77-72 home loss to the Bobcats back on <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2017-01-13">Jan. 13</TIMEX3>. 
 
Darrius Fugh had 21 points for GNTC to go with 14 rebounds. Daniel Parrish was 5-of-9 behind the arc to end his evening with 18 points and four boards. Patrick Simmons had nine points and Micah Wheeler grabbed eight rebounds off the bench. 
 
Georgia Northwestern (8-8) will look to get back on track <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2017-01-24">Tuesday</TIMEX3> for Veterans and Law Enforcement Recognition Night at the R.A.C. They will take on Welch College out of Nashville, Tenn. at <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="TIME" value="2017-01-24T19:30">7:30 p.m.</TIMEX3>, preceded by the Lady Bobcats' game with Welch at 5
