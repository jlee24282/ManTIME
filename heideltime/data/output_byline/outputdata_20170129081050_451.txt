BOULDER, Colo. Derrick White scored 17 of his 23 points in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2016-H2">the second half</TIMEX3>, keying Colorado's 74-65 upset of No. 10 Oregon that snapped the Ducks' 17-game winning streak on <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TNI">Saturday night</TIMEX3>. 
 
Xavier Johnson added 13 points as the Buffaloes (12-10, 2-7 Pac-12) kept the Ducks winless in seven trips all-time in Boulder. 
 
Payton Pritchard's 19 points led the Ducks (19-3, 8-1), who lost for the first time since <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2016-11-21">Nov. 21</TIMEX3> against Georgetown. 
 
White had a pair of 3-pointers early in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2016-H2">the second half</TIMEX3> that put the Buffaloes ahead 45-39 while Colorado's stifling defense was keeping the Ducks out of rhythm at the other end of the court. And he had a 3-pointer, a three-point play and two free throws in an 11-1 run that gave Colorado a 64-52 lead. 
 
The Buffs are just the third team to top 70 points against the Oregon this season.
