The luxury ocean liner, Queen Mary 2, is gracing Port Elizabeth with its presence <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3>. 

The ship docked <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29TMO">early this morning</TIMEX3> and departs again <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29TNI">tonight</TIMEX3>, to continue its journey to the island of Reunion and Australia, all part of a <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P3M">three-month</TIMEX3> world cruise. 

The Queen Mary 2 is the flagship of the Cunard line and displaces just shy of 80,000 metric tonnes, and is 345 metres long - roughly the length of three-and-a-half rugby fields. 

It boasts a full scale planetarium  and a library with some 8,000 books. 

It is  also the only ship with kennels, so that passengers can take their dogs and cats along for the ride. 

In <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent years</TIMEX3>, the company omitted Durban from its visits to South African waters during world cruises to make provision for its guests to disembark in Cape Town, travel through the Garden Route by road, and then to board again in Port Elizabeth – or the other way around.
