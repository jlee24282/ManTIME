Election loser 
 
Re. “Trumpers make up United Cult of America,” Brian Chasnoff, <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-24">Jan. 24</TIMEX3>: 
 
So those of us who supported Donald Trump, exercised our right to vote, and voted because we didn’t want a continuation of Barack Obama’s policies with a corrupt Hillary Clinton belong to a cult? 
 
You and your ilk have not learned a thing from this election. The West and East coasts have their opinions, but the middle of the U.S. is also part of this country! If you don’t get your way, you attempt to demean the intellect and character of the opposition. This isn’t a one-party country yet! 
 
What is remarkable is how you have managed to “achieve the influence” of a newspaper columnist whose words are “preferable to reality.” You aren’t a cult leader, you are an election loser! Trump has accomplished more good things for the U.S. in these few days than Obama has in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P8Y">eight years</TIMEX3>.

I wholeheartedly disagree with this letter. The singer Charlotte Church should be admired for openly and bravely expressing her disgust toward the amoral, woman-hating, race-baiting and hatemongering Donald J. Trump , just as I flew my American flag at half-staff to display my sentiment regarding the female-groping and mentally underdeveloped person who <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> besmirches the White House.

Double meaning 
 
Donald Trump says “millions voted illegally.” One can believe what one wants to believe. 
 
However, it can mean several things. It could explain why one candidate won more of the popular vote and not the Electoral College . It might also explain why the president won Pennsylvania and other key states. Beware of double-edged swords.

Another red line? 
 
As ex-president, Barrack Obama says he will step up and speak out if President Donald Trump misbehaves. So Obama has drawn a red line in Trump’s sandbox?
