The Women’s <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2016-03">March</TIMEX3> on Washington the day after the inauguration developed out of anger, rage and fear. The anger had replaced disbelief the day after the election and reflected the anger persistent throughout the campaign. A woman in Hawaii suggested turning the anger into resistance in the form of a march. Within days, millions of women across the country and around the world agreed either publicly or silently, and showed up either in D.C. or their hometowns. But something happened on the way to DC. The women and men and children who gathered for that march did not look angry. Except for a little outburst here and there, the mood seemed almost festive. Perhaps it’s just difficult to look and sound angry in a sea of pink.
