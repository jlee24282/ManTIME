ATTLEBORO - The Bishop Feehan High hockey team extended its unbeaten string to six games with a 3-2 win over defending MIAA Division 2 state champion Medfield High <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> at New England Sports Village.

The Shamrocks (8-3-1) improved to 5-0-1 over their past six games where they have not surrendered more than two goals in any game, allowing just nine goals over the past 18 periods of play.

Senior Connor O'Brien had a goal and two assists for the Shamrocks, setting up tallies off the sticks of Kyle Brown and Jack Callahan, while Aidan Findlen stood tall in goal, making 29 saves, staving off a Medfield 6-on-4 skating edge after pulling its goalkeeper with just <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="PT1M">over a minute</TIMEX3> left to be played.

"We're skating toe to toe with everyone," said Bishop Feehan coach Kevin Dunn, the Shamrocks scoring a pair of power play goals. "There are the games that we want to be playing."

Callahan scored the game-winner for the Shamrocks at 12:16 of the third period, on the power play with Browne and O'Brien assisting.

The Shamrocks surrendered a power-play goal to Medfield at 12:50 of the first period, but knotted the score less that <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="PT1M">a minute</TIMEX3> later when Browne scored with an assist from O'Brien.

O'Brien gave the Shamrocks their first lead at 1:42 of the second period on the power play with Josh Nelson and Sean Dunphy assisting. Medfield tied it on a 5-on-3 power play midway through that session.

Hopkinton 6, Norton 1

MARLBORO - The Hillers netted <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="PT4S">four second period</TIMEX3> goals, one on a power play, to erase the Lancers' bid for an upset in the Tri-Valley League game.

Hopkinton stunned the Lancers by scoring twice within the first <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="PT90S">90 seconds</TIMEX3> of the game. Norton scored its lone goal in that first session with Jack Loranger turning on the red light, assisted by Brendan Heayden and Jake Palin.

Clint Gallagher was strong in goal for Norton, facing 48 Hiller shots. The Lancers posted 15 shots.

The Lancers (4-9) next host Bellingham <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2017-01-23">Monday</TIMEX3> with a <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="TIME" value="2017-01-23T15:40">3:40 p.m.</TIMEX3> faceoff at the Foxboro Sports Center.

Diman Voke 4, Tri-County 1

FRANKLIN - Diman Voke jumped to an early 3-0 lead that would end up being too much to overcome for the Cougars.

Tri-County (6-4-3, 4-4-3 in the Mayflower) and Diman Voke skated to a 2-2 tie earlier in the season. Tri-County's lone goal was unassisted and came in the second period from Kyle Hobbs.

Goalie Joe Brown totalled 31 saves for Tri-County which next travels to The Bog in Kingston <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="TIME" value="2017-01-25TNI">Wednesday night</TIMEX3> against Sacred Heart Academy.

Dartmouth 6, D-R/Seekonk 2

NEW BEDFORD - Dartmouth netted a pair of first-period goals and broke a <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DURATION" value="PT2S">2</TIMEX3>-<TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DURATION" value="PT2S">2 second</TIMEX3>-period tie by scoring three more times in beating D-R/Seekonk.

D-R/Seekonk (4-8-1) had won three of its previous four outings.

Luke Robitaille put D-R/Seekonk on the scoreboard late in the first period, while Ben Lunnie netted the tying tally early in the second period. Dartmouth regained the lead by scoring twice within the span of <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DURATION" value="PT1M">a minute</TIMEX3>.

Dartmouth unleashed 33 shots at D-R/Seekonk goalies Dan Loiselle and Ryan Fecteau. D-R/Seekonk mustered 21 shots.

D-R/Seekonk returns home at Driscoll Arena in <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2017-FA">Fall</TIMEX3> River <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2017-01-23">Monday</TIMEX3> for a <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="TIME" value="2017-01-23T17:30">5:30 p.m.</TIMEX3> game with Durfee.
