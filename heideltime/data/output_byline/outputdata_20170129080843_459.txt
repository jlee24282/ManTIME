For the first time in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="P100Y">100 years</TIMEX3>, Greeley residents may have the freedom <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017">this year</TIMEX3> to water their lawns whenever they want. 
 
Since <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="1907">1907</TIMEX3>, residents have faced limits on watering days — usually every other day — during warmer months. Thanks to an overhauled water budget system , residents may soon have the power to pick their days — any days; all days — so long as they stay within their budget. 
 
The Greeley water and sewer board approved lifting the restrictions, but the city council will have to give final approval — likely <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2017-02">next month</TIMEX3>. 
 
“It’s pretty simple,” said Harold Evans, chairman of the city’s water and sewer board. “If I’m going to say you have a budget, we shouldn’t tell you what days you should water.” 
 
Watering freedom would run from <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2017-04-01">April 1</TIMEX3> through <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2017-10-31">Oct. 31</TIMEX3>, and city officials would take a look at the results before deciding whether to keep it going in <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2018">2018</TIMEX3>. The water budget, however, is here to say. 
 
The water budget — and watering day freedom — would apply only to residential, single-family homes. Even then, the city will restrict watering between noon-<TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="TIME" value="2017-10-31T17:00">5 p.m.</TIMEX3> Businesses and other commercial property will maintain the same water rate structure as they’ve had in the past. 
 
Single-family homes account for nearly half of the city’s overall water usage, making that category ripe for change. 
 
Evans said the budget, which will take effect <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2017-01-25">Wednesday</TIMEX3>, is <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DURATION" value="P1DE" mod="MORE_THAN">more than a decade</TIMEX3> in the making, as city officials sought to stave off the effects of a drought like the one the state saw in <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="200" mod="START">early 2000s</TIMEX3> . 
 
Coming to consensus took a lot of work, as did developing the budget for every household. 
 
Greeley staffers mapped every plot of land in Greeley to calculate the amount of irrigable area — basically any property you have outside of your roof, sidewalk and driveway. They used that area, combined it with an assumption that every inch of that area is planted with bluegrass, and came up with a formula that spits out enough water to take care of all of that. 
 
“I think it’s the core of what the water budget is all about,” City Manager Roy Otto said, referencing the personalized water budget. 
 
Inside, the city will budget 55 gallons per person per day, with the assumption that there are three people in every household. (Call the city if you have a larger family). 
 
City officials say the budget should provide more than enough water for most residents. In testing the program with 16,700 households, the city found 83 percent of folks stayed within budget. 
 
If you don’t, well, you’ll get charged more. This year’s base rate is $3.97 per 1,000 gallons, which is actually cheaper than what folks paid <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3>. 
 
If you use up to 130 percent more than your budget, you’ll pay $4.85 per gallon for anything over your budget. The rates go up to $6.62 and then $8.82 per 1,000 gallons from there. Just 4 percent of the pilot group of 16,700 households went that far over their budget. 
 
“We think we’ve developed a program that will reward efficiency, and yet it will also provide an incentive for people who are over-watering to cut back,” Evans said. 
 
For <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3>, the changes won’t apply to businesses or other commercial property. That’s a little more tricky. 
 
A typical, tiered-rate structure would have been easier. That would involve one rate for a certain amount of water, and higher rates for anything above that. 
 
Fort Collins has one, and such a structure can punish homeowners with a larger lot even if those homeowners practice water conservation. 
 
“Without that work done by the staff, we would have arbitrarily penalized people for being efficient with their water just for having a larger lot,” Otto said. 
 
City officials spent so much time studying the outdoor water use because they say it’s the area with the most potential for savings. In <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DURATION" value="PXM">some months</TIMEX3> — particularly <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2017-04">April</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2017-10">October</TIMEX3>, when people run their sprinklers more than necessary — the city as a whole could cut water usage by half or more, according to city data. 
 
As Greeley grows toward 250,000 people by <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="2060">2060</TIMEX3>, getting folks in the habit of thinking about water conservation will be key, Evans said. 
 
“There’s a finite supply of water in Colorado,” Evans said. “We’ve got to be more efficient.”
