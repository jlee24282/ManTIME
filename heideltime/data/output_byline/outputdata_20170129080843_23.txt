Louisiana’s coast is in peril. And that peril puts us all — anyone who lives within tidal surge distance of the Gulf of Mexico — in peril. 
 
We have watched for decades as our land washed away into the Gulf. We have also watched the sea level rise and our ground subside beneath us. 
 
For far too long, our state and federal governments did nothing to offset this unsettling trend. 
 
But that has begun to change. Chance hasn’t come quickly, but the momentum away from inaction and toward urgent action has at least started. 
 
Our state government has embraced the notion of fighting for the survival of our coast and the betterment of all the people it protects. 
 
A <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DURATION" value="P50Y">50-year</TIMEX3> plan is in place to guide coastal projects toward those that will do the most good with the least money. 
 
The plan is estimated at $50 billion, and that money has not been secured. But even having a plan is a step forward from where we were just <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="200X">a decade ago</TIMEX3>. 
 
<TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3>, the plan is in place, and it is reworked and re-evaluated <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="SET" value="P5Y" quant="EVERY">every five years</TIMEX3>. 
 
Representatives from the Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority were in Houma <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="TIME" value="2017-01-24TNI">Tuesday night</TIMEX3> to explain the latest version of the Coastal Master Plan and to take comments from the public. 
 
The meeting was a success. More than 100 people showed up for it, and many were willing to voice their opinions on the plan. 
 
The fact that so many people have been spurred to action out of concern for our coast shows that there is a growing public awareness of and concern over our plight. 
 
That in itself is an improvement. 
 
The next step will be for state officials to finalize the latest iteration of the plan and set about putting it into action. 
 
That might not seem like a huge goal when the money to fully pay for the plan is still lacking. But the plan is an essential part of our way forward. 
 
And there is some money. Much of the money coming in from fines paid by BP for its part in the <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2010">2010</TIMEX3> oil spill will go toward coastal restoration. The cash won’t pay for all the projects in the plan, but it will create some progress. 
 
That, too, is important. 
 
The fact that we have stopped ignoring the problem and started addressing it is a major step in the right direction. The state’s plan represents our best chance at keeping the most of us safe from future storms. 
 
<TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3>, our challenge becomes getting the money to put fully implement the plan. The sooner the work begins, the more good it can do over the long run. 
 
Tuesday’s meeting was a great chance for local people to learn more and to get involved. But there are other chances as well. You can learn about the plan and make comments at coastal.la.gov. 
 
Take this opportunity to join the conversation that will help shape our future.
