A <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="PT1H">one-hour</TIMEX3> work stoppage was declared at John F Kennedy International Airport by the New York Taxi Workers Alliance (NYTWA) in a protest against President Donald Trump's executive order of banning all refugees for <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P120D">120 days</TIMEX3> and suspending immigration from seven Muslim-major countries, reports Polic.Mic . 
 
NYTWA is a non-profit organisation that works with the metropolis' more than 50,000 licensed yellow taxi drivers. 
 
The NYTWA wrote on Twitter: "We cannot be silent." Â  
 
They also twitted: "We go to work to welcome people to a land that once welcomed us. We will not be divided." 
 
NYTWA made a statement that cited the higher risk of the professional drivers being murdered during work for standing with those whose entry is rejected in the country. 
 
"Whose membership is largely Muslim, a workforce that's almost universally immigrant and a working-class movement that is rooted in the defence of the oppressed, we say no to this inhumane and unconstitutional ban," NYTWA added. 
 
Hundreds of protesters assembled outside the terminals demanding the ban removal, after the news of individuals being detained by law enforcement officials at JFK International Airport dispersed in the country. 
 
Dozens of incidents of individuals and families being refused entry in accordance with their valid visa or green card credentials have been reported across the US. 
 
The ACLU is organising further demonstrations at airports throughout the country.
