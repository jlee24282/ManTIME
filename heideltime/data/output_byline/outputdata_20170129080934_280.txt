Three were found mauled to death, four were found caged and alive in a field behind the sanctuary, while three others are still missing but presumed dead.

Frank Lewis, 18, from Croeserw, near Port Talbot, admitted burglary and killing the cats and was sent to a young offenders' institute for <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P30M">30 months</TIMEX3>.

Swansea Crown Court heard he used the cats as "live bait" for his dogs and slit one of the cat's legs to prevent escape. The other teenager, a 15-year-old boy, was found not to have taken part in the killings and was given a <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="P9M">nine-month</TIMEX3> curfew order.

"The ones they took were old cats," said volunteer Nicky Morgan.

"They didn't even have teeth, so they couldn't have defended themselves against what was happening."

But the sanctuary was consoled by the "overwhelming amount of public support" and the response to a GoFundMe page which collected almost £20,000.

"I've seen the best of humanity and the worst of humanity all in a short space," said Ms Ahmad.

<TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION" value="P6M">Six months</TIMEX3> on she said: "I don't feel that we have won. 

"I attended court on <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2017-01-23">Monday</TIMEX3> and I'm relieved he's in custody and that he was handed quite a lengthy sentence.

"But I just feel so sad because the cats aren't here and we can't bring them back.

"Everyday we think of how they suffered and what they must have gone through." Image caption The surviving cats were found in a cage in a field behind the sanctuary Image caption The cat on the right was a survivor. His two siblings were not so lucky Ms Morgan recalls finding three cats alive in the cage. 

"I can still remember their faces from that day," she said.

"Because we found the dead ones, we didn't think we would find them alive. 

"We just couldn't believe it. They were very lucky."

Ms Morgan explained it took those cats <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DURATION" value="PXW">a few weeks</TIMEX3> to settle back down as they had to be relocated while their room was repaired, which was "upsetting for them."

One of the surviving cats has since been adopted. 

Ms Morgan said since the sanctuary became well known, they have seen a lot more cats come and go. 

"Adoptions have increased, but then the other side of the coin we've had more in," she said.

"It's swings and roundabouts." Image caption The sanctuary <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> has about 50 cats, some of which are looking for new homes After the incident an online fundraising campaign was started with more than £17,000 raised in just <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DURATION" value="P4D">four days</TIMEX3>. 

That figure is <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> just shy of £20,000 thanks to the donations of 1,418 people. 

"We were absolutely overwhelmed at the public response," said Ms Ahmad.

"I can't thanks everybody enough. They've really helped us and our volunteers."

Some of the money has already been spent repairing the pens that were broken into, with the old mesh replaced by galvanised fencing bolted down to the floor. 

"There's no way anyone can cut through it," said Ms Ahmad.

Security around the sanctuary has also been improved with CCTV cameras, alarms and sensor lighting. 

All the pens have also been renewed in the cattery, which Ms Ahmad said "provides the cats and future cats with a "higher standard of living".

A large amount of the money has and will continue to go towards the sanctuary's veterinary bills, which is a "huge outgoing."

Image caption Galvanised fencing has been put around the pens for added security The sanctuary is <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> campaigning for a change in the law to get harsher sentences for people convicted of animal offences. 

Ms Morgan said: "At the moment judges' hands are tied by their sentencing guidelines.

"We were told we were lucky he was sentenced to <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">12 months</TIMEX3> as he could have got a suspended sentence."

A petition "demanding justice for the cats of Ty Nant Cat Sanctuary" has been set up and has so far collected more than 223,000 signatures. 

It proposes a register be introduced which anyone convicted of animal abuse, neglect or cruelty will have to sign. 

The petition said: "This will ensure that perpetrators are monitored and details of their crimes can be found." Image caption One of the cats cared for at the sanctuary
