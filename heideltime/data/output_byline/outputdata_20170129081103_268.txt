For <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DURATION" value="P25Y">twenty-five years</TIMEX3>, the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program has supported a comprehensive system of health services for vulnerable and under- or uninsured people living with HIV. Using data from the Health Resources and Services Administration about people living with HIV and served by the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program, we found reductions in disparities in viral suppression rates between <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010">2010</TIMEX3> and 2014—with rates for Blacks/African Americans, adolescents and young adults, and people living in the South becoming more similar to rates for Whites, older adults, and people in other regions of the United States, respectively. Although absolute viral suppression rates for people without stable housing and transgender people improved during the same time period, disparities were not reduced between these groups and those with stable housing and nontransgender people, respectively. Addressing persistent disparities through the effective use of this program will be one of the key ways to meet the goals of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy.
