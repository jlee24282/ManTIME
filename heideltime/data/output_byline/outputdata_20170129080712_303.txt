LONDON, United Kingdom (AFP) — The number of European nurses registering to work in Britain has fallen by more than 90 per cent since last June’s Brexit vote, the British Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) told AFP on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3>. 
 
A total of 101 nurses and midwives from EU nations registered in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-12">December</TIMEX3>, compared with 1,304 in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-07">July</TIMEX3>, the month after the referendum, according to the NMC. 
 
The country’s National Health Service (NHS) is <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> in the spotlight over an apparent “<TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-WI">winter</TIMEX3> crisis” and already has a staff shortage with 24,000 nursing vacancies across Britain. 
 
Official figures comparing the <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="SET" value="XXXX-XX">monthly</TIMEX3> averages for <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2016">previous years</TIMEX3> show 204 nurses registering in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3>, down from 820 in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3> and 707 in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2014">2014</TIMEX3>. 
 
“This is the first sign of a change following the EU referendum and it is our responsibility as the regulator to share these figures with the public,” said Janet Davies, chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN). 
 
However, she stressed that it was not possible to link the fall in registrations with Brexit “definitively”. 
 
There are almost 700,000 nurses <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> registered in the UK, of which 84.8 per cent are British, 5.6 per cent from the EU and 9.6 per cent from the rest of the world. 
 
Other reasons that could explain the decline include the toughening of the English language test in <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3>, or the sharp decline of the pound, which has cut wages in euro terms. 
 
Davies warned that the NHS could suffer a further crisis if the trend continued. 
 
“With 24,000 nursing vacancies across the UK, the NHS simply could not cope without the contribution from EU nurses,” she told 
 
AFP in a statement. 
 
“We need a guarantee that EU nationals working in the NHS can remain. Without that, it will be much harder to retain and recruit staff from the EU, and patient care will suffer as a result.”
