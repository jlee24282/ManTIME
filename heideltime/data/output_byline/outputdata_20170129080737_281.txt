Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3> opined for continuation of public examinations in Class-V and class-VIII saying those are playing crucial role in confidence building of students for secondary school certificate examination (SSC). 
"The main objective of introducing the new system in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2009">2009</TIMEX3> was to ensure equal opportunity to every student for learning, build up their confidence, remove fear in public examinations and give scholarship to students based on the results," she said. 

"But, suddenly I am observing some criticism on the issue and as a section of people came up with the suggestion to stop the examinations. But, their claim doesn't suit to the reality," the prime minister said. 

She added: previously a few number of students would have been selected for extra care from schools to prepare them for examination only for scholarship in Class-V and Class-VIII, and in that case other students were neglected. 

"Out of that thought, she said, we have decided to introduce the new examination system and give scholarships to the students based on their results," she said inaugurating the National Primary Education Week-<TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3>. 

The prime minister said in the previous system a student had to wait <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P10Y">ten years</TIMEX3> for a certificate. But getting a certificate in between is matter of great pleasure for them and guardians also, the prime minister said. 

Minister for Primary and Mass Education Mostafizur Rahman presided over the function organized by the ministry at Osmani Memorial Hall here. 

Acting secretary of the ministry Mohammad Asif-uz-Zaman and Director General of Directorate of Primary Education Dr. M. Abu Hena Mostafa Kamal addressed the function, among others. 

On the occasion, the prime minister distributed prizes among the winners of sports and cultural events of Inter-primary School Competition-<TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3>. 

She also distributed the National Primary Education Award-<TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3> among nineteen officials, PTI superintendent, instructor, education loving social worker and teachers for their outstanding contribution to development of primary education.
