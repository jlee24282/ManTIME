WARREN — A number of communities in Trumbull County charge fees for non-fire related services, which is something officials in Warren are thinking of doing, too. 
 
Howland, Bristol, Warren Township and Niles, which began just <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2016-SU">last summer</TIMEX3> charging for some services, are among the communities that have gone to charging fees to offset costs in the departments. The services range from ambulance rides to attending fireworks displays and fire alarm and sprinkler inspections, fire department officials said. 
 
The proposal in Warren stems from an effort by the International Association of Firefighters Local 204 against city hall’s effort to reduce the number of captains in the Warren Fire Department from six to three and to abolish the requirement that fire inspectors be captains, in an attempt to control costs. 
 
“When there are events — Relay For Life, the Italian, Greek and African-American festivals, and other programs — vendors pay fees to the city,” said Warren firefighter John Jerina, president of Local 204. “When the department sends inspectors to check each of their vendor booths, they should be charged for these services. Inspection costs should be part of their fees.” 
 
Inspections is just one way Warren firefighters propose to raise funds. Others include charging insurance companies and others for the city’s use of its equipment when the department responds to an accident or other emergency and increasing fees for having firefighters present at fireworks displays and other non-emergency events. 
 
Niles Fire Department charges a flat $200 fee for standing by at fireworks displays and other fees for sprinkler, fire alarm and hood suppression systems. The city generated $1,000 <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3> and is expected to only double that in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3>, said fire Chief Dave Danielson. 
 
“It is not a lot of money,” Danielson said. “We’re attempting to offset some of our costs.” 
 
Warren and Bristol townships charge for ambulance service. Warren does not provide ambulance service. 
 
“We do not charge for any other services,” Warren Township Fire Chief Ken Schick said. “The billings are helpful in financing the EMS services. The money earned is not used in other areas of the department.” 
 
Said Bristol fire Chief Tom Dempsey, “we will charge insurance companies for the equipment used during auto accidents, especially if we have to use extraction tools. We will charge for scene protection and hazmat equipment and material.” 
 
“We do not charge individuals,” he said. “What we are doing is trying to recoup our costs.” 
 
Howland has a permit fee schedule of charges for services, but the township does not bill for fire-related services like the need for a rescue truck at a vehicle accident, said fire Chief James Pantalone. 
 
The fee schedule includes the costs of different types of inspections and permits, including occupancy for new businesses in the township. 
 
“What we charge depends on the services,” Pantalone said. “We are a delegated fire service, meaning the township has the ability to draft and manage our own permit fee schedule.” 
 
Other communities rely solely on tax dollars to run their departments. 
 
“The mayor, safety service director and I, all feel people pay taxes to receive the services we provide,” said Girard fire Chief Ken Bornemiss. “We don’t charge for anything outside of the tax money our residents pay.”
