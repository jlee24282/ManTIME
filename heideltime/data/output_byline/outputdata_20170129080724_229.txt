<TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-Q1">The first quarter</TIMEX3> was dominated by the Delhi Waveriders, who started strong with better ball possession. 

They started showing more urgency and intent, forcing the Ranchi Rays back on every attack. Through concise incisive passing, Delhi Waveriders started breaking down the Ranchi Rays' defence each time they launched a counter. 

The first chance fell to Talwinder Singh with a fierce reverse hit to fire in the opener in the 3rd minute of the match. 

Tyler Lovell, in the Ranchi Rays goal came off the line quickly and blocked the shot to deny the visitors a lead. 

The pressure paid off soon enough though. Mandeep Singh won Delhi Waveriders their first PC of the game, thanks to sloppy defence within the circle by Ranchi Rays. 

From the flick, Austin Smith, did not disappoint with a hard push, but could not beat the goalkeeper as the two teams went into the first break in a stalemate. 

Delhi Waveriders showed their resilience, coming back from <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="PT2M">the two-minute</TIMEX3> break, discomforting Ranchi Rays who made as many as seven circle penetrations but in vain. 

The home team though had a golden chance at converting, within <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="PT1M">a minute</TIMEX3> into <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2016-Q2">the second quarter</TIMEX3>, but Gurbaj Singh's deflection from within the circle missed the goal by inches. 

<TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2016-Q2">The second quarter</TIMEX3> too remained goal less. It seemed as though fortunes would change in <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2018-Q3">the third quarter</TIMEX3> when Delhi Waveriders' Simon Child appealed for a high-ball coming off Gurbaj Singh's stick within the striking circle through video referral. 

His appeal was upheld and the visitors were handed a penalty corner. This time, skipper Rupinder Pal Singh taking the strike but Ranchi Rays goalkeeper Lovell was on top of his game so was the Ranchi Rays defender Flynn Ogilvie with some superb stick work to ensure they denied Delhi Waveriders a lead. 

The battle for supremacy continued into the final quarter with both teams pressing hard and chances flying both ways.

The teams had to settle with a draw and split the points from the encounter..
