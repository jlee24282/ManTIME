Video posted to Twitter by ABC7NY reporter CeFaan Kim shows a sea of protesters at JFK with a message projected high above them in blue letters that read, “F*** YOUR WALL”. The protesters were chanting over and over, “F*** your wall! We’ll tear it down!”, in protest of Trump’s commitment to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.

Independent reporter Tim Pool posted to Twitter that he was threatened several times by protesters at JFK who demanded of him, “agree with us or leave.” 
  
So while I have been at the JFK protest I have been threatened with violence three times and told "agree with us or leave."

Pool noted the difference in his treatment between Trump supporters and Trump protesters. 
  
Why is it that Trump supporters say "we don't agree and that's OK" and the Trump protesters say "I'm going to break your phone"
