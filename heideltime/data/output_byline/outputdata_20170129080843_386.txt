SANFORD — If you're ever in need of a hug, prayer, or word of encouragement, Salvation Army food pantry volunteer, Dorothy Stacker, is always happy to oblige.  
   
Dorothy Stacker, 55, life-long Lee County resident, volunteers weekly at the Salvation Army food pantry at 507 N Steele St, Sanford, to put food on the shelves and in bags for those in need.  
   
Stacker assembles meals with things that she would buy for herself at the grocery store like spaghetti, cereal and cupcakes. She keeps candy on hand for children who come into the pantry to make them smile, she said.  
   
"We are here to help families with food, pray for them, give them the word and just to have compassion," said Stacker. "We don't look down on people when they have a need. I know how I felt the first time I came in and asked for help. I didn't want to do it, it was embarrassing." 
   
Stacker began volunteering <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2000">17 years ago</TIMEX3> after needing assistance herself during during a personal crisis and health issues.  
   
"I started coming in to get some help for a light bill," said Stacker. "I came back to see if I could volunteer and hanging up clothes and stuff, then <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2015" mod="APPROX">about two years ago</TIMEX3>, after I got over some health issues I came and started volunteering over here with the food." 
   
Stacker worked for Coty for <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="P16Y">16 years</TIMEX3> and had to quit after she hurt her back in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="1994">1994</TIMEX3>. Her rough patch began after a divorce roughly <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="1997">20 years ago</TIMEX3> that made her a single parent of three children and in need of help, she said.  
   
"I really needed that help and then when I came to the Salvation Army and I met Pam Hooker," said Stacker. "We started talking and she really encouraged me. I didn't want to come in and get help but I needed help. We started a friendship right then and there and she encouraged me. We been talking ever since, we are prayer partners, we just encourage one another." 
   
Through her experience at the Salvation Army, Stacker has realized her passion for helping others the way Hooker helped her, she said.  
   
"If I needed help, somebody else needed help and also that encouragement," said Stacker. "I love doing it, I love giving back to the community, I love helping people and it just touches me to give back." 
   
A particular interaction with a stranger at the Salvation Army inspired her to keep volunteering and working to reach out to those in need, she said.  
   
Stacker overheard a conversation while turkey's were handed out during the holiday season where a young woman was explaining to others her illnesses. After everyone left, Stacker asked the young lady if she would like to pray with her and she did.  
   
"Before I started praying I told her how God healed my body," said Stacker.  
   
Roughly <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2000">17 years ago</TIMEX3>, Stacker was diagnosed with a spinal infection that should have claimed her life and at very least left her paralyzed, said Stacker.  
   
After an evening church service Stacker went to bed with a headache. <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2017-01-30">The next day</TIMEX3> she went to the emergency room where she was given shots and sent home. The <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="TIME" value="2017-01-30TMO">next morning</TIMEX3> she could not get up and her parents took her to the hospital.  
   
"I could hear the doctors saying that my body was shutting down," said Stacker. "I was dying and they didn't know what was going on, it was a terrifying moment." 
   
Stacker is a member of Christian Mission of Hope and recalls the prayers she prayed in her hospital bed that gave her the strength to carry on. 
   
"It was my faith that healed me," said Stacker. "While I was in the hospital I would look at the window and I told the Lord, if you take care of the animals, you said you'd take care of me, you said you'd never leave me nor forsake me. If I never walk again it's alright but my prayer was that I wanted to hold my first grandbaby. He touched my body and I was able to hold him, he's 17 <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> we have a bond, I have a bond with all of them, but especially with him." 
   
During physical therapy, Stacker had to relearn how to walk, feed and bathe herself, which was a humbling experience for her, she said. 
   
"It really humbled me because you're use to doing things yourself and all of a sudden you can't do it," said Stacker.  
   
After completing physical therapy, Stacker was able to walk out of the hospital and is thankful for <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EVERY">every day</TIMEX3>, she said.  
   
"They have in my records that it's a miracle, they said I wasn't supposed to be here," said Stacker. "<TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> I don't take it for granted, walking, talking, living, breathing. I have compassion for others going through sickness and ailments. Just living life I don't take it for granted." 
   
While Stacker is stocking the shelves and packing bags at the Salvation Army she often overhears people coming in asking for help who are often embarrassed, she said.  
   
"A lady came in who had never been in before and she kept apologizing," said Stacker. "I came around the corner and said, "Ma'am do you mind if I hug you?" and she said, "No I don't." 
   
Stacker hugged the woman and gave her words of encouragement.   
   
"I hugged her and said,"Baby, it's gonna be ok, it's gonna be ok, don't worry about it"," said Stacker. "She calmed right down and I prayed with her, something in her just lifted up." 
   
The hardest thing for Stacker to see is young people who come in who might be addicted to drugs. She wonders what more can be done and prays for them and prays while she is touching the food, she said.  
   
"I hear different people's problems and I wonder what can I do to give back and how can I help them," said Stacker. "If it's nothing but sitting and listening to them, if they have problems or issues, just by being a listener and letting them talk and praying with people and trying to encourage them. I tell them not to give up to hold on and to know that God is there and he will help you, no matter what you're going through." 
   
When Stacker is not volunteering, her passion is baking and decorating cakes, teaching people how to make cakes and spending time with her family. She has remarried and has eight grandchildren who she bakes with. She is also a minister who visits nursing homes and delivers sermons and words of encouragement, she said.  
   
"We all come to a point where we need help," said Stacker. "You've got to humble yourself and say, "Ok, I need this". It was embarrassing when I needed help not only with the light bill but with food because I had growing kids but you got to humble yourself."
