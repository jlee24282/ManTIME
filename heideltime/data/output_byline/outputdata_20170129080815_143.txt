SEDALIA, Mo. – Khiandra Perry finished a successful cut to the basket to give the Mineral Area a 20-15 lead as <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-Q1">the first-quarter</TIMEX3> buzzer sounded on <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>. 
   
But an ideal start on the road eventually faded, and State Fair dominated <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2016-H2">the second half</TIMEX3> to prevail 72-53 in Region 16 women’s basketball action. 
   
Ahjana Oakes and Ren’Cia Rolling scored 16 points each, and the Roadrunners (14-6, 4-1) used a massive 52-26 margin in rebounds to take control. 
   
Mineral Area also got a transition layup by Olivia White on an outlet pass from Hayley <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-WI">Winter</TIMEX3> as time expired at halftime to stay within 33-30. 
   
State Fair limited the visitors to eight field goals <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="PT20M" mod="MORE_THAN">over the last 20 minutes</TIMEX3>, however, and built a double-digit lead when Alexis Cowan was fouled on a made 3-pointer and sank the ensuing free throw. 
   
Rolling pushed the margin to 67-45 with a steal and layup in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2018-Q4">the fourth quarter</TIMEX3>, and the Roadrunners finished 12-of-15 from the line. 
   
Perry tallied a team-high 12 points off the bench for the Lady Cardinals (10-11, 1-4). Her energetic play resulted in three early baskets, including a slashing layup for a 12-8 edge. 
   
The lead changed hands six times early, and Maya Brewer put State Fair ahead to stay from the corner at 24-22 after MAC freshman Allie Golden sank a tying mid-range jumper.
