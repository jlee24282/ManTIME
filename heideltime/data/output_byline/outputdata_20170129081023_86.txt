DUBAI (Reuters) - A decision by President Donald Trump to temporarily ban Yemeni citizens from traveling to the United States is "illegal and illegitimate," authorities controlled by the Iran-allied Houthi group in Yemen's capital said. 
 
The war-damaged and impoverished country in the south of the Arabian Peninsula is one of seven majority Muslim countries whose citizens <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> face a <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P90D">90-day</TIMEX3> ban on entering the United States while the U.S. administration says it studies ways to keep militants out. 
 
The Houthi-controled news agency SABA quoted a foreign ministry source as saying the ministry was aware that such action is the sovereign right of the U.S. government. 
 
But "the source said emphatically that any attempt to classify Yemen or its citizens as a possible source of terrorism and extremism was illegal and illegitimate." 
 
Yemen has been divided by <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P2Y" mod="LESS_THAN">nearly two years</TIMEX3> of civil war. 
 
The Iran-allied Houthi group has de facto control of northern areas, including the capital Sanaa and the country's largest international airport, while the internationally recognized government is based in the south and east. 
 
An official in that administration said on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> that it was "dismayed" by the visa ban.

    Cate Le Bon makes poetic songs for absurd times  
Cate Le Bon is well aware that we live in strange times. That’s the premise for the Welsh singer/songwriter’s new EP “Rock Pool” (out <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3>), which came out of the same recording sessions as her <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3> record “Crab Day.” “It’s almost a reactionary language to the absurdity and horror of the times we’re living in,” says Le Bon, who <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> lives in Los Angeles. She wrote these songs before Donald Trump came into power and Brexit happened, but she certainly recognizes their significance <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3>.
