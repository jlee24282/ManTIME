The Pacific women's basketball team's problem at the free throw line is simple. 
 
It just isn't getting many chances. 
 
Pacific went to the line just three times — a low in program history — and made just one in a 67-64 loss to USF on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> at the Sobrato Center in San Francisco. It was the fourth loss in a row for the Tigers (8-13, 4-6 West Coast Conference) and sixth in seven contests. 
 
Pacific had set a school record for fewest free throw attempts in a game with five in a 69-58 loss to Pepperdine on <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-12">Jan. 12</TIMEX3>. While the Tigers had trouble getting to the line again, the Dons (12-9, 6-4) went 17-of-19 from the penalty stripe. 
 
The Tigers did play well early and had a 23-19 lead after the first period. Ameela Li hit a 3-pointer to pull Pacific within a point, 65-64, with 2:01 left in the game, but Nia Alexander of USF hit two free throws with <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="PT16S">16 seconds</TIMEX3> remaining. 
 
Emily Simmons led Pacific with 14 points, Chelsea Lidy had 11 points and GeAnna Luaulu-Summers had 10 points. Rachel Howard had 28 points for the Dons.

Griffins 2, Heat 1 
 
At Grand Rapids, Michigan, Austin Carroll scored for Stockton in the third period, breaking a streak of <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="PT204M">204 minutes</TIMEX3>, <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="PT12S">12 seconds</TIMEX3> without a goal. 
 
“It was important for us for sure. Good on Austin for burying it,” Heat head coach Ryan Huska said. 
 
Stockton was trailing 1-0 when Carroll tied it 3:35 into the final period. Ben Street scored the game winner with 2:51 to go. Goalie Jon Gillies had 37 saves for the Heat (19-16-4), which has lost four in a row and seven of eight.
