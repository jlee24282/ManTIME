Donald Trump has been excoriated for his interest in the Barack Obama birther movement most <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> in the E-R though it coincidentally resulted in Obama releasing his long form Hawaiian birth certificate. 
 
I have no means to prove or disprove Obama was born in Hawaii. I do believe Obama himself planted the seeds of the “birther” movement. 
 
Fact: In <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="1990">1990</TIMEX3> Obama was elected the first black president of the Harvard Law Review, a student publication featuring analysis of important legal matters. The review’s student yearbook includes a biography of Obama, stating “born in Kenya, raised in Indonesia and Hawaii.” 
 
Fact: In <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="1991">1991</TIMEX3> Obama hired a literary agency, Acton & Dystel, to help promote sales of his upcoming book, “Dreams of My Father.” The agency published a promotional booklet listing its 90 client/authors, including Obama. His biography states “born in Kenya, raised in Indonesia and Hawaii.” <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011">Twenty years later</TIMEX3> an Acton & Dystel employee claims she wrote Obama’s biography but neglected to fact check it. What are the odds that two individuals would have both mistakenly chosen Kenya as Obama’s country of birth? I find it impossible to believe that an author would not write their own biography. 
 
Obama believed it was to his advantage to promote himself as a foreign born, man of the world ... until it wasn’t. When he decided on a political career, he needed to be U.S. born to get elected. 
 
Unbelievably no U.S. journalist had the guts to ask him about facts.
