NOTES: New Orleans coach Alvin Gentry said he appreciates F Anthony Davis' toughness in playing through a thigh injury.

" Asked if it might be better to give Davis a game off, Gentry said: "I'm not a smart guy, but I think we're a little bit better with him out on the court." ... Gentry said he felt badly for Portland G Damian Lillard and C.J. McCollum who were left off the Western Conference All-Star team. "If you extended the rosters to 15, it's going to be the 16th and 17th guys that feel like they got (overlooked)," Gentry said. ... Asked if he was surprised that only F Kawhi Leonard made the All-Star team, Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said: "I don't think about it much."
