A man from Australia was caught by the cops while allegedly driving 127/h in a 110km zone on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-23">Monday</TIMEX3> in the town of Geraldton, and he had the most hilarious explanation for his actions. His response to the police who caught him was simple: “The wind was pushing me.” 
 
Who could dispute that in a town that has a reputation of being windy? Police, of course, gave him a R2 000 fine, reports The Citizen . 
 
The cops shared a picture of the ticket on Twitter with the caption: “And excuse of the day goes to…”
