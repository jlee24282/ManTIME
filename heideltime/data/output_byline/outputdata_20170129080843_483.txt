MT. VERNON – Mattoon built a big early cushion and topped the Lady Rams basketball team 61-43 <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TAF">Saturday afternoon</TIMEX3>. 
 
Mattoon ripped off an 11-2 run to start the game. The Green Wave built a 20-plus point margin going into halftime. The Lady Rams slashed the deficit to 11 with its outside shooting in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2016-H2">the second half</TIMEX3>. 
 
Mattoon entered the game unbeaten this season and ranked No. 4 in class 3A. 
 
“They're super. We knew that coming in, and they did the things to us we expected,” Mt. Vernon coach Jeff Lonnon said. 
 
Avery Jackson led Mattoon with 22 points. Jackson surpassed the 1,500 career point mark in the game. Isabella Coffey added 12, and Sierra Thompson finished with 11 points and 12 rebounds. 
 
“They're a load,” Lonnon said. “They've got the whole package. They've got an inside game when they want it, and they've got an outside game when they want it. They have a transition game when they want it. The dimensions of talent they have are rare.” 
 
Lauren Heinzman paced Mt. Vernon with 22 points and 10 rebounds. Madeline Keele finished with nine points and three rebounds. 
 
Mattoon's defense challenged the Mt. Vernon shooters throughout the game. The Lady Rams found more openings in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2016-H2">the second half</TIMEX3> but finished 12 of 55 from the field. 
 
The Green Wave players blocked several shots in the opening half and limited the Lady Rams to 11 points at the half. The stingy defense allowed Mattoon to take a 22-point cushion into <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2018-H2">the second half</TIMEX3>. 
 
“Their size gives a lot of people trouble and especially us because we're a really small 3A basketball team,” Lonnon said. 
 
Mt. Vernon found more success from long range in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2016-Q3">the third quarter</TIMEX3>. Heinzman canned three straight 3-pointers during <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2016-Q3">the quarter</TIMEX3>. Bria Meyer also connected on a long-range bucket in the third period. 
 
“Lauren took that <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-H1">first half</TIMEX3> personal. I can tell you that,” Lonnon said. “Lauren doesn't like it whenever people come on your floor or anywhere, whether it's home or away, and basically blows you out. And I think it made her mad.” 
 
The outside shooting allowed Mt. Vernon to slash into the Mattoon lead. Kendal Ryan's driving basket in the final minute of the third cut the deficit to 45-34. Mattoon countered with a 3-pointer from Ivy Nichols in the closing seconds. The bucket made the score 48-34 going into the fourth frame. 
 
“When you've got a kid who really is probably your fifth offensive option that you can throw it to and knock a three down at the end of a quarter, then you know you have something special going,” Lonnon said. 
 
Mt. Vernon dropped to 8-14 overall this season while Mattoon improved to 24-0. 
 
The Lady Rams travel to Centralia on <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="TIME" value="2017-01-24TNI">Tuesday night</TIMEX3>.
