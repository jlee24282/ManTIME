As the reality of US President Donald Trump's executive order on immigration hits, immigrants and their relatives grow anxious about what it means for their loved ones. 

The executive order lists seven Muslim-majority countries, temporarily banning travellers with passports from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. This includes green card holders, who travel to the US for work. 

The order has caused confusion for many longtime legal-US residents travelling abroad. 
  
Iranian immigrant Masih Alinejad, 40, has lived in New York since fleeing her home country with her son in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2009">2009</TIMEX3>. 

Her son <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> lives in the UK and she fears travelling to see him will result in the end of the life she has established in the US. 

"Donald Trump's decision again makes me feel like a prisoner here in the United States of America, not in Islamic republic of Iran," she said. 

"<TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> because of Donald Trump's decision… I cannot go and hug my son and my son cannot come from England to New York and visit me." 

She says many people, like herself, are feeling as if they are losing their second homes and their second chance at freedom. 

"My heart and thoughts are with millions of Middle Easterners and ordinary citizens who are being discriminated against not only in their own homelands, but in their adopted land, the United States," she said.

Ms Alinejad says authorities have not provided any support or future information. 

Kinan Azmeh, a clarinetist born in Syria who has lived in the US for <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="P16Y">16 years</TIMEX3>, left his home in New York City <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-W01">three weeks ago</TIMEX3> for a series of concerts that included a date with cellist Yo-Yo Ma — <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> he does not know if he will be able to return home.

Her sister Mahsa Seyed <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> lives in the US with her family. 

"My sister is <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> married to an American and lives there with her husband and three kids," Ms Seyed said. 

"Under these new rules, nobody from my family can visit my sister and her family even though we are Australian citizens."
