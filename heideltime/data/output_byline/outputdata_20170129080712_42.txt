Ice fishermen and groundhogs are scarce <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3>. 
 
The weather will make more  ice <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2017-W04">this week</TIMEX3>, and some groundhogs will pose on their day <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2017-01-26">Thursday</TIMEX3>. 
 
So much for good news. <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2017-SU">Summer</TIMEX3> flounder fishermen will have to wait until <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2017-02">next month</TIMEX3> to see if their season will be crippled by size reductions <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2017-SU">this summer</TIMEX3>. 
 
The Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council  will vote then  on options that could the increase minimum size to 19 inches and a shorter season. 
 
Not only fishermen would be affected, but also the tourism industry. New Jersey federal and state politicians oppose the restrictions. 
 
<TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2017-SU">Summer</TIMEX3> flounder, also known as fluke, are popular, and the Department of Environmental Protection estimates recreational fishing contributes $1.5 billion to the state's economy. 
 
Most of the winners of the <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> Garden State Deer Classic were from Central and South Jersey. Lou Cornine of Morristown won the Nontypical Archery category with a rack that  scored 167 4/8.  He got it in Deer Management Zone 51, Monmouth County. 
 
You can see all the winners of <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2017-01">this month</TIMEX3>'s <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2017-01">January</TIMEX3> Classic, and the winners of all time from <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="1963">1963</TIMEX3> at njfishandwildlife.com/ 
 
Six wildlife management areas, including Flatbrook and Clinton, were stocked with 50 pheasants for hunting.  The 300 birds were released after dark on <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3>. 
 
The Division of Fish and Wildlife reports that at the Rockport Pheasant Farm there were 61,761 birds released, the result of another excellent production year. 
 
<TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="SET" value="P1Y" quant="EACH">Each year</TIMEX3>, the farm is scheduled to release more than 50,000 birds, and <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2017">this year</TIMEX3> there were 7,005 extra pheasants: 2,280 were released for the youth hunt, 880 stocked for dog training and 596 sold to buyers. 
 
Rockport has more than 3,000 breeder pheasants <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2017-01">this month</TIMEX3> while the Fish and Game Council and the Division decide about the program's future. 
 
Despite the warm weather <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2017-01">this month</TIMEX3>, New Jersey's bears must have been napping for the first <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DURATION" value="P20D">20 days</TIMEX3> of <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="2017-01">this month</TIMEX3>. 
 
There were no bear home entries, no humans or pets attacked, no home damaged and only three  bears were killed by motor vehicles. 
 
But the state's annual on bear activities in <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3> reported 108 bears killed crossing roads, 32 bears entered homes, 36 bears damaged crops, 24 attacked livestock, 24 of them damaged beehives, damaged 52 bird feeders, caused 92 property damage, 423 got into garbage and 310 were nuisances. 
 
We have too many bears, but think about Florida with their snake problems.  Florida hired snake hunters from India to get water pythons out of the Everglades. In <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DURATION" value="P2W">two weeks</TIMEX3> they caught 13 big snakes. 
 
Meanwhile, Gucci is going into the snake business with the opening of a python farm in Thailand to keep up with the demand for snakeskins for handbags and shoes. A snake farm?
