After a tough seven-point loss to Lawrence on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3>, the Emporia High girls hoped they could find a little extra spark on <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> in the third-place game of the Glacier's Edge Tournament. 
 
Unfortunately for the Spartans, a brief lead in the first didn't hold up as they dropped a 54-37 decision to Maize. 
 
"Our energy wasn't there, I thought we came out flat," EHS coach Carolyn Lee said. "We can't allow that. All these teams are playing three games in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P3D">three days</TIMEX3>, so there shouldn't have been an excuse." 
 
The Eagles had a 34-point loss to Derby earlier in the week, but didn't show signs of it on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> as Lee said the Spartan opponent had much more energy. 
 
"Maize wanted it more," she said. "I thought they played harder than us. We had a lot of girls not playing very hard — not diving on the floor — jogging to their spots (and) hands downs. That's just atypical of what we expect — (and an) atypical team that we saw <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="TIME" value="2017-01-27TNI">last night</TIMEX3>. 
 
"We have to be better than that." 
 
At times during <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>'s contest, EHS had three freshmen on the floor at the same time. Senior Baylee Beatty is still out due to a concussion. Freshmen Rayanna Breshears, Drue Davis and Mya Tovar saw significant minutes. 
 
"Having three freshmen out there is difficult," Lee said. "They got valuable experience to see. We played two ranked opponents in the state — I had two or three freshmen on the court at the same time getting experience from that.  
 
"Other players like (Taylor) Milleson — only a sophomore — there's a lot of upside to these kids.  They've got to figure out how to play harder. We walked away with some players who got game-like experiences we needed them to have." 
 
EHS (8-4 overall, 4-1 Centennial) finished 1-2 in its home tournament will <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> focus on <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2018-H2">the second half</TIMEX3> of Centennial League play. 
 
The Spartans will have a back-to-back beginning on <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017-02-03">Friday</TIMEX3> at Topeka West, before traveling to Junction City on <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> for a make-up contest from <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2017-01-13">Jan. 13</TIMEX3>. 
 
EHS is a game back behind Manhattan and Washburn Rural, who are both undefeated in league play and sit in a tie with Seaman with one loss. 
 
"We'll get after it on <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2017-01-24">Tuesday</TIMEX3>," Lee said. "We've got to get ready. We've got back-to-back and it'll be tough. We've got to get ready for league play. We want to be competitive to finish out league strong. 
 
"One game at a time. We'll talk about Topeka West <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2017-W04">this week</TIMEX3> and then worry about Junction City on <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> when we get there." 
 
Senior Kelsey Gordon led EHS with nine points.
