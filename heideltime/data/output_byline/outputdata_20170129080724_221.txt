New Delhi [India], <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Jan. 29</TIMEX3> : Citing the example of Master Blaster Sachin Tendulkar who broke and created several records in the game of cricket, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3> urged the students to learn from the life of cricket legend in order to compete and improve. 
Addressing the nation in his first address of <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> in his <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="SET" value="XXXX-XX">monthly</TIMEX3> 'Mann Ki Baat' programme, Prime Minister Modi said it is always self-competition and not competition with others which helps a person to improve and become a better human being. 

"Take the example of Sachin Tendulkar. In his career which extended for <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P20Y" mod="MORE_THAN">more than 20 years</TIMEX3>, he kept breaking his own records day after day and got better and better with each passing day. 

The secret of his success was self-competition and not competition with others," the Prime Minister said. 

He also advised the students to study for knowledge and not only for mere marks as it would lead them to go for shortcuts. 

"Only studying for marks will lead to shortcuts and one will limit himself or herself. It is important to study for knowledge," he said. "The root of all the problems are expectations, it is acceptance that makes things easy. You should compete with yourself to see how <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-01-30">tomorrow</TIMEX3> can be made better than <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">yesterday</TIMEX3>," he added..
