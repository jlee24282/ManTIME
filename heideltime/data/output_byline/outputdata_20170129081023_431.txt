Mauricio Pochettino admitted his Spurs side were outplayed by Wycombe Wanderers <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">yesterday</TIMEX3> – and that it was a pleasure to play them. 
 
The Chairboys put in a stunning performance at White Hart Lane to not only take a 2-0 half time lead, but come back to lead 3-2 with <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="PT6M">six minutes</TIMEX3> left after conceding two <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2018-H2">second half</TIMEX3> strikes. 
 
Only a Dele Alli-led late surge from Spurs denied Wycombe even a replay with an equaliser <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="PT2M">two minutes</TIMEX3> from the end of the 90, and a cruel winner in the sixth minute of stoppage time. 
 
Pochettino said: “First of all, credit to Wycombe, they were better than us. Full credit to Wycombe as from the first minute they found a way to click and create chances.

“It was difficult for us. In <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2016-H2">the second half</TIMEX3> we increased our level, they touched our pride, but we turned the result. 
 
“They showed a big side the way to play. We never underestimate our opposition, but they played better than us. 
 
“They didn't surprise me because when you analyse your opponent you try to see their weaknesses and strengths, you need to adapt your game. 
    So close: Wycombe dared to dream when they went in front again with <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="PT6M">six minutes</TIMEX3> left  Read More  
“But they played better than us and beat us in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-H1">the first half</TIMEX3>. Sometimes you need a bit of a luck to win. I congratulated their manager because his players played very well <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3>.” 
 
Pochettino was also full of praise for the FA Cup itself, and the famous old competition's ability to throw up classic ties like the one he just witnessed. 
 
He added: “That is the magic of the FA Cup, different level teams show the same quality. It is the most special competition in the world. 
    Heartache: In the end there was disappointment but pride for the Chairboys  Read More  
“You cannot replicate in France, Spain or Italy the same passion, the same motivation on the pitch, or having teams like Wycombe believing they can beat us here, that is the important thing. 
 
“The FA Cup creates that feeling, that's the beauty of it. We had a little bit of luck <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3>, but I won't feel sorry for Wycombe as that is football. They are disappointed, but there is nothing we can do. 
 
“<TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Today</TIMEX3> was for us, another day will be for Wycombe. I wish them all the best in the league, and it was a pleasure to play a team like Wycombe.”
