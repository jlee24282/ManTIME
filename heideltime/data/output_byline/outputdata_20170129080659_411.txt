Cards and flowers are lovely, but the best gift to give mum is your time! Create some new memories with her over one of these fun Mother’s Day activities  
Mothers are meant to be pampered all year round, but the upcoming Mother’s Day gives extra reason to show just how much you appreciate her unconditional love! Ditch any plans to purchase a pricey gift, and instead splurge on an activity you can both do together. After all, no pearls or diamonds could compare to the <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DURATION" value="PTXH">many hours</TIMEX3> she’ll be spending with her daughter! 
 

 Yoga In The Dark  
All of us have tried yoga before, but switching it up a little sounds like fun, doesn’t it? Sign mum and yourself up for a session of yoga in the dark, where you’ll both be blindfolded throughout! Yes, girls – blindfolded! This is a chance to connect deeply with your body, all while becoming more attuned to your senses. Although there might not be much talking to one another during class, you can both have some tea or brunch after to chat about the unique experience!

 Bounce Fitness Class  
Kulture Studios , Singapore’s first official jumping fitness studio, vows to push you to your limits with exercises containing high energy but low impact moves. The energetic workout lets you lose major calories while bouncing around on a trampoline; something we suppose will turn out to be tons of fun! But, go easy on mummy, okay? We wouldn’t want her to break anything!

 Breakfast Ceramics Workshop  
For all the meals mama has lovingly made for you, why don’t you thank her with a ceramic workshop at Studio Asobi , where you’ll be able to take matching sets of breakfast ceramics home? Recommended for beginners, the class will have you both pinching and sculpting clay from scratch, a chance to discover the hidden artist within yourselves. The end products need to stay at the studio for <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P1M">a month</TIMEX3> before you can take them home, but once you do, you can both enjoy hearty meals together with your handmade plates!

 Modern Calligraphy Session  
If your mum is a calligraphy enthusiast ( or actually, even if she’s not! ), take her to a modern calligraphy class with The Letter J Supply , where you’ll both learn to use a traditional dip nib pen in a modern context. They aim to equip you with the fundamental skills, which will eventually lead you towards developing a style of your own. Since you’ll be paying for and taking home the necessary tools, both you and mum can practise together in the future and pen notes to one another! 
 
The Modern Calligraphy Workshop is held at Bynd Artisan Atelier , 44 Jalan Merah Saga #01-54, Singapore <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2781-1-6">278116</TIMEX3>, visit here for more information and to reserve a slot. 
 

 Watercolour Workshop  
Natalie Studio runs a series of watercolour workshops from time to time, and it’ll be an ultra fun experience for both you and your mum! We recommend their basic workshop if you aren’t familiar with the craft, but the floral-inspired watercolour classes seem exciting for those who feel like they might have the chops for it. Besides, who doesn’t love painting floras? You know what the best thing is? If you attend both the modern calligraphy workshop by The Letter J Supply and this watercolour class, combining the two skill sets helps create a beautiful masterpiece that you can display in your home!

 Make Your Own Clay Necklaces  
Remember the good ol’ days when you and your mama had some great laughs playing dress up? Those fun moments may be few and far between <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> that you’re all grown up, but a clay necklace workshop by  Average Jo can help bring back some fond memories. The course isn’t merely about making the necklace itself, but includes tips on colour theory too, for when you go crazy painting your newly made accessory. Aww, imagine how cute it’ll be wearing matching necklaces out this coming Mother’s Day!

 Floral Arrangement  
All girls love flowers, so we bet your mum does too! She’ll appreciate attending a floral arrangement class with you, one where florist Bisoufleur teaches students how to create their very own handheld bouquet. It’ll be quite an interesting experience too, since you’ll be dealing with blooms that are considerably more exotic in nature. And you know what to do with your completed bouquet? Give it to mummy for Mother’s Day!

 Tulipmania At Gardens By The Bay  
Like we said, all girls love florals. And that’s reason enough to take your mum to Tulipmania at Gardens By The Bay ‘s Flower Dome, where you’ll be able to witness the beauty a sea of tulips bring. Trust us, this is as close to flower paradise as you can get in Singers! Look into the details of these flowers and learn more about their interesting past too, as you and mum go around snapping shots of the lovely scenery! Tours are available at the dome too and last for a duration of <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="PT15M" mod="APPROX">approximately 15 minutes</TIMEX3>!
