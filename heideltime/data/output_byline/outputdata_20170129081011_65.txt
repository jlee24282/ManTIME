The Moon enters Pisces <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3> and encourages you to reflect on self-care. You tend to put others first, Libra, but <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3>, while the Moon is in sensitive Pisces, do something to promote healing in your own life.
