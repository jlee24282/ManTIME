Washington: US President Donald Trump on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> ordered the Pentagon to devise a strategy to defeat Islamic State and restructured the National Security Council to include his controversial top political adviser, as he forged a partnership with Russian President Vladimir Putin in their first official phone call.

Trump and Putin spoke for <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="PT1H">an hour</TIMEX3> and vowed to join forces to fight terrorism in Syria and elsewhere, according to the White House and the Kremlin, signaling a potential shift in US-Russian relations that have been marked by high tension.

Meanwhile, Trump signed a presidential memo directing the Pentagon to submit a plan within <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P30D">30 days</TIMEX3> to defeat IS, an effort to make good on his campaign promise to more aggressively confront Islamist terrorism than US president Barack Obama did.

Even before <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>'s order, military officials had been at work developing potential actions for Trump and Defence Secretary James Mattis to consider. Those include potentially deploying additional advisers to Iraq and Syria, allowing US military personnel to accompany local forces closer to the front lines, and delegating greater decision-making power to field commanders.

David Barno, a retired lieutenant-general who once led US forces in Afghanistan, said it would be a major escalation if Trump's administration opted to rely on US troops by putting them into a direct combat role and effectively substitute them for local forces.

"We've been down that road, and I don't think the American people are excited about that idea," said Barno, who <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> teaches at American University in Washington, DC.

As he signed his directive at his desk in the Oval Office, Trump said: "I think it's going to be very successful. That's big stuff."

Counselling Trump in the effort will be Stephen Bannon, the White House chief strategist whose influence inside the administration is expanding far beyond politics. In an executive order, Trump reorganised the National Security Council to, along with other changes, give Bannon a regular seat on the principals committee - the meetings of the most senior national security officials, including the secretaries of defence and state.

Trump's order also states that the director of national intelligence and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff will sit on the principals committee only when the issues to be discussed pertain to their "responsibilities and expertise". In the previous two administrations, both were included as regular attendees.

Trump said the changes would bring "a lot of efficiency and, I think, a lot of additional safety".

The changes affirm the ascent of Bannon, the former executive chairman of Breitbart, a conservative website that is popular with white nationalists, who has emerged as Trump's political consigliere and the keeper of the president's populist flame.

Bannon has already been playing a major role in directing Trump's foreign policy, administration officials say, and joined the president in the Oval Office on <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> for his calls with Putin and several other world leaders.

In their call, Putin and Trump discussed Ukraine and Syria, and they agreed to build stronger economic ties between the US and Russia, according to a statement issued by the Kremlin.

They said they would arrange an in-person meeting, but Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told the Interfax news agency that the two presidents did not specifically talk about a lifting of the sanctions the Obama administration imposed against Russia over Russian interference in the US presidential election and Moscow's military intervention in Ukraine.

Eliminating the sanctions is a priority for Moscow, but Trump is under pressure in the US and from European allies to maintain them and said on <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3> that he thought it was premature to consider lifting them.

The White House described the conversation as "a congratulatory call" initiated by Putin.

"The positive call was a significant start to improving the relationship between the United States and Russia that is in need of repair," read a statement from the White House. "Both President Trump and President Putin are hopeful that after <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3>'s call the two sides can move quickly to tackle terrorism and other important issues of mutual concern."

Trump spoke with the leaders of Australia, France, Germany and Japan, but his administration's suspension of the acceptance of all refugees and a suspension of entry by citizens from seven majority-Muslim nations injected some diplomatic tension into the conversations.

In their call, French President Francois Hollande told Trump that he believes defending their democracies would be effective only if their governments adhere to "the principles on which they are founded, in particular the reception of refugees", according to the Elysee Palace.

Trump repeatedly blasted German Chancellor Angela Merkel on the campaign trail over the German policy of admitting large numbers of Syrian refugees. Trump and Merkel covered a range of issues, including the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, according to the White House.

After Trump's criticism of NATO during his campaign, the President and Merkel agreed on the alliance's "fundamental importance to the broader transatlantic relationship and its role in ensuring the peace and stability of our North Atlantic community", read a White House statement.

Trump accepted Merkel's invitation to visit Hamburg in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2017-07">July</TIMEX3> for the G20 summit, and Trump invited the chancellor to visit Washington soon, the White House said.

Also on <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>, Trump signed an executive order finalising new lobbying rules that had been informally established during the transition period. It stipulates that administration officials cannot register as lobbyists for <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="P5Y">five years</TIMEX3> after leaving the government - and can never lobby on behalf of a foreign government.

"Most of the people standing behind me won't be able to go to work or do anything adverse to our wonderful country," Trump said, as the aides standing behind him in the Oval Office laughed.
