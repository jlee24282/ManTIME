Even for the high-octane, explosive offense that they call the San Jacinto College men's basketball team, the Ravens may have amazed themselves a little bit <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TNI">Saturday night</TIMEX3>.

With six players landing in double figures, nationally-ranked San Jac erupted for a <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P13Y">13-year</TIMEX3> conference scoring high when the Ravens crushed Coastal Bend College 124-96 in a Region 14 Conference game at Anders Gym.

In wrapping up <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2017-01">January</TIMEX3> play with a 9-0 record, it's San Jacinto College's first perfect <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017-01">January</TIMEX3> since the <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="1999">1999</TIMEX3>-<TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2000">2000</TIMEX3> team fashioned an 8-0 ledger.

Reaching 100 points with still <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="PT7M" mod="MORE_THAN">over seven minutes</TIMEX3> to go in the game, it was San Jac's most points against a conference opponent since <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2003-12-03">Dec. 3, 2003</TIMEX3> when the Ravens that year defeated Panola College 125-98. <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DURATION" value="P1Y" mod="LESS_THAN">Almost one year</TIMEX3> to the day in <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2002">2002</TIMEX3>, the Ravens scored 125 points against Angelina but that production came in an overtime contest.

San Jac, <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> 4-0 in South Zone play and 11-0 overall in conference, had to keep piling on the points because Coastal Bend was sharp from the perimeter. It was only a 56-47 Ravens lead at the break, before San Jac surpassed that with a 68-point <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2016-H2">second-half</TIMEX3> eruption.

"It looked like we didn't know anything coming into the game. I know they made eight (3s) in <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2017-H1">the first half</TIMEX3> and I bet they ended up with 20 for the game. (Willie) Rooks is a good player. He's leading the conference in scoring. We might have held him below his conference average (26 points), but he was close to that. But we've got some firepower too," Ravens head coach Scott R. Gernander said.

Yeah, that's for sure. Let's start with Jorden Duffy's own 26 points, followed by Kabir Mohammad's 20, James Kirksey's 18, Tay Hardy's 17, Konstantin Kulikov's 13 and Elton Dyer's 12.

Add it all up and it was a fun night to be at Anders, watching the No. 4 team in the nation light up the scoreboard.

There was a moment late in the game that defined that fun. Over three consecutive possessions, Hardy hit 3-point goals, energizing the nice crowd with each long-distance goal. His first one showed off his hustle when he corraled a ball, but appeared stuck in the left corner. Not so. He made this slight turn with his body, launched his legs off the floor and watched the ball find nothing but net. In fact, all three were swishes.

But adding to the crowd's fun was the fact that Coastal Bend's Taywyn Mason, Jr. was matching Hardy bonus goal for bonus goal until Mason misfired on his third consecutive attempt.

After a road trip to Lamar State College-Port Arthur on <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2017-02-01">Wednesday</TIMEX3>, the Ravens will be home again <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2017-02-04">next Saturday</TIMEX3>, opposing the Roadrunners from Angelina College. Tipoff is <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="TIME" value="2017-02-04T16:00">4 p.m.</TIMEX3>
