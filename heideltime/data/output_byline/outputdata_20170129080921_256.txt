There's a slew of Netflix originals coming in <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2017-02">February</TIMEX3> but this is the most interesting of the bunch. 
 
"Santa Clarita Diet" is a comedy-horror Netflix series starring Drew Barrymore and Timothy Olyphant. They play a married couple of real estate agents whose lives take an interesting turn when the wife dies and turns into a flesh eating zombie. 
 
Based on the trailers, this will be a disturbing but fun genre mashup of a series. "Santa Clarita Diet" comes to life on <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2017-02-03">February 3</TIMEX3>. 
 
Other additions worth mentioning are Tim Burton's "Corpse Bride" and "The Nightmare Before <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2017-12-25">Christmas</TIMEX3>," the popular Channing Tatum hit "Magic Mike," Seth Rogen's R-Rated animated comedy "Sausage Party" and the "Babe" movies. <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2017-02-07">February 7</TIMEX3> also marks the debut of Netflix's <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2017-02-14">Valentine's Day</TIMEX3> special, "Michael Bolton’s Big, Sexy Valentine’s Day Special." 
 
And as usual, as new content comes, we'll have to say goodbye to other favorites as well. Thankfully, the departure list is not as extensive. Among the notable movies saying goodbye are "There Will Be Blood," "The Kite Runner," "The Machinist," "Mission Impossible 3," and "Trainspotting." If you haven't seen these before, make sure you catch them before they leave Netflix <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2017-02">next month</TIMEX3>.
