By CORRESPONDENT , MOMBASA, Kenya, <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Jan 29</TIMEX3> – A son of slain drug baron Ibrahim Akasha was arrested on <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> alongside two foreigners on suspicion of trafficking in narcotics. 
 
Ibrahim Akasha was arrested alongside Gulam Hussein, Vijaygiri Goswami in Nyali over alleged links with importers of a container seized at the port of Mombasa suspected to contain narcotics. 
 
Ibrahim’s brother Baktash is said to have evaded arrest and is being sought by police. 
 
According to their lawyer, Cliff Ombeta, the suspects were booked for interrogation at various police stations in Mombasa in what he said appeared to be an investigation lead by officers deployed from Nairobi. 
 
Munga Nyale, Anti-Terror Police Unit (ATPU) boss and former head of the Flying Squad is said to be among the officers who led the operation that resulted into capturing of the suspects. 
 
The Akasha’s are not new to controversy with their <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> appearance in court on drug-related accusations being in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2016-12">December 2016</TIMEX3>, when High Court Judge Justice Dorah Chepkwony changed their bond terms from Sh30 million to 5 million. 
 
The suspects are also on the United States radar for drug-related offences.
