KIELER, Wis. — Snow blew across the partially covered southwestern Wisconsin cornfields before temperatures would be too cold for even the most zealous snowmobilers to start their engines — wind chills dipping to 30 below. 
 
“We’ve gone out in minus- 20 or -25 up north, but not around here,” said Jamie Vaassen, president of Kieler Snowmobile Club. 
 
Vaassen and his brother-in-law Jeremy Brant met this reporter on that snowy <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2016-12">December</TIMEX3> day for the first ride of the season at what they call The Sled Shed, near Kieler. Our multiple layers of clothing would keep us cozy, but within days of that ride, warm temperatures would stop the pastime in its tracks. 
 
<TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="XXXX-XX-XX">One week later</TIMEX3>, Vaassen led a group up to Houghton, Mich., where 18 inches of snow fell. 
 
We took two of the 20 or so snowmobiles stored in the shed, 10 of which are for children as young as 5 years old and top out at 15 mph. Our sleds were equipped with heated handlebars. The helmet could be plugged into the rig to prevent the face shield from fogging up. 
 
“Snowmobiles have really come a long way, even in just <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="P10Y">the past 10 years or so</TIMEX3>,” said Vaassen, 42. “We used to have to stop three or <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="SET" value="P1D" freq="4">four times a day</TIMEX3> for gas while going 70 to 80 miles. <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> we can go 100, 120 miles before gassing up.” 
 
The sport is more dependent on the weather than are the farmers who allow the riders on their land. Most snowmobile owners are resigned to spending much of their time on deeper snow during trips north. And the sport’s reputation for staging “poker runs,” where riders drive from bar to bar and get drunk, causes enthusiasts to bristle. 
 
“That’s been a thing over the years,” said Roger Biefer, of Montfort, a snowmobiler for 47 of his <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION" value="P57Y">57 years</TIMEX3> and co-founder of the I-G Sno Cats Snowmobile Club. “People think we go out, get drunk and throw beer cans and bottles all over the ground. That’s not it. We have to respect the landowners’ property.” 
 
There are about two dozen snowmobile clubs in the tri-state area. Wisconsin has half of them. Members of every club said their sport wouldn’t exist without cooperative landowners. 
 
“They certainly don’t have to let us do this,” said Tiffany Saunders, of the Warren (Ill.) <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2017-WI">Winter</TIMEX3> Warriors. “We have the trails marked for a reason. There may sometimes be tree stumps you can’t see under the snow, or new trees growing, or a creek or fence line you don’t see. 
 
“Going off the trails could put you at risk of getting hurt and/or the landowner taking away the privilege so many of us enjoy.” 
 
The appreciation goes beyond just saying thanks. 
 
“We couldn’t have such an extensive trail without our landowners’ lease agreements,” said Wanda Pape, club secretary for the Dyersville (Iowa) DriftSkippers. “Riding through their land allows us to connect our trails. <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="SET" value="P1Y" quant="EVERY">Every year</TIMEX3> we have — as most clubs do — an appreciation supper for our landowners that offers them drinks and a meal and door prizes.” 
 
They also <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="SET" value="XXXX">annually</TIMEX3> donate to organizations such as the Dyersville Fire Department and Dubuque County Firefighters Association. 
 
<TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2011" mod="APPROX">About six years ago</TIMEX3>, members of the Jackson County (Iowa) Snowmobilers approached landowner Tim Sprank for permission to go across his land near Springbrook. 
 
“They wanted more recreation for the county,” Sprank said. “At first, I thought about whether there was anything they could wreck, and I wanted to make sure it was legal and that liability was covered.” 
 
Papers were signed, and a half-mile extension for the trail that includes access to Cascade, Iowa, trails, as well as those in Clinton County, was groomed across Sprank’s 90 acres. 
 
“Some landowners just don’t want people on their place, the snoopiness of it “ Sprank said. “It’s the fear of the unknown. I’m just amazed they can pull it off and connect all of the trails.” 
 
“Every mile is a big thanks to the landowners,” said club President Aaron Michels. “Without them, we would have none.” 
 FIRST RIDE  
That first ride of the season for our group from the Kieler club would be about 10 miles to Cuba City. <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DURATION" value="PT5M">Five minutes</TIMEX3> into it near Louisburg, we met up with Nick Leibfried, whose business, Nick’s Powersports in Dickeyville, is a big booster for area clubs. 
 
“How’s the trail?” Brant asked as he took off his helmet. 
 
“Not too bad,” Leibfried said through his upraised face shield. “Could be better.” 
 
“We had some spots that weren’t so good, but others were fine,” Brant said. 
 
“It’s just nice to finally get out again,” Vaassen chipped in, later saying they hadn’t been out on that trail the past two winters because of lack of snow. 
 
After crossing Jimtown Road, one of eight roads we would carefully glide over during the trip, there was a trail sign that posted mileages to towns — Cuba City, 10; Hazel Green, 12; Kieler, 3. All along the route, signs put up by volunteers guided riders and warned them when to be cautious. 
 
Almost immediately, the ride became bumpy. Several spots on the trail were exposed to the frozen remains of cornstalks. It felt like being on an ancient wooden roller-coaster, only on smaller inclines. 
 
“The ride would be 10 times more fun if there was more snow and the trail had been groomed,” Vaassen said. 
 
It would be that night. 
 
All area clubs rely on members to keep the trails groomed and marked. 
 
“Nobody gets paid to go out and put signs up,” said Josh Ruley, president of the Dyersville (Iowa) Driftskippers. “It’s all volunteer.” 
 
That means a lot of work for The Snow Pioneers out of the Manchester, Iowa, area — they maintain about 260 miles of trail. 
 
“That includes putting in signs in the fall, removing the signs in <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2017-SP">spring</TIMEX3> and grooming trails in <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2017-WI">the winter</TIMEX3> when conditions allow,” said club member Steve Vorwald. 
 
Their system has some trails in Backbone State Park and in Delaware County. 
 DRIVING RESPONSIBLY  
Area enthusiasts acknowledge there are people who drink and then drive. But they insist it is not as common as people think. 
 
“We don’t have anybody who drives stupid,” said Cody Johnson, 26, president and organizer of the Galena (Ill.) Mississippi Ridge Runners. “It’s the same as if you meet up with some of your buddies and go out to have a few. It’s actually safer than drinking and driving (a car) because there’s not as many people out on the trails.” 
 
Biefer, who has served as vice president of the Grant County Snowmobile Association and was a Grant County representative to the Association of Wisconsin Snowmobile Clubs, said most riders have too much respect for the landowners to drive erratically. 
 
“Some might drink, and some might not drink,” he said. “(The bars) are a warming place along the trails.” 
 
Vaassen agreed that there is more drunk driving on the roads than on the trails. 
 
“We don’t want our members to take advantage of it and give the sport a bad name,” he said. 
 
His club <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="SET" value="XXXX">annually</TIMEX3> joins the Dickeyville Idle Riders club on an area fun run fundraiser that includes a bus, where snowmobilers can pay $10 for a ride home. 
 
Nate Johnson, of Dubuque, is a conservation officer with the Iowa Department of Natural Resources. He has given out more citations to people who have been barred from driving motor vehicles of all kinds, as well as for outdated registrations, than he does for drunken driving. 
 
“We’re probably not detecting a fair amount of them,” Johnson said. “It’s extremely hard to detect someone who has been drinking while on a snowmobile.” 
 
Instead, he occasionally approaches riders outside of a bar to remind them about the laws, which are identical to those for driving a car or a boat. 
 
“But for <TIMEX3 tid="t34" type="DURATION" value="PXY">the past few years</TIMEX3>, <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="SET" value="P1Y" freq="1">once a year</TIMEX3> we find a sled that’s been wrecked or abandoned off a trail,” he said. “One owner set his on fire, apparently to try to hide any evidence of drinking.” 
 
Craig Timmerman, 42, president of the Idle Riders, said the vast majority of their riders simply enjoy riding from town to town. 
 
“As a club, we are more about promoting the sport, camaraderie, scenery and the machines they drive,” he said. “And we promote the sport and educate the youth about the responsibilities that come with it.” 
 
Many other clubs use fun runs as fundraisers. The Platteville (Wis.) Driftbusters might have the most unique fundraiser in the area. The annual <TIMEX3 tid="t38" type="DURATION" value="P1D">one-day</TIMEX3> event on <TIMEX3 tid="t36" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">the last Saturday</TIMEX3> of <TIMEX3 tid="t35" type="DATE" value="2017-01">January</TIMEX3> includes a radar run, open water race and cancer bikini run. 
 
“We were looking for a way to raise money and presented this idea to the club,” said organizer Curt Timlin, 50. “They said, ‘You guys are nuts!’” 
 
Timlin learned about the idea from a bartender during a 220-mile trip north to St. Germain, Wis., home to the Snowmobile Hall of Fame and Museum. He hosts the event outside his bar, The Barn. 
 
The radar run measures the speed of snowmobiles over an eighth-mile track — the fastest has been 126 mph. The open water race has riders speed their sleds across 130 feet of water that is 4 to 5 feet deep. 
 
“We’ve had to pull out a few,” Timlin said. 
 
And then there is the bikini run, which has raised $15,000 for the Grant County Cancer Coalition in <TIMEX3 tid="t39" type="DURATION" value="P7Y">seven years</TIMEX3>. Area women wearing bikinis race their sleds against each other across an eighth-mile track. 
 
“The girls get pledges from area businesses and see who can raise the most and drive the fastest,” Timlin said. 
 
The event goes off regardless of the weather. 
 
“Four of <TIMEX3 tid="t41" type="DURATION" value="P7Y">the last seven years</TIMEX3> we had no snow,” he said. 
 
In that case, club members have rallied around to haul snow in dump trucks from area parking lots, then using a new manure spreader to lay it out. 
 SCENIC TRIP  
Our snowmobile group flew as fast as 55 mph on some of the smoother stretches during the ride to Cuba City. Several streams looked like they were part of a painting, banked by the fresh white snow. Other views provided interesting perspectives. 
 
“I like seeing the farms from the other side than you usually see them,” Brant said. 
 
We stopped near a stream about halfway to Cuba City to meet a few more riders: Ryan Ingersoll and his two sons, Zach, 16, and Austin, 14. Ryan’s sled had sustained some damage under the skis while crossing a new bridge. 
 
They teamed up to adjust the entrances to the bridge with some pieces of wood, and we moved on. After <TIMEX3 tid="t43" type="DURATION" value="PT40M" mod="APPROX">about 40 minutes</TIMEX3>, the Cuba City water tower came into view. We slowly drove a few blocks along the streets and reached Hindu’s Corner Bar for lunch. 
 
Sitting at the bar were longtime snowmobilers Carl and Dick Timmerman. They had already put 33 miles on their sleds during a trip from Kieler to Dickeyville to Cuba City and home to Hazel Green. Though not related, both Timmermans started snowmobiling in <TIMEX3 tid="t44" type="DATE" value="1973">1973</TIMEX3>. 
 
“There was very little suspension on those sleds and lots of breakdowns,” said Carl, 72. “There weren’t any hand-warmers, either. <TIMEX3 tid="t45" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3>, mine’s even got power steering.” 
 
They will go out anytime there is enough snow, whether it is in the area or up north, often with their wives. 
 
“I like the fresh air and scenery,” said Dick, 73. “I’m not much of a house-sitter.” 
 
Carl once went on a 220-mile trip on trails near Copper Harbor in extreme northern Michigan. 
 
“That was a long day,” he said, with a laugh. “We were a lot younger then.” 
 
Steering snowmobiles is old hat for the young Ingersoll boys. 
 
“We live on a farm, so we’re used to driving anything,” Zach said. “Up north on the lakes, you can easily go 100 miles per hour.” 
 
After finishing off mostly hamburger baskets — Zach and Austin had cheese curds — we suited back up for the return trip. It went quicker because the trail had been driven on, and the constant falling snow might have helped as well. 
 
“I think it kind of filled in a bit,” Brant said when we got back to the Sled Shed, where five kids and a couple of dads waited to get back out on their sleds. 
 
When asked how I liked the ride, I said I didn’t feel as sore as I thought I would. 
 
“You will <TIMEX3 tid="t46" type="DATE" value="2017-01-30">tomorrow</TIMEX3>,” Brant said. “We all do.” 
 
I did, too — that night.
