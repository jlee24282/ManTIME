It apears, Britain would prefer a visit by Indian PM Narendra Modi <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2018">next year</TIMEX3>. A key official at the Foreign Office in Whitehall put it politely, saying, “Mr Modi would be welcome if he came <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017">this year</TIMEX3>, but our choice, if it comes to it, would be <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2018">next year</TIMEX3>.” 
South Block has been enquiring about options. A senior Indian diplomat ran the idea of a sojourn <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-SU">this summer</TIMEX3> past the British Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson, during his <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> visit to New Delhi. A trip <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017">this year</TIMEX3> would be scheduled immediately before or after the G20 summit in Hamburg on <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2017-07-07">July 7</TIMEX3>-<TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017-07-08">8</TIMEX3>. In <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2018">2018</TIMEX3> it would be a bilateral component leading up to or in the aftermath of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in the UK.

Britain’s preference for <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2018">next year</TIMEX3> is understandable. Prime Minister Theresa <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2016-05">May</TIMEX3> was in Delhi <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2016-10" mod="LESS_THAN">less than three months ago</TIMEX3>. It would be too early to review the progress of decisions taken. If any pressing new issues arise in the interim, she and Modi can discuss these on the sidelines of the multilateral meeting in Germany. 

Besides, CHOGM would involve British Head of State Queen Elizabeth II, which is very important to Britain. The Commonwealth is dear to her heart. Indeed, it could well be the last time she presides over the 52-nation organisation’s biennial conference. At 90, she is unlikely to travel too far for such events in future. 

Former PM Manmohan Singh and Modi both have skipped <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> CHOGMs. An emerging India - in the eyes of Britain – is quite central to the future of the Commonwealth. 

The Commonwealth is badly in need of a shot in the arm. After Brexit, Britain is desperately seeking enhanced trade with its former colonies to compensate for a possible downturn in exports to and imports from Europe, if compelled to quit the European Common Market. 

But the Commonwealth is in crisis. The British Department of International Development (DfID) has threatened to withdraw its funding unless it improved its performance.  

“The Commonwealth Secretariat continues to under-perform," a report asserted. The secretariat claimed the review  

pertained to the period before Baroness Patricia Scotland became secretary-general <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2016-04">last April</TIMEX3>. 

India is a major contributor to the Commonwealth. A senior diplomat at the Indian High Commission in London is said to have told Scotland she needs to stop bad-mouthing her Indian predecessor, Kamlesh Sharma, if she wants India’s co-operation. The morale at the Commonwealth Secretariat is reportedly low. The BBC quoted senior diplomatic and political sources as alleging “poor leadership” on the part of Scotland.  

It further reported: “She has been accused of financial extravagance over the refurbishment of her official residence." Scotland has denied the charges. However, with a meeting  

of Commonwealth trade ministers on the anvil in <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2017-03">March</TIMEX3>, the British Government is jittery. 

A former British Ambassador to Japan reporting directly to <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2017-05">May</TIMEX3> has been put in charge of a team preparing for <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2018">next year</TIMEX3>'s CHOGM while a retired Foreign Office diplomat has been made acting chief operating officer at the secretariat. The interventions are pre-emptive moves by London to arrest the inefficiency.  

Most unusual, the British Queen has expressed her inability to attend the annual Commonwealth Day reception in <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2016-03">March</TIMEX3>. She will be represented at the reception by the Prince of Wales. 

The Indian Prime Minister has been advised visits to Britain <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2017">this year</TIMEX3> and next would be an overkill.  

So, does he come <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2017-SU">this summer</TIMEX3> to keep his exuberant overseas Gujarati constituency contented? Or does he visit <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2018">next year</TIMEX3> to attend CHOGM? 

There has over the years developed a natural closeness between the UK and India. Of course, immigration is an irritant and trade turnover could be better. Besides, the agreed partnership on counter-terrorism would be more meaningful if forces hostile to India are deterred from functioning freely in Britain.
