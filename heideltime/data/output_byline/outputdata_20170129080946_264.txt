According to court papers filed in Downtown Brooklyn, Hameed Khalid Darweesh had worked on behalf of the U.S. government in Iraq for <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P10Y">10 years</TIMEX3>.

The other detainee, Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, was coming to the United States to join his wife, who had worked for a U.S. contractor, and young son.

The men arrived on separate flights.

Rep. Jerrold Nadler of New York tweeted that he and Rep. Nydia Velazquez had secured the release of Darweesh.

At an airport news conference, Darweesh was asked about his feelings toward Trump.

"I like him but this is a policy, I don't know,"he said. "He's the president, I'm a person. I have a special immigration visa in my passport because I work with the U.S. government, I support the U.S. government on the other side of the world. But when I came here, they say no and they treat me as I break the rules or do something wrong. That surprise me."

The men were detained after arriving overnight. Their immigration attorneys filed a writ of habeas corpus <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TMO">Saturday morning</TIMEX3> in the Eastern District of New York seeking to have their clients released.

At the same time, those attorneys filed a motion for class certification, to represent all refugees and immigrants.

Nadler and Velazquez added that 12 travelers have been detained at Kennedy Airport while customs agents clarify how they should be responding to the Trump executive order.

Several hundred protesters gathered at the airport to demand their release.

Meanwhile, Iran's foreign ministry is suggesting the country will limit issuing visas to American tourists in retaliation for Trump's suspension of immigration and visas for nationals from Muslim countries including Iran.

The official IRNA news agency carried a statement by the Iranian foreign ministry that says Iran will resort to "counteraction" to Trump's executive order.

The statement says: "Iran, to defend the dignity of the great Iranian nation, will implement the principle of reciprocity until the removal of the insulting restriction against Iranian nationals."

The statement adds: "It will apply corresponding legal, consular and political actions."

The two countries have had no diplomatic relations since <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="1979">1979</TIMEX3> when militants stormed the U.S. embassy.

Refugees in the air or on the way to the United States when the order was signed are being stopped and detained at airports, according to immigration advocates.

Seven U.S.-bound migrants - six from Iraq and one from Yemen - were prevented from boarding an EgyptAir flight to Kennedy airport.

Officials said the action <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> by the airport was the first since President Trump imposed a <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DURATION" value="P3M">three-month</TIMEX3> ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen.

The officials said the seven migrants, escorted by officials from the U.N. refugee agency, were stopped from boarding the plane after authorities at…
