New Delhi, <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">January 29</TIMEX3>:  Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the first Mann Ki Baat episode of <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3>. The radio show was primarily focused on the fast approaching Class Tenth and Class Twelfth board exams and motivating students for the same. 
 
The address was special because of the fact that it is the first one of the year. The Prime Minister particularly sought approval from the Election Commission of India to host the address, keeping in mind the crucial Assembly elections in five states, just a handful of days away. 
 
The Election Commission had indeed, given clearance to the Prime minister to host this episode of ‘Mann Ki Baat’ it was on the condition that the subject of the elections would not be broached. Highlighting the point, the commission had informed the Information & Broadcasting Ministry, that there would be nothing in the address  “that might act as inducement to voters.” 
 Key Highlights of this month’s Mann Ki Baat:  The Prime Minister proposes a <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="PT2M">two-minute</TIMEX3> silence for martyred soldiers at <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29T11:00">11:00 AM</TIMEX3> on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-01-30">January 30th</TIMEX3>. He also congratulated all soldiers that have won awards this Republic Day.  Narendra Modi asked students to research the Jawans who have won awards this Republic day and write two lines about them on social media. He further asked the youth to tag their friends to extend awareness.  The Prime Minister addressed the fears of students, teachers and parents in view of the coming exams. The Prime Minister said that the country needs to get out of the anxiousness that exams seem to generate.  Saying that many students have sent across messages from all parts of the country, the Prime Minister said that exams should be a pleasure and not a pressure. It should be a festival of showing off the achievements that students have accomplished throughout the year.  “I request parents to celebrate this period as a festival. Put in a team effort as a family, to generate a positive atmosphere,” said the Prime Minister. He added the slogan, “Smile more, Score more.”  The Prime Minister said that exams do not test your life. They are just a test of what has been learnt through the year. He said low scores are not an indication of failure in life. Modi added that exams are not a matter of life or death.  Giving the example of APJ Abdul Kalam, the Prime Minister asked students whether if the former President had given up after failing to get into the NDA, he would have made such a successful scientist.  “If your focus is only on marks, you will not be able to gain knowledge,” said the Prime Minister. He further asked students to introspect and go after their ambitions. If that is done, marks will follow he said.  Giving the example of Sachin Tendulkar, the Prime Minister said introspection is the best way to go forward in life. Competing with oneself is the best way to push oneself forward, not competition. Highlighting the ills of comparing oneself with others, the Prime Minister said that it limits one’s capabilities of reaching greater heights.  The Prime Minister said that parents and mentors play a crucial role in the success of students. He said that women in the family are particularly concerned with the performance of their children. However, he asked them to accept realities as they are. He said, “We often debate the weight of school children’s bags. I, however, feel that the weight of mentors’ expectations are more heavy for children than their bags.”  Broaching the subject of cheating in exams, the Prime Minister said, “To cheat is to be cheap. So please do not cheat.” He added that once you get used to cheating, you will never be able to reach anywhere in life. There are some people who spend their entire creativity in devising ways to cheat. If the same creativity is spent on ways to study you will have a wonderful exam, he added.  “There is a life outside books,” said the Prime Minister. “If anyone says this is not the time to explore life, they are wrong. The life of a student is the best period to mould one’s life,” he expounded.  Proper rest, exercise and sleep are crucial for giving a crucial exam, said Modi. Mental relaxation is crucial for a good performance. He also asked students to look at the stars, the trees, take a deep breath, you will study with new vigour,”  Narendra Modi emphasised on the role that proper sleep plays in fulfilling one’s tasks. Throwing in humour, he said, “but don’t keep sleeping all the time saying that the Prime Minister asked ou to do so. Otherwise, when your results come, your parents will only see me in their mind.”  <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017-02-01">1 February 2017</TIMEX3>, the Indian Coast Guard will complete <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="P40Y">40 years</TIMEX3>. the Prime Minister congratulated the jawans and sailors for the achievement. <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2017-02-01">1st February</TIMEX3> is also the day of Vasant Panchami, it is a great festival. “I also extend greetings for this great festival,” Narendra Modi said.
