Eastern coach Mike Springer said in <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2016-Q4">the fourth quarter</TIMEX3> the Comets "changed from man-to-man to zone, that helped us as well. Graber scored 10 of his 20 in <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2016-Q4">the fourth quarter</TIMEX3>, and we attacked the basket and controlled the tempo really well. 
 
"[Graber] had two 3s and had two big free throws down the stretch to solidify the game. It was just a good team effort that <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2016-Q4">last quarter</TIMEX3>. Both teams had played three games in <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION" value="P5D">five days</TIMEX3> and I was really proud of the kids, the way they stayed mentally strong that <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2016-Q4">last quarter</TIMEX3>." 
 
Clinton Central (6-10) got 23 points from Keenan Orr but Eastern found ways to limit CC's offensive effectiveness. 
 
"Orr had 14 of his 23 in <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2017-H1">the first half</TIMEX3>, he was really carrying them early and I really felt like it was a good team effort [by Eastern]," Springer said. "Robinson ended up with five assists. Smalley had six boards, Graber and Henry did a good job scoring, [Luke] Monize had six rebounds as well. [Scott] Mullenix] came off the bench and got us a very big basket early in the game, and [Sam] Querry did a really good job on [CC's Axle] Brandenburg, who was averaging 19 a game, held him to 11."
