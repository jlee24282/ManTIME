<TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">Recently</TIMEX3>, surprising physical effects were observed using special microscopic waveguides for light. Such "photonic structures" <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> are revolutionizing the fields of optics and photonics, and have opened up the new research area of "Chiral Quantum Optics". Physicists from Copenhagen, Innsbruck, and Vienna, who are leading figures in this field, have <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> written an overview on the topic which just appeared in the scientific journal Nature. What one learns at school is that light oscillate...
