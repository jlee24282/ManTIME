The suspended speaker 
 
We reported <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29" mod="START">earlier today</TIMEX3> that the Speaker of Ondo State House of Assembly, Princess Jumoke Akindele and her Deputy, Alhaji Fatai Oloutu, were late <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TNI">last night</TIMEX3> impeached by 20 out of the 26 members of the state assembly. 
 
SaharaReporters has exclusively published some shocking photos and alleged that the Ghana-must-go which was filled with cash and being ferried before it was caught and exposed, was the reason the lawmaker and her deputy was suspended. 
 
“PHOTONEWS: Stash of cash being ferried by ONDO state Speaker Jumoke Akindele that led to her suspension <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">yesterday</TIMEX3>,” SaharaReporters captioned the photos released on Twitter.
