Appearances, they say, can be deceiving.

But this doesn't look good.

State lawmakers have passed and sent on to Gov. Charlie Baker a bill that will raise the annual pay of House Speaker Robert DeLeo and Senate President Stan Rosenberg, both Democrats, roughly 40 percent to $142,000. Raises would also be approved for other Democratic and Republican leaders, and for the chairs of legislative committees.

Under the proposal, the governor's salary would increase from $151,800 to $185,000, along with a new, $65,000 housing allowance, even though Baker has said he and the lieutenant governor are quite happy with their <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> salaries, thank you.

The housing allowance? Massachusetts is among a handful of states that doesn't have an official governor's mansion or a housing stipend, so that would be a nice perk. Except that Baker seems fine with his commute from Sampscott. (Also, Mike Dukakis famously rode the T from Brookline to Beacon Hill <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EVERY">every day</TIMEX3>.) So maybe we could skip that one.

However, there would also be salary increases for other constitutional officials in this little post-<TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-12-25">Christmas</TIMEX3> gift package.

The attorney's general's annual salary would go from $130,582 to $175,000 and the state's treasurer would get a boost from $127,917 to $175,000.

By the way, your local rep won't be getting any extra pay out of this. Under a <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="1998">1998</TIMEX3> amendment to the state constitution, base pay for rank-and-file legislators is adjusted <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="SET" value="P2Y" quant="EVERY">every two years</TIMEX3> based on the median household income in the state during the previous <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="P2Y">two-year period</TIMEX3>. The <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> base pay is $62,547.

First of all, let's stipulate that the salaries for several of these officials have remained stuck at the <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> levels for years, or decades in some cases. The compensation for the president of the Senate and the House speaker haven't changed in <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="P33Y">33 years</TIMEX3>.

But, citizens of Massachusetts - who have also seen pay levels stagnate in the years since the Great Recession - may be excused for asking why the haste to bring this measure up in the opening days of the legislative session?

After all, a report proposing salary changes was drafted in <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2014">2014</TIMEX3> by a special advisory panel. It's been kicking around Beacon Hill since then until it suddenly resurfaced in the opening days of the <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> session, when the Massachusetts public was consumed with news from the new Trump administration and the victories of the New England Patriots. A hearing <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2017-W03">last week</TIMEX3>, called on during a vote in nearly vacant legislative chambers, brought the issue up again.

With more warnings of state budget constraints, fiscal belt-tightening and the possibility of tax hikes in the <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="FUTURE_REF">coming year</TIMEX3>, lawmakers owe their constituents a better explanation of the compensation increases and more time to comment on them - if only for appearances.

Meanwhile, we commend the local legislative delegation for opposing these unnecessary raises. And we call on Gov. Baker to reject the measure, even though it was approved by veto-proof margins.

It would at least show the appearance that someone is willing to stand up to Beacon Hill greed.
