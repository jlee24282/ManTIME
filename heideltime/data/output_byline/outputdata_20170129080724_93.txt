Regarding "Trump owes us tax records," editorial, <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-25">Jan. 25</TIMEX3>: President Donald Trump obviously does as he pleases. If it had been to his benefit to release his tax returns before the election, he would have done so. We can assume that it was not. 
 
<TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> that he is president, itâ€™s not likely that he will change his mind. We may have to forget about seeing his tax returns. That bird has flown.
