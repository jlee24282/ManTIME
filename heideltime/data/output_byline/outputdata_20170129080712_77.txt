By Simon  cambers  MELBOURNE, (Reuters) - Serena Williams plans to play fewer tournaments in the future to aid her quest to win more grand slam titles, according to her coach Patrick Mouratoglou.  The 35-year-old American won her 23rd grand slam title on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> at the Australian Open, breaking the open-era record she held jointly with Germanyâ€™s Steffi Graf.  Serena will <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> manage her schedule as she chases down the all-time leader Margaret Court, the Australian whose record of 24 grand slam titles straddled the amateur and professional eras.
