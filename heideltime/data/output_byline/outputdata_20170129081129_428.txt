A <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> study was undertaken to assist in regulating the islands national tourism strategy for <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3>-<TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2030">2030</TIMEX3> has revealed serious weaknesses in the ‘Cyprus brand’ as well as the recognition of Cyprus as a tourist destination. 
 
The study undertaken by the Spanish THR-Innovative Advisors has recommended that the identity of a new ‘brand’ should be agreed on by all the parties involved – both state and private. They should then later work to build on the basic elements of the brand’s identity as outlined in the study. 
 
Additionally, a new modern marketing strategy must be devised giving emphasis to the mass media as opposed to internet marketing. 
 
At the same time, support should be given to small businesses to develop marketing strategies while Cyprus Tourism Organisation (CTO) offices abroad should be totally restructured. 
 
THR also recommended the creation of the ‘Experience Cyprus’ programme in order to promote unforgettable experiences and not services offered in Cyprus. 
 
This calls for the creation of a specialised service that will create, manage and promote, with the help of the private sector, the 5-10 top experiences which could attract visitors to Cyprus. ‘Brand experiences’ concerned with the myths and culture of Cyprus and ‘signature experiences’ to be promoted by the private sector based on the policies set by the state. 
 
The study also called for the creation of a programme to combat ‘visual pollution’ giving incentives or introducing other measures to improve the urban environment and to develop an architectural identity. 
 
The report also suggests the introduction of ‘Made in Cyprus’ (MIC) and ‘Souls of Cyprus’ labelling to identify local products and to assist in the economic development of local communities. 
 
The first concerns local products available online, airports and specialised MIC stores, while the second relates to cultural events and experiences offered through a new marketing platform. 
 
The study also encourages for the total restructuring of the governance of the tourism sector. 
 
The study calls for the creation of four bodies: Creative Council for Tourism (under the president of the republic), Office of the Strategical Director (under the president), National Tourism Alliance (private sector) and the National Tourism Authority (State Secretariat for Tourism). 
 
In light of this, the National Tourism Authority must be restructured to implement the strategy and to face the challenges posed to the sector. 
 
The programme followed by the Authority will be decided by the four bodies, while a system must be devised to monitor developments in the sector. 
 
Finally, the study calls for the creation of a Competitions Unit with the aim of improving productivity in the sector by promoting the use of new technology and innovations through specialised programmes.
