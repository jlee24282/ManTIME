The Hamilton Place Rotary Club has partnered with Operation Warm for <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P7Y">the past seven years</TIMEX3> to provide local students with new <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-WI">winter</TIMEX3> coats through the club's annual Warm Coats for Cool Kidz project. 
 
<TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017">This year</TIMEX3>, 180 coats were delivered to nine elementary schools: Woodmore, Bess T. Shepherd, Harrison, East Lake, <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-SP">Spring</TIMEX3> Creek, East Side, Hillcrest, Orchard Knob and East Ridge. 
 
A new <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-WI">winter</TIMEX3> coat can be more than just a coat. It helps build self-esteem and tells a child, "You're worth it." A new <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-WI">winter</TIMEX3> coat can inspire pride and joy within a child, while also increasing peer acceptance. It can change a child's life and empower them with greater self-confidence and increased school attendance.
