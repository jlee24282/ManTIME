RIVERSIDE – Coach Bert Esposito and the Southeast All-Stars spent much of <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TNI">Saturday night</TIMEX3> with a football game well in control.

But the Northwest team was led by Dan Barlage, whose teams at Valley View have showed a flair for the dramatic. And even with a different cast of characters, a Barlage team made things interesting.

The Northwest team rallied from a 17-point deficit in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2016-Q4">the fourth quarter</TIMEX3>, but the Southeast club held on for a 27-21 victory in the first Riverside Sheriffs’ Association All-Star Classic at Norte Vista High School.

The Southeast led, 24-7, when the Northwest scored twice in <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="PT90S">90 seconds</TIMEX3> in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2016-Q4">the fourth quarter</TIMEX3>, and it only won after holding the Northwest offense on downs inside of <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="PT2M">the two-minute</TIMEX3> mark, one of four fourth-down stops it got on the night.

“That was big,” said Esposito, the longtime football coach at Paloma Valley who led the Southeast. “Anytime you play great defense like that … defense just wins games, plain and simple.”

Vista Murrieta’s Jaylin White and Temecula Valley’s Zak Simon caught touchdown passes and Paloma Valley running back Corey Maddox ran for another for the Southeast early on.

But La Sierra quarterback Roman Aguire found North receiver Joseph Seabrook – he finished with 154 yards on four catches – for an 80-yard touchdown pass on a hitch play that Barlage called “special” with 5:08 remaining to pull the Northeast to 24-14.

King’s Jaylen Moore recovered an onside kick, and the Northeast punched in a score on a 1-yard plunge by Corona’s Tony Fusi with 3:35 left to make it 24-21.

Fusi normally plays on the defensive line, but Barlage was impressed with what he saw from him as a fullback.

“He’s not average,” said Barlage, whose Valley View team won a CIF-Southern Section championship <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2016-12">last month</TIMEX3> on the final play at Quartz Hill. “He’s really good.”

The Northeast held on defense on downs but only gained 6 yards on four downs on the ensuing possession, with a fourth-down completion to North’s Micah Lowen stopped short of a first down by Paloma Valley safety Andre Kirkpatrick.

King quarterback Brad Kleven threw for 160 yards, and Aguirre threw for 104 more while Rancho Verde receiver Tyler Kennedy ran for 117 yards on 16 carries for the Northeast.

Quarterback Seth Morales of Indio Shadow Hills completed 8 of 14 passes for 174 yards, and Elsinore running back Anthony Reyes, who like Simon took the night off from his school’s boys basketball team, ran for 79 yards on 15 carries.

“It felt amazing,” he said. “Any time you get to come out and play football again – you don’t get those chances all the time.”
