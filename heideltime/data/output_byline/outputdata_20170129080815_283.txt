A Wall Street Journal Roundup Technology industry executives expressed personal dismay and concern for their companies in reacting to President Donald Trump's executive order on immigration. In company emails, interviews and posts published online, leaders from companies including Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp. framed the order as one at odds with a nation that welcomes foreigners and an industry that counts foreign-born executives in its upper ranks. In doing so, they broke with weeks of cautious engagement with the new administration. Here is a rundown of their statements. Apple CEO Tim Cook Team, In my conversations with officials here in Washington <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-W04">this week</TIMEX3>, I've made it clear that Apple believes deeply in the importance of immigration--both to our company and to our nation's future. Apple would not exist without immigration, let alone thrive and innovate the way we do. I've heard from many of you who are deeply concerned about the executive order issued <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">yesterday</TIMEX3> restricting immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries. I share your concerns. It is not a policy we support. There are employees at Apple who are directly affected by <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">yesterday</TIMEX3>'s immigration order. Our HR, Legal and Security teams are in contact with them, and Apple will do everything we can to support them. We're providing resources on AppleWeb for anyone with questions or concerns about immigration policies. And we have reached out to the White House to explain the negative effect on our co-workers and our company. As I've said many times, diversity makes our team stronger. And if there's one thing I know about the people at Apple, it's the depth of our empathy and support for one another. It's as important <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> as it's ever been, and it will not weaken one bit. I know I can count on all of you to make sure everyone at Apple feels welcome, respected and valued. Apple is open. Open to everyone, no matter where they come from, which language they speak, who they love or how they worship. Our employees represent the finest talent in the world, and our team hails from every corner of the globe. In the words of Dr. Martin Luther King, "We may have all come on different ships, but we are in the same boat <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3>." Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella As an immigrant and as a CEO, I've both experienced and seen the positive impact that immigration has on our company, for the country, and for the world. We will continue to advocate on this important topic. Microsoft President Brad Smith As a company, Microsoft believes in a strong and balanced high-skilled immigration system. We also believe in broader immigration opportunities, like the protections for talented and law-abiding young people under the Deferred Access for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) Program, often called "Dreamers." We believe that immigration laws can and should protect the public without sacrificing people's freedom of expression or religion. And we believe in the importance of protecting legitimate and law-abiding refugees whose very lives may be at stake in immigration proceedings. (Full statement here.) Google CEO Sundar Pichai We're upset about the impact of this order and any proposals that could impose restrictions on Googlers and their families, or that could create barriers to bringing great talent to the U.S....It's painful to see the personal cost of this executive order on our colleagues. Uber Technologies CEO Travis Kalanick Expedia CEO Dara Khosrowshahi Ours is a nation of immigrants. These are our roots, this is our soul. All erased with the stroke of a pen. I was incredibly fortunate to arrive in the U.S. with my family after the Iranian revolution. I don't have an Iranian passport and have never been back but have no idea if I'm on a list someplace listed as an Iranian citizen. And I'm a lucky one. We should strive for safe borders. But we have a responsibility as the world's greatest nation. And we sure aren't acting our part. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg My great-grandparents came from Germany, Austria and Poland. Priscilla's parents were refugees from China and Vietnam. The United States is a nation of immigrants, and we should be proud of that. Like many of you, I'm concerned about the impact of the <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> executive orders signed by President Trump. We need to keep this country safe, but we should do that by focusing on people who actually pose a threat. Expanding the focus of law enforcement beyond people who are real threats would make all Americans less safe by diverting resources, while millions of undocumented folks who don't pose a threat will live in fear of deportation. (Full statement here.) Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk Many people negatively affected by this policy are strong supporters of the U.S. They've done right, not wrong & don't deserve to be rejected....The blanket entry ban on citizens from certain primarily Muslim countries is not the best way to address the country's challenges Tweets: https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/825502618680045568 and https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/825502400454594561 Code.org CEO Hadi Partovi My family left Iran to escape a bloody war when I was 11, during the Reagan administration. America welcomed us as legal immigrants with visas. Code.org and the Hour of Code wouldn't exist otherwise. (Facebook post here.) Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky Open doors brings all of US together. Closing doors further divides US. Let's all find ways to connect people, not separate them. Tweet: https://twitter.com/bchesky/status/825407087085645824 Y Combinator President Sam Altman The tech community is powerful. Large tech companies in particular have enormous power and are held in high regard. We need to hear from the CEOs clearly and unequivocally. Although there is some business risk in doing so, there is strength in numbers--if everyone does it early this <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="FUTURE_REF">coming week</TIMEX3>, we will all make each other stronger. (Full statement here.) Netflix CEO Reed Hastings Trump's actions are hurting Netflix employees around the world, and are so un-American it pains us all. Worse, these actions will make America less safe (through hatred and loss of allies) rather than more safe. A very sad week, and more to come with the lives of over 600,000 Dreamers here in a America under imminent threat. It is time to link arms together to protect American values of freedom and opportunity. (Facebook post here.) Salesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff When we close our hearts & stop loving other people as ourselves (Mk 12:31) we forget who we truly are--a light unto the nations. #noban Tweet: https://twitter.com/Benioff/status/825470203299377152 Uber Technologies CEO Travis Kalanick Our People Ops team has already reached out to the dozen or so employees who we know are affected: for example, those who live and work in the U.S., are legal residents but not naturalized citizens will not be able to get back into the country if they are traveling outside of the U.S. <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> or anytime in <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DURATION" value="P90D">the next 90 days</TIMEX3>. Anyone who believes that this order could impact them should contact immigration@uber.com immediately. This order has far broader implications as it also affects thousands of drivers who use Uber and come from the listed countries, many of whom take long breaks to go back home to see their extended family. These drivers <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> outside of the U.S. will not be able to get back into the country for <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DURATION" value="P90D">90 days</TIMEX3>. That means they will not be able to earn a living and support their families--and of course they will be separated from their loved ones during that time. We are working out a process to identify these drivers and compensate them pro bono during <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DURATION" value="P3M">the next three months</TIMEX3> to help mitigate some of the financial stress and complications with supporting their families and putting food on the table. We will have more details on this in the <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="FUTURE_REF">coming days</TIMEX3>. (Full statement here.) Box CEO Aaron Levie On every level--moral, humanitarian, economic, logical, etc.--this ban is wrong and is completely antithetical to the principles of America. Tweet: https://twitter.com/levie/status/825424282679283712 Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey The Executive Order's humanitarian and economic impact is real and upsetting. We benefit from what refugees and immigrants bring to the U.S. Tweets: https://twitter.com/jack/status/825476172658200577 Slack Technologies CEO Stewart Butterfield "And he's just getting started." -- It's still so hard to believe that this is real life. Nearly every action seems gratuitously...evil. Tweet: https://twitter.com/stewart/status/825431304112009217 LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner 40% of Fortune 500 founded by immigrants or their children. All ethnicities should have access to opportunity--founding principle of U.S. Tweet: https://twitter.com/jeffweiner/status/825437102162792451 Dropbox CEO Drew Houston Executive orders affecting world's most vulnerable are un-American. Dropbox embraces people from all countries and faiths Tweet: https://twitter.com/drewhouston/status/825462890949861377 EBay CEO Devin Wenig <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DURATION" value="PXM" mod="MORE_THAN">Over the past several months</TIMEX3>, I've talked with you repeatedly about my unyielding commitment to our company's values. I've been clear that we will always stand up for those values and act in the interests of our employees and customers....I believe this decision fundamentally contradicts our company's values and America's values.
