The student-led Students for Survivors sent a list of 10 demands to the university in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2016-11">November</TIMEX3>. The list included calls to update the policy on sex offenses with adequate and correct information, create an easily accessible website that includes all of the resources available for survivors and is updated <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="SET" value="XXXX-XX">monthly</TIMEX3> and to hire a full-time Title IX coordinator and staff, the Cincinnati Enquirer reported.

Title IX is a federal law passed in 1972 that’s aimed at protecting people from discrimination based on sex in education programs and activities.

The school responded to the group in a letter on <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2016-12-05">Dec. 5</TIMEX3>, saying it hired four new Title IX staff members in the fall. The school has updated its website to reflect the <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> support services UC offers to survivors, the newspaper reported.

Vice President for Equity and Inclusion Bleuzette Marshall said in the letter that the group’s “voice is an important part” of the process. Since the list was sent, the university has asked the group to be part of the search process for a new Title IX coordinator. Marshall and interim Title IX coordinator Karla Phillips weren’t available for comment.

Grace Cunningham, a 20-year-old junior, said she founded Students for Survivors after she reported to UC officials that she was sexually assaulted off-campus in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3> and didn’t feel supported or helped by the school.

“It was frustrating,” Cunningham said. “It felt like it didn’t matter to them.”

The group officially formed in <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2017-08">August</TIMEX3> with about 50 members. It is not affiliated with the university. Cunningham said she hopes it can educate survivors of their rights and raise awareness of the issue on campus.

“There is no safe space on campus for survivors,” she said. “There is no place for them to feel supported on an institutional level.”
