VOTERS return to the polls on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-22">Sunday</TIMEX3> to elect a socialist candidate for <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-SP">spring</TIMEX3>'s Presidential elections. 

The second round of voting in the presidential primary is a straight run-off between former Prime Minister Manuel Valls and Benoît Hamon, who was education minister between <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2014-04">April</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2014-08">August 2014</TIMEX3>, and won the first round of voting with 36.35% compared to Mr Valls' 31.24%. 

Mr Hamon was regarded as an outsider, like centre-right presidential candidate François Fillon, but is credited with coming up with one of the few fresh proposals of the campaign: a ‘universal basic income’ which would see all over-18s paid €750 <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="P1M">a month</TIMEX3>. 

Both he and Mr Valls emerged from a seven-way primary <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017-W03-WE">last weekend</TIMEX3> to enter the run-off race. An early favourite to reach the second round, Arnaud Montebourg, who finished third, immediately declared his support for Mr Hamon. 

Mr Valls has criticised Mr Hamon and others for being ‘stuck in the past’ with old left-wing ideas that are not fit for today’s economic challenges. He said <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">today</TIMEX3> he did not want to 'shut the Left in unreality and illusion'. 

Regardless of whoever wins the nomination, polls suggest he will struggle to overcome the negative legacy of François Hollande's presidency and will not progress beyond the first round of the Presidential elections in <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2017-04">April</TIMEX3>. 

Mr Fillon and far-right candidate Marine Le Pen are expected to face off in the second round of the race for the Elysée, with centrist Emmanuel Macron finishing third. 

But Mr Fillon has become embroiled in a scandal over claims that his wife was paid for parliamentary work she did not do. He has denied the allegations, and said he would drop out of the race if a formal investigation was launched. 

According to a poll released on <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3>, only 38% of respondents had a positive opinion of him, against 54% in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2016-11">November</TIMEX3> and 42% <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2017-01" mod="START">earlier this month</TIMEX3>. 

It has been reported that, if he drops out, there could be no centre-right candidate at the elections.
