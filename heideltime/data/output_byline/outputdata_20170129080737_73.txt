<TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2017-W04-WE">This weekend</TIMEX3>, coach Mark Dantonio and the Michigan State staff will host several top junior prospects on a recruiting visit. The Spartans already have two four-star commitments for the class of <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2018">2018</TIMEX3> and could potentially add more in the near future. The players listed below are high on the recruiting board and could be offered in the near future. 
 
QB Theo Day of Divine Child High School in Dearborn 
 
Day is one the top pro-style quarterbacks in the Midwest for the class of <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2018">2018</TIMEX3>. The 6-foot-5, 190-pound is rated the No. 8 player in Michigan and the No. 14 quarterback in the nation by  Rivals.com . Day has already been offered by multiple Division 1 schools and Michigan State has been in frequent contact with him. 
 
Day camped at MSU <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2017-SU">this summer</TIMEX3> and was a top performer. This <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2016-FA">past fall</TIMEX3>, he excelled for Divine Child leading them deep into the playoffs. His visit to East Lansing could go a long way to him eventually receiving a Spartan scholarship. If he receives an offer, MSU could be tough to beat. 
 
DE Alex Reigelsperger of Wayne High School in Huber Heights, Ohio 
 
The 6-foot-5. 230-pound Reigelsperger has an impressive list of scholarship offers and he could add another <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2017-W04-WE">this weekend</TIMEX3>. Among others, Iowa, Wisconsin, Purdue, Pittsburgh, Kentucky and Rutgers have already extended him a scholarship.  Rivals.com  rates him a three-star recruit and one of the top players in Ohio for the class of <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2018">2018</TIMEX3>. 
 
Reigelsperger has been a target of the Spartans for some time. He is very familiar with the Spartan program due to his former teammate Messiah deWeaver being a member of the Green and White. Led by defensive coordinator Harlon Barnett, the Spartans have recruited the Dayton area very well. If the Spartans extend Reigelsperger an offer <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2017-W04-WE">this weekend</TIMEX3>, they will definitely be one of the teams to beat. 
 
LB Ed Warinner of Olentangy Liberty High School in Powell, Ohio 
 
Warinner is a 6-foot-1, 222-pound linebacker prospect that has some strong family ties to MSU. His father coached there in <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="198">the 1980's</TIMEX3> and his mother is a Spartan graduate. He also has several family members that live in the state of Michigan. 
 
Warinner has over half a dozen scholarship offers and schools such a Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota and MSU are all actively recruiting him. His father was <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> hired at Minnesota after coaching for <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DURATION" value="PXY">several years</TIMEX3> at Ohio State. His father and Dantonio roomed together in <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="198">the 1980's</TIMEX3> when they were both breaking into coaching at Akron. 
 
Michigan State may not offer the above prospects <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2017-W04-WE">this weekend</TIMEX3>, but expect all three players to be top priorities for the class of <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2018">2018</TIMEX3> before all is said and done.
