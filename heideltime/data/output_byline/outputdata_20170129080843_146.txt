Slice the chicken tenders in half and then toss with the remaining 2 tablespoons pesto. Evenly place the chicken and torn prosciutto over the puff pastry. If desired, sprinkle a little gorgonzola cheese overtop the pastries. Place in the oven with the peaches and bake for <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="PT25M">25</TIMEX3>-<TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="PT30M">30 minutes</TIMEX3> or until the pastry is puffed and the chicken cooked through.
