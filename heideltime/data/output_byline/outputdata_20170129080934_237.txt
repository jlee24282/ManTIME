The Joint Admission and Matriculation Board, JAMB has warned members of the general public about the activities of fraudsters illegally selling fake JAMB forms to unsuspecting applicants. The JAMB Registrar, Prof Isiaq Oloyede, represented by the Director of Special Duties, Mr Olujide Adisa, gave the warning in Abeokuta, the Ogun state capital during the parade of two suspects by the Ogun state command of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps. The JAMB boss said that the forms for the <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> session were not out yet as the board was putting all machinery together to ensure a hitch-free admission process. The two middle-aged men were reportedly arrested in Abeokuta, the Ogun state capital by the men of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps at two locations. They caught in the act of selling a form said to be fake to unsuspecting Joint Admission and Matriculation Board candidates. Putting the records straight, the JAMB Director of Special Duties said that any form being sold <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> by anybody is presumed to be fake. He asked prospective applicants to visit any of the state offices of the board across the country for any inquiry and save themselves from the antics of the fraudsters on the prow.http://www.edificationinfo.com/<TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3>/01/jamb-warns-against-fake-application.htmlcc lalasticlala
