A Southern California city and the federal government on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> said they reached a deal to close Santa Monica's airport, ending a lengthy legal battle over the site. 
 
In recognition of the city's authority to make decisions about land use, the agreement allows Santa Monica to shorten the airport's single runway to 3,500 feet from its <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> length of 4,973 feet. In <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent years</TIMEX3>, the city has dueled in court over the future of the property with the Federal Aviation Administration, the agency tasked with regulating the country's airports. 
 
In the meantime, the city can shorten the airport's single runway to 3,500 feet from its <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> length of almost 5,000 feet, which means larger jets will no longer be able to take off or land, city officials said. 
 
The agreement allows the city to close the facility any time after <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2028-12-31">December 31, 2028</TIMEX3>, and officials said they plan to take that action on the first possible day - <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2029-01-01">January 1, 2029</TIMEX3>. 
 
Stars and industry titans have long frequented the Santa Monica Airport, which has been deemed "unsafe" by city residents for years, according to the Times . 
 
Shortening the runway - which the city hopes to do within <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION" value="P6M">six months</TIMEX3> - will reduce jet operations by 44 percent, and jets are responsible for 95 percent of the noise complaints received by the city, said Mayor Ted Winterer. 
 
More details into the closure were expected to be released at a <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="TIME" value="2029-01-01T14:00">2 p.m.</TIMEX3> press conference <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TAF">Saturday afternoon</TIMEX3>. 
 
"Mutual cooperation between the FAA and the city enabled us to reach this innovative solution, which resolves longstanding legal and regulatory disputes", a statement from FAA administrator Michael Huerta reads.
