Australia lost, but Mitchell Starc remembers his top form the last time he played New Zealand at Eden Park. 
  
It is hardly like any more could be expected of Mitchell Starc. 
 
Australia's lanky left-arm pace spearhead has been to New Zealand once, for a <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3> World Cup pool match at Auckland's Eden Park. 
 
While he was on the losing side of the ledger, it was not for a lack of brilliance from Starc as he returned stunning figures of 6-28 as the Black Caps snuck home by one wicket. 
 
But, as the world's No 2-ranked <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P1D">one-day</TIMEX3> international bowler behind New Zealand counterpart Trent Boult arrived on Kiwi shores for the second time, he arrived with even more responsibility. 
 
  
  
   
   
   
   
 
The absence of captaincy duo and star batsmen David Warner (rested) and Steve Smith (injured) places Starc as arguably the most crucial figure if Australia are to retain the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy over a three-match series. 
 
While he felt that when it came to assisting stand-in skipper and wicketkeeper Matthew Wade, Starc indicated that would not be the case when he had ball in hand. 
 
"Between (new-ball partner) Josh Hazelwood and I, it's an opportunity to help Wadey out and offer some of our experience on the field," he said. 
 
"He's going to have to do a fair bit behind the stumps ... it gives a chance for a different leadership group to lead the way for the younger guys. 
 
"I always aim to take wickets and help the team. That is one of my roles, to come out aggressive and take wickets. 
 
"I will do that the same as I have been all <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-SU">summer</TIMEX3> in Australia." 
 
Same, though, is not a word the Australian team will be using much as they look back on their previous two matches at Eden Park ahead of game one there on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-01-23">Monday</TIMEX3>. 
 
They were rolled for 151 in that <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3> encounter before succumbing for four runs less in a 159-run hammering <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2016" mod="APPROX">almost a year ago</TIMEX3>. 
 
Starc says Australia have learned their lesson about being lured in by the famously small boundaries, mostly down the ground, at the largely rugby-based venue. 
 
"We've spoken about giving ourselves more time. 
 
"The smaller boundaries are in the back of your mind but you always have more time than you think, especially in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2050">50</TIMEX3>-over cricket where you don't have to score 300 in the first 40 overs. 
 
"For here, where it might swing and nip a little bit, you can give yourself a chance to get in, see some balls and take the chance [to be aggressive] at the back end." 
 
Making that adjustment, for the Australian batsmen and bowlers, will be key if they are to retain the silverware, but it won't be easy. 
 
Starc admitted they had not seen much swing or seam in their 4-1 ODI series victory over Pakistan during <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="PXW">the past couple of weeks</TIMEX3>, matches also played on significantly bigger grounds than they would encounter in New Zealand. 
 
And while the reminder he did not have to bowl to Brendon McCullum was greeted with a wide smile, Starc said they were wary of a Black Caps batting line-up that was particularly dangerous in their own conditions.
