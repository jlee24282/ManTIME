Bloemfontein Celtic reserve team assistant coach Jeffrey Legetla has hailed the ‘phenomenal talent’ on display in the team as they gear up to face Polokwane City on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3>.

Phunya Sele Sele head into the Kaizer Sebothelo Stadium encounter full of confidence, having rallied from two goals down to draw 2-2 against Kaizer Chiefs reserves <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-W03-WE">last weekend</TIMEX3>.

And, speaking ahead of <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-W04-WE">this weekend</TIMEX3>'s tie against Rise and Shine, which could see Siwelele go top of the table with just a draw, Legetla was full of praise for his charges.

He told Celtic’s official website: "We are truly blessed. The resilience produced by our talented and committed squad has been phenomenal this whole season."

He continued: “We are left with only four fixtures before we wrap the season and already players talking about their dream to clinch the title.

“Part of our major plan is to give opportunities to some of these players to be promoted and that has instilled some sense of winning mentality hence the <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> situation.

“Without underestimating City, our lads are focused and fantastically giving us the commitment we need. Contrary to what we experienced at the beginning of the season our goal scoring problems have been somehow solved and defense solidified.”
