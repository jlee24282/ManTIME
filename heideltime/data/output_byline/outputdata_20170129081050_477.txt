Canberra United crowned W-League premiers, but could be forced away from their home ground for semi. 

Newly-crowned W-League premiers Canberra United face being forced away from Fortress McKellar to play their do-or-die semi-final and a hit to their hip pocket in the process.

United coach Rae Dower says they've earned the right to host their semi against Melbourne City at their home ground, rather than have to play it as part of a double-header with the A-League clash between Central Coast Mariners and Adelaide United at Canberra Stadium on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3>.

United were crowned W-League premiers on <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3> after Sydney FC lost 5-2 to Adelaide United and Perth Glory could only manage a 1-0 victory over the Western Sydney Wanderers.

Canberra requested to play their semi at McKellar Park on <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> — the day before the Mariners come to town.

A home final would pocket them about $15,000 in gate takings and given the W-League team is run on a lean budget, that would be a substantial financial boost.

If they play at Canberra Stadium, then all gate takings would go to the Mariners, but Fairfax Media believes Canberra United would seek financial compensation from the FFA.

It's the second game Central Coast will play at Canberra Stadium <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-SU">this summer</TIMEX3>, having already played the Wellington Phoenix there in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-11">November</TIMEX3> in front of 5497 fans.

Canberra United were expecting a crowd of at least <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="1500">1500</TIMEX3> for their semi — the perfect number for the boutique McKellar Park.

The FFA met on <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29TAF">Sunday afternoon</TIMEX3> to decide the semi-final fixtures, although an announcement was not expected to be made until <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2017-01-23">Monday</TIMEX3>.

Dower said they'd pushed for their semi to be played at McKellar and had earned the right to hold it there.

The sticking point will be Fox Sports will be reluctant to set up television cameras to cover two games at two different venues on different days in Canberra, when they could simply cover them both at Canberra Stadium.

"That's certainly not our preference, our preference is to play [at McKellar]," Dower said.

"This is our home, this is Fortress McKellar so from my perspective a lot of other clubs have had a fair say of where they're allowed to play <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2017">this year</TIMEX3>, so I would hope that we got the opportunity to put in our first request and to be granted that as well.

"Especially if you're finishing No.1 or two on the ladder I think you've earned the right to play at your own home ground.

"It's out of our control, we can't do anything about it. I'm not going to stir the hornet's nest, but a number of other teams have had the opportunity to control where they've played <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2017">this year</TIMEX3>."

Another sticking point is training.

United can train throughout the week at McKellar for minimal cost, but would get limited access to Canberra Stadium.

Last time the Mariners were in town, Canberra played its season opener against Melbourne City as part of a Canberra Stadium double-header, losing that game 2-1.

They were unable to train on the ground in the lead-up to that match.

United co-captain Ellie Brush reiterated Dower's preference, but added they'd be ready regardless of where the game was.

"This is our favoured home, but ... we don't really mind where we suit up, we know the crowd will get out and support us. Just two more [wins] to go," she said.

Dower said Brush's fellow co-captain Michelle Heyman was unlikely to be ready for the semi, although she had returned to training with the main group as she continued her comeback from toe and ankle injuries.

The Matildas striker has been out since she rolled her ankle against the Melbourne Victory at <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2016-12" mod="END">the end of December</TIMEX3>.

"She was back training [<TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3>], which was a great sight to see her out here at McKellar juggling, jogging laps, kicking the ball around," Dower said.

"It was really great. <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2017-W05">Next week</TIMEX3> might be asking too much, but at least she's back in the frame <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> and she's running herself around."
