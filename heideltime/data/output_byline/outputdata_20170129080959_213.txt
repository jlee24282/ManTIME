DUBLIN BUS HAS a fleet of nearly 1,000 buses, three of which are single deck vehicles.

The need for the smaller vehicles has largely died out due to growing passenger numbers and extended routes, but the capital’s bus service still retains the vehicles for certain routes.

The buses are used on routes where roads may be narrower and less easily accessible to double deckers.

According to DublinBusStuff.com, single decker buses were used extensively on the “Nipper” route in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="198" mod="END">the late 80s</TIMEX3>/<TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="199" mod="START">early 90s</TIMEX3>.

A spokesperson for Dublin Bus that the bus is used to service the 44B route which takes it to Johnny Foxes Pub in the Dublin Mountains.

“Dublin Bus operates a fleet of 987 buses, three of which are single deck vehicles. These are based in Donnybrook Depot and are predominately used on Route 44b due to narrow roads and low hanging trees along the route to Glencullen.”

The route goes to Glencullen from Dundrum <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="SET" value="P1D" freq="6">six times a day</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-01-23">Monday</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3>.
