A CENTENARY is an anniversary worthy of a celebration. 

The Ballarat RSL has survived a tumultuous <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P10DE">10 decades</TIMEX3> that saw many other branches fold. 

The branch is stronger than ever and celebrated its centenary with a vehicle display, luncheon and dinner. 

Branch president Alexandra Tascas said the event gave people with a variety of military links an opportunity to gather and share stories.

She said one man, who she had never met before, came and showed her a picture of his daughter who had given the first Anzac day speech in Ballarat by a woman. She was in the airforce.

Ms Tascas, an army veteran, said these stories showed the significance and importance of the RSL.
