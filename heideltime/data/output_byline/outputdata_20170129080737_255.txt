The store employs hand-picked bathroom experts who are well-trained and dedicated to ensure the customers have a smooth buying and after-sales experience.” 

Bhatia added, “The Indian luxury landscape is experiencing an evolution which is redefining the consumer profile. Luxury in India is no longer the privilege of a few born into wealth. There is <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> a larger consumer base which has the money to splurge but wants a real value proposition. Also, this consumer base is not restricted to the top metro cities anymore. More than 40% of the total luxury market revenue is generated from smaller cities and towns. This luxury consumption in Tier II and III cities is growing steadily due to high internet penetration, increasing awareness amongst the youth and higher disposable income of the working segment.” 

He further said, “Our main focus is to align HSIL’s presence across these strategic locations in order to generate strong brand distinction. We feel that it is essential for us to grow by increasing our consumer touch points and provide them with holistic bathroom solutions. This Hyderabad is a very important market in the region driving demand for premium and luxury products. It is also the hub of marketing, technology and innovation in the region and offers great economic potential owing to the growing real estate market.”
