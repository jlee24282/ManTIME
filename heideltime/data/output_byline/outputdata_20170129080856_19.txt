The High Court <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3> granted bail to two children  detained in a case filed for killing another child in Kamrangirchar of Dhaka in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2016-10">October last year</TIMEX3>. 

The children -- Md Yusuf and Joy Das -- secured their bail after police produced them before the court complying with its earlier order. 

While passing the order, the court said that the detention without determining their age is against the relevant law. 

The HC bench of Justice Quazi Reza-Ul Hoque and Justice Mohammad Ullah came up with the order during hearing a rule issued over the legality of the duo’s detention. 

The court also fixed <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-03-01">March 1</TIMEX3> for further hearing on the rule. 

The HC on <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-01-15">January 15</TIMEX3> asked police to produce them following a petition filed by Children's Charity Bangladesh Foundation (CCBF), a human rights organisation, seeking necessary order to determine the age of the duo. 

In the petition, CCBF's counsel Barrister Abdul Halim said the children were under <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="P9Y">nine years</TIMEX3>' old and police had sent them to the custody mentioning that they are more than 12 years old. 

The petitioner’s counsel also said police cannot arrest any child, who is less than nine years old, as per the relevant provisions of the Children Act, <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2013">2013</TIMEX3>. 

Alif Bhuiyan, son of Uzzal Bhuiyan of Kamrangirchar, was killed on <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2016-09-29">last September 29</TIMEX3>. His body was recovered on <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2016-10-11">October 11</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2016-10-11">the same day</TIMEX3> police arrested the two children.
