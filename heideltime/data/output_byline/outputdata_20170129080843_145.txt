 History program  
<TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="1917" mod="MORE_THAN">More than 100 years ago</TIMEX3>, <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2016-08">August</TIMEX3> Fruehauf, a Detroit blacksmith and wagon builder, was asked to come up with a way to move a lumber dealer’s sailboat up north – but not using the traditional team of horses that would take days to make the journey. His idea was to create a two-wheeled wagon to hold the boat. To pull the boat, he removed the back seat of the lumberman’s speedy Model T and attached the wagon. It worked. They called the contraption a “trailer.” The rest, as they say, is history. 
 
Ruth Ann Fruehauf will relate the history of the firm that was founded in Detroit by her grandfather <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2016-08-03">August 3</TIMEX3>-<TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29T16:30">4:30 p.m. Sunday</TIMEX3>, Feb. 12,  at the Bloomfield Township Public Library. Fruehauf Trailer Co. created an industry, establishing a global presence with 26,000 employees worldwide. 
 
Fruehauf, author of "Singing Wheels" and several other books on the company, graduated from Cranbrook Kingswood School. After her grandfather’s death, her father Roy Fruehauf carried on the business and strongly promoted the nascent Interstate Highway System until his death at age 57. Ruth Ann ended up with boxes of his files and a determination to document the legacy of the company and the family. 
 
The library is located at <TIMEX3 tid="t34" type="DATE" value="1099">1099</TIMEX3> Lone Pine in Bloomfield Township.
