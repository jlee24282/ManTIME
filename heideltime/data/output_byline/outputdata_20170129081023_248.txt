In his retirement, Brian Schaab was a keen rose grower. 
   
When he was just a kid, Cameron Schaab watched his dad leave for Washington DC with hair samples in an envelope and a dogged determination to find the truth. 
 
Detective Sergeant Brian Schaab ﻿  was leading a police team aiming to catch one of New Zealand's worst criminals – and was becoming the kind of role model that sets the course of a son's life. 
 
Cameron Schaab spoke on <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3> after the death of his father: the man who arrested Jules Mikus, <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P15Y">15 years</TIMEX3> after his <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="1987">1987</TIMEX3> abduction, rape and murder of Napier schoolgirl Teresa Cormack. 
 
Brian Schaab died <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-W03">last week</TIMEX3> from complications related to his treatment for cancer, his son said. 
 
    
 
Cameron Schaab was glad his dad had a chance to see him in police uniform, after he graduated from police college in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2016-12">December</TIMEX3> and was posted to South Auckland. 
 
"That was one of the things I looked forward to, after everything that happened at work – getting home to tell Dad about it." 
 
He said a big part of his inspiration to join the police came from his dad's <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="P44Y">44 years</TIMEX3> in the force. It was a job that left Brian Schaab well-known and liked in Hawke's Bay. 
 
His dogged detective work eventually saw Mikus convicted in <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2002">2002</TIMEX3> for killing Cormack, after a breakthrough in the case that happened when Cameron Schaab was only about 5 or 6. 
 
"I don't really remember a huge deal of it, but Dad went on a trip to Washington DC with an envelope that had a couple of hairs, when DNA testing was cutting-edge, and that was the only place that could do it." 
 
His father gave him some simple advice: to "always go with your gut". 
 
"Even if things seem to line up on paper, but it's still not sitting right, then keep digging, and keep pushing on with it." 
 
Brian Schaab retired in <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2012-02">February 2012</TIMEX3>, but kept busy with work that included becoming a volunteer driver for the Hawke's Bay Cancer Society. 
 
Manager Trudy Kirk spoke through tears about Schaab, a "wonderful" man who had worked for <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3> with the group driving the shuttle van <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="SET" value="P1W" freq="3">three times a week</TIMEX3> to Palmerston North Hospital for treatment. 
 
"I get upset talking about him. He has got such a go-to attitude, he has enormous respect and empathy for people, driving our service and being there for clients." 
 
Schaab never spoke of his work as a detective. "We were all aware of it, but he never talked about it." 
 
Detective Senior Sergeant Dave de Lange said Schaab was a dedicated police officer and a committed member of the CIB. 
 
He was influential and had major involvement in the armed offenders squad in the Hawke's Bay. His commitment and enjoyment of the challenge of detective work made him a good investigator. 
 
Schaab is survived by four children.
