WATERLOO — The City Council will hold a public work session <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-23">Monday</TIMEX3> to discuss next year’s budget.

The meeting at <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="TIME" value="2017-01-30T17:30">5:30 p.m. Monday</TIMEX3> in City Hall will take advantage of what would normally be <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> off, because regular Waterloo council meetings are only held on the first four Mondays of any month. <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-W04">This week</TIMEX3> is January’s fifth <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-01-23">Monday</TIMEX3>.

Mayor Quentin Hart said the work session is designed to provide some baseline information about the budget for the fiscal year starting <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2016-07-01">July 1</TIMEX3> and discuss the process moving forward.

He said additional budget meetings are tentatively slated for <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2017-02-08">Feb. 8</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2017-02-11">Feb. 11</TIMEX3>, the latter being a <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>. The city must set the budget before <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2017-03-15">March 15</TIMEX3> to comply with state law.

This week’s meeting is not designed for public input, but future meetings and the mandatory budget meeting will allow comments.

Meanwhile, the city has put a link on the home page of its website — www.cityofwaterlooiowa.com — where anyone can post ideas on priorities, programs, improvements and organizational processes related to the budget.

<TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2016">Last year</TIMEX3>, a deeply divided City Council voted 4-3 to approve a budget cutting the property tax rate from $17.76 to about $17.61 per $1,000 of taxable value.

New goals adopted by the City Council in <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2016-12">December</TIMEX3> included reducing “the city’s property tax levies through a responsible balance of cost reduction in city operations and increases in taxable property valuations to ensure that Waterloo is a competitive, affordable and livable city.”
