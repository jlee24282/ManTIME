US Vice President Mike Pence told a crowd gathered in Washington for the annual March for Life rally that ending taxpayer-funded abortion is an important priority of President Donald Trump. 
 
After <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P4DE" mod="MORE_THAN">more than four decades</TIMEX3>, the March for Life has become a familiar ritual in Washington. No matter the weather, thousands of abortion opponents gather <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="SET" value="P1Y" quant="EVERY">every year</TIMEX3> on the National Mall, many wearing matching hats or scarves from their school or church groups, and listen to speeches from social conservatives in Congress before marching to the Supreme Court.

<TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017">This year</TIMEX3>, though, the anti-abortion movement has political momentum on its side, and Vice President Mike Pence lent his newly minted star power to <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3>'s rally, promising the triumphant crowd that more victories await. 

 
"We've come to a historic moment in the cause for life," said Pence. "Life is winning in America."

He said the Trump administration would "work with the Congress to end taxpayer funding of abortion and abortion providers, and we will devote those resources to health care services for women across America."

Pence added that the nation's founders, in the Declaration of Independence, intended "life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness" to be for all Americans, including the unborn. 
 
He accused the US Supreme Court, in its landmark Roe v. Wade decision in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="1973">1973</TIMEX3> that legalized abortion, of having "turned away from these timeless ideals." 
 
He said President Donald Trump would be nominating a Supreme Court justice <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2017-W05">next week</TIMEX3> who "will uphold the God-given liberties enshrined in our Constitution." 
 
President Donald Trump used his Twitter account to express support for abortion opponents attending the March for Life in Washington. 
 
"The #MarchForLife is so important. To all of you marching --- you have my full support!" Trump said in a tweet. 
 
The March for Life is usually held on the anniversary of the <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="1973">1973</TIMEX3> Supreme Court decision—Jan. 22—but it was pushed back <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2017">this year</TIMEX3> because of Trump's inauguration. 
 
Majority Republicans in the House and Senate would also like to end federal funding for Planned Parenthood, which provided more than a third of the nation's abortions in <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2014">2014</TIMEX3>. They also hope to ban most abortions after <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DURATION" value="P20W">20 weeks</TIMEX3> of pregnancy. Trump has pledged to sign both measures if they reach his desk. 
 
Though Pence, who describes himself as an "evangelical Catholic," has spoken at the rally before, his speech on <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> made him the first sitting vice president to do so. Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway will also speak. Trump, for his part, has signed an executive order banning US aid to foreign groups that provide abortions. 
 
One of President Donald Trump's top advisers, Kellyanne Conway, also spoke at the rally.

Thousands of abortion opponents gathered in the shadow of the Washington Monument for an annual rally that's taken on new energy <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2017">this year</TIMEX3> with President Donald Trump in office. 
 
Glenn Miller, a 60-year-old cabinet maker from Coventry, Connecticut, says this is his <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2017-03-04">fourth march</TIMEX3> and it's easily the most enthusiastic. He says Trump has given a voice to those who oppose abortion and that the previous administration "didn't care." 
 
He said he voted for Trump reluctantly because he didn't feel like he had a choice. He says he's been encouraged by the administration's actions on abortion so far. 
 
For the first time in years, abortion opponents will have all the political momentum when they hold their annual rally on the National Mall. 
 
The March for Life is held <TIMEX3 tid="t35" type="SET" value="P1Y" quant="EACH">each year</TIMEX3> to mark the anniversary of the <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DATE" value="1973">1973</TIMEX3> Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion. The group says Vice President Mike Pence will address <TIMEX3 tid="t36" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3>'s rally. The group adds no president or vice president has ever spoken previously at the event, <TIMEX3 tid="t37" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> in its 44th year. 
Americans remain deeply divided on abortion. The latest Gallup survey, released <TIMEX3 tid="t38" type="DATE" value="2016-SP">last spring</TIMEX3>, found that 47 percent of Americans described themselves as pro-abortion rights and 46 percent as anti-abortion. It also found that 79 percent believed abortion should be legal in either some or all circumstances.

Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, said that poll shows why abortion-rights supporters should not despair.

"The vast majority of Americans support Roe v. Wade and support the legal right to abortion," Hogue said. 
The March for Life, however, is running ads arguing that a majority of Americans support some restrictions on abortion and do not believe it should be funded by tax dollars.
