Linton Country School has one student enrolled for <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3>. 
   
OPINION: Six-year-old Cruiz Strickett​ is one special kid. 
 
They say it takes a village to bring up a child – and that's exactly what's happening in the small semi-rural farming neighbourhood of Linton, in the Manawatu. 
 
Not much had gone right at Linton Country School. Already, declining incomes and living conditions in the area saw the school plunge down the decile rankings. <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2016">Last year</TIMEX3>, challenges with the school governance and leadership provoked the Ministry of Education into sending in a limited statutory manager to take control of the board of trustees. Principal Bill Kaandorp had to stand down due to ill health, and ultimately resign. And for good measure, the school hall suffered a severe fire in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2016-10">October</TIMEX3>. 
   
Natasha Baker hopes to send her three-year-old son Michael to Linton Country School. She's set up a parents' group to support the school. 
   
The community might have been forgiven for turning their back on the school.  Some did. 
 
  
   
   
   
 
There were 12 pupils at the end of <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2016">the last year</TIMEX3>, who headed off to their <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2017-SU">summer</TIMEX3> holidays under the cloud of a series of crisis meetings about the school's future. Some went off to high school. Some moved to other schools. 
   
Linton Country School has suffered more than its share of troubles. By ast month, it was on the brink of closure. 
   
On <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2017-02-01">Wednesday</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017-W04">this week</TIMEX3>, one will return. That's Cruiz. 
 
Cruiz is the sixth generation of his family to go to Linton Country School; they weren't going to let go easily. 
 
After <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="P127Y">127 years</TIMEX3> serving the district, the school came oh-so-close to closing at <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2016-12-25">Christmas</TIMEX3>. The statutory manager, Laura Snowden, challenged the community: You want to keep your school? Well, step up. 
   
Cruiz Strickett's dad gardened, painted and cleaned in a last-ditch bid to keep his son's school open. 
   
And they did. Cruiz's dad, Aaron Strickett, fixed the sandpit, tidied up the gardens, cleaned the drains and put up bright yellow school signs. Natasha Baker and other mums with pre-schoolers swung in to offer their help too. 
   
They fought. And the Ministry of Education agreed to let them keep the school open – at least, for <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3>. 
 
Because there is, if course, a question of real public interest here: Should the taxpayer continue bankrolling a school that has just one child on the roll? The school will get $158,000 in salaries and operations funding <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2017">this year</TIMEX3> – you could put Cruiz through a degree at an Ivy League university for that kind of money.  
 
Ultimately the answer must be "no". It serves neither the public purse, the community, nor Cruiz himself, to continue propping up a failing school. 
 
That is the ultimate answer. But the immediate answer is a resounding "yes". The Ministry of Education has rightly given the school and its community a chance (probably a last chance) to prove themselves. 
 
School rolls go up. School rolls go down. But communities endure. 
 
Once you've shut down a school, it's hard to open it again. The graffitied, burned-out shells of closed schools around New Zealand are evidence of that. 
 
And a good school isn't just an educational provider – it is the heart of a community. 
 
The people of Linton have shown us that.
