Sila (club team) ang magre-request ‘di ba? Since wala pa si Alyssa ITC because she is new eh, ngayon lang siya magka-club, so pag ganoon ire-request nila (club team) sa NSA -- LVPI vice president Peter Cayco on Alyssa Valdez's delayed ITC release 
  
Larong Volleyball sa Pilipinas, Inc. vice president Peter Cayco clarified that there was a miscommunication in the process of acquiring an international transfer certificate (ITC) that delayed Filipina superstar Alyssa Valdez's clearance to play in the Thai League <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29TAF">Sunday afternoon</TIMEX3>. 
 
The sports association came under fire <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> following the reports that Valdez still has to receive her ITC to be able to suit up for 3BB Nakornnont in her debut game against King-Bangkok. 
 
In a late report, Valdez received her ITC and was cleared to play. 
 
Cayco was on the receiving end of criticism from volleyball fans, citing reports pointing that LVPI failed to register Valdez for an ITC. 
 
He clarified that they did their part in giving the former three-time UAAP Most Valuable Player the go-signal to play in Thailand, adding that since Valdez is just applying for a new ITC the process of obtaining one falls on the side of 3BB Nakornnont.  
 
Cayco and Valdez met at the LVPI office in Arellano University in Taft Avenue <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017-01-14">last January 14</TIMEX3> before she left for Thailand the day after.     
 
“Yes, sila (club team) ang magre-request ‘di ba? Since wala pa si Alyssa ITC because she is new eh, ngayon lang siya magka-club, so pag ganoon ire-request nila (club team) sa NSA,” he explained <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> during the national team tryouts. “So binigyan ko sila ng clearance, she’s clear to play. Ang kuwan ko lang, kami (LVPI) daw ang humingi ng ITC dapat nga sila ‘yung requesting club. Wala pa sayang previous ITC so what should have be done was kuha sila ng clearance sa amin, which I already gave.” 
 
“Actually three letters na ang pinapadala ko. We met lang kasi the day before she left so after she left siguro after <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="P2D">two days</TIMEX3> nagpadala na ako ng letter, then I sent a second letter and finally I sent a third letter on <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3> that she’s cleared to play,” he continued. “Dapat sila na ang nagpa-process niyan eh. Kasi it’s a new ITC and if it’s new, club to NSA (dapat) it’s not club to club kaya mas simple.” 
 
Cayco said that LVPI already cleared Valdez to play in Thailand, a historic feat for a Filipina spiker. 
 
“Eh ni-release ko na siya eh so I don’t know what’s happening,” Cayco said. “That paper was Alyssa’s letter to LVPI asking that she may be permitted to play so sinagot ko, after <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DURATION" value="P2D">two days</TIMEX3> may sagot na ako doon, naka-CC, copy furnish si Alyssa. Siguradong maga-grant (ang request), ang sa akin lang na-late lang kasi sila tapos sasabihin bakit hindi pina-process.” 
 
Valdez trained for <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DURATION" value="P2W">two weeks</TIMEX3> with the team but failed to send Cayco a copy of her contract and passport – the required documents needed by FIVB to process the ITC. 
 
LVPI received a copy of the contract just <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">last Friday</TIMEX3>. 
 
“I have (<TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3>) the records with me. I have been asking Alyssa to email me kasi she left na rin ‘di ba? Before she left, she visited me here on <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>, so I told her, Alyssa here’s my email add send me a copy of your passport and your contract,” Cayco said. “But it did not come, kinulit ko na lang siya, sabi ko please send me (the documents).” 
 
Cayco said that he sought the help of LVPI secretary general Ricky Palou to contact Valdez for the required documents but the former Ateneo de Manila athletics director told him that a contract in not necessary to acquire an ITC.    
 
“I asked Mr. Palou to help me get in touch with Alyssa so they sent me a copy of the passport. So ang hinihingi ng FIVB is the copy of the passport and the copy of the contract and he (Palou) told me they (FIVB) don’t need the copy of the contract. I told him that’s what they’ re asking so I might as well give it kasi I cannot tell them naman na, ‘huwag na ‘yan’,” he said. “So finally, I went direct to her club, I wrote them I think twice or thrice. <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="TIME" value="2017-01-27T12:00">Friday noon</TIMEX3> they sent me a copy of the contract signed by Alyssa Valdez so <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> I have with me a copy of her contract and a copy of her passport and <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">yesterday</TIMEX3> (<TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>) I sent it immediately na to FIVB. Ang problema, <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3> (nagsend ng contract) I just hope na process na nila. I was trying to call them <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> mga noon time, I was getting the answering machine of the FIVB, so hopefully sana ma-process agad.” 
 
“Pero I wrote TVA (Thailand Volleyball Association) and AVC and her club stating that the LVPI imposes no objection to the playing of Alyssa Valdez in Thailand from the period covered and she is cleared to play, it’s just that the LVPI is still awaiting for the ITC,” said Cayco.
