Akshay Kumar's upcoming film Jolly LLB 2 is releasing in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="PXW">a few weeks</TIMEX3> on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-02-10">February 10</TIMEX3> and the khiladi star is very much needed in the country to promote his film. 
 
Meanwhile, Jolly LLB 2 is caught in a one-of-a-kind legal soup. A practicing sessions court lawyer Ajaykumar Waghmare has filed a petition against Jolly LLB 2 and has urged the filmmakers to drop the word 'LLB' from the title as the film is "nothing but an attempt to portray the Indian legal profession and judicial system as a laughing stock to the society at large."

The petition has been filed against, among others, Akshay Kumar, his co-actor Annu Kapoor and Fox Star Studios, the producers of Jolly LLB 2. It remains to be seen what the case leads to and whether Jolly LLB 2 becomes yet another Rs 100-crore hit.
