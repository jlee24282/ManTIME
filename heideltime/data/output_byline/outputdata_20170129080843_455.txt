It was never really a retirement, it's not quite a comeback and who knows what happens <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017">this year</TIMEX3>. 
 
What Cameron Meyer knows for sure is that riding his bike has rarely felt this good. 
 
The 29-year-old continued his outstanding form in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3>'s Cadel Evans Great Ocean Road race. 
 
Riding for the Korda Mentha national team, Meyer launched a bold solo attack with 600m left in the 174km race. 
 
It just failed, with German Nikias Arndt and compatriot Simon Gerrans catching Meyer on the line. 
 
Such a near-miss would frustrate or even devastate a lot of riders, but Meyer was rapt. 
 
"I'm ecstatic to be third in a WorldTour <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P1D">one-day</TIMEX3> race, to kick off the season like this," he said. 
 
"I'm having a great <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-SU">summer</TIMEX3>, I'm really enjoying it." 
 
Given what happened <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3>, it's no wonder Meyer is so happy. 
 
He abruptly took a break from professional cycling in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2016-06">June</TIMEX3> and just as suddenly announced a return in <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2016-10">October</TIMEX3>. 
 
"It was just a break - everyone called it retirement and a comeback and everyone like that," he said. 
 
"I knew I had more cycling left in me. 
 
"It just took time, it just took a bit of a break - it took a bit of time away, which I hadn't had since I was 12. 
 
"That was probably a bit of my downfall, not managing outside, off the bike." 
 
Meyer initially returned on the track - he is a six-time world champion on the boards - but <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017-01">this month</TIMEX3> he has also starred in the composite national road team. 
 
Made up mainly of developing riders, they won the teams category at the Tour Down Under. 
 
They were the only non-WorldTour team in the field. 
 
<TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3>'s result again showed that Meyer is back, but it remains to be seen what he does once the Australian season ends. 
 
His immediate aims are <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2017-W05">next week</TIMEX3>'s Herald Sun Tour and then the world track championships. 
 
"That's the question everyone asks me actually at the moment and I don't think I have an exact answer," he said. 
 
"I'm just taking it as it comes <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3>. 
 
"It might be a bit of national team stuff, it might be signing with a team, at the moment I'm just really enjoying it, getting back out there and having a crack.
