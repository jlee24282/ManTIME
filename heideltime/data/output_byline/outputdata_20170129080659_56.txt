On <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="TIME" value="2017-01-27TNI">Friday night</TIMEX3>, Chambers shared another image of the baby boy — but this time with herself and Harper in the frame. “<TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="TIME" value="2017-01-27TNI">Friday night</TIMEX3> rager,” the TV journalist joked. “And baby boy slept right through it.”

“You can find out <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> at <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION" value="P9W">nine weeks</TIMEX3>, which is really bizarre,” he told Jimmy Kimmel at the time, in reference to gender testing. “They do a blood test. It’s crazy. They test if there’s hormones in there. They go, ‘Oh, you’ve got testosterone.’ So you either have balls or you’re having a baby boy.” 

 
When Kimmel, 49, then joked about possible names the couple were trying out to go with “Hammer,” the Birth of a Nation actor only referenced names for a baby boy. “We’re thinking Jack, Jack Hammer,” he joked. “Michael Charles and he can just go by M.C.” Suddenly he realized his mistake. “I think I just gave away our baby name,” Hammer revealed. “I’m in so much trouble!"
