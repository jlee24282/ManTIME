Michael Parekowhai’s artwork on Queens Wharf, The Lighthouse, will be publicly opened on <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-02-04">Saturday</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-02-11">11 February</TIMEX3> from <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="TIME" value="2017-02-11T19:00">7pm</TIMEX3> – with no speeches or unveiling. 
 
Auckland Council arts & culture manager Kaye Glamuzina said the finishing touches were being applied and the fences around it would be taken down at opening time. 
 
The opening celebration is timed to coincide with dusk & sunset to offer people the opportunity to see The Lighthouse – a conceptual design in the form of a <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="195">1950s</TIMEX3> state house filled by a hand-blown glass chandelier – against the changing night sky. 
 
It’s surrounded by a wooden jetty that ‘floats’ on the wharf. The public can explore the work by looking in windows & doors and climbing the staircase. 
 
Real estate agency Barfoot & Thompson donated $1 million of the council’s $1.5 million project budget.
