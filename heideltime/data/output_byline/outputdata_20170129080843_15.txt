Although most assessments of what could be lost to coastal erosion have focused on modern buildings, one often overlooked piece of Louisiana’s culture that could be lost is the historical legacy of the state’s Native American tribes. 
 
This has been a major topic on the mind of Jayur Mehta. Mehta received his Ph.D. in anthropology with a focus in archaeology from Tulane and has been studying the millennia-old mounds along the Gulf for <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DURATION" value="PXY">many years</TIMEX3>. He said he believes the ancient monuments are at risk. 
 
“Louisiana’s coastal heritage is incredibly threatened from coastal erosion, sea-level rise and human interference,” Mehta said. “It’s all at risk.” 
 
Mehta is studying the mounds along the Louisiana coast with Tulane doctoral candidate Elizabeth Chamberlain and says the mounds are a rarity when considered next to other similar ancient monuments. 
 
“We have no evidence of the people of coastal Louisiana engaging in any kind of agriculture,” Mehta said. “More broadly across the world, monument building is tightly tied to agriculture. Only in a few locations like here and coastal Peru do you see monuments without agriculture.” 
 
Mehta said these mounds are culturally and historically significant, pointing to the fact that the mound at Poverty Point in north Louisiana is a Unesco World Heritage Site alongside the Great Pyramids of Giza and the Taj Mahal as proof of their importance. 
 
And studying these mounds and the movement of the ancient tribes, he has gotten some insight into why the people of Louisiana would abandon one settlement and move to another. 
 
“There are older settlements to the west and younger settlements to the east,” Mehta said. “We don’t really understand the mechanism of abandonment and resettlement, but, broadly speaking, the settlements seemed to align with the age of the Delta.” 
 
According to Mehta, from <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="0400">400</TIMEX3>-<TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="1400">1400 A.D.</TIMEX3>, the outflow of the Mississippi River was Bayou Lafourche and it was around this time that the mounds in the region were built. One of the more impressive mounds that Mehta mentioned was the one at Bayou Grand Caillou that is about 26.25 feet high. 
 
There are also mounds in the Dulac area. Although one that was located near Bayou Hardware has been destroyed, two still exist off Shrimpers Row. 
 
“I think it’s really amazing and beautiful from the top of it,” said Candace Chauvin, a member of the United Houma Nation whose family lives next door to the mound. “It’s surprising that so many people don’t even know about their history. It’s so important.” 
 
Chauvin, who was in attendance for Mehta’s <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> presentation on the subject at the Grand Caillou Library, said she wishes more could be done to save them. 
 
“They’re just disappearing. I really wish there was some way to preserve them,” Chauvin said. “I’m so glad Dr. Mehta did his presentation at the library. People need to know about this stuff.” 
 
Mehta is also a humanities teacher at the New Orleans Center for the Creative Arts and a principal at the Gulf Communities Research Institute, a nonprofit dedicated to “preserving the health, resilience, and lifeways of coastal peoples.” 
 
According to Mehta, the <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> land loss projections are threatening to wash away the mounds outside of levee rings. 
 
He also says even though places like Dulac and Bayou Grand Caillou are “protected for some time,” if we don’t fight land loss and reintroduce sedimentation and subsistence, it’s “absolutely possible we will lose these sites.” 
 
“We have to do more. We know that historically the Mississippi River would create around half-a-football field of land <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="PT1H">an hour</TIMEX3>, yet we’re losing an entire football field <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="PT1H">an hour</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3>,” Mehta said, quoting <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> land loss studies. “It’s scary that natural systems aren’t able to keep up anymore. We need to do more.”
