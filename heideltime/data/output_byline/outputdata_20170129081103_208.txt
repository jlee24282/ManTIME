PFI said the 12th <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P5Y">five year</TIMEX3> plan recommends increasing public expenditure on health to 2.5 per cent of GDP by <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3>. Noting that India’s spend on healthcare is much lower than some fellow BRICS and SAARC nations, a health body has asked the Centre to bolster investments in health, particularly in family planning, in the upcoming budget. Insisting that increasing the budget allocation for health and family planning is of “utmost concern”, Population Foundation of India (PFI) has said low spending by the country in the sector has caused growing inequities, insufficient access and poor quality of healthcare services. “India spends just 1.3 per cent of its GDP on healthcare. This figure is much lower compared to BRICS countries – Brazil spends around 8.3 per cent, Russian Federation 7.1 per cent and South Africa around 8.8 per cent. “Among SAARC countries, Afghanistan spends 8.2 per cent, Maldives 13.7 per cent and Nepal 5.8 per cent. This low spending by India has been a cause for the growing inequities, insufficient access (to), and poor quality of healthcare services,” Poonam Muttreja, Executive Director, PFI said. PFI said the 12th <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P5Y">five year</TIMEX3> plan recommends increasing public expenditure on health to 2.5 per cent of GDP by <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3>. Between <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3>-<TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2016">16</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3>-<TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017">17</TIMEX3>, the government’s allocations for Health Ministry increased by 13 per cent but the share of National Health Mission in the Ministry’s budget declined to 48 per cent.

Trends in budget allocations indicate that percentage share to family planning has remained unchanged between <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2013">2013</TIMEX3>-<TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2014">14</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3>-<TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2017">17</TIMEX3> — at 2 per cent of the total Health Ministry’s budget.

Noting that during <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3>-<TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2016">16</TIMEX3>, 59 per cent of government fund was released primarily in <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2016-Q4">the last quarter</TIMEX3> while 72 per cent was released in the first two quarters in <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2014">2014</TIMEX3>-<TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2015">15</TIMEX3>, PFI said this evidences staggered supply of funds for health resources and affects investments.

“Investing in health is critical for achieving the economic development goals. The health sector, which drives domestic demand for health care, has the potential of providing new jobs. The lack of skilled workforce is stark in the health sector. Increased investment will also bring down the prices of health services and assist in sustaining the medium term inflation target of four per cent.

“Adequate and proportionate resources invested (in health and specifically family planning) in the upcoming budget announcement will bear positive dividends for the country’s future,” Muttreja said.

According to Census <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2011">2011</TIMEX3>, 53 per cent of the country’s population is reproductive age group (15- <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DURATION" value="P49Y">49 years</TIMEX3>) while one of five persons in the country is an adolescent (<TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DURATION" value="P10Y">10</TIMEX3>-<TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DURATION" value="P19Y">19 years</TIMEX3>) and every third is a young person (<TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DURATION" value="P15Y">15</TIMEX3>-<TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DURATION" value="P24Y">24 years</TIMEX3>).

“There is a collective responsibility on the government, civil society and other stakeholders to work together to plan adequate and suitable opportunities to meet their needs and aspirations and address the health and well-being of this population,” she said.

PFI said that at the London Summit <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="2012">2012</TIMEX3>, India committed to provide family planning services to an additional 48 million new users by <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DATE" value="2020">2020</TIMEX3>.

To fulfill our FP-2020 commitments and meet the responsibility towards the large young population, investments in health and family planning need to be proportionately increased.

“According to the FP-<TIMEX3 tid="t34" type="DATE" value="2020">2020</TIMEX3> progress report <TIMEX3 tid="t35" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3>-<TIMEX3 tid="t37" type="DATE" value="2016">16</TIMEX3>, India has only reached 7.7 million additional users, by <TIMEX3 tid="t39" type="DATE" value="2016-07">July 2016</TIMEX3>. Three million additional users have been reached <TIMEX3 tid="t40" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3>, in contrast to 1.5 million additional users reached, each for the first <TIMEX3 tid="t41" type="DURATION" value="P3Y">three years</TIMEX3>.

“The accelerated efforts of the government towards universal access to family planning are also evident in its introduction of three new spacing methods of contraception in the family planning programme… in <TIMEX3 tid="t42" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3>, offering greater choice and autonomy to the users of family planning,” she said.
