This <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-W03">past week</TIMEX3>, I sadly learned of the passing of my former English teacher from Winnacunnet High School in Hampton. 
 
Tom Haggerty, along with my mom and another teacher, Mr. Ford, were my inspirations for majoring in English in college. They also gave me the interest in doing what I’m doing <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">right now</TIMEX3> — writing. I was surprised at how sad I was to learn about Mr. Haggerty’s passing. He wasn’t part of my daily life. I had only seen him a handful of times since graduating. Yet, something about the news struck me. Over the years, I would stop into the little book store in North Hampton where Mr. Haggerty worked in his retirement and we’d chat and catch up. He was always interested in what I was doing, what campaigns I was on, what my plans were. The fact he and I disagreed politically on almost everything never stopped the conversation from being pleasant and kind. It never stopped him from letting me know he was proud of what I was doing or had done. Mr. Haggerty didn’t preach tolerance, he demonstrated it by accepting me for who I was and am. We could use some more Mr. Haggertys in the world <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3>; maybe that’s why I was so struck. 
 
Since President Trump took office just a bit <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-W03" mod="MORE_THAN">more than a week ago</TIMEX3>, we have seen a Women’s <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2016-03">March</TIMEX3> and March for Life, celebrations and protests and all forms of disagreement in both social and traditional media. We have seen people preach tolerance while condemning those they disagree with. We saw acts of violence and vandalism and cowardly attacks on people who had presumably voted differently than the attacker. 
 
I worked in politics for a long time. Long enough to remember when following events or even debates, competing staffs would join each other afterward for a drink or a bite to eat. I remember Democrat and Republican lawmakers going out for dinner or lunch or after a session to talk about life outside of politics. People didn’t hate each other based on voter registration. Moreover, people were able to exchange ideas, even disagreeing in an agreeable manner. There was a mutual respect for one another, even during the discussion of opposing opinions. 
 
We are a nation of more than 300 million people. The idea that we would all agree — or that we even should — is as insane as smashing windows of Starbucks to spread tolerance. 
 
Tolerance is not agreement. Quite the opposite. Tolerance means to accept the views, lives and opinions of others, without disliking them for it. It means, live and let live. Somewhere along our path, and certainly <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="P2Y" mod="MORE_THAN">over the past two years</TIMEX3>, too many have forgotten this. 
 
I received several emails regarding last week’s column, some in praise, others in disagreement. I was thrilled to be part of a dialogue even with those who didn’t agree with me. I was so pleased people went out of their way to write to me and express their opinions. I learn from others' ideas and I don’t shun them for having them. I celebrate the exchange of them. 
 
People in New Hampshire and America are all over the spectrum emotionally since the inauguration. Some are jumping with joy, others bitter and angry. Most are probably somewhere in between. Every one of the opinions and emotions are valid to the person feeling them. Why can’t we embrace that reality and embrace our differences? How completely boring the nation would be if we were all the same. My stops in the little bookstore in North Hampton probably wouldn’t have been as much fun either. 
 
Rest well, Mr. Haggerty and thank you. Your lessons will live on in the too-many-to-count students you inspired. 
 
That’s my perspective; I’d love to hear yours. You can write me your thoughts or ask me to weigh in on anything you’d like and maybe your comments or topics will appear here next time. Just email me at PrestonPerspective@gmail.com.
