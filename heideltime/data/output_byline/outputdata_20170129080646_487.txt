An impressive 154 dachsunds turned out for <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017">this year</TIMEX3>'s dachshund races at the Bungendore Show on <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3>. Organisers claim this a record number of the little dogs in the one place at the one time. 

Mark Ellis, the organiser of <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3>'s Werriwa Wiener Dash at the Bungendore Show, believes the turnout of 154 dachshunds for the event constitutes a world record for the number of the sausage dogs in one place at one time.

"We had miniatures, long hairs, short hairs, standards and wire hairs," he said. "They came from all over; some even travelled from Melbourne.

While Mr Ellis wasn't able to engage the attention of the people from Guinness, who ruled the record being sought was too "specialised" to interest them, he is happy to claim the record with any other contenders needing to prove him wrong.

Although the quirky event, which has captured the imagination of dachshund lovers from across NSW and the ACT, is only in its second year it has already become one of the feature events of the Bungendore Show.

<TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017">This year</TIMEX3>'s dash winner was Buddy, owned by Jacqueline Winzenberg of Page in the ACT. Buddy's award was presented by NSW Deputy Premier and local member John Barilaro.

One hundred and twenty seven dogs turned up for the inaugural event in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3>.

Bungendore Show, which was first held in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="184">the 1840s</TIMEX3>, has gone from strength to strength in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent decades</TIMEX3>, <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017">this year</TIMEX3>'s showgirl, Hanna Darmody, 22, said.

Ms Darmody, whose family own a Bungendore butchery, said she could recall helping with the catering at the show as a toddler <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="1997" mod="APPROX">almost 20 years ago</TIMEX3>.

"I've seen the event grow as the town has grown," she said. "It is a great bridge between country and city; the showgirl competition is a good way to get young people involved and promotes opportunities in agriculture."

Show organisers said <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2017">this year</TIMEX3>'s event, which enjoyed the best weather conditions in <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DURATION" value="P3Y">three years</TIMEX3>, was an unqualified success with more than 2000 people passing through the gates before lunch.

In addition to the usual attractions in the show ring and the pavilions and the dachshund dash, the <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> event offered visitors a chance to get a close look at the Anzac Centennial 18 pounder gun.

The World War I-era weapon, which also saw service during World War II,was restored by the Royal Australian Artillery Company in conjunction with veteran coach builder Jim Frecklington. The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.
