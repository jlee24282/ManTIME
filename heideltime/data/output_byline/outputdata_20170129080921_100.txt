While competing at the <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> Kosuke Kitajima Cup, 19-year-old Japanese swimmer  Ippei Watanabe cranked out a shiny new World Record in the men’s long course meters 200 breaststroke. Firing off a monster 2:06.67 at the Tatsumi International Swim Centre <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29TNI">tonight</TIMEX3> on Tokyo, Watanabe became the first man ever to score a sub-2:07 200 breast, easily overtaking the previous world record mark by .<TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="PT34S">34 seconds</TIMEX3>. 
 
The elusive 200 breast World Record was previously held by countryman Akihiro Yamaguchi with the 2:07.01 he set in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2012">2012</TIMEX3>. Although Yamaguchi has been silent ever since, Watanabe has quietly and steadily been on the rise, having broken the World Junior Record in this event back in <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2015-05">May 2015</TIMEX3>. Although it’s since been overtaken by Russia’s Anton Chupkov, Watanabe’s junior mark of 2:09.75 from just <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2015" mod="LESS_THAN">less than 2 years ago</TIMEX3> gives an eye-opening view of this young man’s progression in the event. 
 
Watanabe made a run at an Olympic gold medal in the 200 breast, heading into the Rio final with a newly-minted Olympic Record of 2:07.22 in the semi-finals. Unable to replicate that caliber of performance, the teen ultimately finished in 6th place overall in a slower 2:07.87. 
 
However, with tonight’s performance, Watanabe may have just foreshadowed a thrilling breaststroke performance that may be in store come the <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2020">2020</TIMEX3> Olympic Games when the then-23-year-old may be performing in front of a home crowd.
