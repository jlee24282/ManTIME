Roger Federer, 35, and Rafael Nadal, 30 are once again at it. Both men, who rouse nostalgia, are in a Major final. The Swiss and the Spaniard will be facing in the Australian Open men’s final on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3> . The match will begin at <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29T14:00">2 pm</TIMEX3> Indian Standard Time (IST). ESPN Sony Six will broadcast the match live on television. Fans looking to catch the action online can watch free live streaming of Serena vs Venus Women’s single final on Sony Liv.   While Nadal has been clearly the better player on clay, the grass would have favoured Federer’s game. That equation of dominance does not stand with respect to hard courts. No player can claim that he will dominate his great rival and opponent on a hard court because the man at the other side of the net is equally capable on the same surface.   Nadal leads Federer 13-2 on clay. More importantly, Nadal has won the French Open nine times. Federer has won in France only once. On grass, the two have met only three times. Federer leads 2-1. And significantly, Federer has won Wimbledon seven times. Nadal on the other hand has won there twice.

On the other hand, Federer has won nine Majors on hard courts (five in the US and four in Australia). Nadal has bagged three Majors on hard courts (two in the US and one in Australia).
