Key players Jordy Nelson, Davante Adams, Geronimo Allison and Morgan Burnett are active for the Green Bay Packers for their NFC Championship matchup against Atlanta. 
 
The Green Bay Packers aren’t healthy. 
 
But they are full strength. 
 
Receivers Jordy Nelson, Davante Adams and Geronimo Allison and safety Morgan Burnett are all active for today’s NFC Championship Game here at the Georgia Dome. Nelson (ribs), Adams (ankle), Allison (hamstring) and Burnett (thigh) were all listed as questionable and potential game-time decisions. 
 
To protect the broken ribs sustained only <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-W02">two weeks ago</TIMEX3> against the Giants, Nelson has enlisted extra protection . Nelson was listed as limited participation on <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-25">Wednesday</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-01-26">Thursday</TIMEX3> but not on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3> due to illness. Adams, Allison and Burnett did not practice on <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-01-25">Wednesday</TIMEX3> or <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-01-26">Thursday</TIMEX3>. 

Also active for Green Bay is cornerback Quinten Rollins, who missed the last two games with a concussion, and running back Christine Michael, who was added to the injury report on <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>. 
 
Green Bay’s inactives are quarterback Joe Callahan, receiver Max McCaffrey, cornerback Herb Waters, fullback Joe Kerridge, running back James Starks, offensive tackle Kyle Murphy and defensive tackle Christian Ringo. Only Starks (concussion) is injured among that group. McCaffrey, an undrafted rookie, was promoted from the practice squad on <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> and center J.C. Tretter (knee) was placed on injured reserve. 
 
The Falcons don’t have any noteworthy names on their inactives list. Receiver Julio Jones (toe) will start, as expected.
