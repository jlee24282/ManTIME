INDIO >> In a sport where double nicknames, multiple divisions, and duplicate belts abound, let’s get this straight about the 130-pounders. 
 
They are super featherweights. There is nothing “junior” or “lightweight” about them. 
 
The most interesting division in boxing hit another gear <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TNI">Saturday night</TIMEX3> at Fantasy Springs Casino. 
 
Francisco Vargas, who had gotten a win and a draw in the <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3> and 2016 Fights of the Year, ran up against Miguel Berchelt, a fellow Mexican who was 30-1 but nobody’s household name in America. 
 
And it seems Vargas has paid a high price for providing such violent entertainment. 
 
His usual punching volume removed none of <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-SP">the spring</TIMEX3> in Berchelt’s step. Neither did it stop his opponent’s forward surges. 
 
When Berchelt powered Vargas against the ropes near the end of the 11th round and got little shrapnel in return, referee Raul Caiz Jr. stopped it at the 2:19 mark. 
 
Berchelt thus became the new WBC 130-pound champion and an intriguing new figure for the networks. 
 
From the beginning Vargas had difficulty coping with Berchelt’s one-inch reach advantage and his two-handed power. Unlike Vargas’ earlier victims, Berchelt was able to judge the distance and keep Vargas from rat-a-tat inside attacks. There was nothing resembling a knockdown, but Berchelt also held his poise and his command throughout. Between the ninth and 10th rounds, ring doctors spent a long time staring at Vargas’ ravaged eye. Berchelt, standing and waiting to come in, began holding up his fist in anticipatory victory. The fight resumed, but nothing changed. 
 
It was a surprising leap for a guy who never had fought for a title before and, in fact, never had seen a seventh round. 
 
“Vargas is a great champion, that’s why he’s had those Fights of the Year,” Berchelt said later. “I’m young, I’m hungry and I came here to be the world champion, and <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">right now</TIMEX3> that feels great.” 
 
The outcome was not exactly a revelation for Vargas and his Golden Boy handlers. 
 
“He is his own worst enemy,” said Eric Gomez, Oscar De La Hoya’s right-hand man at Golden Boy. “He has a lot of skills as a boxer and a puncher, but he wants to fight these wars.” 
 
Gomez had likened Vargas to Salvador Sanchez, the great featherweight champ of <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="198" mod="START">the early 80s</TIMEX3> who died in a car wreck when he was only 23 and ready to become a celestial figure in the sport. Sanchez had the same charisma, in and out of the ring, but he also had the counterpunching polish necessary to put the head-first guys in their place. 
 
That storyline vanished <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TNI">Saturday night</TIMEX3>, but another door opens and another compelling super-featherweight comes out. 
 
If you could somehow clear out the politics (ha), you’d see a procession of quality 130-pound matchups on a <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="SET" value="XXXX-XX">monthly</TIMEX3> basis. 
 
 
Nobody in boxing is more polished and confident than Vasyl Lomachenko, and yet he lost his first professional fight to Orlando Salido, who brawled Varga to a draw at StubHub Center <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2016-06">last June</TIMEX3> in what was the <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3> Fight of the Year. Then there’s Gervonta Davis, the kid from Baltimore who dethroned Jose Pedraza <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2017-01" mod="START">earlier this month</TIMEX3>. 
 
The only division on the same level is the 126-pound featherweight division, with Carl Frampton, Leo Santa Cruz, Oscar Valdez, Abner Mares and Lee Selby, among others. But several of those fellows will inevitably move up to 130, creating more permutations. 
 
In the lead-in fight, Takashi Miura of Japan illustrated how stout Vargas is. The man who lost his 130-pound championship to Vargas in <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2015-11">November of 2015</TIMEX3> took consistent punishment from Miguel Roman, but kept moving forward until he had decked Roman three times and finished him in the 12th round. 
 
Miura, a southpaw who apparently has no nerve endings or anything resembling a pitch count, kept stalking Roman no matter how many fists he got in return. In the seventh round, Roman even knocked out Miura’s mouthpiece. But a wicked left to the body sent Roman to the floor in the 9th round, and from there it was just a survival game. 
 
Miura thus raised his record to 31-3-2. He had only fought one round since he and Vargas staged the Fight of the Year <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2015">two years ago</TIMEX3>, in which Miura nearly closed Vargas’ eye and had the doctors wondering if the fight should be stopped. Then Vargas put that aside and knocked out Miura in Round 9. 
 
Maybe we’ll see Miura-Berchelt, or Lomachenko-Salido, or Vargas against somebody a little less dangerous before he returns to championship mode. With his face an angry cherry pie, Vargas stood on the turnbuckle and waved goodbye. He’ll be back, but the non-junior, non-lightweights won’t waste time waiting.
