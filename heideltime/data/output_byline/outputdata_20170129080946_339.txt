Thought it builds its world impressively, this totalitarian yarn might not have the wide appeal of the big young adult franchises This British/Hungarian co-production unfolds in the kind of near-future dystopian society that is so popular in young adult movies. But with a modest budget and a younger protagonist – Djata (Lorenzo Allchurch) is a child whose father has been imprisoned for some undisclosed act of rebellion – this might not have the same appeal to audiences as movies such as The Hunger Games. Still, it’s an impressively realised world; the "Homeland" is an agrarian totalitarian state in which any form of dissent is quashed by jackboot justice.
