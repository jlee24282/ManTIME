PITTSBURG, Kan. — Emily Presley couldn’t have asked for a better start to her sophomore campaign. 
 
<TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P1W">A week</TIMEX3> after rewriting the Missouri Southern pole vaulting record books, Presley was back at it again on <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TAF">Saturday afternoon</TIMEX3> inside Pittsburg State’s Plaster Center. 
 
Presley, of St. Clair, Missouri, cleared 14-feet to win the women’s pole vault event at the Pittsburg State Invitational, breaking her previously-set record of 13-7.25 at last week’s MSSU Invite. 
 
“Obviously it is a pretty impressive jump,” Lions coach Bryan Schiding said. “She was trying to be consistent from <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-W03">last week</TIMEX3>. Her goal was to top what she jumped <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-W03">last week</TIMEX3> by maybe a little more. Five inches in the pole vault is a lot more; we were hoping for a little bit. And she had some good attempts at 14-2 as well. 
 
“At that time she would be tied for sixth in the Division I rankings. She’s established herself as a pretty solid pole vaulter.” 
 
Presley, who won last spring’s outdoor national championship as a freshman, entered the competition at the 12-05 mark where two competitors remained. Central Missouri’s Brittany Kallenberger cleared 12-10.75 to finish second and Oral Roberts’ Tiffany Richeson took third with a jump of 12-02.75. 
 
Missouri Southern freshman Mylene Loridan, who ranked 14th nationally prior to the event, no-heighted, failing to clear the first mark of 11-07. Pittsburg State’s Megan Wickersham also did not clear the opening height. 
 
MSSU freshman Samantha Donnell set a provisional mark of 11-10.75 to win the open division of the pole vault. 
 
MSSU WOMEN BREAK MEDLEY MARK 
 
A Missouri Southern relay team of Morgan Smith, Destiny Akannam, Kristen Koch and Allie Heckemeyer broke the 4X400 school record with a time of 3:56.78. 
 
“None of the four ran on the relay <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3>,” Schiding said. “In the second race, that’s pretty neat for them.” 
 
The Lions finished ninth of 34 teams in the event. Pittsburg State’s ‘A’ team of Rhema Taylor, Emilyn Dearman, Olivia Boone and Courtney Nelson finished third with a provisional time of 3:49.18. 
 
KIPROP beats own record 
 
In his first action since winning the cross country national championship in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2016-11">November</TIMEX3>, Vincent Kiprop kicked off his indoor season with a first-place finish. 
 
Kiprop, a sophomore from Kenya, won the 3K event with a time of 8:17.53, besting his school record by nearly six-tenths of <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="PT1S">a second</TIMEX3>. Junior Tyler Rush finished eighth. 
 
“The guys side showed more spark <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017-W04">this week</TIMEX3>,” Schiding said. “Vincent ran solid. And Tyler ran 8:38, not a bad opening time.” 
 
BURNS IN ACTION 
 
Bryan Burns saw his first action of the indoor season, as he was the shot put runner-up with a provisional heave of 57-06.5. 
 
A junior from Carthage, Burns finished behind Central Missouri’s Jacob Mahin, who had a series best 57-07.5. 
 
The mark, along with a fourth-place weight throw of 58-10.75, were personal bests for Burns. 
 
“This was the first time he threw this season, coming off a solid preseason,” Schiding said. “It was a good opener for sure against some really good competition.” 
 
After a first-place finish in the weight throw <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2017-W03">last week</TIMEX3> in his Lion debut, Missouri Southern’s Junior Joseph took ninth with a series best toss of 55-05. Joseph, a native of Wichita, Kansas, and junior transfer from Hutchinson Community College, threw it 60-7.75 <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2017-W03">last week</TIMEX3>. 
 
<TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2017-W05-WE">Next weekend</TIMEX3> the Lions will take smaller groups to the Central Missouri Mule Relays in Warrensburg. 
 
The women compete on <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3> and the men on <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>.
