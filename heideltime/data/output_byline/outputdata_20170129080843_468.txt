 Operating losses for the seventh consecutive year to near-break-even   
EMBARGOED UNTIL SUNDAY, 1/29 AT NOON 
 
The Detroit Regional Convention Facility Authority narrowed its operational loss for the seventh consecutive year in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3> after paying down $13.5 million in taxable bonds, a move it says will save taxpayers about $11.7 million over the life of the bond issue or $7.75 million in present value dollars. 
 
The early payment represented more than half of the  higher-interest $23.5 million taxable bond issue owed on the original $295.35 million in bonds taken out in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2014-11">November 2014</TIMEX3>, said Patrick Bero, CEO and COO of the authority, which has operational oversight for Detroit’s Cobo Center. 
 
It was made in addition to a scheduled principal payment of just over $7 million paid <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2016-10">last October</TIMEX3>. 
 
<TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2018">Next year</TIMEX3>, the authority plans to pay off the remainder of the taxable bond issue and then dip into the tax-exempt debt owed, Bero said. 
 
The early payment leaves the authority owing a total of just under $274.8 million, Bero said, due at various points between <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2039">2039</TIMEX3>. 
 
The authority continued to operate at a loss <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3> but narrowed its deficit to $280,166 earnings before interest, depreciation and amortization, net of debt and operating subsidies. 
 
The authority and Cobo management company SNG have narrowed the losses for seven consecutive years since taking on oversight of the convention center. 
 
In <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3> it posted a $2.7 million loss and $3.4 million loss the year before. 
 
The city was losing an estimated $21 million year on Cobo Center, the authority said, when it took over control in <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2009-09">September 2009</TIMEX3> under an agreement between the Michigan State Legislature, the City of Detroit, and Wayne, Oakland and Macomb counties. 
 
Bero said the authority is approaching a break-even point operationally, <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DURATION" value="P7Y" mod="LESS_THAN">nearly seven years</TIMEX3> before the <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2023">2023</TIMEX3> deadline the state legislature set as <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2016">the last year</TIMEX3> it will receive subsidies to help fund Cobo’s operation.  He credits the <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> renovation and subsequent increase in bookings with helping the events venue turn things around. 
 
The authority completed a $279 million renovation and upgrade to Cobo Center on time and within budget in <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2015-08">August 2015</TIMEX3>. Among other things, the upgrades created a 30,000-square-foot atrium with views of the Detroit River and Canada,  increased parking and improved traffic flow, upgraded infrastructure, enclosed loading docks and redeveloped the former Cobo Arena as a 40,000-square-foot grand ballroom. 
 
Additionally, the authority said a $2 million technology upgrade was completed in <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2016-12" mod="MID">mid-December</TIMEX3> to allow 32,000 simultaneous users on Cobo’s Wi-Fi network. 
 
In <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3>, the event center hosted 16 city-wide conventions, including the annual North American International Auto Show. 
 
Cobo lays claim to being the 17th largest convention center in the country with 723,000 square feet of exhibition space and nearly 1.5 million visitors <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="SET" value="P1Y" quant="EACH">each year</TIMEX3>.
