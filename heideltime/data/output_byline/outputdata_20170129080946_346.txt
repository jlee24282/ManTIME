 Dog llistening to music Michale Sevy / Moment /   
Putting together a playlist for your pup? New research could help you fetch some of Fido's favorite tunes. 
 
In a  <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> study  by the University of Glasgow and the Scottish SPCA, researchers found that dogs in kennels were less stressed when they listened to music – especially reggae and soft rock. 
 
"Overall, the response to different genres was mixed, highlighting the possibility that like humans, our canine friends have their own individual music preferences," said Neil Evans, one of the study's authors.
