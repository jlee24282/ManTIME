Afterglow of the post-inaugural Women's <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-03">March</TIMEX3> on Washington <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-W03-WE">last weekend</TIMEX3> endures in memorabilia acquired by participants, who vow to fight to sustain and obtain various rights.

Presumably, many will keep politicians' feet to the fire in realms of work, reproduction, climate, and racial, religious and ethnic protections, and so on. They will contact legislators and the president, write letters to the editor and blog.

Most must know that if the fervor of the event in D.C., replicated around the world, does not translate into action, it will simply become a memory of solidarity without lasting solidity.

So <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3> is not too soon to think beyond badgering leaders, to the steps required to become one. To run for office. This country is way behind some others in gender parity where the power resides.

"It's time to get serious about addressing why 51 percent of the population has less than a fifth of the representation in Washington, DC," wrote Steven Hill in his piece, Why Does the US Still Have So Few Women in Office, for The Nation in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2014">2014</TIMEX3>. "The future of the nation is at stake."

Hill reported that America ranked 98th in the world for percentage of women in its national legislature, down from 59th in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="1998">1998</TIMEX3>. Compare the U.S. at less than 20 percent to Sweden, for example, with 45 percent presentation on the national level.

Quotas and "multi-seat districts" are elements of those successes. Those concepts are too complex for explanation here; still, our woeful record begs review of our processes including the burdensome Electoral College established in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="1787">1787</TIMEX3> as part of the Constitution.

That said, the prime impediment to the election of women may not be discrimination by men, as some would say, or our system, but the fact that women do not get involved in the same numbers.

<TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Today</TIMEX3> is not too soon for women charged up with the momentum of an historic march to look toward next elections.

There are resources. The state of Massachusetts has a website detailing preparation for candidacy - the number of signatures on nomination papers, for instance, the filing deadlines - and there are organizations that champion women.

Emily's List recruits and helps elect pro-choice Democratic women candidates. There are names on its website of those it claims to have helped to attain office, including Massachusetts women.

These include Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Reps. Katherine Clark and Niki Tsongas, and several on the local level. Every election cycle, Emily's List recruits women interested in running for the first time. You can sign up online for trainings.

The National Federation of Republican Women recruits and trains GOP candidates. Judy Weis, president from <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="1941">1941</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="1942">1942</TIMEX3>, won election to the U.S. House from New York in <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="195" mod="END">the late 1950s</TIMEX3>, and there are other successes noted.

The death of actress Mary Tyler Moore <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2017-W03">last week</TIMEX3> and reruns of her sitcom - a mythical news workplace of <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="197">the 1970s</TIMEX3> - were reminder on the heels of the women's march of how far women have come since days when the words "single" and "pill" were each taboo and, used together, outright inflammatory.

But there's a long way to go - and the most promising route to ultimate power is as a candidate for election.
