Paul Bobrowski heard a business student at the University of Northern Colorado describe the Monfort College of Business as “the hidden gem of business schools.” 
 
He agrees, and that’s why he decided to continue his <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DURATION" value="P32Y">32-year</TIMEX3> career in academia as dean for UNC’s business college. 
 
Bobrowski started at Monfort College on <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2016-08-01">Aug. 1</TIMEX3>, marking fall semester his first one in the books at UNC. He started his second semester <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-01-09">Jan. 9</TIMEX3>, where he oversees about 1,000 business undergrads as well as a staff of about 40. 
 
Bobrowski has an extensive educational background, earning his bachelor’s degree in aeronautical engineering from the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, his master’s in management from Purdue University, and he holds a doctorate in operations management from Indiana University. 
 
Prior to UNC, he served as dean of the School of Business Administration at the University of Dayton for <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P4Y">four years</TIMEX3> — the largest private business school in Ohio. He also had a <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P6Y">six-year</TIMEX3> stint as dean of the College of Business at Auburn University and was at Syracuse University for <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="P14Y">14 years</TIMEX3>, where he was director of the Executive MBA program at Syracuse University and served as associate dean. 
 
But wait — there’s more. Before all of that, Bobrowski was a business instructor at Indiana University and assistant professor at the University of Oregon. His professional business experience stems from <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P9Y">the nine years</TIMEX3> he worked with companies while in the Air Force — he reached the rank of captain. 
 
That’s all probably how he landed a gig at UNC. 
 
The Tribune <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> sat down with Bobrowski to discuss how he ended up at UNC and the plans he has for the Monfort College of Business during his tenure. 
 
QUESTION — What brought you to UNC? 
 
ANSWER — First off, my deanship was ending at the University of Dayton. The university here contacted me and asked me if I wanted to apply. I’ve been to Colorado many times, obviously, and I was familiar with UNC from the fact they had won the (Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award) <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="PXY">several years</TIMEX3> back. I thought the school offered some opportunities, especially in a vibrant economic area of Colorado. You’ve got a population rate that’s increasing. You’ve got the cluster of the state that lives between Colorado Springs and Fort Collins — we’re not too far east from Interstate 25. So you have some natural advantages for recruiting students and for keeping close to your alumni. You also have some great advantages in terms of attracting faculty to come here. Those are all big advantages that I think play well at this particular time in this particular college. 
 
Q — What is something that is appealing to you about the Monfort College of Business? 
 
A — From my standpoint, the reason business schools exist is because of the students. I know the Monfort College as well as UNC as a whole really shows a caring for their students. You’re not dealing with a 50,000 or 60,000-student university. Students have names. Students are essentially hooked to the faculty in ways that make them build a relationship that not only lasts <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="P4Y">the four years</TIMEX3> here, but goes on beyond that time. So when a student is <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION" value="P3Y">three</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="P5Y">five years</TIMEX3> out of school here and decides to go to graduate school, I don’t think they have a problem calling faculty members to get a recommendations. That’s a very positive thing in my book, in terms of how much a university cares about its students and the graduates it produces. 
 
Q — What direction do you want to take UNC’s business school? 
 
A — You have to focus on the things that make you different. For us, we have classrooms that are relatively small. So we have the ability to do a lot more in terms of practice with theory — in other words, utilizing the classroom and bringing in what some people call “live clients,” rather than looking at textbooks and cases out of textbooks. We’re the only business school in the state of Colorado to be affiliated with a Small Business Development Center that covers the majority of eastern Colorado. Before you can solve a real problem, you have to know what it is, and that’s what students can learn through “live clients.” (The university) can be doing more of this because of who we are. 
 
When you start talking about things to change, one of the key elements is to get faculty and staff to start thinking about what they do that’s different, and what they can do more of. We’re in the strategic planning process that will lead to some new initiatives. (The process) will give us some new ideas about what to emphasize, to differentiate the Monfort College from other business colleges in the state, and even around the country.
