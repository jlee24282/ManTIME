From hitting his first 3-point attempt to converting two alley-oop lay-ins to thriving at the line, Branson Combs had a career night on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> against arch-rival Mater Dei at the Kent Athletic Center. 
 
Combs finished 9-for-14 from the floor, including 4-for-6 from 3-point range, and was 8-for-10 from the line in scoring a career-high 30 points in Memorial’s 79-65 victory. 
 
“My first shot was a 3,” said Combs, a 6-foot-2 sophomore guard. “On the alley-oops, I got good passes from my teammates and we set some really good screens. When the first (three) went in, I got into a rhythm. I think I had a little more confidence than I normally would.” 
 
Michael Lindauer hit Combs on a backdoor alley-oop to boost the Tigers’ lead to 41-20 with 3:23 left in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-H1">the first half</TIMEX3>. On nearly an identical play, Logan Douglas found Combs for a backdoor alley-oop, to increase their margin to 46-23 with 2:02 showing. 
 
Dylan Penn complemented Combs with 24 points, going 10-for-12 from the stripe in a game plagued by fouls. After a tough 55-52 loss at Princeton on <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3>, the Tigers rebounded nicely, improving to 9-7 overall and 1-3 in the Southern Indiana Athletic Conference. 
 
“Princeton is a very good basketball team,” said Memorial coach Rick Wilgus. “Everybody looks at their record (7-10) and think Memorial laid an egg. They’re a good team. We were down eight and had a chance to win. We carried that over into <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29TNI">tonight</TIMEX3> against a good Mater Dei team. They compete. They keep coming at you.” 
 
Sam Fulton scored 19 points and had six rebounds for Mater Dei (8-8, 0-4). 
 
Combs’ 3-pointer from the right wing and two free throws began a 14-1 surge that boosted the Tigers’ advantage to 27-13 with 7:34 left in the second period. Memorial appeared on the verge of a blowout win, but the Wildcats doggedly hung in there. Jules Weinzapfel hit a pair of foul shots to narrow the margin to 73-59 with 1:51 remaining in the game, but they could never close within single digits. 
 
“They’ve got a nice team,” Mater Dei coach Kurt Wildeman said of Memorial. “They played well and shot it. We let it get away (late in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-Q1">the first quarter</TIMEX3>).” 
 
The Tigers finished 22-for-39 from the field, a 56.4 percentage, and were 28-for-38 from the line. 
 
“We kept battling,” Wildeman said. “<TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2016-H2">The second half</TIMEX3> was all right. We played hard all the way. We have to work hard in practice to get better.” 
 
Combs had 22 of his game-high point total in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-H1">the first half</TIMEX3>. 
 
“Branson plays hard,” Wilgus said. “He’s fun to watch when he’s fundamental. This was a good win. I ask the guys: How good do you really want to be? We made a couple of steps forward <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29TNI">tonight</TIMEX3>.” 
 
Wildeman said he knew that Combs was a nice player entering the game. 
 
“They have a lot of guys who can beat you,” he said. 
 
At the other end, Memorial’s defense forced the Wildcats into 20 turnovers.
