MOSCOW (Sputnik) – On <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-01-25">Wednesday</TIMEX3>, French prosecutors opened a probe into Fillon's wife who in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="1998">1998</TIMEX3>-<TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2002">2002</TIMEX3> was allegedly paid between 6,900 and 7,900 euros (up to $8,500) for working as her husband's parliamentary aide and in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2012">2012</TIMEX3>-<TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2013">2013</TIMEX3> received 5,000 euros as a <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="SET" value="XXXX-XX">monthly</TIMEX3> salary at prestigious cultural magazine La Revue des Deux Mondes, owned by Fillon's friend Marc Ladreit de Lacharriere. 
"A total of 500,000 euros [$535,000] were transferred for this position. The sum would seem exaggerated, since you have repeatedly said in different interviews that you have never been engaged in your husband's political life. This is an issue of ethics and morality: if you have never performed the duties of the parliamentary aide, we ask you to return these 500,000 euros to the National Assembly and thus to us, the French people," the petition said. 
 
The author of the petition, which gathered 100,000 signatures in the first <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="P1D">24 hours</TIMEX3>, is Christophe Grebert, a member of the Puteaux City Council. 
 
Far-right presidential candidate Marine Le Pen said the scandal surrounding Fillon and his wife was a matter of trust between him and French people.
