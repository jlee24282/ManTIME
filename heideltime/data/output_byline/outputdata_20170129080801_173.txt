The latest outburst of fighting with pro-Russia forces has claimed the lives of two Ukrainian servicemen in the country's volatile eastern area.

Ukrainian military spokesman Oleksandr Motuzyanyk said the soldiers were killed on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3> amid renewed clashes along the frontline with the territory held by the pro-Russians.

The deaths were the first Ukrainian losses for <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P2W" mod="LESS_THAN">nearly two weeks</TIMEX3>.

Meanwhile, monitors from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) confirmed an upsurge of violence around the city of Lugansk, the administrative center of a region with the same name, <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="P2W" mod="MORE_THAN">over the past two weeks</TIMEX3>.

The monitors further said that they were "saddened to see how little had changed" since <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2016-12">December 2016</TIMEX3>, when the warring sides to the Ukraine conflict agreed to an "indefinite" ceasefire.

"We have confirmed at least five civilian fatalities compared to 19 for all of <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3>," said Alexander Hug, the OSCE deputy mission head.

Ukraine's Donbass region - the self-proclaimed republics of Donetsk and Lugansk - has witnessed deadly clashes between pro-Russia forces and the Ukrainian army since in <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2014-04">April 2014</TIMEX3>, when Kiev launched military operations to crush pro-Moscow protests there. 

The crisis has left almost 10,000 people dead on both sides.

The conflict in eastern Ukraine and the <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2014-03">March 2014</TIMEX3> reintegration of the Black Sea Crimean Peninsula into the Russian Federation have pushed relations between Moscow and the West to their lowest level since the Cold War as the latter supports Kiev.
