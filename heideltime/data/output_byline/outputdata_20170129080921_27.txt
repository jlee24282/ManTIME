MUMBAI : Director Rahul Dholakia says Aamir Khan’s superhit “Dangal” is on the top of his watch list films and will catch it up whenever gets time. 
His Shah Rukh Khan starrer “Raees” saw a big box office clash with Hrithik Roshan’s “Kaabil” on <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-25">January 25</TIMEX3> with both films garnering positive response from the audience. 
When asked Rahul if he will see “Kaabil”, Rahul told PTI in an exclusive interview, “Where is the time to see the film? I am busy with ‘Raees’. Whatever little time I have I will see ‘Raees’ in theatres to understand the reaction of audience. I have not enjoyed that bit.” 
“I have not seen ‘Dangal’ forget about ‘Kaabil’. So, I will first catch up ‘Dangal’ and then if I get time will see other film (referring to ‘Kaabil’).” 
The “Parzania” helmer wasn’t perplexed about the clash with “Kaabil”. 
“For me it was like I want to make a film the way I want to. I have to be honest and loyal to my job. Also the release date is not in my hands. I was not looking at at it (referring to clash). It doesn’t matter who competes with which film.” 
In terms of box office numbers, “Raees” is ahead with Rs 59.83 crore collection, while “Kaabil” stands at Rs 38.87 crore in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P3D">three days</TIMEX3>. 
“I am not too much into numbers. I don’t understand it. But I do believe the numbers are phenomenal. My producers are happy and so even I am happy. <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P2D">Two days</TIMEX3> back I was at Gaiety Cinema (in Mumbai) watching the last show, I saw people were waiting till the end of the film. People were going crazy, they were whistling, dancing.” 
Not only the audience but even B-town celebrities have liked “Raees”. 
“Lot of people from industry are saying good things about the film like Twinkle Khanna, Amitabh Bachchan and others. It feels great when people come and praise your film,” Rahul says. (AGENCIES)
