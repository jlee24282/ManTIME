Max Angelelli, who has decided the 55th Rolex 24 Hours at Daytona will be his last race in the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship, is leading by <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="PT75S">75 seconds</TIMEX3> as the rain falls harder and the temperatures barely stay over 50degF.  Prototype  
Prototype lap times have climbed to the 2min mark as the track gets wetter, and causes huge problems for cars trying to get new tires up to temperature. 
 
Angelelli’s closest opponent is Rene Rast in the Multimatic Riley, who is another 80sec ahead of Christian Fittipaldi in the lead Action Express Cadillac. A lap down on this pair is Scott Sharp in the ESM Nissan #2, with Eric Curran five laps down in the second AXR Cadillac. 
 GT Le Mans  
Patrick Pilet and Kevin Estre have the Porsches running 1-2, with apparently superior traction than the Fords in these treacherous conditions. 
 
Joey Hand and Harry Tincknell have the #66 and #69 Fords in third and fourth, 12 and 27sec behind the Porsches respectively. Toni Vilander is fifth in the Risi Competizione Ferrari , ahead of Billy Johnson’s #68 Ford, and the #3 Corvette <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> driven by Antonio Garcia. 
 
It has not been plain sailing for the Fords, as Briscoe had a major off in the #67 Ford and had to be taken behind the wall for repairs. 
 GT Daytona  
Jeff Segal has the Michael Shank Racing Acura NSX in the lead, 25sec ahead of Adam Christodoulou in the Riley Motorsports Mercedes AMG GT3, which in turn has a 40sec lead over Connor De Phillippi in the Land Motorsport Audi R8. 
 
Fourth in class is Katherine Legge in the second Acura, 16sec behind De Phillippi, and fifth is Mirko Bortolottin in the lead Lamborghini Huracan. 
 
In Prototype Challenge , Patricio O’Ward’s Peformance Tech Motorsports entry is four laps ahead of Gustavo Yacaman’s BAR1 car.
