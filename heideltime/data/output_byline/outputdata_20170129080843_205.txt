Los Angeles - What's an All-Star Weekend without a little bit of the P.K. Subban show? After <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TNI">Saturday night</TIMEX3>'s Skills Competition, Subban took over reporting duties for the LA Kings team site and threw some questions at defenseman Doughty, who was a good sport about the entire thing.

Towards the end, Subban asks Doughty what the plans are for hanging out later, to which Doughty is very non-committal. Also, if you listen carefully, you'll catch Subban asking "was that ok?" as he hands off the microphone.
