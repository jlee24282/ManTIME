LONGVIEW, Texas (LC) - In their second-best shooting performance of the season, the Louisiana College women scored a season-high 92 points in route to a 92-78 victory over LeTourneau, <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="TIME" value="2017-01-26TAF">Thursday afternoon</TIMEX3> in Longview. With the win the Wildcats improve to 5-6 in conference play, just one game behind the Yellowjackets in the loss column, and facing LeTourneau again in their next game on <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-26">Thursday</TIMEX3> in Pineville. 
 
Things started off quickly in the game as LeTourneau's Crystal Jones and LC's Kourtney McGhee traded 3-pointers to start the game. The Wildcats took the lead after that on back-to-back buckets from Kristen Breaux. The teams traded baskets through much of <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-Q1">the quarter</TIMEX3>, neither team taking control of the game, leading to a 16-16 tie at the end of the first. Neither team scored in the final 2:22 of <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-Q1">the first quarter</TIMEX3>, the last basket, a layup from RyDeja McQuarn, the second of her six made field goals of the game. 
 
The slow ending to <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-Q1">the first quarter</TIMEX3> was quickly erased as the teams came out hot in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2016-Q2">the second quarter</TIMEX3>, combining for 50 points total, and the Wildcats would hold a 42-40 lead at the break. The scoring outburst was thanks in large part to excellent shooting from behind the arc. The Wildcats went 3-of-5 from distance and the Yellowjackets made 4-of-6 attempts from downtown in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2016-Q3">the third quarter</TIMEX3> alone. 
 
The slim halftime lead for the Wildcats quickly turned into a comfortable advantage as LC converted on their first four field goal attempts to start <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2018-H2">the second half</TIMEX3>, taking a 51-42 lead <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="PT2M" mod="LESS_THAN">less than two minutes</TIMEX3> into <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2018-Q3">the third quarter</TIMEX3>. LC continued to stretch their lead the rest of <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2018-Q3">the quarter</TIMEX3>, outscoring LeTourneau 18-10 over the final 5:29 of the period, taking a 72-57 lead into the fourth. 
 
LC maintained their lead through <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2016-Q4">the fourth quarter</TIMEX3>, thanks to good enough free throw shooting, making 10-of-18 from the line in the final quarter to help seal the victory. The Wildcats shot their second-best field goal percentage of the season in the game at 43.4% for the afternoon, it was also the team's best 3-point shooting game of the season, going 7-of-13 from distance for 53.8%. 
 
Head Coach Patrece Carter said after the game, "Letourneau is a scoring machine, and it took <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION" value="PT40M">40 minutes</TIMEX3> of defensive pressure and us hitting big shots to get this win! <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29TNI">Tonight</TIMEX3>, I finally saw the entire roster play as a team for <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DURATION" value="PT40M">40 minutes</TIMEX3> with no breaks, and that is what we have to have every game from here on out to stay in playoff contention." 
 
The Wildcats saw five players go for double figures in the game, led by sophomore RyDeja McQuarn and her season-high 19 points. Brooke Jones came just a rebound shy of a double-double for the second time in three games with 17 points and nine rebounds. Karlee Teddlie had 14 points on 5-of-9 shooting, Rachel Johnson put together another solid outing with 13 points, and Kourtney McGhee finished with 10 points and seven rebounds.

West Fieldhouse <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2017-W04">this week</TIMEX3> for the start of a five-game home stand.
