Close wins are starting to become a specialty for the UAA men's basketball team. 
   
The Seawolves won their third straight game by four or fewer points <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> with a dramatic overtime victory over rival Seattle Pacific 83-81 in Seattle. 
   
The win marked the first time UAA has swept a regular season series against SPU since the <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="1989">1989</TIMEX3>-<TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="1990">90</TIMEX3> season. 
   
The Falcons forced overtime on a buzzer beating 3-pointer by Sharif Khan, and led by as many as four in overtime, but UAA's Diante Mitchell scored a go-ahead, old-fashioned 3-point play to put UAA up by two with <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="PT5S">five seconds</TIMEX3> remaining. SPU's Olivier-Paul Betu missed a finger-roll layup at the buzzer on the other end. 
   
"It was a very good win against a very good offensive team," UAA coach Rusty Osborne said by text. "Both Suki (Wiggs) and Diante made big plays at the end of overtime and that's what you expect from your seniors." 
   
The Seawolves (15-5, 9-3 Great Northwest Athletic Conference) hovered around a 10-point lead for most of the game, but the Falcons slowly chipped away at UAA's lead in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2016-H2">the second half</TIMEX3>. SPU (9-11, 5-7) took its first lead of the game with just under <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="PT4M">four minutes</TIMEX3> remaining on a pair of Khan free throw that made it 59-58. 
   
UAA regained the lead on a Connor Devine layup on the other end. The lead changed six times in the final <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="PT4M">four minutes</TIMEX3> of regulation. 
   
UAA took a three-point lead on a pair of Mitchell free throws with <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="PT7S">seven seconds</TIMEX3> remaining — he made four free throws in the final <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="PT30S">30 seconds</TIMEX3> — but SPU had a chance to tie the game, down 71-68. 
   
SPU's Coleman Wooten drove the baseline and dished the ball out to Khan, who sank a fadeaway 3 to send the game to overtime. 
   
"We did a great job defensively in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2017-H1">the first half</TIMEX3> but we made some mistakes in <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2016-H2">the second half</TIMEX3> that allowed them to get going," Osborne said. "We weighed whether to foul or not at the end of regulation, but decided to play it straight up. Credit to them for hitting a fadeway contested 3 by a young man shooting 27 percent for the season." 
   
The Falcons went up early in overtime when Wooten hit a trey in a 4-on-5 situation with Mitchell down on the court after taking a hard fall. But UAA stayed close and retook the lead for the final time on Mitchell's layup with 4.8 seconds to go. 
   
Wiggs scored a game-high 34 points on 13 of 27 shooting from the field. Mitchell racked up 16 points and went 8 of 8 from the line and Senior guard Spencer Svejcar added 15 points. 
   
Both teams endured foul trouble throughout the game. Devine and Svejcar played limited minutes in <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2016-H2">the second half</TIMEX3> for UAA and SPU's leading scorers — Tony Miller (29 points) and Wooten (14) — both fouled out. 
   
"I am proud that we were able to fight through some foul trouble," Osborne said. "Connor barely played in <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2016-H2">the second half</TIMEX3> and Spencer had to sit a long time in the second. But we had guys step up and help the team." 
   
With the win, UAA stays alone at second place in the GNAC standings. UAA hosts conference-leader Western Washington (17-3, 11-1) on <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2017-01-26">Thursday</TIMEX3> at the Alaska Airlines Center.
