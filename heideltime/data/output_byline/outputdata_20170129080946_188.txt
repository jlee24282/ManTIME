King County sheriff’s deputies shot and wounded a man <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="TIME" value="2017-01-27TNI">Friday night</TIMEX3> as they looked for a suspect in a deadly car prowl earlier in the week at a Sammamish park. 
 
Deputies went to an apartment in the 21600 block of 29th Avenue South in Des Moines where they believed the suspect was staying, the sheriff’s office said in a news release. Deputies were outside when a man and a 16-year-old boy walked out <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="TIME" value="2017-01-27T22:30" mod="APPROX">around 10:30 p.m. Friday</TIMEX3>. 
 
The man and the teen pulled out handguns when they saw the deputies, and three deputies opened fire, striking the man, the sheriff’s office said. The teen fled and dropped his handgun, the sheriff’s office said. 
 
After a search, deputies determined the teen was inside a nearby apartment. The teen was finally convinced to walk out of the apartment and was arrested just after 5 a.m. <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>. 
 
The wounded man was in critical condition <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle. 
 
Detectives have not said how or whether the 16-year-old from Kent was involved in the car prowl. 
 
The deputies involved in the shooting — all three are veteran officers — will be placed on paid administrative leave. 
 
The man killed <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2017-01-25">Wednesday</TIMEX3> at Beaver Lake Park in Sammamish was the son of a Seattle police officer. Authorities said Moises Elias Radcliffe, 22, was walking his dog with his girlfriend at the park when he saw someone who tried to break into his parked vehicle <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="TIME" value="2017-01-25T14:30" mod="APPROX">around 2:30 p.m.</TIMEX3> 
 
According to the King County Sheriff’s Office, Radcliffe ran and confronted the person. The prowler then jumped into a tan or gold SUV — not Radcliffe’s vehicle — and drove toward Rad­cliffe, who opened fire at the vehicle, authorities said. The SUV struck and killed Rad­cliffe, and the driver took off. 
  
Correction: 
 
Information in this article, originally published <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday, Jan. 28, 2017</TIMEX3>, was corrected later that day. A previous version of this story, and the headline accompanying it, incorrectly stated that the man wounded in the police shooting <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3> was a suspect in the deadly car prowl. Authorities said <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28" mod="END">later Saturday</TIMEX3> that he was not.
