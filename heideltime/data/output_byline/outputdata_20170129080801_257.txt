Pinewood slayed another giant <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> with a 66-54 victory over Salesian in the feature game of the Bentley Showcase at Bentley School in Lafayette. 
 
Salesian towered over the Panthers, especially at center where Pinewood had 5-foot-9 Klara Astrom guarding 6-5 Angel Jackson.  
 
Brianna Claros But Pinewood, with coach Doc Scheppler continually bellowing “give help in the post,’’ came out on top of that matchup with Astrom outscoring Jackson 15-5. 
“She’s playing the best of anyone on the team,’’ Scheppler said of Astrom. “She’s our most physical and tough player, our only player who wants to brawl. Everyone else on the team is a basketball player relying on skill.’’ 
 
Astrom had 13 of her points in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-H1">the first half</TIMEX3>, using her quickness to get loose and knock down three 3-pointers.  
 
Those 13 points early were crucial because that was the part of the game where Salesian had the advantage.  
 
Pinewood trailed 19-11 at the end of <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-Q1">the first quarter</TIMEX3> and after the Pride scored the first basket of <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2016-Q2">the second quarter</TIMEX3> Pinewood found itself trailing by 10. 
 
But then Salesian, which shot 7 of 11 in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-Q1">the first quarter</TIMEX3>, started to miss and Pinewood quickly capitalized to get back in the game. Astrom’s third 3-pointer of the half brought the Panthers within 23-22 and it was still a one-point deficit at the half, 29-28. 
 
Early on Salesian focused on trying to go inside to Jackson. But when that brought little success the Pride started to go elsewhere. 
 
“I just tried to keep pushing for position and boxing out and using my body to exploit her weaknesses,’’ Astrom said. “I tried to use my smaller size to get around her.’’ 
 
Pinewood completely took over in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2016-Q3">the third quarter</TIMEX3>, outscoring Salesian 18-5. The Panthers went on a 13-0 run to start <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2016-Q3">the quarter</TIMEX3>.  
 
Akayla Hackson hit a 3-pointer to get it started and was fouled. She missed the free throw, but Pinewood ran down the offensive rebound and Mikaela Topper nailed another 3. Instead of a four-point play, it was a six-point possession to start <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2018-Q3">the third quarter</TIMEX3>. 
 
Hackson made two foul shots, and then Brianna Claros hit a 3-pointer in transition as the gym erupted. Two free throws by Topper concluded the run with Pinewood up 41-29. 
 
All the momentum was on Pinewood’s side and Salesian (15-6) never recovered. Another 9-0 run extended a 44-34 lead to 53-34. 
 
Claros led Pinewood with 20 points. She made two 3-pointers, one 2-pointer on a drive, and went 12 of 14 at the foul line, 8 of 8 in <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2016-Q4">the fourth quarter</TIMEX3> when Salesian was reduced to fouling Pinewood’s primary ball-handler. 
 
Hannah Jump, Pinewood’s leading scorer on the season, had a hard time getting untracked. But she made two 3-pointers in <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2016-Q4">the fourth quarter</TIMEX3> to finish with 10 points. 
 
“Hannah was struggling, then she knocks down two 3s in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2018-H2">the second half</TIMEX3>,’’ Scheppler said. “When you’re the best shooter in California you keep shooting because you know the ball is going in.’’ 
 
Pinewood (17-2) returns to action <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2017-01-24">Tuesday</TIMEX3> at Eastside Prep. 
 
“I love my team,’’ Scheppler said. “These girls are going to fight and rise up to any challenge.’’
