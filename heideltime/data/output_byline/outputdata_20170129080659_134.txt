For all of the pain and struggle that are often associated with cancer, it was the common link for a vibrant community that gathered at Colorado Mesa University on <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> for the first Western Colorado Cancer Day. 
 
Nearly 300 people came to the event organized by the St. Mary’s Survivorship Program, which Coordinator Debra Hesse said was sparked by a patient survey <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3>. 
 
“Every speaker is based on what our patients are dealing with,” she said. 
 
Hesse was planning for 200 people to attend, and 294 people registered for the day. 
 
“That confirms people are wanting resources,” she said. “To be in a room with 300 people who get it is pretty powerful.” 
 
Keynote speaker Wendy  Reece spoke of her role as a caregiver for her daughter, Delaney Clements, who died in <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2016-03">March</TIMEX3> after living with cancer for <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="P5Y">five years</TIMEX3>. 
 
“Delaney always told me that living life to the fullest with cancer is a type of therapy, and I fully believe that,” she said. “When you think you’re doing it wrong, you’re not. In caregiving there is only love, and that’s never wrong.” 
 
Reece said she learned many lessons about how to be a good caregiver, and most of them centered on learning how to care for herself, too. 
 
“Being healthy and taking care of yourself does not take away from your ability to care for your loved one,” she said. 
 
Grand Junction resident Jody Turano, who was diagnosed with blood cancer <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2013">four years ago</TIMEX3>, said she came to learn more about the resources that are available. 
 
“Everything is in one place, so you don’t have to make a million phone calls finding those resources. They’ve done a wonderful job with it,” she said. 
 
“It’s always good to be around other people dealing with similar situations and to be able to network.”
