<TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01">This month</TIMEX3> the library is getting prepared for tax season. The AARP tax-aid program will be helping residents of Fowler and neighboring towns with their tax returns. The majority of people they help are with their basic tax form. They are holding their sessions on Mondays starting <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-02-06">Feb. 6</TIMEX3> and running until <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-04-10">April 10</TIMEX3>. They are doing it by appointment only. They will be able to answer many questions you might have about taxes and forms and what they can and cannot file for you. What’s great is that this service is done for free. You will need to bring with your driver’s license or ID, your Social Security card, and W-2 or any other items needed to file your taxes. The number to call to make your appointment, find out what you need to bring, and to answer your tax questions is (719) 649-9401.  

In other library news, we will be having our after school program on <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-02-02">Monday, Feb. 2</TIMEX3>, at <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="TIME" value="2017-02-02T15:45">3:45 p.m.</TIMEX3> This month’s topic is a little different than previous ones we have had. We are asking kids to bring in their science fair projects and present them to us. In other words the children will be the teachers and the librarians will be the students! We hope to learn a lot from the kids, and maybe get to do some experiments as well. If your child would like to bring the presentation ahead of time, we will find a place to put them. This will be one of the most fun programs to date, we think. The more the merrier, so if there are middle school students who would like to present, they are more than welcome to come. We know we are excited about this program, and we think the kids will be too.
