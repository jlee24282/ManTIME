Mr Brokenshire, who took the post <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2016-07">last July</TIMEX3>, said: "It is also clear the <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> focus is disproportionately on those who worked for the state - former members of the Armed Forces and the RUC."

He said the "vast majority" of police and the armed forces served "with great courage, professionalism and distinction".

He added: "We are in danger of seeing the past rewritten."
