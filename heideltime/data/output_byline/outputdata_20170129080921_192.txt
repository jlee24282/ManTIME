The long-awaited Knights have arrived in Lincoln and the process of transforming them from plain white to dazzling works of art is underway.

The Knights are the follow-up to the hugely successful Lincoln Barons' Charter Trail staged in the city <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3> to celebrate <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P800Y">800 years</TIMEX3> of Magna Carta.

The Lincoln Knights' Trail celebrates the 800th anniversary of the Battle of Lincoln, which has been described by academics as one of the most decisive in English history, and the sealing of the Charter of the Forest. <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017" mod="END">Later this year</TIMEX3> the decorated knights will be on display across Lincoln.

Most of the knights will be decorated behind closed doors but the public will be able to see some artists working their magic.

Owners of Daisy Made Ice Cream in Skellingthorpe Matt and Debbie Scarborough are thrilled to have received the sculpture they have sponsored and visitors will even be able to watch artist Mel Langton at work as they enjoy their cornets and coffee in the shop café.

Before work began Debbie and Matt's two-year-old son Charlie was very excited to meet the "big horsey" and even let horsey share some of his ice cream.

Debbie said: "<TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017">This year</TIMEX3> Daisy Made is celebrating its 25th birthday so we thought this was a great idea. We really enjoyed the Baron's Trail and wanted to be involved and also give something back as a thank you to everyone who has supported us over the years.

"We are really excited about this. When it is finished it will join the rest of the Knights in Lincoln to form the trail and as we are on the outskirts of Lincoln its great to make a connection between us and the city. "

The Daisy Made knight entitled Never Grow Up, will be decorated with bright colours, and include tree climbing and kite flying to reflect and celebrate the company ethos of enjoying a natural outdoor childhood. Visitors young and old also being asked to write some of their favourite childhood memories on a pinboard and there are already some interesting recollections. From Linda who used to collect frogs and kiss them believing they might turn to princes, Matt who built a raft which sunk on its maiden voyage to Carly who used to find ladybirds and feed them to her dog!

Artist Joanne Botterill ,37 has started work painting her knight in the full gaze of High Street shoppers as she is decorating her knight the shop window of Ruddocks. Joanne has a special connection with Ruddocks and her dream came true when her design was selected by the company.

"I had really set my heart on doing Ruddock's Knight. As a Lincolnshire artist Ruddocks has played a big part of my life. As a student I used to come here the buy materials but also I used to have life-drawing lessons upstairs here. " Joanne also moved to the other side of the easel posing as a life model for other students. <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> the shop has also become a favourite of her sons, " When we want a really special toy we come to Ruddocks and my son Eli loves art so he is really excited about coming to help me paint a little part of the knight one afternoon."

And in-keeping with Joanne's love of Ruddocks and art , her knight is called Paint, Print , Publish and Play

"Most people who come into the shop are also artists and art lovers so it's really nice to have to banter. I've done lots of different things but art is great because art makes people happy."
