<TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P2Y">Two years</TIMEX3> after the “Georgia Beer Jobs Bill” gave craft breweries in the state the opportunity to kind of, sort of, in a roundabout way, sell some beer to customers, a new bill introduced in the Georgia General Assembly may allow breweries to actually sell moderate amounts of beer directly to customers.  

 
Senate Bill 85, introduced <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3>, is billed as a compromise between the state’s brewers and wholesalers. Georgia has a strict three-tier system that separates producers, wholesalers and retailers.  
 
Under the bill, Georgia’s small breweries could offer direct sales by the glass on premises, and even sell up to a case – or case equivalent – worth of beer “to go” to individuals. Breweries would be limited to direct-selling 3,000 barrels of beer per year. 
 
Breweries in the state, including Newnan’s Abide Brewing, are hoping that the bill will pass. 
 
<TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Right now</TIMEX3>, Abide doesn’t bottle its beer, but the brewery is in the midst of a major expansion. “If the bill goes through, we will be pushing pretty hard to get into a package form,” said Evan Scanlan, one of the brewery’s three owners.  
 
Under the <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> scenario, breweries can sell tours – and give away servings of beer. With a standard tour, visitors get a souvenir glass and 36 ounces of beer, divided into six, six-ounce pours. State law allows tour packages to also include some to-go beer, in a sealed “growler” bottle, but Abide doesn’t offer that.  
 
According to co-owner Philip Leonard, the biggest advantage of the bill passing would be a greater potential for sales. It would allow Abide Brewery to sell directly to consumers, and would lift the mandate for all events to follow the pattern of the standard tour.  
 
“<TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Right now</TIMEX3>, we sell something, then the distributor sells it, then the retailer,” Leonard explained. “The passing of the law may allow us to recapture some of the profit.” This would, in turn, allow Abide to expand the business.  
 
Leonard added that the owners may even be able to host events at the brewery in which they could sell directly to the customers. Birthday parties, corporate retreats or meetings could be hosted at the brewery without the <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> restrictions.  
 
The brewery has 13 beers on tap, Scanlan said. There are five beers <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> on the market and available in local restaurants. The other eight spots are filled by various new brews. “We do a bunch of test batching, to see what the public likes. They kind of have input of what might be coming out next or what people are liking the most.”  
 
Abide may brew just one barrel of a test brew, and never make it again. 
 
The bill was introduced the day before “Georgia Beer Day,” which was <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>. Breweries all over the state, including Abide, held events and are working to advocate for passage of SB 85.  
 
In <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3>, the “Beer Jobs Bill” originally allowed direct sales, but by the time it passed, it was considerably pared down. In <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2017-SU">the summer</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2016-FA">fall of 2016</TIMEX3>, representatives from breweries and wholesalers met to work out a compromise, according to Travis Peterman of the Georgia Craft Brewers Guild.  
 
SB 85 was introduced by Sen. Rick Jeffares, R-McDonough, chairman of the Senate Regulated Industries and Utilities Committee. 
 
“With suggestions championed by both brewers and wholesalers, Lt. Governor Casey Cagle, Speaker of the House David Ralston, R-Blue Ridge, House Regulated Industries Committee Chairman Howard Maxwell, R-Dallas, and Senator Jeffares have provided guidance to create this legislation. Their commitment to supporting the small businesses of Georgia shines through in SB 85,” said Nancy Palmer, Executive Director of the Georgia Craft Brewers Guild. Palmer said the business leaders of Georgia Beer Wholesalers Association were also crucial in the process.  
 
Being able to have direct sales will make breweries more of an attraction or destination, and bring in tourism, Scanlan said. That’s what’s happening in North Carolina and other states. Scanlan said that breweries in North Carolina have seen tremendous growth.
