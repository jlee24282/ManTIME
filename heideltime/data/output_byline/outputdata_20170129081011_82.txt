Join the Goethe-Zentrum for their latest lecture in our “A Note on Opera” series as we look at “A German in Paris: Giacomo Meyerbeer and Grand Opéra.” 
Giacomo Meyerbeer, born Jakob Liebmann Beer in Berlin in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="1791">1791</TIMEX3>, was a Jewish expatriate who immigrated to France, eventually becoming the dominant musical presence in the French capital for much of the 19th-century. He developed the genre of grand opéra to its full scope, with its epic tone, sweeping historical narrative, huge casts, ballet, and special effects – including ice-skating on stage! 
 
His works have never completely gone into obscurity and are <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> slowly being revived. Regardless of how one finds this “Andrew Lloyd Webber” of French opera, his influence is palpable in works by later composers as diverse as Richard Wagner, Giuseppe Verdi, and Modest Mussorgsky. 
 
They’ll be looking at Meyerbeer’s life as a Jewish composer living in early 19th-century Germany and then his later life as the “Toast of Paris,” defining exactly what is grand opéra and how it evolved by examining bits of Meyerbeer’s “Les Huguenots” and “Le prophète.” Meyerbeer’s influence on other opera traditions will also be illustrated.
