NORTH ANDOVER — Led by the first-career hat trick for freshman Mikyla Grant-Mentis,  the Merrimack College women's ice hockey team registered its first- ever victory over Boston University <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TNI">Saturday night</TIMEX3>, topping the Terriers by a score of 4-1 at Lawler Rink. 
 
Merrimack improved to 9-17-3, 5-14-0 in Hockey East while Boston University dropped to 13-9-5, 8-8-4. 
 
Grant-Mentis woud open the game's scoring just <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="PT5M" mod="MORE_THAN">over five minutes</TIMEX3> into the first period to give Merrimack the early 1-0 lead. After a nice effort from sophomore linemate Annie Boeckers to dig the puck out of the corner, it would find Grant-Mentis in the slot who would fire a shot off the crossbar and in for her first of the game. 
 
The lone Terrier goal of the game would come with 5:31 remaining in the first period evening the score at 1-1 before the first intermission.  
 
Grant-Mentis is just the second Warrior in program history to record a hat trick. She <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> leads the team with 23 points on the season on eight goals and 15 assists, and has five goals and four assists in her last seven games. 
 
With the win, the Warriors move into eighth place and playoff contention in the Hockey East standings, as they lead Maine by one point. Merrimack hosts the Black Bears for two games <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-W05-WE">next weekend</TIMEX3>. 
 
Merrimack outshot BU 37-32.
