Tennis great Margaret Court expects Serena Williams to break her all-time record for grand slam singles titles sooner rather than later, but says she won't be losing much sleep over it.

Williams <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> sits just one big win behind Court, having broken her tie with Steffi Graf and claimed her 23rd grand slam title after <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TNI">Saturday night</TIMEX3>'s Australian Open final.

Court won 24 major titles in her <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P17Y">17-year</TIMEX3> career, 11 of them in the Open era. She won 64 grand slam titles in total, including doubles and mixed doubles.

"I think she will break the record, and I think she will break it soon," Court said.

"It's so much easier for players <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3> to do what they do. She hadn't played for <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P3M" mod="APPROX">about three months</TIMEX3> before coming here, and it easier to do these things.

"But she's playing very well, and records are made to be broken.

"People keep asking me, 'How do you feel about your record?' but I'm not going to lose any sleep over something like that.

"My life is very busy and full, and they'll never get my 64 so it's all right. I'll always have that."

Court, who played from <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="1959">1959</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="1975">1975</TIMEX3>, watched Williams beat her sister Venus 6-4, 6-4 in the final and was again struck by the resources, support and equipment that players have access to.

"There was television in <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="196" mod="START">the early '60s</TIMEX3> but no sponsorship and money, none of that. Even the racquets they get to use <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3> are so beautiful compared to what we used to have," she said.

"The facilities are so much better, they have massage people, they can bring psychologists with them as well as their trainers and coaches and whoever else they want to come along.

"It's a whole different era, so it's very hard to compare. I think back to our Aussie era where we had some of the greatest champions in the world and think, how did we ever do that?"

Court has not had the chance to talk extensively with Williams, chatting to her briefly during a presentation at the <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3> Hopman Cup.

"It's like Fort Knox with the players <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3>. They're so isolated and they're hard to talk to. It's not like when we played where everyone was like brother and sister, it's totally different.

"I thought it was a very interesting match that she played. I knew she was going to win but there was a lot of hitting up and down the court.

"We had so much more of an all-round game with the volleying. It's a totally different game <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3>, but she has a wonderful serve. That gets her out of a lot of trouble, but she played very well."
