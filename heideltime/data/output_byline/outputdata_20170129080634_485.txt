(0) Darren Way conceded that his Yeovil Town side were beaten by the better side as Doncaster Rovers cruised to a 3-0 win at Huish Park <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TAF">this afternoon</TIMEX3>.

The table topping visitors eased to victory as Mathieu Baudry put them in front before John Marquis scored a brace to cap off a clinical performance by the visitors.

Way said: "On another day, certainly in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-H1">the first half</TIMEX3> with one or two chances that we could've taken, we could've been looking at a different story, but overall we were beaten by the better team.

"As a manager I'm going to show the players support and make sure they learn from that experience. "Unfortunately <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">today</TIMEX3> we came up against a better team which have got a lot of quality. They've got three forwards that are going to score goals and they've spent large parts of their career scoring goals. Could we afford them? No, probably not, so I look forward to <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-01-24">Tuesday</TIMEX3> [against Plymouth Argyle]." The Glovers players were booed off both at half-time and full-time after a game that looked beyond them from the moment that Baudry opened the scoring.

Way added: "I've got to be honest, they want to see their team win and they want to see individuals making the right decisions at the right time and I have to accept that as a manager.

"That's why I've given the role and responsibility to manage the football club, but realistically I have to make sure I can sleep straight at night knowing what I'm working with and where we are as a football club. That was a big test <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">today</TIMEX3>."

Way remained coy when quizzed on whether he will be bolstering his squad before the transfer market shuts on <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-01-31">Tuesday</TIMEX3>.

He said: "We are working in that area and we'll have to wait and see what develops."
