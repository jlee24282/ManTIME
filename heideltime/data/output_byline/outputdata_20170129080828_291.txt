“Kasi naman wala akong pamilyang tunay. Wala akong asawa, walang magulang, walang lahat, ako lang lagi umuuwi mag-isa. Pagkatapos ng taping, uwi. Gigising sa umaga, magkakape mag-isa,” he further stated. 
 
[Because I have no real family. I have no wife, no parents, everything. I go home alone. After the taping, I go home. In the morning I wake up, drink coffee alone.]
