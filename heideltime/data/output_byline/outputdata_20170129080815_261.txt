SANAA -- Helicopter-born commandoes, believed to be Americans, launched a raid in southern Yemen at dawn on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3> that killed several people, including three al Qaeda suspects, residents told Reuters.

The gunbattle in the rural Yakla district of al-Bayda province killed a senior leader in Yemen's al Qaeda branch, Abdulraoof al-Dhahab, along with his two brothers.

"The operation began at dawn when a drone bombed the home of Abdulraoof al-Dhahab and then helicopters flew up and unloaded paratroopers at his house and killed everyone inside," one resident said, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
