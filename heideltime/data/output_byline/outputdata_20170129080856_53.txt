Drew Barrymore walks into the hotel room in Berlin flanked by assistants, caked in heavy TV make-up and wrapped in a brown fluffy jacket that makes her look like a very glamorous teddy bear. Within seconds, the entourage has disappeared, she’s wiped every last scrap of foundation from her face and she’s rummaging around underneath her dress, a kind of earth mother hippy smock, regretting her decision to wear tights on this sub-freezing day. “Why does anyone wear pantyhose?” she exclaims, barefaced, faux-exasperated, shifting in her armchair, trying to get comfortable. “They’re so fucking sadistic! They’re not even control pants,” she says, conspiratorially, “but I’m forcing them to be.” I was so much more brassy when I was younger. I’m like: ‘Where did you get those balls, kid?’ For a lot of women, especially women who grew up between <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="1982">1982</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="200" mod="START">the early 2000s</TIMEX3>, Barrymore is a particular kind of icon.

Plus, in her 20s, she seemed to hang out with the best bands, go to all the best parties and always looked like she was having the time of her life. She was the manic pixie dream girl before it became a tacky indie film stereotype. The memoir she wrote in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3> is, appropriately, called Wildflower. She looks genuinely pleased that she holds such a place in people’s minds, and decides that if people do like her, “If anyone has any goodwill towards me,” careful not to sound arrogant, it’s because she extends goodwill to other people. “Not in an annoying way, but just, like, being in people’s fucking corners.” It’s this combination of soft and sharp, all wrapped up in that valley girl lilt, that has carried her through life. “I want people to be happy, but I know happiness has to be fought for. It’s a warrior trophy. It’s not hippy,” she insists. “I’m like, fight. Fight to the death to be happy, and don’t kill anyone along the way.” We’re in Germany to talk... Read more
