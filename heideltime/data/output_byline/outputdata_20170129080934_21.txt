CONCORD — A House committee recommended a bill <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-W04">this week</TIMEX3> that would have the state once again contribute to retirement costs for teachers and first responders. 
 
The House Executive Departments and Administration Committee voted 10-9 to support House Bill 413 in a hearing at the Statehouse <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="TIME" value="2017-01-25TMO">Wednesday morning</TIMEX3>. The bill seeks to have the state pay 15 percent of contributions of the retirement system for teachers, police and firefighters. It will <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> go to the House floor for a vote. 
 
The state once contributed 35 percent to the retirement system for teachers and first responders, but the Legislature abolished the state’s contribution in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2011">2011</TIMEX3>, leaving towns and cities to pick up the cost. 
 
The bill’s main sponsor, Rep. Renny Cushing, D-Hampton, said the legislation is vital for municipalities, who each lost hundreds of thousands of dollars in aid from the state in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2011">2011</TIMEX3>. Hampton received between $600,000 and $700,000 for teachers’ and first responders’ retirement <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="SET" value="P1Y" quant="EACH">each year</TIMEX3> from the state before aid was cut in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2011">2011</TIMEX3>. Portsmouth received more than $1 million <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3> from the state in retirement contributions for teachers, police and fire. 
 
The state began paying 35 percent of the retirement system cost for police, firefighters and teachers in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="1977">1977</TIMEX3> when the Legislature and governor passed that fixed percentage into law. In <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2009">2009</TIMEX3>, the state lowered its commitment to 30 percent. Rep. Jackie Cilley, D-Barrington, was a state senator in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2009">2009</TIMEX3> and recalled Gov. John Lynch stating the decrease in contribution was meant to be temporary, as the state was struggling through the recession at the time. Cilley said the Legislature underwent massive turnover in <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2010">2010</TIMEX3> and Republicans wiped out the state’s contribution to the system <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2018">the next year</TIMEX3>. 
 
Cushing, along with other proponents of bringing back the state contribution, have said the state made a “promise” in <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="1977">1977</TIMEX3> to contribute to the system and lawmakers went back on that promise <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2011">six years ago</TIMEX3>. 
 
“The state had a role in supporting public education and public safety,” Cushing said. “It made a promise to communities it would partner and support retirement costs for teachers… police and fire.” 
 
Cushing said he proposed the state contribute 15 percent because he believes that would be more likely to pass than a request for the state to return to 35 percent. A cost analysis provided by the New Hampshire Retirement System states the bill would have the state contribution increase by $40.81 million in fiscal year <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2018">2018</TIMEX3>, and that number would increase slightly in the following <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DURATION" value="P3Y">three years</TIMEX3>. 
 
“It’s a claw back in its attempt to hold the state accountable,” Cushing said. 
 
One of the committee members who voted against recommending the bill, Rep. Steven Beaudoin, R-Rochester, said he understood local taxpayers would benefit from the state contributing to the system. However, he believes the state should not be funding pensions for any town or city employees and questioned whether tax dollars raised from small towns should be used to pay for employee pensions in larger cities. 
 
Beaudoin also was concerned about where the money would come from, saying adding $40 million per year to the state’s expenses is a “tough nut to crack.” 
 
Cushing said no funds specifically have been identified to pay for the contribution, but he believes it should be the state’s responsibility to pay that cost based on the Legislature’s intent in <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="1977">1977</TIMEX3> to help fund pensions. 
 
Cilley said the state demonstrated how much it valued reserving state dollars for the retirement system when it amended the state Constitution in <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="1984">1984</TIMEX3> to require money in the system solely be used for that purpose. At the time, she said, there was interest in raiding the funds for other uses. 
 
“If they want to do any one thing that will help the property taxpayers in this state, it’s to go back to the promise they made to pay their contribution,” Cilley said.
