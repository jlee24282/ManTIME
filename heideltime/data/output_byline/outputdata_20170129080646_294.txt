The drive towards a new points-based check system for taxi licensing in Derby is a "hindrance to the whole trade" and could result in a 31% increase in fares, according to a city car hire operator. 
 
Shahid Quayum is also chairman of Alpha – All Licensed Private Hire Association – which he said is seeing increasing numbers of taxi drivers joining because they are concerned for their future ability to earn a living. He added that many of them wanted to mount an official protest. 
 
Labour-led Derby City Council wants to introduce the new system, which would see powers taken away from councillors and put into the hands of council officers, using a points-based system based on previous convictions, from <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-06-30">June 30</TIMEX3>. 
 
It will cost almost £140,000 to pay for five additional staff to run the system, which is meant to be self-funding and intended to stop rogue taxi drivers operating in Derby.

According to officers, "any additional costs the council may incur in introducing some or all of the proposals, will need to be met by the trade". 
 
This has caused members of the council's licensing committee to question the new system and Mr Quayum said they are right to be concerned. 
 
He said: "Taxi drivers are having to work all hours <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> – sometimes up to 15 <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> to make a decent living. But the extra cost of increased fees because of a new system they do not want will be the final straw for many of them. 
 
"Others who do not want to pay the extra will go elsewhere to get licences, where there isn't a points-based system, ensuring that the council is powerless to stop rogue taxi drivers in Derby." 
 

 
There are 1,300 drivers licensed with the city council but estimates suggest that there are around 2,800 working in the area, not licensed in Derby. 
 
Mr Quayman said: "The legislation only says that a taxi driver has to be a 'fit and proper person' to hold a licence. Those two things can be checked using a DBS (disclosure and barring check) and a medical. 
 
"Two things will happen if this comes into force. One, taxi fares will go up from around £3.80 a mile to £5 and two, a possible 500 drivers will go elsewhere meaning that licence fees and fares could be even higher because the new system has been costed based on the <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> 1,300 licensed drivers."

One of the new posts would be £52,000 to pay for a lawyer because it was anticipated that the number of appeals against licence refusal would increase and have to go before magistrates to be defended. They said this had happened in Leicester, which has a similar system, leading to a 350% increase in appeals, according to council officers. 
 
The points system was developed following a damning report stating failings in Derby City Council's taxi licensing system . Expert auditors found that the authority's taxi licensing sub-committee had allowed licences for people with criminal records who had committed offences including "hate crime, harassment, intimidation and making improper comments to young women". 
 
In one instance, a taxi driver was granted a licence despite "publishing material threatening or intending to stir up religious/sexual hatred". In the new points-based system, criminal convictions for the most severe crimes including rape and murder will trigger an automatic lifetime disqualification. 
 

 
Other lesser crimes will accrue points on a sliding scale. Assault of a police officer, for example, would mean instant refusal for an applicant if it happened <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2013" mod="LESS_THAN">less than four years ago</TIMEX3>. But it would mean six points if committed <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2012">five years ago</TIMEX3>, then five points for <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2011">six years ago</TIMEX3>, four for <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2010">seven years ago</TIMEX3>, and so on. 
 
Any applicant or existing driver who gets "above 12 points" would be disqualified. An alternative change would have seen council officers operate committees similar to the ones <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> run by councillors.

Mr Quayum added: "We have polled our members and increasingly, it seems they want to take action and protest against the system. Many taxi drivers are very resentful but are suffering in silence." 
 
Tory councillor Mick Barker said: "It is <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> obvious that the extra costs, which will be passed on to the taxi trade, will raise serious concerns to drivers and operators alike and potentially cause them to register in cheaper authority areas - leaving Derby with limited control over taxi services." 
 
"We are in danger of pushing drivers too far in demanding extra exacting standards and extortionate fees which will lead them to seek registration elsewhere. That being the case, it undermines the ability of the city council to administer standards on both vehicles and drivers, which is to the detriment of our public that both we and the taxi trade serves."
