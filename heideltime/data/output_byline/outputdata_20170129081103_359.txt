New Delhi: The Election Commission (EC) on <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3> ordered the Goa police to file an FIR against Aam Aadmi Party Convener (AAP) and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal for violating the Model Code of Conduct with his comment about bribes, at an election rally held <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01" mod="START">earlier this month</TIMEX3> in Goa. 
 
The EC directed that necessary legal action should be initiated by filing an FIR against Kejriwal for the statements he made on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-01-08">January 8</TIMEX3> in Goa. It sought a compliance report regarding legal action on the Delhi Chief Minister latest by <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="TIME" value="2017-01-08T15:00">3 pm</TIMEX3> on <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-01-31">January 31</TIMEX3>. 
 
The Commission had earlier quoted him as saying at an election rally that Congress and BJP will come to distribute money. People should accept it in new currency and ask for Rs 10,000 instead of Rs 5,000 keeping in mind inflation. However, Kejriwal had said that the people should then vote for AAP. 
 
It said the AAP leader's statement amounts to "abetting and promoting electoral offence of bribery". 
 
It had said if Kejriwal fails to respond by <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017-01-19">January 19</TIMEX3> afternoon, the Commission will take a decision "without any further reference to you".
