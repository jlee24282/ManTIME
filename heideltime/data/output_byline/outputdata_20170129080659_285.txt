There is no one who loves this country more than I, or can claim to be more patriotic then I, and I am a liberal.

However, there is an even more important label for me â€” citizen. I walked with many citizens on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-22">Jan. 22</TIMEX3>, the women in Tulsa and the sons and fathers who love and support them, all who are just as patriotic and full of love for this country.
