The  Salvation Army Thrift Store formerly located at <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="1155">1155</TIMEX3> N. Fourth St. has moved into the old Harbert Lumber building at 240 North Ave. and is open for business. 
 
Customers can make purchases using cash or check while the internet is being installed, said Capt. Steve Staneart , commanding officer of the Grand Junction corps. 
 
Staneart said an arrangement with the Harbert family allowed the move, which may be permanent. 
 
“The Harbert family has been on our board for generations, and they were very kind to us to allow us to go in there for something we could afford,” he said. 
 
The Salvation Army is leasing the space for <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3>, with an option to buy the building if it’s a good fit. 
 
Staneart said the building has nearly double the space as the old thrift store, and includes a yard that will be useful since the organization just received a license to do after-school care for children. 
 
The organization will keep the former store building and plans on repurposing it for after-school programs offering arts, education, character development and sports. 
 
The Salvation Army also spruced up its Clifton store at 3227 I-70 Business Loop B, Staneart said. 
 
The stores are open from <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28T08:00">8 a.m.</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28T18:00">6 p.m.</TIMEX3>, <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2017-01-23">Monday</TIMEX3> through <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>.

■ Customers of the building materials supply company ProBuild , <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2773">2773</TIMEX3> Riverside Parkway, probably have noticed the new signage and new name of the operation, Builders FirstSource , as they whizzed by along the parkway. 
 
It’s not a new business — just the final step in an acquisition process that began in <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2015-07">July 2015</TIMEX3>. 
 
“We’re just <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> getting the signs changed,” an employee at the newly branded store said <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2017-W04">this week</TIMEX3>, adding that the store is the same as what people remember. 
 
At the time it was announced that Builders FirstSource was acquiring ProBuild, officials said the combined company would help better focus on their four critical customer segments: production builders, custom builders, multifamily/commercial builders, and repair and remodel businesses. The leverage of being a part of a national network — Builders FirstSource had 430 locations, and served 74 of the top 100 metropolitan statistical areas across 40 states at the time of the deal — is presumably a perk of the combination. 
 
If you’re wondering, Wikipedia via the United States Census Bureau says Grand Junction is the 279th statistically most populous metro are in the country, 
 
■ One end-of-the-year list that escaped our clutches until <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> was the Forbes ’ Ranking of America’s 100 Largest Banks, which included some notable local strength. 
 
Glacier Bancorp , parent to Bank of the San Juans , ranked high on the list, at number five. 
 
US Bancorp, or US Bank, was listed at number 58, and Wells Fargo ranked number 66, both respectable finishes on the list, which ranks banks based on metrics related to growth, profitability, capital adequacy and asset quality, Forbes said. 
 
All of the data Forbes relied on for the list is based on regulatory filings for the period ending <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2016-09-30">Sept. 30, 2016</TIMEX3>. 
 
The magazine’s ranking of the 100 largest banks was borne out of the financial crisis of <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="200" mod="END">the late 2000s</TIMEX3>, when credit quality was cratering across the banking industry.
