Following back-to-back wistful performances by New Kids On The Block , Eddie Money , Starship , and more at the iHeart80s Party, English singer-songwriter Rick Astley concluded the show with a performance of his greatest hits <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TNI">Saturday night</TIMEX3>. 
 
Astley kicked off his set with a classic rickroll , leading the fans at SAP Center to believe that he was going to open with " Never Gonna Give You Up ," but instead performed his Whenever You Need Somebody single " Together Forever ," before going into " Strong Strong Man ." In between performances, <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="198">the '80s</TIMEX3> icon, who turns 50 on <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-02-06">February 6</TIMEX3>, made self-deprecating jokes about his age and blamed it for his lack of dance numbers, and asked fans to do the two-stepping for him during " She Wants to Dance With Me ."

Following back-to-back performances of energized hits, Astley slowed things down with his single " Angels On My Side " off his <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="1991">1991</TIMEX3> album Free . Before he concluded his set with his world-conquering cut "Never Gonna Give You Up," he performed the first few verses a cappella to make sure fans were prepared to sing along.
