Polin Waterparks' proud partnership with Edsun Loisirs, a leisure park and outdoor recreation design firm, led to the development of the €12 million (US$13.5 million) facility that features an impressive 12 waterslides, including several of Polin's most-popular waterslides: the Kamikaze, Freefall, Turbo Lance and Looping Rocket. With a size of 60,000 square meters (196,850 square feet), O'Gliss waterpark also sets a record as the third-largest waterpark in France. 

An Oasis Next to an Oasis

Edged with dunes and pine woods, along with coastal mudflats and marshes that attract unusual birds, the beaches are considered an oasis for nature lovers.
