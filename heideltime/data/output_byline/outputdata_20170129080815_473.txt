DATEBOOK 
 
The Bay City News Service Datebook is a listing and description of news events scheduled to take place in the San Francisco Bay area. It is not distributed to the public and is for the exclusive planning purposes of our media, government and business subscribers. 
 
The types of events that typically appear on the Datebook are news conferences, visits by dignitaries, conventions, conferences, government meetings and court appearances. 
 
The Datebook comes out in three forms: 
 There is <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="P1W">a week</TIMEX3>-long version called Looking Ahead which alerts assignment editors to upcoming news conferences, public appearances, meetings, court actions and the like.  The Daily Datebook, which comes out each weekday afternoon with a list of events for <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017-01-30">the next day</TIMEX3>, is followed by a Segment II which carries items submitted too late for inclusion in the regular Datebook.  Segment II, which moves shortly after midnight, also includes a Court Calendar listing major cases docketed for that day. The Datebook includes telephone contact numbers and each listing is double-checked for accuracy.  
Datebook Advisories alert subscribers throughout the day to events that are scheduled on the spur of the moment, like a briefing during a disaster or a news conference about a developing news story.
