(Bloomberg) -- For Mark Carney, better won’t be good enough. 
 
The Bank of England governor, overseeing an economy recording solid expansion and accelerating inflation, will probably raise near term projections for both <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-W04">this week</TIMEX3>, according to economists. At the same time, he may highlight potential longer-term threats from Brexit that may damp any speculation about tighter policy. 
 
It’s a delicate balancing act for Carney, who spent much of <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3> fending off accusations he was being far too gloomy about the economy. While inflation will breach the BOE’s 2 percent target within months, the Monetary Policy Committee has indicated it’s keeping its emphasis on supporting growth for <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3>, a trade-off that may become more challenging if the economy keeps up its <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> momentum. 
 
“On the face of it, the inflation forecast and the fairly resilient growth performance argues for a more hawkish message,” said Sam Hill, an economist at RBC Capital Markets. “But given the headwinds that are approaching related to Brexit, it’s likely the MPC will spend some time making clear just how much room they’ve got to look through a period of inflation being above target.” 
 
Economists predict the BOE will keep its key interest rate at a record-low 0.25 percent and leave the size of its quantitative-easing program unchanged on <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2017-02-02">Feb. 2</TIMEX3>. In <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2016-08">August</TIMEX3>, officials announced a 60 billion-pound ($75 billion) expansion of their gilt-purchase plan, a round of bond buying that is set to expire in <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2016-02">February</TIMEX3>. 
 
Fed, BOJ 
 
Since their last forecasts in <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2016-11">November</TIMEX3>, the pound has stopped falling and the economy has maintained its 0.6 percent pace of quarterly expansion. Another bright spot may be a stronger global backdrop. The Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan also announce policy decisions <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2017-W05">next week</TIMEX3>. 
 
All but two out of 19 economists in the Bloomberg survey see the MPC raising its growth forecast for <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2017">this year</TIMEX3>, while the majority see the panel also raising its inflation projection. However, most see the bank leaving its estimates for <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2018">next year</TIMEX3> unchanged. 
 
<TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2016-10">Three months ago</TIMEX3>, Carney said the bank’s next rate move could be up or down. U.K. consumer-price growth rate jumped to 1.6 percent in <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2016-12">December</TIMEX3>, and some economists see it reaching as much as 3 percent <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2017">this year</TIMEX3>, well above target. That’s prompted traders to raise bets on an interest-rate increase <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2017">this year</TIMEX3>. 
 
Yet concern that Brexit will hurt trade is expected to hit business investment, and faster inflation means consumer spending will probably slow. U.K. companies from BT Group Plc to Whitbread Plc have warned about the outlook, while U.S. President Donald Trump has raised the specter of trade wars. Economists don’t see the MPC changing tack any time soon, with Bloomberg surveys showing no policy change until at least <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="2019">2019</TIMEX3>. 
 
“The messaging we get may well be taken as hawkish,” said Liz Martins, U.K. economist at HSBC Holdings Plc in London. “However, we are not persuaded that the MPC is yet in hawkish mode.” 
 
The meeting will be the last for Deputy Governor for Markets and Banking Minouche Shafik before she leaves to become director of the London School of Economics. The Treasury has yet to announce her replacement.
