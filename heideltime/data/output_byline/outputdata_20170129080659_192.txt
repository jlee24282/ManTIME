BORN, RAISED & GREW UP IN: Born in Westerly, moved overseas at age 13, and grew up living between the Middle East and the UK, where I attended school. 
 
RIGHT NOW I’M IN THE MIDDLE OF: Several creative endeavors — pottery, knitting, and art projects in various stages of completion. 
 
FAVORITE WAY TO SPEND MY TIME: Creating, whether it’s artistic pursuits, planning my garden, or coming up with compelling programs for work. I love the creative process.

ALWAYS IN MY POCKET: Nothing! 
 
WHAT I WANTED TO BE WHEN I GREW UP: A veterinarian. 
 
PERSON OR EXPERIENCE THAT HAS INFLUENCED ME THE MOST: My travels and living overseas, and for that I have my parents to thank. They were incredibly brave to pack up their family and take jobs that were halfway around the world. 
 
FAVORITE AUTHOR: J.K. Rowling. 
 
I AM READING: “Borderline” by Mishell Baker.

FAVORITE PET: Luna, my ornery tortoiseshell cat. 
 
FAVORITE COMFORT FOOD: Any kind of pastry. 
 
AMOUNT OF TIME I SPEND ON SOCIAL MEDIA: A fair amount; it’s part of my work at La Grua Center. It’s also the best way for me to keep in touch with friends and family who are spread so far and wide. 
 
TRAIT I MOST ADMIRE: Compassion. 
 
PET PEEVE: Pop-up ads. 
 
FAVORITE QUOTATION: “Enjoy the little things in life, for <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DURATION" value="P1D">one day</TIMEX3> you will realize they were the big things.”

I also enjoy our rich local history, the proximity to Boston and New York… so much to love! 
 
CAN’T LIVE WITHOUT: Tea! 
 
LITTLE KNOWN FACT ABOUT ME: I am a huge fan of fantasy and sci-fi. 
 
BEST ADVICE I EVER RECEIVED: Your “inbox” will never be empty, so slow down and take time to do the things that bring you the most joy. (Thanks, Mom!) 
 
ADVICE I BEST LIKE TO GIVE: For the most part you make your own happiness. 
 
IF I RULED THE WORLD I WOULD: Lose a lot of sleep! 
 
IF I WON THE LOTTERY, THE FIRST THING I WOULD DO IS: Make sure friends and family are taken care of. 
 
I DRIVE A: <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2006">2006</TIMEX3> gray Mini Cooper S. 
 
I WISH I DROVE A: Same! I love my Mini. 
 
ALWAYS IN MY FRIDGE: According to my teens, frequently nothing. 
 
IF I COULD INVITE ANYONE IN THE WORLD TO A DINNER PARTY, I WOULD INVITE: Too many real life heroes and heroines to narrow that down, so I’ll say, the entire crew of Serenity from the short-lived sci-fi series “Firefly.” That would be interesting … and hilarious.
