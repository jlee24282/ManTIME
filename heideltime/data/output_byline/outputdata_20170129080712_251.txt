NORTH FORSYTH -- The county’s first-ever master planned district zoning to be approved has some new plans.  
 
Forsyth County commissioners voted unanimously at a <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> work session to amend zoning conditions for a master-planned district, or MPD, development on about 96 acres near the northeast corner of the intersection of Matt Highway (Hwy. 369 west) and Bannister Road.  
 
The property does not reach the intersection and will go between the highway and Namon Wallace Road, including the area of Neisler Road.  
 
The property was likely the first MPD ever zoned in Forsyth when it was approved <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="200X" mod="MORE_THAN">more than a decade ago</TIMEX3>, and the changes will mean a reduction of about 150 units.  
 
“It started off in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2005">2005</TIMEX3> with 309 homes and 65 townhomes for 374 units total,” District 4 Commissioner Cindy Jones Mills said. “In <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2006">2006</TIMEX3>, they brought in back in and revised it: 210 [homes] and 55 townhomes, for 265 total.  
 
“It went 374 units down to 211.”  
 
The breakdown is <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> 123 single-family detached homes and 88 townhomes.  
 
Mills said the density of the project dropped from 3.92 units originally to 2.22 as approved and a portion of the single-family houses will be age-restricted.  
 
Many of the condition amendments dealt with architecture standards and landscaping.  
 
Previously, the county had tried to bring in nearby businesses as the commercial portion of a mixed-use project.  
 
“[We tried] to pull in property owners to add that commercial for <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="PXM">a few months</TIMEX3>, but it didn’t materialize,” Director of Zoning and Community Development Tom Brown said. “So, we moved forward with a variance instead, so it has a variance to do commercial to essentially replicate what was approved <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="200X" mod="MORE_THAN">over a decade ago</TIMEX3>.”  
 
Though the property doesn’t have commercial, Mills said it abuts 25 undeveloped acres zoned for commercial to the west.  
 
Mills said she worked for <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION" value="P1Y" mod="APPROX">about a year</TIMEX3> on the zoning amendments and said previously she felt it would improve the area.  
 
“<TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> we have, really, a much more true MPD; a roundabout with a community focal point, common areas, much more common space throughout, upscale landscaping throughout,” Mills said “We’ve added in trails. We’ve added a 10-foot multi-use trail we hope other people can use.”  
 
The development will also include a pool, kids play area, four tennis courts and greenspace.  
 
Mills said she had been working with developer Lennar Georgia -- who was not the original applicant but purchased the property -- and that the company will work with the proposed Coal Mountain Overlay.  
 
“They’ve agreed to work with me and that committee to make that fit with the MPD in the future,” Mills said.  
 
The project also worked with neighbors to move the amenity area and resolve other issues.
