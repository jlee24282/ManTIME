ELNORA — North Daviess got a game-high 21 points from Caleb Wagler <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TNI">Saturday night</TIMEX3> as the Cougars turned back Orleans, 53-42.

North Daviess started the season off 5-0 before injuries began to take their toll, but with everybody <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> back and healthy the Cougars (9-7) are rolling once again.

“They have a really good team,,” said Orleans coach Tom Bradley. “They came out in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-Q1">the first quarter</TIMEX3> and hit five 3s. I think they were 5 for 5 from the 3-point line in the first <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="PT4M">four minutes</TIMEX3>. That’s tough to take when they are shooting the ball like that.”

North Daviess netted 17 points in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-Q1">the first quarter</TIMEX3> and 15 came by way of 3-pointers.

“That kind of stunned us a little bit and we did not get things going in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2018-Q2">the second quarter</TIMEX3>,” Bradley said. “We challenged them at halftime and got the lead down to six in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2016-Q4">the fourth quarter</TIMEX3>, but we could never hit that big shot.”

Duncan Gerkin led the Bulldogs in scoring with 16.

Orleans (3-13) returns home to face Loogootee (12-6) <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2017-01-26">Thursday</TIMEX3>.
