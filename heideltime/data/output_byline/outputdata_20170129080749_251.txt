Connecticut band The Sulls are sort of a surprise. Songs such as “Jenny, We Could Be Rebels,” “Car Alarm” and “Missing You” have a nice indie brightness to them, both catchy and balanced out by some solid rock fundamentals. The music’s both youthful and well-executed, making each song more addictive than the last.
