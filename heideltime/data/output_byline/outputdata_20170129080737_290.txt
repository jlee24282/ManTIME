As someone who loves tennis unconditionally, it doesn't bother me that no American man has demanded our attention since Andy Roddick retired at the US Open in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2012">2012</TIMEX3>. 
 
I simply want to see greatness, and Roger Federer (Switzerland), Rafael Nadal (Spain), Novak Djokovic (Serbia) and Andy Murray (United Kingdom) have carried men's tennis exceptionally well for <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="200">the last decade</TIMEX3>-plus. 
 
However, for the casual tennis fan in America, they want to see Americans at the top of the game. Our country was spoiled for decades with Jimmy Connors, John McEnroe, Jim Courier, Andre Agassi and Pete Sampras displaying the superiority of the United States. 
 
In women's tennis, it's not a problem. The American Williams sisters — especially Serena — have dominated the sport for <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P18Y">the last 18 years</TIMEX3>. Fittingly, Serena and Venus squared off <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">yesterday</TIMEX3> for the first grand slam title of <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> at the Australian Open. 
 
But everyone loves rivalries. Whether it's Ohio State-Michigan in college football, Duke-North Carolina in college basketball or Muhammad Ali-Joe Frazier in boxing. 
 
It's why <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3>'s match with Federer and Nadal for the Australian Open title is so fantastic. 
 
The undisputed best rivalry in men's tennis in the last dozen years is Federer-Nadal. The two all-time greats have combined for 31 grand slam titles — 17 for Federer (the all-time record) and 14 for Nadal, the King of Clay. 
 
The scintillating battles between the two have produced legendary matches, most notably when they battled <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="PT5H" mod="LESS_THAN">nearly five hours</TIMEX3> — and through two rain delays — for the Wimbledon title in <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3>. Nadal won that match 6-4, 6-4, <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2016-06-07">6-7</TIMEX3> (5-7), <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2016-06-07">6-7</TIMEX3> (8-10), 9-7. 
 
It's easy to forget the death-grip Federer and Nadal had on the sport <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">a few years ago</TIMEX3>. From <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2005-07">July 2005</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2009-08">August 2009</TIMEX3>, they held the top two spots in the world rankings. From Wimbledon <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2003">2003</TIMEX3> to the French Open in <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2011">2011</TIMEX3>, the duo combined to win 26 of 32 grand slam titles. 
 
It may seem like a one-sided rivalry when you consider Nadal has a 23-11 record against the Swiss superstar, including a 9-2 mark in grand slam tournaments (6-2 in finals, 3-0 in semifinals). 
 
While those numbers can't be denied, many of Nadal's wins came on clay (5-0 record at the French Open), a surface where he asserted his dominance to such a degree that he became the greatest clay court player in history. 
 
But the matches were almost always heavyweight prize fights, with both players throwing and landing big punches throughout. The battles captivated tennis fans across the globe and even casual fans. 
 
Part of the allure of this rivalry is the stark juxtaposition of the two men. 
 
Federer is the elegant, graceful master who makes everything look easy while maintaining his GQ style. He's the James Bond of tennis, casually blasting a one-handed backhand down the line like he's ordering a shaken-not-stirred martini. 
 
Nadal is the lefty dirt-baller who played <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2017-H1">the first half</TIMEX3> of his career in sleeveless T-shirts and capri pants. He's anti-elegance. He runs down shots as if his life depended on it. He loudly grunts as he muscles the ball over the net with his ferocious top-spin forehand. 
 
Over time, the aura of invincibility slipped from both players — Nadal due to knee injuries and Federer to age. Djokovic took over as the greatest player on the planet in <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2011">2011</TIMEX3> and has held that title ever since, although he fell to No. 2 in the world <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="2016-11">last November</TIMEX3>, ceding the throne to Murray. 
 
Incredibly, it's been <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DURATION" value="P6Y" mod="LESS_THAN">almost six years</TIMEX3> since Federer and Nadal have played in a major final. That was the <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DATE" value="2011">2011</TIMEX3> French Open, which Nadal won in four sets. 
 
<TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Today</TIMEX3>'s final — yes, it began at <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29T01:30">1:30 a.m.</TIMEX3> Arizona time — finally brings back a historic rivalry. In truth, it's likely the last time we will ever see Federer, 35, and Nadal, 30, play one another in a grand slam final. 
 
Other terrific rivalries will emerge once these two legends fade away, but we may never see another rivalry as great as theirs. It's the Rocky Balboa-Apollo Creed of our time. 
 
Ring the bell, because the heavyweight fight has resumed.
