As readers surely know by <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3>, the news came <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-W04" mod="START">earlier this week</TIMEX3> that Star Wars: Episode VIII will be called Star Wars: The Last Jedi. That of course got fans to speculatin' about the nature of the title -- who is the last Jedi ? And also, why is the logo's font in the first poster for the film red ? 
 
You'll have to click through the links above for more on those burning questions, but below you'll find a quick slideshow of every Star Wars announcement poster ever released. From the original film (before it was even called A New Hope) to the prequel films and of course up through The Force Awakens, Rogue One and <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> The Last Jedi, see them all right here: 
 
Mark Hamill <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> gave his thoughts on the new title, and Adam Driver has said Episode VIII will explore Kylo Ren's humanity . In addition to the returning cast, the film will also star newcomers to the Star Wars universe including Benicio Del Toro, Laura Dern and Kelly Marie Tran . 
 
Star Wars: The Last Jedi is written and directed by Rian Johnson and scheduled for release on <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-12-15">December 15, 2017</TIMEX3>.
