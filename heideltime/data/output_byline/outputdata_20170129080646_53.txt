CFA chief officer Steve Warrington said hot, dry and windy conditions could lead to major fires. 
 
"Emergency services are preparing ahead of <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-01-23">Monday</TIMEX3>'s conditions and will be ready to respond to any fire that breaks out," Mr Warrington said. 
 
   
"Grasslands around Melbourne and Geelong, as well as Gippsland and North East foothills, Goldfields and Ballarat area, and the Wimmera are areas of concern. 
 
"Any fire that starts on <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-01-23">Monday</TIMEX3> could be difficult to control." 
 
Mr Warrington said weekend campers should extinguish campfires with water, not soil. 
 
"Fires can still smoulder under soil. If it is cool to touch, it is safe to leave," he said.  
 
"Be mindful of your activities, as it could be your actions that result in loss of life or property." 
 
Mildura and Swan Hill are set to hit 42 degrees, Albury-Wodonga will see a peak of 41 degrees and Orbost in East Gippsland is expected to reach 40 degrees.  
 
The Victorian Health Department has  issued a heat health warning  for the North Central, North East, and Northern Country districts.  
 
It is going to be a hot <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2017-01-23">Monday</TIMEX3> for Melbourne too, but forget a beach trip - or at least, don't expect much sun.  
 
An increasing shield of high-level cloud will spoil <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017-SU">the summer</TIMEX3>-fun potential of the forecast 34 degrees. 
 
Bureau of Meteorology senior forecaster Richard Carlyon said the day will be windy and cloudy, with a smattering of rain.  
 
"It is certainly not a hot, sunny <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2017-SU">summer</TIMEX3>'s day," Mr Carlyon said. 
 
"We do have a strong-wind warning over the waters, but over the beach ... it is going to be fresh and gusty winds," he said.  
 
"Winds will be reasonably fresh ... around 15 to 25 knots around the coast, but with stronger gusts at times."  
 
The temperature will peak <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="TIME" value="2017-01-23T13:00" mod="APPROX">around 1pm</TIMEX3>, but will drop to 30 degrees with the westerly change and stay around that mark for the rest of the afternoon.  
 
But at least we'll be able to sleep in peace. 
 
A cool change in the evening will see the temperature drop to the mid-teens.  
 
"There will be some change early afternoon as the hot northerly wind shifts westerly, but the true cooler change won't arrive until <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="TIME" value="2017-01-23T19:00">7pm</TIMEX3> or <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="TIME" value="2017-01-23T20:00">8pm</TIMEX3>," Mr Carlyon said. 
 
"The temperature will drop to 16 degrees: it should be a fairly comfortable night."
