British prime minister says “we do not agree with this kind of approach.”

President Donald Trump’s order to bar refugees and citizens from certain Muslim countries from the U.S. attracted criticism from aid organisations and French and British leaders. 

French President François Hollande said he intended to have a “firm discussion” with Trump. At a summit of southern European countries in Lisbon on <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>, Hollande said that he was concerned by Trump’s call for more countries to leave the EU, following in the footsteps of the U.K., and that EU countries had to respond to his rhetoric, according to Agence France Presse. Hollande spoke by phone with Trump later on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>. 

Shortly after meeting U.K. Prime Minister Theresa <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2016-05">May</TIMEX3> on <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3>, Trump signed an executive order canceling the arrival of refugees and asylum seekers for <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P4M">four months</TIMEX3>, and banning citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from arriving in the country. Syrian refugees are also indefinitely restricted from coming to the country. 

During her stop over in Ankara on the way back from a visit to the U.S., British Prime Minister Theresa <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2016-05">May</TIMEX3> refused to condemn Trump’s Muslim ban after being asked about it three times at a press conference with the Turkish prime minister on <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>. “The United States is responsible for the United States’ policy on refugees,” she said. “The United Kingdom is responsible for the United Kingdom’s policy on refugees.” 

But soon after midnight in London, May’s spokesman put out a statement that “we do not agree with this kind of approach and it is not one we will be taking.” 

“We are studying this new executive order to see what it means and what the legal effects are, and in particular what the consequences are for U.K. nationals,” the statement added. “If there is any impact on U.K. nationals then clearly we will make representations to the U.S. government about that.” 

The French were the most outspoken from the start. 

“This can only worry us,” Jean-Marc Ayrault, the French foreign minister, said at a press conference in Paris on <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>, according to Reuters. Ayrault added that he and Germany’s Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel discussed their concerns over Trump’s move. “Welcoming refugees who flee war and oppression is part of our duty,” Ayrault said. 

The United Nations refugee agency, UNHCR, and the International Organization for Migration also called on Trump to reconsider his decision, according to Reuters. 

The two U.N. agencies said they hoped “that the U.S. will continue its strong leadership role and long tradition of protecting those who are fleeing conflict and persecution.” 

Meanwhile, Google told traveling staff to come back to the U.S. out of fear they wouldn’t be granted re-entry into the country. At least 187 Google employees could be affected by Trump’s order, said the company’s CEO Sundar Pichai in a memo to the company, according to the Wall Street Journal.

This is from a country that bans certain women’s clothing on beaches? And they have the gall to talk about rights? 

You couldn’t make it up. 

And when exactly are you going to talk to the Donald? You’ll be out of office before the next G8 meeting.

Guess a “firm discussion” with a soon to be ex president with a popularity rating somewhere around the usual +/- margin of error in opinion polls is really going to shake things
