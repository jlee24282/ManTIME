in the 800

BOSTON, Mass. – The New Balance Indoor Grand Prix presented a rare opportunity <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> for Samantha Watson : a race she was not expected to win.  
 
At the Reggie Lewis Track and Athletic Center, the Rush-Henrietta NY senior mixed it up with the pros in the women's 800-meter race, capturing fourth place in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="PT2M">2 minutes</TIMEX3>, 3.94 seconds. Charlene Lipsey of the United States won in 2:02.01. 
 
“The plan was to get out and stay out,” Watson said. “It was fun, I was really excited, because I wasn't expected to win. It was more relaxed and I wasn't going for a record or anything, just looking for an indoor personal record, and I got one.” 
 
Watson's 800 time is No. 3 in U.S. prep history. Watson set a national high school indoor record <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-01-21">Jan. 21</TIMEX3> in the 600 (1:28.67) at the Section 5 vs. Section 6  –  Battle of the West Invitational at Houghton College.  
 
“That helped with my mindset,” Watson said of the 600. “I think my fitness is at a good spot <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">right now</TIMEX3>. I'm happy how my training is going.” 
 
Watson, who has yet to decide on a college, said she's making two more visits.The thought of turning professional for the senior isn't a thought quite yet. 
 
“Not yet,” Watson said. “I want to at least win an NCAA title or break 2:00 (first).” 
 
In the junior boys mile, Josh Hoey of Bishop Shanahan PA, overtook favorite DJ Principe of La Salle Academy RI to win in 4:09.26.  
 
“Just wanted to stay within reaching distance of the leader throughout the race, <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="PT2S" mod="APPROX">about two</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="PT3S">three seconds</TIMEX3> behind, and then with 250-300 meters to go, try and challenge for the lead, and I was able to do that,” Hoey said. 
 
Principe entered <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>'s mile after posting a personal-best 4:00.97 at the New Balance Games at The Armory in New York competing <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017-01-21">Jan. 21</TIMEX3> against professionals. The recovery, mixed in with illness, has made for a tougher-than-normal week, resulting in him running 4:12.34.  
 
“Certainly never pushed myself to that extreme,” Principe said.  
 
Principe will race in the second heat of the NYRR Millrose Games mile <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2017-02-11">Feb. 11</TIMEX3> at The Armory.  
 
“I think that was a really big confidence booster,” Principe said of getting so close to breaking 4:00. 
 
“I was hesitant to get up toward the front of the group at the race <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2017-W03">last week</TIMEX3>, and looking back at it <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3>, I wonder what would have happened if I had been a little more aggressive in the first two laps.” 
 
In the girls junior mile, Jackie Gaughan of Exeter NH won in 4:52.57. 
 
Gaughan, a junior, is coming off a breakout cross country season that saw her finish runner-up at the Foot Locker Northeast Regional and 11th at the Foot Locker National Championships.  
 
“The atmosphere here is a lot like some of the championship meets, I think that helped,” Gaughan said.  
 
Known more for long-distance performances, the mile was a bit of uncharted territory for Gaughan.   
 
“Yeah, the last lap I was like, 'Oh my gosh, I'm in first.' And I was just trying to stay where I was,” she said.
