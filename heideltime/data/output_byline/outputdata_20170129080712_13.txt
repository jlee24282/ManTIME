In a setback to Indian Oil Corp (IOC), the Odisha government has slapped a notice seeking withdrawal of fiscal incentives given to the PSU's Rs 34,555 crore Paradip refinery in the state. In the <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2016-12-29">December 29</TIMEX3> notice, Odisha government has asked why the fiscal incentives like <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P11Y">11-year</TIMEX3> deferment of sales tax on petroleum products sold in the state should not be withdrawn considering that the refinery was delayed by <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P6Y" mod="MORE_THAN">over six years</TIMEX3>. Sources said the state government had in <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2004-02">February 2004</TIMEX3> signed an agreement with IOC to give fiscal incentives for setting up a 9 million tonnes <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3> oil refinery at Paradip by <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2009">2009</TIMEX3>-<TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2010">10</TIMEX3>. However, the project was delayed and started only in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2016" mod="START">early 2016</TIMEX3>. The delay is <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> being cited by Odisha to seek withdrawal of the incentives, they said, adding the state government feels the delay has pushed back the payback time of deferred taxes by few years. Also, the state government says that the refinery was originally planned for a 9 million tonnes per annum capacity .
