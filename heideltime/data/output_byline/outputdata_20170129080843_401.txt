He posted a tweet Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has welcomed immigrants in a sunny Twitter message written in stark contrast to Donald Trump's order temporarily banning all refugees and many Muslims from travelling to the United States. 

"To those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada," Trudeau posted on Twitter on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>. 

The message comes <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P1D">one day</TIMEX3> after Trump signed a sweeping executive order to suspend the arrival of refugees for <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P120D" mod="EQUAL_OR_MORE">at least 120 days</TIMEX3> and impose tough new controls on travellers from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen for <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P3M">the next three months</TIMEX3>. Since then, travellers from those countries have been stopped from boarding US-bound planes, triggering angry protests and detentions at airports. 

Some who were already in the air when Trump signed the executive order were detained on arrival, The New York Times reported. 

On <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>, Canadian airline WestJet said it would reimburse passengers prevented from travelling to the United States under the new policy. 

"WestJet will comply with this executive order," the company said in a statement. 

"In the event, there are foreign nationals from these countries on WestJet who are denied entry, we will be providing them with a full refund." 

The airliner has already had to refuse one passenger transport to the United States, a spokeswoman said, without specifying the passenger's origin. According to the latest Canadian census, from <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2011">2011</TIMEX3>, one out of five people in the country are foreign-born. 

Canada has welcomed more than 39,670 Syrian refugees between <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2015-11">November 2015</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2017-01" mod="START">the beginning of this January</TIMEX3>, according to government figures.
