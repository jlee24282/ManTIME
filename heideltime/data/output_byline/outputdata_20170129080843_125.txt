Pepperdine’s Lamond Murray , the leading scorer in the WCC at nearly 21 points per game, scored just four points in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-H1">the first half</TIMEX3>. He finished with 12 points on 5-of-14 shooting. 
 
Nigel Williams-Goss drew the starting on assignment on Murray, but Jordan Mathews and Silas Melson also saw extended time on the talented 6-foot-5 wing. 
 
“He’s a guy that’s going to make some money at this game <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2018">next year</TIMEX3>,” Few said. “Our bigs did a really nice job of hedging on screens and pindowns. He’s a handful.” 
 
Murray didn’t score until midway through <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-H1">the first half</TIMEX3>. He had three baskets early in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2016-H2">the second half</TIMEX3> but Gonzaga was already pulling away. 
 
“Just staying in front and contest his shots at the top,” Mathews said. 
 
Murray had 19 points in the <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2016-12">December</TIMEX3> loss to the Zags.
