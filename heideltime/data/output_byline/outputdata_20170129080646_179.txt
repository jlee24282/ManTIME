At age 22, she married her second husband, Austin Standish, an Irish immigrant working as a civil engineer for the Pacific Railroad, who built the home next door to his in-laws. 
 
The Queen Anne-style brick and frame home stands at 103 Jackson St. 
 
Mildred was born in <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="1834">1834</TIMEX3> in Charlottesville, Virginia, to G.A. and Patience Parsons. Her father had worked for President Thomas Jefferson at Monticello and moved to the namesake city in <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="1839">1839</TIMEX3>, according to her obituary on <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="1919-05-24">May 24, 1919</TIMEX3>, in the Jefferson City Democrat Tribune. 
 
The Parsons family enjoyed a spacious setting for their home overlooking the Missouri River and featuring a stone stairway to the river's edge, prior to the installation of Jackson and State streets, according to the Daily Capital News on <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="1942-03-20">March 20, 1942</TIMEX3>. 
 
Before her marriage in <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="1857">1857</TIMEX3>, three of her sisters had died, including Mary Ann, who married a nephew of Jefferson. 
 
The Standishes had two sons — Richard and Austin — before the Civil War began. Their youngest son, Monroe, was born in <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="1862-01">January 1862</TIMEX3>. By that <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2017-12">December</TIMEX3>, Mildred's youngest brother, Gustavus Adolphus Jr., died in Van Buren, Arkansas, after enlisting at age 16. 
 
Her other brother, Monroe Mosby (M.M.), had distinguished himself early in the military, commanding a company of mounted volunteers from Cole County in the Mexican War. He commanded the 6th Division of the Missouri State Guard before being promoted to Brigadier General in the Confederate Army. 
 
Mildred's husband, Austin, also joined the 6th Division, eventually rising to the rank of colonel and served on Gen. M.M. Parson's staff. 
 
Standish served from the beginning of the war and was once wounded when his horse was shot from under him, and his life was saved at the battle of Wilson Creek by his watch, which was badly crushed by a bullet meant for him. 
 
The <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="1942">1942</TIMEX3> newspaper reprinted a letter in Mildred's own words, detailing her last visit with her husband and brother inside the Confederate lines. 
 
Following the election of Lincoln to his second term, her father encouraged Mildred "to go south and try to persuade my husband Col. Standish to leave the Confederate Army and take a position of less danger than that of Chief of Staff to my brother Gen. Monroe M. Parsons," she wrote. 
 
She braved travel through enemy lines with her three young sons in tow. After weeks aboard boats, trains and wagons, she reached his camp in Arkansas. For a southerner crossing through enemy lines, Mildred Standish found courtesy and hospitality. 
 
"In view of the fact that I had not asked any favors, good fortune meeting me at every point was most remarkable," she said. "Surely a kind providence guided me to find friends among strangers to help me through the difficult places." 
 
From Arkansas, she had traveled with her husband and brother to their Louisiana camp, where they were for <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">the last days</TIMEX3> of the Confederacy and when word of Confederate Gen. Robert Lee's surrender arrived. 
 
Upon receiving that news, Gen. M.M. Parsons and his brother-in-law, Col. Standish, with other Confederate officers chose to seek better futures in Brazil. 
 
Mildred wrote the officers in particular felt anxious and uncertain about the future, including her husband. They "decided at once to leave the country believing that better opportunities of practicing their professions could be found elsewhere," she wrote. 
 
With her young sons, Mildred returned from Shreveport, Louisiana, to Jefferson City. 
 
"While on their way south, both Gen. Parsons and Col. Standish were cruelly murdered," Mildred's obituary said. 
 
The soldiers still wearing their Confederate uniforms were attacked by Mexican soldiers <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DATE" value="1865-06-10">June 10, 1865</TIMEX3>, near Chino, Mexico, by the San Juan River. 
 
"At first, the bloody deed was supposed to have been committed by guerrillas, but it was afterwards found that they were soldiers," noted the <TIMEX3 tid="t37" type="DATE" value="1875-05-05">May 5, 1875</TIMEX3>, Troy Herald. "It was a fiendish massacre, and several noble men were butchered." 
 
Standish was remembered "as gallant an Irishman as ever drew a sabre or mustered a squadron." 
 
"Legend surrounding the Standish house tells that Mildred, refusing to believe reports of the deaths of her husband and brother in <TIMEX3 tid="t39" type="DATE" value="1865">1865</TIMEX3>, kept a burning candle for them in the front window waiting for their return," according to the Historic City of Jefferson's "Capitol Avenue Historic District." 
 
At the same time, she had a young family to care for. In addition to serving as matron of the School for the Blind in St. Louis for <TIMEX3 tid="t41" type="DURATION" value="P30Y" mod="MORE_THAN">more than 30 years</TIMEX3>, Mildred also won restitution from the Mexican government. 
 
In <TIMEX3 tid="t44" type="DATE" value="1875-09">September 1875</TIMEX3>, she was awarded $40,000 in gold plus replacement of the $1,500 Standish had with him at the time of his murder. Her nephew and another Missouri widow also won claims of $50,000 each. 
 
"Although crushed by the double tragedy which came to her as the result of the war and it's subsequent financial responsibilities, Mrs. Standish faced the future with a grace and dignity which caused her to be one of the most beloved personages of the city," the <TIMEX3 tid="t45" type="DATE" value="1942">1942</TIMEX3> newspaper said. 
 
Mildred was an honorary member of the Confederate veterans M.M. Parsons Camp and was one of the oldest members of Grace Episcopal Church at the time of her death. 
 
In <TIMEX3 tid="t48" type="DATE" value="1919-02">February 1919</TIMEX3>, just <TIMEX3 tid="t49" type="DURATION" value="P3M">three months</TIMEX3> before her death at her niece's home in St. Louis, Mildred was one of 35 patients rescued from a fire at the St. Mary's Catholic Hospital. 
 
She is buried at Woodland-Old City Cemetery, sharing a headstone with her son, Richard, a Cole County clerk. Sons — Austin, a physician, and Monroe, involved in the wholesale drugs business — also are buried there, as well as memorial stones for her husband, brother and several other Parsons family members.

The brick 2 1/2-half-story home features several decorative elements, including the pyramidal tower, according to the Capitol Avenue Historic District nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. 
 
The north corner boasts a rounded two-story bay, and the center of the gable has a three-light round window. The first floor also features a wrap-around porch that bows out around the rounded bay and curves around the southeast corner tower. 
 
By <TIMEX3 tid="t58" type="DATE" value="196" mod="END">the late 1960s</TIMEX3>, the property was used as blended office space and residential. 
 
Employees of state offices, International Shoe Company and others lived there for short periods of time. 
 
Roy and Maye Ottinger bought the property from the estate of Ethel Gibler in <TIMEX3 tid="t59" type="DATE" value="1969">1969</TIMEX3>. 
 
Born in <TIMEX3 tid="t60" type="DATE" value="1891">1891</TIMEX3>, Gibler studied at Central Missouri State College and returned to her hometown to work at Exchange National Bank before retiring in <TIMEX3 tid="t61" type="DATE" value="1956">1956</TIMEX3>. 
 
Gibler was a member of First Presbyterian Church and active in the Charles Still Hospital Guild. She died suddenly in a two-car collision in <TIMEX3 tid="t62" type="DATE" value="1966">1966</TIMEX3>. 
 
Maye Ottinger hosted social gatherings with the Cole County Republican Women's Club and the First Baptist Church Women's Missionary Union. 
 
It also was the headquarters for the State Association of Mentally Retarded Children, organized in <TIMEX3 tid="t63" type="DATE" value="1954">1954</TIMEX3>. 
 
The voluntary organization established and coordinated local associations, provided programs and services consultation and instituted special services to the "mentally retarded," as well as providing preschool classes, diagnostic evaluations, social and recreation activities, vocational training, counseling and public information. 
 
The Ottingers sold the property to Barbara and Betty Buescher in <TIMEX3 tid="t64" type="DATE" value="1975">1975</TIMEX3>. 
 
Jewell Pratt lived there for <TIMEX3 tid="t67" type="DURATION" value="P1DE" mod="APPROX">about a decade</TIMEX3> beginning about <TIMEX3 tid="t65" type="DATE" value="1985">1985</TIMEX3>. 
 
She served the Jefferson City public schools as nurse for <TIMEX3 tid="t70" type="DURATION" value="P35Y">35 years</TIMEX3>. 
 
Pratt was born in <TIMEX3 tid="t71" type="DATE" value="1908">1908</TIMEX3> to Judge John and Maude Leslie. She was a charter member of the Jefferson City Symphony Orchestra, playing both the violin and viola, and she performed with the St. Louis Symphony at the Capitol dedication in <TIMEX3 tid="t72" type="DATE" value="1924">1924</TIMEX3>. 
 
She was among the first graduating class from Jefferson City Junior College, and she went on to become a registered nurse, working for a time in St. Louis at St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital and Nurses Home. 
 
She married Burt Pratt, who died in <TIMEX3 tid="t73" type="DATE" value="1945">1945</TIMEX3>, leaving her to raise three children.

In the famous litigation against the Hannibal and St. Joseph Railroad, McIntyre fought through the federal courts and saved the state more than $3 million. 
 
McIntyre first arrived in Jefferson City to complete the state Senate term of Charles Hardin, newly elected governor in <TIMEX3 tid="t81" type="DATE" value="1874">1874</TIMEX3> and under whom McIntyre had studied law in Audrain County. 
 
He was elected in his own right to represent Audrain County in the statehouse from <TIMEX3 tid="t82" type="DATE" value="1876">1876</TIMEX3>-<TIMEX3 tid="t83" type="DATE" value="1880">80</TIMEX3>. He won the statewide election to attorney general for the <TIMEX3 tid="t84" type="DATE" value="1881">1881</TIMEX3>-<TIMEX3 tid="t85" type="DATE" value="1885">85</TIMEX3> term and chose to remain in Jefferson City, where he continued his law practice, as well as serving as president of Merchants Bank. 
 
In <TIMEX3 tid="t86" type="DATE" value="1886">1886</TIMEX3>, he was re-elected to the statehouse, this time representing Cole County until <TIMEX3 tid="t87" type="DATE" value="1891">1891</TIMEX3>. 
 
Born in Callaway County in <TIMEX3 tid="t88" type="DATE" value="1833">1833</TIMEX3>, McIntyre was raised in Mexico and attended Westminster College, where he graduated in absentia in <TIMEX3 tid="t89" type="DATE" value="1861">1861</TIMEX3>, as he was already an officer in the Missouri State Guard. 
 
McIntyre was elected captain of Company A in the 1st Infantry Regiment, which formed from Callaway County and saw action at Carthage and Springfield. He was severely wounded in the jaw at the Battle of Wilson's Creek. 
 
He returned home to recuperate but was captured <TIMEX3 tid="t91" type="DATE" value="1861-12-19">Dec. 19, 1861</TIMEX3>, at Blackwater River near Milford and sent to Alton Prison (Camp Chase and Johnson's Island Prison). He was exchanged at Vicksburg, Mississippi, in <TIMEX3 tid="t95" type="DATE" value="1862-09">September 1862</TIMEX3>. 
 
After his release, he enlisted in the regular Confederate army, serving as a lieutenant in Company K of the 10th Regiment Missouri Cavalry under Confederate Gen. Sterling Price until the surrender at Shreveport, Louisiana. 
 
McIntyre married Susan Simpson in Adams County, Illinois, in <TIMEX3 tid="t99" type="DATE" value="1866-03">March 1866</TIMEX3> and returned to Salt River near Mexico as a farmer until <TIMEX3 tid="t97" type="DATE" value="1871">1871</TIMEX3>, when he took up law. 
 
He was elected Audrain County prosecuting attorney from <TIMEX3 tid="t100" type="DATE" value="1872">1872</TIMEX3>-<TIMEX3 tid="t101" type="DATE" value="1874">74</TIMEX3>. 
 
For <TIMEX3 tid="t103" type="DURATION" value="P10Y" mod="APPROX">about 10 years</TIMEX3>, the McIntyres called Jefferson City home. They made their mark, building the Italianate, three-story, yellow brick home at 401 E. Capitol Ave. about <TIMEX3 tid="t104" type="DATE" value="1883">1883</TIMEX3>. 
 
After his last term representing Cole County in the statehouse about <TIMEX3 tid="t105" type="DATE" value="1891">1891</TIMEX3>, he returned to Mexico after his war wound caused him to go blind. 
 
By <TIMEX3 tid="t106" type="DATE" value="1902">1902</TIMEX3>, his wife, Susan, had been judged insane and was committed to the Fulton State Hospital. 
 
Upon his death in <TIMEX3 tid="t107" type="DATE" value="1910">1910</TIMEX3>, the Mexico Ledger described him as "a man who for <TIMEX3 tid="t109" type="DURATION" value="P40Y">40 years</TIMEX3> was active in public life in his city, county and state life, public and private, was without a blemish, and he was honored and respected for his ability and integrity."

The striking, red home "once served as the center of gaiety prevailing in Jefferson City and throughout the country in <TIMEX3 tid="t119" type="DATE" value="189">the 1890s</TIMEX3>," according to the <TIMEX3 tid="t120" type="DATE" value="1967-12-03">Dec. 3, 1967, Sunday</TIMEX3> News and Tribune. 
 
The home was built in <TIMEX3 tid="t123" type="DATE" value="1893">1893</TIMEX3>, following the election of Lon Stephens, of Boonville, to the state treasurer's office. 
 
"Records of the period described the many parties held in the home with dancing on the third-floor ballroom and guests including state officials, prominent local residents and relatives from the Boonville area," the newspaper said. 
 
The entertaining tradition began by Stephens and his wife, Maggie, continued when they sold to local druggist and civic leader Gustavus A. Fischer in <TIMEX3 tid="t124" type="DATE" value="1903">1903</TIMEX3>. The Stephens only lived in the home for <TIMEX3 tid="t126" type="DURATION" value="P3Y">three years</TIMEX3> before he was elected governor and moved into the Governor's Mansion, according to the <TIMEX3 tid="t125" type="DATE" value="1990">1990</TIMEX3> National Register of Historic Places nomination. 
 
Distinguished by its open-air turret and extensive wrap-around porch, "Ivy Terrace is one of the most intact Queen Anne representatives of this architectural style in Jefferson City," according to the Historic City of Jefferson's "Capitol Avenue Historic District." 
 
It retains eight hand-carved fireplaces complete with Italian tile, art glass windows and the grand entry oak staircase. 
 
The national register nomination said its "most significant characteristics are its rounded tower, wrap-around porch, high and irregular roof, fish scale shingles and asymmetrical facade." 
 
"All of Opel's homes were good examples of Queen Anne style, but few have survived — Ivy Terrace is the only one substantially unaltered," the nomination said. 
 
Most of the "historic east" was influenced by Opel, a <TIMEX3 tid="t127" type="DATE" value="1992">1992</TIMEX3> Urbana architectural survey said. 
 
He designed several prominent buildings in town including several at Lincoln University, First Methodist Church, First Baptist Church, Second Baptist Church, the Tweedie home at 601 E. High St., parts of the Missouri State Penitentiary and other buildings in Russellville and California. 
 
Born in <TIMEX3 tid="t128" type="DATE" value="1857">1857</TIMEX3> to immigrants Adam and Charlotte Opel, he learned his trade from his father, a successful contractor who arrived from Bavaria in <TIMEX3 tid="t129" type="DATE" value="1852">1852</TIMEX3>. Charles Opel was a cabinet maker before going into partnership with his father in <TIMEX3 tid="t130" type="DATE" value="1882">1882</TIMEX3>. 
 
Later he partnered with another local architect, Fred Miller, with an office in Columbia by <TIMEX3 tid="t131" type="DATE" value="1898">1898</TIMEX3> and expanded further by <TIMEX3 tid="t132" type="DATE" value="1911">1911</TIMEX3> to offices in Kansas City and Springfield, where he partnered with his son-in-law A.N. Torbitt. 
 
Opel also was active in the community. By <TIMEX3 tid="t133" type="DATE" value="1900">1900</TIMEX3>, he was the business manager and treasurer of the Missouri Illustrated Sketch Book Company, vice president of the Commercial Club (forerunner to the Chamber of Commerce), director of the Town Mutual Fire Insurance Company, treasurer of the First Church of Christ Scientists and state president of the Single Tax League. 
 
The Jefferson City sketchbook said he was a fluent writer and speaker, "taking an interest in every measure to its artificial beauty, as well as other means material progress." 
 
Opel married Myrtle Hughes in <TIMEX3 tid="t134" type="DATE" value="1881">1881</TIMEX3>. They had eight children — six, including an adopted daughter, who were still alive in <TIMEX3 tid="t135" type="DATE" value="1915">1915</TIMEX3> following his death due to kidney failure in Kansas City. 
 
The Opels' teenage daughter Jessie died in <TIMEX3 tid="t136" type="DATE" value="1901">1901</TIMEX3> when her clothing caught on fire from a lamp near where she was curling her hair. 
 
Opel's grand architectural achievement at 500 E. Capitol Ave. served the 18th state treasurer for <TIMEX3 tid="t137" type="DURATION" value="P3Y">three years</TIMEX3>. 
 
Stephens, born <TIMEX3 tid="t138" type="DATE" value="1855">1855</TIMEX3> in Boonville, was educated at Cooper Institute, Kemper Family School, and Washington and Lee University. He was appointed <TIMEX3 tid="t142" type="DATE" value="1890-03">March 1890</TIMEX3> by Gov. D.R. Francis to fill the term of Edward Noland and then elected in <TIMEX3 tid="t140" type="DATE" value="1892">1892</TIMEX3>. 
 
He was elected governor in <TIMEX3 tid="t143" type="DATE" value="1896">1896</TIMEX3> on the Free Silver platform, serving <TIMEX3 tid="t144" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">one year</TIMEX3> during which time the State Fair was established in Sedalia. 
 
Ivy Terrace passed in <TIMEX3 tid="t145" type="DATE" value="1903">1903</TIMEX3> to Gustavus and Jennie Fischer, who married in <TIMEX3 tid="t148" type="DATE" value="1889-11">November 1889</TIMEX3>. Jennie was the granddaughter of Dr. Bernard Bruns, founder of Westphalia and pioneer physician and civic leader. 
 
In <TIMEX3 tid="t149" type="DATE" value="1887">1887</TIMEX3>, Fischer founded the G.A. Fischer Drug Company at 105 E. High St., which he handed down to his son Clifford Hess Fischer. He also helped Fred Ott establish East End Drug at 700 E. High St. 
 
The Fischers called Ivy Terrace home from <TIMEX3 tid="t150" type="DATE" value="1903">1903</TIMEX3>-<TIMEX3 tid="t151" type="DATE" value="1948">48</TIMEX3>. Gustavus died in <TIMEX3 tid="t152" type="DATE" value="1933">1933</TIMEX3>, and Jennie remained there until her death in <TIMEX3 tid="t153" type="DATE" value="1947">1947</TIMEX3>. 
 
Jefferson City "loses one of her best known, most highly respected and successful business men, druggist and bankers," the Daily Capital News reported <TIMEX3 tid="t156" type="DATE" value="1933-04-29">April 29, 1933</TIMEX3>. 
 
Fischer graduated from the Jefferson City schools and then from the St. Louis pharmacy school. He started as clerk at J.R. Riddley Drug Store, which he later bought and renamed. 
 
In <TIMEX3 tid="t158" type="DATE" value="1902">1902</TIMEX3>, Fischer was a "prime mover" in organizing the Central Missouri Trust Company, his obituary said. Upon Sam B. Cook's death in <TIMEX3 tid="t159" type="DATE" value="1931">1931</TIMEX3>, he became chairman of the board of directors. 
 
"He inspired the Central Missouri Trust Company building and was the leading spirit and financial genius that gave Jefferson City this outstanding office and business building," the Capital News reported. 
 
Fischer was involved in the opening of the Jefferson City Country Club in <TIMEX3 tid="t160" type="DATE" value="1922">1922</TIMEX3> and organizing the Capitol Telephone Company at the turn of the century. 
 
Mary Woods bought the home in <TIMEX3 tid="t161" type="DATE" value="1948">1948</TIMEX3>, where she operated the Mariwood College of Beauty Culture until <TIMEX3 tid="t162" type="DATE" value="1966">1966</TIMEX3>, when it was sold to Thomas Whitecotton, who lived there until about <TIMEX3 tid="t163" type="DATE" value="1987">1987</TIMEX3> with his wife, Dee. 
 
Whitecotton "restored the building to its original splendor," a <TIMEX3 tid="t164" type="DATE" value="1967">1967</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t165" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3> News and Tribune article said. 
 
He was one of the original members of the Missouri Highway Patrol, retiring in <TIMEX3 tid="t166" type="DATE" value="1965">1965</TIMEX3> after <TIMEX3 tid="t168" type="DURATION" value="P34Y">34 years</TIMEX3>. He was involved in a major gun battle with the infamous Barrow Gang in Platte County <TIMEX3 tid="t172" type="DATE" value="1933-07-20">July 20, 1933</TIMEX3>, according to his <TIMEX3 tid="t170" type="DATE" value="1987">1987</TIMEX3> obituary in the News Tribune.
