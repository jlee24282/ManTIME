ST. CLAIRSVILLE — For <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="200">the last decade</TIMEX3> plus, softball has been year-round labor of love for Ron Hummel. 
 
<TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-SP">This spring</TIMEX3>, his focus will be squarely on St. Clairsville High School. 
 
Hummel, who boasts an extensive career of working at the travel, rec and prep levels, has been named the Red Devils’ head softball coach, replacing Rachel Ochsenbine, who served most of last season in an interim role. 
 
”I’m excited about it,” Hummel, a <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="1979">1979</TIMEX3> Bishop Donahue graduate said. 
 
While a Bishop, baseball was Hummel’s sport of choice. But with three daughters, he quickly developed a love for softball. 
 
Latashia, Brianna and Antonia Hummel all played for the Red Devils. 
 
And, along the way, their dad, became more and more involved in their development. That involvement took place at various levels and blossomed as the years moved along. 
 
Hummel has been involved with the Roadrunners — a popular travel organization for <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P1DE" mod="APPROX">about a decade</TIMEX3>. There, Hummel said he was able to hone his skills under the tutelage of Rick Sherman and Jim DiCarlo. 
 
”That really gave me a different outlook on the game,” Hummel said. ”(Softball) is such a fast-paced game. 
 
”(being a head coach) is something I thought I’d be interested in doing if I ever had the opportunity.” 
 
When one arose at St. Clairsville, Hummel kicked around the experience he had and came to the conclusion that the time was right to give it a go. 
 
”I want to take my knowledge and give it to these girls,” he said. ”I feel like if I don’t do it I’d be cheating them out of something.” 
 
Hummel is a firm believer many opportunities exist at the college level, and he’s eager to help set his players on the path to reach that level. 
 
”The biggest thing <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">right now</TIMEX3> is to get the girls accustomed to me; learning my technique and coaching philosophies,” he said. 
 
”I’m looking forward to the challenge.” 
 
St. Clairsville has enjoyed much success in <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> seasons and Hummel hopes to build on that. 
 
He’s started to work with the players already and is focusing his attention on the younger players. 
 
”My goal is to take the younger players and get them to where the juniors and seniors are,” he said. 
 
The Red Devils lost three starters, but return six, Hummel said, including pitchers Amaya Smith and Ari Reager. 
 
”I don’t think we’re gonna miss a beat,” he said.
