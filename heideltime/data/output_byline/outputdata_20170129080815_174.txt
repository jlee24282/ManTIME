The Board of Studies has decided to introduce eligibility Test Paper scheme for fostering the habit of regular study and writing skills in examination conditions to help students to perform well for their examinations. The Test Paper Scheme would be initially made applicable to Final Course students appearing in the examination for the first time, to begin with. As a part of this scheme such Final Course Students would be required to take one test each for two Papers as may be notified in each Group of Final Course, to be eligible to appear for Final Exam proposed from Nov-17 attempt and a later attempt as may be notified. The broad modalities for this scheme are under finalisation. 

Students are advised not to be worried and continue with their sincere preparation for the forthcoming examinations, as they will be given sufficient time to secure eligibility.
