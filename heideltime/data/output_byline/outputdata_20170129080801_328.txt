The APC in Borno State <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">yesterday</TIMEX3> distanced itself from a campaign message allegedly authored by the former chairman of the state emergency management agency (SEMA), Grema Terab, calling for the return of President Goodluck Jonathan in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2019">2019</TIMEX3>. 
 
The state secretary of the APC, Bello Ayuba, said the clarification from the APC became necessary because Terab paraded himself as a member of the party in the state. 
 
“While we respect the freedom of any Nigerian, including Grema Terab, to associate with any political party and aspirant of his choice for all elective offices, we find it disturbing that some Nigerians are already assuming Terab is a member of the Borno APC, for the fact that he always identified himself as one,  mainly because he once held public office as chairman of the Borno SEMA from <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2013">2013</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3>, and also openly associates with public office holders in Borno State and in Abuja, who are of the APC,” the statement said. 
 
It, however said there was no record showing Terab as a card carrying member of the APC in any of the 312 wards across the 27 local government areas of the state.  
 
“<TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TNI">Last night</TIMEX3> (<TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-01-25">Wednesday</TIMEX3>), many of our APC members in Borno State were shocked to receive messages on their mobile phones with the following words: ‘Fellow Northern Youths, join the launching of our movement to Bring-Back-Goodluck-Jonathan in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2019">2019</TIMEX3>; holding on <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-01-26">Thursday</TIMEX3> (<TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">yesterday</TIMEX3>) in Abuja.  
 
“All northerners have failed this country and no northerner (Muslim or Christian) has capacity (sic). Let us northerners also concede the vice president (slot) to Gov. Ayo Fayose,’” part of the text message read. 
 
But Terab had in a phone interview said he was not the author of the purported pro-Jonathan drive. 
 
“I have already directed my lawyers to go to court and I refuted the story in my Twitter handle and facebook. I have nothing to do with the purported programme in Abuja,” he said.
