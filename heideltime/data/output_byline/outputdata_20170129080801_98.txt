President Trump's action limiting refugee flow challenged after leaving refugees hoping to enter US legally in limbo  
World Bulletin / News Desk 
 
Pro-immigration lawyers in New York City sued <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> to stall a travel ban enacted by President Donald Trump after two Iraqis were detained at John F. Kennedy International Airport and denied entry into the country despite having legal visas. 
 
Legal teams from several immigration groups filed a civil lawsuit at a federal court in Brooklyn, according to media reports, as President Trump's executive order limiting refugee flow into the U.S. was put into immediate effect <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27" mod="END">late Friday</TIMEX3>. 
 
One of the Iraqi men, named in the lawsuit as Hameed Khalid Darweesh, was granted a special immigrant visa after working for the U.S. army for <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P10Y">10 years</TIMEX3> in Iraq. 
 
The other individual, Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, received his visa <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-01" mod="START">earlier this month</TIMEX3> to join his wife in the U.S., who worked for a U.S. security contractor. 
 
It wasn't immediately clear <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TMO">Saturday morning</TIMEX3> how many people scheduled to arrive in the U.S. were affected by the ban. 
 
Trump signed an executive action <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017-01-25">Wednesday</TIMEX3> to deport undocumented immigrants involved in criminal activity, and another <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3> that limits the flow of refugees into the U.S. as a measure against what he called "radical Islamic terrorists". 
 
The second action reportedly involves <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="P1M">a months</TIMEX3>-long entry ban on people from several blacklisted Middle Eastern countries, although President Trump said Christians living in Muslim-majority nations would be given priority to enter the U.S.
