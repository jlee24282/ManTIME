Pop duo Jedward, model Nicola McLean, cleaning guru Kim Woodburn, footballer Jamie O’Hara and model Calum Best are all facing eviction from Celebrity Big Brother <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-W04-WE">this weekend</TIMEX3>. 
 
Contestants had to make their nominations for eviction face to face in tonight’s episode, with many taking the opportunity to tell their least favourite housemates exactly what they thought of them. 
 
Jedward and Nicola have been bickering with each other for most of their stay in the house and got into a heated row after nominations took place. 
 
   
The twins accused Nicola of spreading lies about them and she complained that they were trying to intimidate her. 
 
In the diary room, Jedward said: “It hurts loads when you hear people nominating you and saying you’re big-headed. 
 
“I am not big-headed, I haven’t changed my bed sheets in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P6M">six months</TIMEX3>.” 
 
People were concerned that the housemates were ganging up on Jedward as Calum Best waded in to defend Nicola. 
   
Feeling for Jedward <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3>, they’re vulnerable without Speidi around. Not liking this gang mentality of the other housemates… #CBB

I don’t care how “immature” or “annoying” Jedward are. These people are bullying 25 year old boys. It’s disgusting. #CBB

<TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION" value="P3W">Three weeks</TIMEX3> of collective bullying finally took its toll on #CBBJedward , and no one gave them any support whatsoever. Awful to watch. #CBB

Some viewers were happy to see them hit back in an argument. 
   
So glad #CBBjedward are sticking up for themselves! I really hope they win. #CBB
