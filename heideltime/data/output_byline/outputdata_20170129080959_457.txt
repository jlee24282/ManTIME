Denver Broncos Cornerback and Super Bowl 50 winner Aqib Talib gives his thoughts on Atlanta Falcons Wide Receiver Julio Jones and his team-mate Matt Ryan 

Aqib Talib believes that it's almost impossible for just one player to stop Atlanta Falcons wide receiver Julio Jones. 

The Denver Broncos cornerback was speaking with Neil Reynolds ahead of the <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> Pro Bowl in Orlando, Florida. When asked about how the New England Patriots might stop Jones in Super Bowl LI, Talib said that it would have to be a two-man job. 

"You better double him. You better have somebody helping you," Talib said. "I don't think anyone can guard him one-on-one and have <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> with him. 

"He should have a safety on top of him and corner pressing him, that's the best you can do to try to stop him. 

Neil asked Talib about what made Jones such a hard player to stop. 

"It's everything, man, he's the total package. He's got the size, the strength, the speed, the confidence and the ball skills. That's the ultimate receiver, right there."

<TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> will be the first time that the Falcons have made the Super Bowl since <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="1998">1998</TIMEX3>. Talib reflected on the moment he won Super Bowl 50 with the Broncos. 

"Winning that game is the ultimate feeling that an NFL player can get. We were on the field for <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="PT1H">an hour</TIMEX3>, before we started the media stuff. It was an absolute joy to win." 

Talib also talked about Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan, who he believes will go to the next level with a Super Bowl win. 

"Matt Ryan is one of the best quarterbacks in the middle of his career <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">right now</TIMEX3>. If he can come out with a Super Bowl, he's going to go to the next level, and be right behind those elite guys. 

"It's a huge day for 'Matty Ice' and his legacy, and I think he can get it done."
