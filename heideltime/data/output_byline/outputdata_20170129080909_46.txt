Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has insisted that it is not possible to get any lower after they were sent packing from two cup competitions in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DURATION" value="P3D">three days</TIMEX3> with a tie against Chelsea up next

The 2-1 loss in the FA Cup to Wolverhampton Wanderers at Anfield followed home defeats to Southampton in the EFL Cup semi-final and Swansea in the Premier League

Liverpool has not lost four straight matches at home since <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="1923">1923</TIMEX3> and Klopp says things cannot get worse

"If someone asks if this is the lowest point of my Liverpool time until <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> I don’t know" he said 

"But if it is it is a perfect moment to turn because it is not possible to go lower" he said

"I don’t think it is the right time to talk about being positive or optimistic In this moment we feel really bad It is absolutely right that it feels bad and we have to use it in this moment"

The former Borussia Dortmund coach also took the blame for the result and said he could do better

"I am responsible and I feel really responsible for this performance because I thought we could do better obviously" Klopp added

"We have to think about this Not too long but we have to think about this You learn always about situations and players and all that stuff in all games

"It was an important game for us <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3> and obviously we couldn’t deliver I am responsible for the line-up I saw them training and I thought ‘That’s the line-up’" Top Stories
