It’s big and bold and beautiful. 
 
It’s a modernist, giant-windowed nod to its location on Okanagan Lake. 
 
It has a gourmet kitchen with a wall of wine. 
 
It has double-height living and dining rooms seemingly suspended above the lake. 
 
It’s festooned with multiple balconies, decks and patios. 
 
It is the Thompson Okanagan Housing Award’s <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> Home of the Year built by Turner Custom Homes of Kelowna. 
 
Awards were handed out <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TNI">Saturday night</TIMEX3> at the 25th anniversary Tommies gala at the Delta Grand hotel in Kelowna. 
 
While trophies were awarded in 39 categories, Home of the Year is 
 
considered the marquee accolade, the one most closely watched and the property that tends to elicit the most oohs and aahs. 
 
The owners of the Home of the Year were not identified through the Tommie awards process. 
 
It simply carried the Waterfront Estate moniker. 
 
The contemporary stunner also picked up the trophy as the best single-family detached home worth $3-5 million. 
 
Turner Custom Homes is a division of Gord Turner Renovations. 
 
The renovations arm of the business won two other Tommies as residential renovator of the year and best residential renovation under $100,000. 
 
Besides Home of the Year and Renovator of the Year, there are three other Grand Tommies awarded <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="SET" value="XXXX">annually</TIMEX3>. 
 
Pentar Homes picked up Multi-Family Builder of the Year honours for its 
 
68-unit Kara Vista townhouse development in West Kelowna’s Rose Valley neighbourhood. 
 
Edgecombe Builders, one of the preferred home builders in Kelowna’s Wilden master-planned community, was recognized at Large Volume Single-Family Home Builder of the Year. 
 
And Vineyard Developments was named Small Volume Single-Family Home Builder of the Year for its custom homes.
