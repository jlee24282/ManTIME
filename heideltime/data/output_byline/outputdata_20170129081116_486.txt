The night was filled with some RAD moments from all of the performances of the night, amazing fan reactions, special guests, and more. Check out the best moments from the show below: 
 Candace Cameron Bure -- AKA D.J. TANNER -- Helped Kick Off The Night By Introducing New Kids On The Block  
In case you didn’t know, Candace is a huge NKOTB fan, and has been <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P30Y" mod="MORE_THAN">over the last 30 years</TIMEX3>. The band and Bure united on her show Fuller House , so there was no one better to introduce the band and kick off the show than D.J. Tanner herself. 
   New Kids On The Block Brought All The Right Stuff  
New Kids On The Block are one of the O.G. boybands, and after <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="P30Y" mod="MORE_THAN">over 30 years</TIMEX3> of performing together, the guys still have  the right stuff . NKOTB took the stage to perform hits like “Step By Step,” “You Got It (The Right Stuff),” and more, and brought all of their amazing dance moves with them. And yes, we’re talking about those classic steps you learned from watching their music videos. 
 Also, the NKOTB fans were out in FULL FORCE. Donnie couldn’t resist…  Starship Reminds Us “We are all citizens of the world.”  
At the very end of their performance at the 2017 iHeart80s Party, which also happened to be the day as President Donald Trump’s Immigration Ban which sparked protests across the country, Starship lead singer Mickey Thomas simply told the crowd, “Remember, we are all citizens of the world.”

— iHeartRadio (@iHeartRadio) <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">January 29, 2017</TIMEX3>  Rick Astley Opened His Set With A Classic Rickroll  
Astley kicked off his set with a classic Rickroll by leading fans to believe he was going to open with “Never Gonna Give You Up” by having his band play the instrumentals, but instead he kicked things off with his Whenever You Need Somebody single “Together Forever.” Also during his set, the ‘<TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="198">80s</TIMEX3> icon, who turns 50 on <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2017-02-06">February 6th</TIMEX3>, made jokes about his age and blamed it for his lack of dance numbers and inability to play high-energy songs back-to-back. 
 UB40’s “Red Red Wine” Had Everybody Feeling So Fine  
UB40  Featuring Ali Campbell, Astro and Mickey  took us all back to <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="1983">1983</TIMEX3> with their hit “Red Red Wine.” The crowd went wild during the band’s performance of the beloved tune -- everybody was feeling it.
