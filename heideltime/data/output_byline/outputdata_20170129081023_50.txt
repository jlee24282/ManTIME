Australian selectors should consider picking three spin bowlers in the Test team for <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-02">next month</TIMEX3>'s tour of India, according to retired paceman Mitchell Johnson. on <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TNI">Saturday night</TIMEX3>, a tournament where multiple spin-bowling options have been the norm, Johnson said he expected Test selectors to show an unprecedented amount of faith in their slow bowlers on the subcontinent.

Four spin bowlers will be taken on tour – incumbent Nathan Lyon, left-arm orthodox pair Steve O'Keefe and Ashton Agar, and rookie leg spinner Mitchell Swepson.

Johnson predicted Lyon would lead the attack, but said Australia must adapt to the conditions and utilise their considerable spin bowling contingent.

"They [Indian pitches] are bunsen burners at the moment, they've been turning a fair bit, South Africa lost a Test series there," Johnson said.

"It's going to be very interesting ... I don't know whether they go for two or three spinners in a Test.

"I've just got a feeling we'll see something different, something maybe special. We'll see a very different side to what we're normally used to – we're going to see more spin bowling over there.

"That's a good thing because you've got to play the conditions in India. The stats say that our quicks are better over there but mostly it's the quicks that bowl over there, we don't really bowl a lot of spin.

"It was Shane Warne before that and over the last 10 or so years there's been a lot of changes with our spin bowling."

Australia lost their last Test tour of India 4-0, and not a single member of the Australian team has won a Test in the country.

Not since <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2004">2004</TIMEX3> when Warne was rubbing shoulders with Adam Gilchrist, Matthew Hayden and Glenn McGrath has Australia won a series in India. 

Johnson played seven Tests there without success before retiring from the longer form of the game at <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2016-SU" mod="START">the start of last summer</TIMEX3>.

After some significant arm-twisting by Scorchers coach Justin Langer, the fearsome left-arm quick was enticed to have a season in the BBL and his signing proved a masterstroke.

He saved his best two performances for last, claiming a record 3-3 in the semi-final win over the Melbourne Stars before finishing with 1-13 in his side's towering nine-wicket win over the hapless Sixers.

"It's just a really good tournament, I was probably one that never embraced Twenty20 cricket when I was playing international cricket but <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> that's all I'm playing, that's very enjoyable," Johnson said.

"The crowds are amazing too. That was one thing that I probably noticed throughout this Big Bash is the crowd and support and talking to the guys – random punters coming up and saying 'I hope you have a good season' to guys that don't have the profile.

"To get that experience and that exposure through the Big Bash, it's great for them."

And icing the cake on the Scorchers' third Big Bash title, Johnson said he planned on returning to the competition <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2018">next year</TIMEX3>.

"I only want to do it if I'm going to perform and I guess <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017">this year</TIMEX3> was a bit of a see how it sort of goes," Johnson said.

"JL [Langer] was really good with me throughout, he just said: 'Come and have fun mate, there's no pressure, you're not the No.1 strike-bowler we just want you to go and have fun and enjoy it and whatever happens happens'.

"It turns out that competitiveness in me is still there so if the body holds up and I'm bowling well then yeah. It seems like fresh is best."
