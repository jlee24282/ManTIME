Thee Auld Floozie's first Group I victory could earn her a another start in the top flight or a well deserved break. 
 
<TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P1D" mod="MORE_THAN">More than 24 hours</TIMEX3> after her scorching win in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>'s Thorndon Mile at Trentham, Cambridge trainer Stephen Marsh remained undecided on what her next step will be. 
 
A five-year-old daughter of Mastercraftsman, Thee Auld Floozie holds a nomination for the $400,000 Group I Herbie Dyke Stakes (2000m) at Te Rapa but there is no decision on whether she will take her spot at this stage. 
 
"I'm still thinking about the Herbie Dyke, there's 400,000 reasons to be there, but I'm not sure," Marsh said.  
 
  
   
   
   
   
   
 
"I'm considering sending her for a break, we'll see in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="PXD">the next few days</TIMEX3>." 
 
The Group I scalp is a huge feather in the cap of part owners John and Sue Young, who bred Thee Auld Floozie out of their good race mare Thee Auld Hussie. 
 
Rosie Myers gave Thee Auld Floozie a perfect trip on the rail before she hit the go button and let the mare's explosive turn of foot finish the job off. 
 
Thee Auld Floozie beat home Prince Of Passion by a length and a half with the same margin back to Abidewithme in third. 
 
Marsh started four runners in the race with Serious Satire finishing fifth and Seize The Moment (11th) and Ruud Not Too (14th) finishing back in the field. 
 
In the other feature at Trentham, a potential New Zealand Oaks contender was unveiled when the Murray Baker and Andrew Forsman-trained Nicoletta scored a short head victory in the Group III Desert Gold Stakes. 
 
Nicoletta beat home Devise with another Baker-Forsman runner Bonneval a further one and a half lengths back in third.
