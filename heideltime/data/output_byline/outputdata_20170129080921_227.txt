President Donald Trump said in a new interview <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3> that persecuted Christians will be given priority over other refugees seeking to enter the United States, saying they have been "horribly treated,’’ – the CNN reports. 
Speaking with the Christian Broadcasting Network, Trump said that it had been "impossible, or at least very tough" for Syrian Christians to enter the United States. 

"If you were a Muslim you could come in, but if you were a Christian, it was almost impossible and the reason that was so unfair -- everybody was persecuted, in all fairness -- but they were chopping off the heads of everybody but more so the Christians. And I thought it was very, very unfair. So we are going to help them." 

Trump did not name a reason or offer any evidence about why the agencies that vet refugees, including the Department of Homeland Security and the State Department, would have prioritized Muslim refugees over Christians. 

According to a report by the non-partisan Pew Research Center, however, 99% of the nearly 12,600 Syrians granted refugee status <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3> were Muslims. Less than 1% were Christian. Syria's population is 87% Muslim and 10% Christian, according to the CIA World Fact Book. 

Also on <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3>, Trump signed an executive order explicitly freezing refugee applications from Syria. It's unclear how his pledge to help persecuted Christians from that country will accord with the order, the CNN reports.
