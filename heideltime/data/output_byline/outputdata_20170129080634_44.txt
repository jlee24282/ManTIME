What some may think of as only possible in science fiction movies is actually happening on the Coast Guard base in Elizabeth City. Members of the Aviation Logistics Center’s Industrial Operations Division are utilizing emergent technology to design and create prototypes and components for aircraft. 
 
The Industrial Operations Division, or IOD staff use Computer Aided Design and a 3D printer to create non-structural and non-flight critical components for aircraft – which saves the Coast Guard time and money. 
 
IOD members create the components using additive manufacturing – a process using a series of additive or layered framework to create solid objects. The Fortus 400mc 3D printer allows users to manufacture parts in-house using multiple production-grade thermoplastics. 
 
Bryan Derr is the production controller and contract program manager for the CAD/CAM shop in the IOD, said the technology has been around for a while, 
 
“We started looking at 3D printers <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2005" mod="APPROX">about 12 years ago</TIMEX3>, but we never really thought of it in a production aspect,” Derr said. 
 
When the first 3D printer came to ALC, there were just two people working with it. <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Today</TIMEX3>, six people are qualified to use the <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> machine, acquired <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2014" mod="APPROX">about three years ago</TIMEX3>. 
 
The original idea was to use the machine to create prototypes for testing, which would save time and money. Once the Coast Guard approved the design of a plastic prototype, the part could then be made out of other materials, such as metal or fiberglass. <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">Recently</TIMEX3> the division began also producing parts that could be used in their <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> form. Production began with simple components and progressed to more complex designs. 
 
<TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> the division is using the technology for the design and production of components, as well as manufacturing specialized tooling needed for the Aviation Logistics Center’s systems overhaul process for all of the Coast Guard’s aircraft. 
 
The IOD members work closely with the product line managers and engineers from ALC to develop non-structural aircraft components. Those components range from satellite phone mounts, to circuit breaker panels for all aircraft in the Coast Guard aviation fleet. 
 
There are a handful of components that are re-ordered multiple times for production, and Derr said the demand for production continues to increase. Some products can be used in plastic form, instead of metal, such as seat rails for aircraft armrests and vent covers for the interior of an aircraft. 
 
As the aircraft continue to age, the need for replacement components will also increase. 
 
“The demand and cost to support these aircraft is going to continue to grow,” Derr said. 
 
IOD members use computer-aided design, which replaces manual drafting with an automated process. They utilize SolidWorks, a program also used at the Coast Guard Academy to teach engineering students about the computer-aided design. 
 
The technology is continually changing, said Derr, who also spent <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="P5Y">five years</TIMEX3> teaching in the Engineering Technology Program at the College of the Albemarle’s Regional Aviation and Technical Training Center in Barco. Three of his former students who graduated from the COA program are <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> working in the Industrial Operations Division. 
 
Josh Baker is one of those graduates and works as drafter and programmer in engineering support in IOD. Baker graduated from COA <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3> with an Associate of Arts degree in applied science for mechanical engineering and began working on base <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2016-08" mod="APPROX">about five months ago</TIMEX3>. 
 
“A lot of what we do is reverse engineering, really,” Baker said. “We are often presented with a known part, and tasked with figuring out how to make it and creating plans to do so.” 
 
Derek Blackford, also a drafter and programmer in engineering support for IOD, said the technology saves the division time. 
 
“We can stock the printer with two canisters of plastic and it can print for the entire weekend,” Blackford said. 
 
It also saves the Coast Guard money, he said, noting that a part that might cost more than $300 if made of metal, including costs for the milling machine and manual labor, might cost only $5 if made out plastic in the machine. 
 
“We’re interested in anything we can do to save money and time and test ahead of time,” Blackford said. 
 
Division members create plastic prototypes, which are tested and approved, then manufactured from metal or other materials. 
 
“If someone brings us a part and asks us to make drawings and the prototype, we have the technology to do that,” Blackford said. 
 
Derr said the technology helps from a logistics standpoint, in that components can be made much faster in the machine, and printing components also saves space. Because the machine can create parts as they are needed, it’s not necessary to have as much warehouse space for storing parts for future use, he said. 
 
IOD members are routinely seeking out new training and collaboration, Derr said. 
 
“It’s such a new and emergent technology, and it’s developing rapidly,” he said. “There’s not a lot of formal analysis and specifications within the military aviation community.” 
 
Members of IOD periodically meet with others utilizing the emergent technologies, including Navy personnel in Virginia, for think-tank sessions to share information, thoughts and ideas about the new technology. 
 
“When we meet with them I get the sense that they are very impressed with the fact that we are able to produce what we do,” said Derr, a native of Elizabeth City whose father served in the Coast Guard for <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DURATION" value="P32Y">32 years</TIMEX3>. 
 
“My long-term goal is to continue to be at the forefront of this rapidly developing technology and ensure that we continue to lead the way in how it can be integrated into the Coast Guard’s primary mission capabilities by constantly pushing the boundaries of what the technology has to offer,” he said.
