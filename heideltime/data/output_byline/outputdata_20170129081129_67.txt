A new race to space is on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017">this year</TIMEX3> — a private-sector one, among the five finalists in the Google Lunar XPRIZE competition. 
 
To stay in the race, each team must initiate its moon launch by <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-12-31">Dec. 31, 2017</TIMEX3>. To win, its craft must land on luna — and a probe must move at least 500 meters (1,640 feet) and send hi-resolution images of its exploration back to earth. 
 
The winner gets the $20 million grand prize, while runners-up split a $1 million consolation award. 
 
It’s already taking a bit longer than hoped — rules that required a complete finish by the <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2016-12-31">Dec. 31</TIMEX3> deadline just got loosened to give the competitors a bit more time. 
 
But the goal is still remarkable: landing a high-tech mobile probe on the moon, 238,900 miles away. The Chinese government, with all its vast resources and desire to win global respect, pulled it off in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2013">2013</TIMEX3> — but the last (non-crash) landing before that was in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="1976">1976</TIMEX3>. 
 
The five teams include one international one, Synergy Moon, with members from 15-plus countries, as well as the Israeli SpaceIL, the California-based Moon Express, India’s Team Indus and Japan’s Hakuto. 
 
Each has its rocket booked (Team Indus and Hakuto are actually sharing their flight) and the contract verified by X Prize, which sponsors a variety of technical contests aimed at building a better future. 
 
Established in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2007">2007</TIMEX3>, the competition is meant to push a lowering of the cost of spaceflight — while also inspiring the world’s scientists and engineers. 
 
Once this competition is won, it’ll be time for a race to get live astronauts back to luna: It’s been far too long (<TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P45Y">45 years</TIMEX3>!) since the late Gene Cernan walked on the moon. 
 
Government programs alone will never establish a real human presence off-planet: That will require a private sector that can make it pay. The Google Lunar XPRIZE promises a giant step toward that brilliant future.
