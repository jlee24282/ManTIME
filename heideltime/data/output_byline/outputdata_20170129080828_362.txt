There was a little bit of confusion about the score midway through <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2016-Q3">the third quarter</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Jan. 28</TIMEX3> and, after some discussion between coaches and officials, it was decided that Salem was leading Ozark 34-31. Bre Johnson and Mikayla Putt made sure it didnâ€™t stay that way for very long.
