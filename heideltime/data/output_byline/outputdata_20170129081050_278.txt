An alleged drink-driver left their car upside down in the middle of the street with glass strewn across the road after crashing into TWO parked cars. 
 
Police officers said the driver recorded a reading of 55 micrograms in an alcohol breath test - which is over the drink-drive limit in England - after the overnight Allestree crash. 
 
The picture was posted online by Derbyshire police's roads team which keeps Twitter users up to date with a surprising amount of serious - and sometimes humorous - incidents. 
 
The tweet read: "Allestree. Driver collides with two parked cars. Provides a roadside breath sample of 55ųg # DontDrinkAndDrive ."
