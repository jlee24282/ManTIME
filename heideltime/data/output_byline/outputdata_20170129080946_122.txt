Hey, “ Stranger Things ” and “ Atlanta ”: Do you know that you have a rule switch to thank for your victories at the <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> Producers Guild Awards ? After years of the PGA Awards heeding to the Emmys’ schedule of nominating programs airing between <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2016-06-01">June 1</TIMEX3> of <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">one year</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2016-05-31">May 31</TIMEX3> of the next, the producers guild decided to change the eligibility period <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017">this year</TIMEX3>. And these two shows benefited big league in the new system. 
 
For this ceremony only, there was a year-and-a-half eligibility on the TV side, from <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2015-06">June 2015</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2016-12">December 2016</TIMEX3>, meaning newcomers “Stranger Things” and “Atlanta” were allowed to compete despite not being seen yet by the Emmys. Next year’s eligibility will change yet again, likely for good, when the cycle of contention for TV programs will be the strict calendar year of <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2017-01">January</TIMEX3> through <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2017-12">December</TIMEX3> .
