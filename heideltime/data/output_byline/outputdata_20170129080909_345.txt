Billings Skyview's drive home from Bozeman was a long one. 

The top-ranked Falcons fell to the third-ranked Hawks in double-overtime <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="TIME" value="2017-01-27TNI">Friday night</TIMEX3>, and didn't get back into Billings until <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28T01:00">1 a.m. Saturday</TIMEX3>.

The team had a shoot-around at <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28T09:00">9 a.m.</TIMEX3>, but then held a team breakfast at Montana Jacks to lighten the mood.

Skyview coach Kevin Morales said that was a turning point for the team's spirits.

"That kind of set the tone and gave us a good feel," he said. "We got back to smiling and laughing and joking around again. That was important for us to get our heads back straight and understand that losses happen, and if anything, Bozeman's a dang good team for us to drop one too.

"I felt like the kids did a good job of responding <TIMEX3 tid="t34" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3>."

Full highlight reel from <TIMEX3 tid="t35" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29TNI">tonight</TIMEX3>'s matchup between the @SkyviewFalcons and @LaurelLocos1 #mtscores pic.twitter.com/s8pIczENXz

That response led the Falcons (9-1, 4-1) to bouncing back from <TIMEX3 tid="t36" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3>'s loss with a 52-38 grind-it-out victory over the surging Class A Laurel Locomotives (8-3, 5-1) in Skyview's gym. 

RayQuan Evans led all scorers with 23 points in a game where fouls were aplenty. The teams combined for 51 free throws, 35 by Skyview.

It wasn't a pretty win, but it was a win nonetheless.

"It was much needed," Evans said. "We were all kind of bummed out <TIMEX3 tid="t37" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TNI">last night</TIMEX3> and we knew what Laurel would bring. This is a big one being on our home court so we really wanted to get this one."

Senior Jerelle Big Hair, who has seen some big minutes off of the bench for the Falcons lately, knocked down a 3-pointer right before <TIMEX3 tid="t38" type="DATE" value="2017-Q1">the first quarter</TIMEX3> ended, giving Skyview a 13-12 lead. The Falcons never trailed again.

Evans took over in <TIMEX3 tid="t39" type="DATE" value="2016-Q2">the second quarter</TIMEX3>, scoring 11 of his points in the period to give Skyview a 28-20 halftime lead. Zharon Richmond also added 10 points for the Falcons. 

The Falcons sealed the win with a poster dunk from Evans with <TIMEX3 tid="t41" type="DURATION" value="PT1M">about a minute</TIMEX3> left in the game.

For Skyview, it was nice to get back in the win column. 

"Losing a tough game like that, especially in double-overtime, it's tough, but it's always onto the next, even if it's a win," Evans said. 

Christian Jones had nine points to lead Laurel. The Locomotives, who took down Hardin 66-60 on <TIMEX3 tid="t43" type="DATE" value="2017-01-26">Thursday</TIMEX3>, saw their seven-game winning streak snapped. 

Laurel starter Layne Willis missed the game due to sickness.

"The bottom line is we told our kids is we're disappointed with the fire in our belly and our effort <TIMEX3 tid="t44" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29TNI">tonight</TIMEX3>," Laurel coach Pat Hansen said. "I don't think individually our kids came out trying to play their best basketball and we don't do that against a good team like Skyview. This is the result that happens."
