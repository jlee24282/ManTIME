HUNTINGTON - UTEP had one of those nights, and so did the Marshall Thundering Herd. 
   
UTEP made 57.8 of its shots while Marshall had its poorest shooting night this season at 34.5 percent. Matt Willms of the Miners tossed in 25 points, the same as Terrence Thompson for Marshall, and the Miners rolled to a 91-68 men's basketball victory <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TNI">Saturday night</TIMEX3> before a Cam Henderson Center crowd of 6,781 spectators. 
   
Willms, a 7-foot-1 junior, sank 11 of his 15 shots and led UTEP (6-14 season, 4-4 Conference USA) to a whopping 60-32 advantage on points in the paint. UTEP also got backcourt scoring from guards Dominic Artis (24) and Omega Harris (13). Artis, a 6-3 senior, also had 11 rebounds. 
   
"They probably looked at our record and thought we stunk, which for the most part we have <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017">this year</TIMEX3>," said UTEP head coach Tim Floyd. 
   
Marshall's season win streak at home ended at 11 games. The Herd fell to a 13-9 season record and a 6-3 conference mark. 
   
Thompson, a 6-7 junior, established career highs for points and rebounds with 10. Marshall forward Ryan Taylor scored 14 before fouling out with 5:36 left in the game and collected eight rebounds. Junior point guard Jon Elmore scored 11, grabbed five rebounds and delivered six assists. 
   
The Herd's highlight was senior guard Austin Loop breaking the school career record for 3-point field goals. 
   
Loop tied Tamar Slay's record of 251 the first time he touched the basketball. He became the all-time leader with 252 with a shot from the top of the foul circle at 1:40 of <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-H1">the first half</TIMEX3>. 
   
"It felt good at the time," said Loop, who scored seven and was 2-for-5 shooting 3-pointers. "It was a big relief off my shoulders. 
   
"Honestly, <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">right now</TIMEX3> it's not on my mind." 
   
UTEP hit 60.6 percent of its field goals in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-H1">the first half</TIMEX3> (20 of 33) and pulled away, 45-35. 
   
Marshall, the nation's eighth-highest scoring team with 88 points a game, connected on 32.3 percent in <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2017-H1">the first half</TIMEX3> and 34.5 percent in the second period. The Herd made a season-low three 3-point baskets in 25 attempts for 12.0 percent, which was also a season low. 
   
Thompson's free throws with 17:00 left to play pulled Marshall as close as 46-44 before UTEP stretched the margin to 25 points with 1:22 remaining. 
   
"Obviously it wasn't a great shooting night for us," Marshall head coach Dan D'Antoni said. 
   
Marshall's next game is <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2017-01-26">Thursday</TIMEX3> at Southern Miss. UAB won at home <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> against Southern Miss, 87-43.
