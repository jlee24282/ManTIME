ATLANTA (TNS) — Georgia Tech is not to be trifled with. 
   
The Yellow Jackets took down their third top-25 team <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>, dropping No. 14 Notre Dame by a 62-60 score at McCamish Pavilion. 
   
In a taut matchup in which neither team led by more than 10 points, the outcome was decided in the final minute. Guard Josh Okogie, whose playing time was limited to <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="PT18M">18 minutes</TIMEX3> because of foul trouble, scored the game-winning basket on a layup as time expired, eliciting a full-throated roar from the Tech crowd. With the scored tied at 60, Okogie had missed two free throws with 35.8 seconds remaining, giving Notre Dame a chance to take the lead. 
   
However, guard Matt Farrell missed a tough jumper, which was rebounded by guard Tadric Jackson, who dribbled upcourt before finding Okogie. 
   
Okogie raced in from the wing, barely beating the buzzer. 
   
Before a full house that included Tech legends Bobby Cremins and Jarrett Jack, Tech built on their <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-01-25">Wednesday</TIMEX3> upset of No. 6 Florida State with another exemplary defensive performance. Notre Dame, which came into the game shooting 46.9 percent from the field, was held to 40.4 percent on 23-for-57 shooting. 
   
Tech (13-8 overall, 5-4 ACC) has beaten three AP top-25 teams: North Carolina, Florida State and Notre Dame, all at McCamish. Notre Dame (17-5, 6-3) was held to its second lowest point total of the season. 
   
Jackson led the Jackets with a career-high 25 points, scoring on drives, post-ups and from the perimeter. Center Ben Lammers went all <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="PT40M">40 minutes</TIMEX3> for the first time in his career and added 15 points with 10 rebounds, three assists and five blocks. It was his 11th double-double of the season. Guard Josh Heath handed out eight assists and came up with five steals, a career high. 
   
Notre Dame led 19-9 at the 11:47 mark of <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-H1">the first half</TIMEX3>, but the Jackets began to assert themselves defensively. Tech gained the lead for first time at 26-25 with 4:54 left in the half. 
   
Miami 77, N. Carolina 62 
   
CORAL GABLES, Fla. (TNS) — North Carolina has often played with the kind of offensive brilliance this season that has left school officials flipping through the record book, searching for perspective. There was some searching again on <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> — but only to see where the Tar Heels’ <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-H1">first-half</TIMEX3> misery might have ranked. 
   
One of the worst first halves in <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> UNC history doomed the Tar Heels to a 77-62 defeat at Miami. The loss, which replaced the one at Georgia Tech as UNC’s ugliest of the season, brought an end to the Tar Heels’ seven-game winning streak. 
   
UNC played without Theo Pinson, the 6-foot-6 junior who watched from the bench while he wore a protective boot over his right foot. Pinson, the Tar Heels’ versatile forward who often provides energy, was undoubtedly missed against Miami. 
   
So, too, was the Tar Heels’ shot-making ability and offensive rhythm. UNC (19-4, 7-2 ACC) entered the Watsco Center as one of the best offensive teams in the country, averaging nearly 90 points per game. After taking an early 11-2 lead, though, the Tar Heels had no answers for Miami’s 2-3 zone. 
   
The Hurricanes (14-6, 4-4), led by freshman Bruce Brown and his 30 points, needed <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="PT4M" mod="LESS_THAN">less than four minutes</TIMEX3> to erase their early nine-point deficit. Once Miami seized that lead it grew quickly, thanks in large part to a defensive performance that was every bit as good as UNC’s offense was bad. 
   
Duke 85, Wake Forest 83 
   
WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (TNS) — In desperate need of a win and a team leader, No. 17 Duke got both <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> thanks to Luke Kennard. 
   
The sophomore scored 34 points and hit the game-winning shot with 6.6 seconds left giving Duke an 85-83 comeback win over Wake Forest at Joel Coliseum. 
   
Kennard scored 30 points in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2016-H2">the second half</TIMEX3>, and scored 11 points in the final 3:40 as Duke (16-5, 4-4) overcame Wake Forest’s 81-71 lead. 
   
Duke shot 63 percent in <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2016-H2">the second half</TIMEX3>. 
   
Duke trailed by 10 points at halftime and the lead remained that margin as the Deacons held an 81-71 lead with 4:01 to play. 
   
But Kennard wouldn’t allow Duke to go down. He hit a 3-pointer and, after a Wake Forest offensive foul, drilled a deep two to cut the deficit in half. 
   
Keyshawn Woods nailed a 16-foot jump shot for Wake Forest but Kennard answered with a 3-pointer at 1:49 to slice Wake’s lead to 83-79. 
   
Duke forced the Demon Deacons into a shot clock violation after Woods airballed a 3-pointer. 
   
The Blue Devils worked to find an open shot, with Grayson Allen draining a 3-pointer with 52.5 seconds left leaving Wake Forest up 83-82. 
   
Wood misfired on a contested 3-pointer with <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DURATION" value="PT23S">23 seconds</TIMEX3> left, setting the stage for Kennard’s 3-pointer with 6.6 left that gave Duke an 85-83 lead.
