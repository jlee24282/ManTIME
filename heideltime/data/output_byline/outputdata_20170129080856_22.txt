Sony has a couple of smartphones in the pipeline, which are readied for a <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2016-02">February</TIMEX3> unveil. The Japanese company is expected to announce a flagship smartphone at Mobile World Congress (MWC), but also a few mid-range devices that will go alongside the high-end device. 
 
One of the mid-range handsets that could be announced <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-02">next month</TIMEX3> is the Sony G3121. The phone is said to be the Xperia XA's successor , but other than that we didn't know too many things about it. 
 
Luckily, someone made of video of a Sony G3121prototype and published it on YouTube, so we <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> know what the phone will look like. Unfortunately, the person who uploaded the video did not offer any details about the phone's specs aside from the fact that it does not come with fingerprint sensor. 
 
A fingerprint sensor on a a mid-range smartphone would have been highly unlikely anyway. One other piece of information that we've learned about watching the video is that the G3121 will definitely ship with Android 7.0 Nougat operating system right out of the box, which isn't surprising considering we're in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3>. 
 
Design-wise, the G3121 retains the same design specific to Sony smartphones, which implies large bezels and rather thick form factor. The phone features on-screen buttons as well, and we can see there's a microSD card slot on the left side for memory expansion. 
 
The rear camera has been positioned on the upper left corner, not in the middle as most smartphones do. It's got a single, small LED flash, which should be enough for a mid-range device. Sony G3121 does look to be made of plastic, while the front side is covered with glass. 
 
The mid-range smartphone comes with a dedicated camera button and a volume rocker on the right side. The power key is positioned near the volume button, on the right side. 
 
The size of the display is unknown for the moment, but we believe this is a 5-inch display that supports HD (720p) resolution. We expect more info about the Xperia XA successor's specs to emerge in the <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="FUTURE_REF">coming days</TIMEX3>, so stay tuned.
