By DOVER — The owner of a new business, soon to open on Third Street, will try to use space in her store to help those affected by the opioid crisis. 
 
Dianne Chalifour, 48, will open Earth Harmony Wellness at 66 Third St. <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-02-11">Feb. 11</TIMEX3>. The business is divided between retail, services and workshops – all aimed at providing holistic approaches to healthy living. Chalifour says one of her passions in life is working with children. 
 
“When I look out into the world, there’s a lot of challenges that the future generation faces,” she said. “It’s staring us in the face <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">right now</TIMEX3>.” 
 
One of those challenges is the heroin and opioid crisis, which Chalifour has a personal connection with. She said her niece was addicted to heroin, and Chalifour wants to do what she can to prevent others from going down that road, and to help those who are on the road to recovery. 
 
“I began to think, ‘What makes somebody turn to a drug or any other substance,’” she said. “It’s a need that you have to fill. But when you are able to realize that everything you need is inside of you, you will never need anything outside.” 
 
Chalifour hopes to use techniques like meditation and other methods of spiritual, mental and emotional healing to help people “know themselves and find inner happiness,” so that they hopefully do not feel as much of a need to turn to outside sources. 
 
"If we can offer some tools to help them and aid them in the process, I think that is very important," she said. 
 
Chalifour lives in Dover with her husband and three children, ages 10, 11 and 16. The family moved to the Garrison City from Massachusetts in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2015-06">June 2015</TIMEX3>. She previously had a holistic center in Wakefield, Massachusetts, but the business lacked a retail space. 
 
She said she is excited to offer workshops, massages, infrared spa treatments and other services, while being able to sell items at the “Oasis Retail Shoppe” that will help customers achieve spiritual wellness at home. Retail items include herbs, essential oils, decorations and products to aid in meditation and wellness at home. 
 
Apart from the retail space, Earth Harmony will feature two unique rooms – one called the Energy, Healing and Clearing room and one the Massage room. Each will feature Himalayan rock salt panels and a canvas mural. 
 
The space also has an infrared sauna, which Chalifour said is healthier and more comfortable than normal heat saunas. 
 
“It heats from the inside out, so it does not feel as uncomfortably hot on the outside,” she said. “It also helps improve circulation and detoxes the body because it focuses inside.” 
 
Headed upstairs to the meditation and healing space, there is a small altar Chalifour hopes will help clients find peace. She says her approach does not focus on one religion or belief, but instead emphasizes humanity as a whole. 
 
“It’s important for us to recognize that we’re not separate in the world, but everybody is one,” she said. 
 
Chalifour said she became interested in holistic wellness when she worked at a chiropractic office and learned about the body's ability to heal itself. 
 
"That really resonated with me," she said.  
 
She then began to learn about clinical herbalism and meditation and has been spreading the word about her approaches to wellness ever since. 
 
"The medical establishment can be very effective with certain things," she said. "But there is more to health than just physical health. Instead of treating symptoms, we look at how to heal the whole body." 
 
Earth Harmony will hold its grand opening <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-02-11">Feb. 11</TIMEX3> from <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="TIME" value="2017-02-11T10:00">10 a.m.</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="TIME" value="2017-02-11T18:00">6 p.m.</TIMEX3> For more information, visit earthharmonywellness.com.
