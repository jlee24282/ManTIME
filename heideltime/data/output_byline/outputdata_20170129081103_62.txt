By Dear Jerry:  
 
The <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> celebrated Martin Luther King, Jr. holiday has me confused.  
 
After spending most of my life in Galena, Ill., I moved <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3> to an assisted living community in Dubuque, Iowa. Regarding the MLK Jr. holiday, I am panicked that my mind may be playing tricks on me. After reading “Ask Jerry” for <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="PXY">many years</TIMEX3>, I am optimistic you will settle my concern. Here is the issue.  
 
<TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-01" mod="START">Earlier this month</TIMEX3>, my new senior-citizen neighbors and I were watching the Martin Luther King, Jr. holiday observances. There was a fair amount of coverage on television. It mentioned that MLK Jr. Day did not become a holiday until <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="1983">1983</TIMEX3>. Unless my mind is totally disappearing from reality, I have a clear recollection that we celebrated <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2017-01-16">Martin Luther King, Jr. Day</TIMEX3> during <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="197" mod="MID">the mid-1970s</TIMEX3>.  
 
Am I totally losing my memory?

Dear Mary:  
 
Your memory sounds excellent to me. When you lived in Galena, Illinois, you happen to reside in the first state to observe <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2017-01-16">Martin Luther King, Jr. Day</TIMEX3> as an official holiday. It was <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="1973">1973</TIMEX3> when Illinois adopted it as a state holiday.  
 
<TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DURATION" value="P4D">Four days</TIMEX3> after the assassination of The Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. (<TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="1968">1968</TIMEX3>), legislation was introduced to make MLK Jr. Day a federal holiday. However, it took <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DURATION" value="P15Y">15 years</TIMEX3> before legislation was passed (<TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="1983">1983</TIMEX3>). Then, it was another <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DURATION" value="P3Y">three years</TIMEX3> before the legislation and MLK Jr. Day were in effect (<TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="1986">1986</TIMEX3>).  
 
The holiday was not observed immediately in all 50 states though DC, like Illinois, observed it officially before it became a national holiday. Following a tourist boycott, Arizona approved the holiday in <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="1992">1992</TIMEX3>. New Hampshire, the last state to acknowledge <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2017-01-16">Martin Luther King, Jr. Day</TIMEX3> in its own right, did not adopt the holiday until <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="1999">1999</TIMEX3>. It was <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DURATION" value="P13Y">13 years</TIMEX3> after it became a federal holiday that New Hampshire actually changed the name of its Civil Rights Day to <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2017-01-16">Martin Luther King, Jr. Day</TIMEX3>. Obviously, this holiday did not happen instantly across the United States.  
 
Even <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">today</TIMEX3>, there are three southern states that combine <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2017-01-16">Martin Luther King, Jr. Day</TIMEX3> with Robert E. Lee Day. Those are Alabama, Arkansas, and Mississippi. Albeit controversial, that one-stop holiday still exists in those states.  
 
In fact, many variations have occurred throughout the country and over the years. For example, the Commonwealth of Virginia merged the commemoration of Robert E. Lee, Thomas J. (“Stonewall”) Jackson, and Martin Luther King, Jr. into one holiday. Although the Lee and Jackson portion were subsequently separated from the King portion, Lee-Jackson-King Day was observed <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="SET" value="XXXX">annually</TIMEX3> in Virginia from <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="1984">1984</TIMEX3> through <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DATE" value="2000">2000</TIMEX3>.  
 
While hardly a comprehensive history, that would be a CliffsNotes version of the MLK Jr. holiday. Meanwhile, Mary, I am impressed that you recall events so specifically from <TIMEX3 tid="t34" type="DATE" value="197" mod="MID">the mid-1970s</TIMEX3>. Congratulations.
