Prince William and Prince Harry said it was the right time to "recognise her positive impact" both at home and abroad with the monument.

"It has been <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P20Y">20 years</TIMEX3> since our mother's death and the time is right to recognise her positive impact in the UK and around the world with a permanent statue," a statement from the princes said. 
Commissioned by her adoring sons, the statue of Princess Diana will be erected  in the public grounds of Kensington Palace, which was the centre of public tributes to "the people's princess" in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="1997">1997</TIMEX3>. 
"Our mother touched so many lives. We hope the statue will help all those who visit Kensington Palace to reflect on her life and her legacy." 

William was 15 and Harry just 12 when their mother was killed in a car crash in Paris on <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="1997-08-31">August 31, 1997</TIMEX3>.
