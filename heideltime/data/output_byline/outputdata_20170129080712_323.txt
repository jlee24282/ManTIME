<TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">Recently</TIMEX3> widowed at the time, Fran Rendulic was looking for a job when she read a newspaper advertisement for the Lifetime Learning program.

She applied for the job at Westmoreland County Community College’s Mon Valley Center in Rostraver Township.

Rendulic was offered a job, right across the street from the center’s Fells Church Road site, at the Rostraver Public Library.

By the end of her first day on the job, Rendulic wrote a thank you to Lifetime Learning.

<TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="XXXX" mod="APPROX">Nearly 26 years later</TIMEX3>, the library’s assistant director is preparing to retire at the end of the month.

Rendulic’s first day on the job was <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="1991-04-01">April 1, 1991</TIMEX3>. The library at the time was located in the former Fells Methodist Church.

‘When I started, we were only on the balcony (of the building),” Rendulic said. “The township offices were on the main floor. “We had less than 1,000 books. You signed them out in pencil.”

The library <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> utilizes Athena, a Windows-based library system, she said.

“When the township moved out, we moved downstairs,” Rendulic said.

The library would move to its new building on Plaza Drive in <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2007">2007</TIMEX3>.

<TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="P50Y">Fifty years</TIMEX3> after graduating from McKeesport High School, Rendulic earned an associate degree in business management from Westmoreland County Community College, in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2000">2000</TIMEX3>. She also holds a state certificate that permits her to direct a library which serves up to 15,000.

“I was just going to learn computers,” Rendulic said. “Our old library had one computer, which was brand new, and nobody used it. I learned Word Perfect and Lotus 1-2-3. I <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> use Excel.”

The library has been a perfect fit for Rendulic’s outgoing, friendly personality.

“I love people and I like to talk,” Rendulic said. “And I like the growth of the library.”

She said the township library draw patrons from Perryopolis, West Newton and parts of Allegheny County.

“I tell my kids you have to learn something new <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EVERY">every day</TIMEX3>,” Rendulic said. “Some people just sit at home, and that’s not good for your brain.”

On a typical day, Rendulic likes to catalog. At one time, she would type out each card for the catalog, but <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> she does the work on a computer.

She works Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays. At one time, she worked <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DURATION" value="PT32H">32 hours</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DURATION" value="P1W">a week</TIMEX3> but has had to cut back her hours.

“When you get old, you get old,” Rendulic said with a smile.

<TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> 84, Rendulic has lived in Rostraver Township for <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DURATION" value="P51Y">the past 51 years</TIMEX3>.

A <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="1950">1950</TIMEX3> graduate of McKeesport High School, she lived along Route 48 in McKeesport before the family home was condemned to widen the highway.

Rendulic’s parents Francis Fink and Louis Vodopivec immigrated to the U.S. from Slovenia in <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="192" mod="START">the early 1920s</TIMEX3>. The couple married in Greensburg in <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="1923">1923</TIMEX3> before settling in McKeesport.

In <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="1973">1973</TIMEX3>, she went back to Slovenia with her mother, visiting where her mother grew up and her father lived. Her mother’s house had been destroyed during World War II.

“It was under Communist control but we could go anywhere,” Rendulic said. “It was a good experience.”

Rendulic has brought together her love of books and her family.

In <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="2002">2002</TIMEX3>, she wrote a book, “Mom’s Cooking: Otherwise Known as Things I Don’t Make Anymore.” A copy of the book is in the Rostraver library.

She is <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> working on her family story, “My Story.”

It’s a large story. She is the mother of six. Frank Rendulic Jr., 63, lives in Dayton, Ohio; Louis Rendulic, 62, in Norfolk, Va.; Emma Hopeck, 58, in Library; Paul Rendulic, 56, and Frannie Rendulic, 53, both live with their mother; and Lisa Kingsbury, 48, in Los Angeles.

She also has four grandchildren and one great-grandchild.

In her spare time, Rendulic likes to crochet, read and play games on the computer.

Rendulic said she watches very little television, usually the news and Jeopardy, then she goes into her room to listen to KDKA radio.

She likes to send cards to famous people, whether condolence cards to the estates of Jackie Kennedy Onassis and Grace Kelly, or congratulations to Charles and Diane on their engagement.

It’s the people who draw Rendulic to her job at the library.

“I’ve met a lot of nice people here,” Rendulic said.

Her colleagues believe it has been a perfect fit for Rendulic.

“She’s been incredibly helpful for me adapting here,” library Director Naomi Cross.

“She’s made so many friends and brought a lot of people into the library,” added Kelly Yoskosky, children’s and adult programming coordinator.

“She maintains those friendships. She’ll be missed by a lot of people.”

In retirement, Rendulic plans to occupy her time on her computer and spend more time with her to son and daughter who live at home.

“It’s going to be interesting because I like to talk to people,” Rendulic said. “Maybe I can come and hang out at the library.”
