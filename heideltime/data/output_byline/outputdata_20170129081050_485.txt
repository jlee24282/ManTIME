Serena and Venus Williams both brought their A-game to the <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> Australian Open. Venus finished in second place after losing to her sister, Serena, who took home her twenty-third (!!) Grand Slam title on <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday, Jan. 28</TIMEX3>. But it wasn't the historic win or their sweet embrace after the match that made the moment so special. The sisters each spoke about their relationship and the power of sisterhood in their post-match speeches, which we suspect left almost everyone a little misty eyed. 
 
"Serena Williams, that's my little sister guys!" Venus boasted proudly, which prompted a rowdy applause. "Congratulations Serena on number 23. I have been right there with you. Some of them I lost right there against you. Your win has always been my win." Serena followed up with a loving speech of her own, thanking Venus for inspiring her "to be the best player" that she could be. Watch both of their moving speeches in full ahead.
