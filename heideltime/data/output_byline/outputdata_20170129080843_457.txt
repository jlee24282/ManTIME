We’ve all been there from time to time. You toss and turn, look at the clock and inevitably wake up feeling depleted. It makes it tough to stay awake during the day and focus on important tasks. Sleeplessness is a common problem in our busy society, and an ongoing lack of sleep can impact every part of a person’s life. 
 
A good night’s sleep helps the mind and body in many ways including avoiding excessive daytime fatigue, staying alert and focused, and strengthening the immune system, which also leads to better overall health, less sick days, and more productivity. 
 
A lack of good sleep can pack a host of consequences including negatively impacting decision making and memory retention abilities, decrease in reaction time, irritability, weight gain and general physical stress on the body which can increase the risk of heart disease, stroke and diabetes. 
 
Lack of sleep can also be dangerous for others, not just the person dealing directly with the issue. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, sleepy drivers cause more than 100,000 crashes each ear. Of those, 40,000 result in injuries, with 1,550 deaths. It only further highlights the importance of a good night’s sleep. 
 
If you need help to remedy a lack of quality sleep, here are a few suggestions: 
 
» Get into a bedtime routine that occurs at the same time <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EVERY">every day</TIMEX3>. Your body will automatically begin to “get sleepy” if you go to bed at the same time every night. 
 
» Exercise during the day. Get <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="PT20M" mod="EQUAL_OR_MORE">at least 20</TIMEX3>-<TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="PT30M">30 minutes</TIMEX3> of vigorous exercise daily. But don’t exercise too close to bedtime. It’s best to exercise <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="PT5H">five</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="PT6H">six hours</TIMEX3> before bedtime. 
 
» Try not to nap during the day. If you must take a nap, limit it to <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="PT20M" mod="EQUAL_OR_LESS">no more than 20 minutes</TIMEX3>. 
 
» Avoid stimulants like smoking or drinking coffee within <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="PT5H">five</TIMEX3> or <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="PT6H">six hours</TIMEX3> from when you want to go to bed.  Contrary to what you might think, alcohol can disrupt sleep as well. While it may cause you to fall asleep initially, it doesn’t allow for the more restful phases of sleep, not to mention that you may also have to get up in the night to use the bathroom. 
 
» Create a meditative and relaxing environment in your bedroom that is quiet and dark, and use the time getting ready for bed to calm your mind. This means that it is best to not have a television in the room. Also pick another room to charge your cell phone at night such as the kitchen or living room. 
 
If you’ve tried most, if not all, of these already and you are still struggling with fatigue from poor sleep, medication is rarely the best option to get a better night’s sleep. Even over-the-counter medications have risks, especially when used regularly. If you are using medication for sleep more than a couple times <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DURATION" value="P1M">a month</TIMEX3>, or if you find the suggestions above are not helping, it is worth mentioning at your next doctor’s appointment. There may be something more serious at play such as sleep apnea. 
 
Getting a good night’s sleep can help to improve cognitive function, increase awareness and provide more energy. A few simple tweaks to your sleeping routine could be the difference. You can learn more and download a more in-depth, interactive sleep management kit at kp.org/choosebetter .
