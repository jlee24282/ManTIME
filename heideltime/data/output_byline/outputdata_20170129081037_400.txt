SHARING an office space makes you susceptible to catching all manner of germs (especially this time of year). 
   
For the co-tenants of the Verizon Center, though, the only contagion at the moment seems to be success. 
   
Entering Sunday’s NHL all-star game, the Capitals are 13–1–2 in their last 16 games and, with 72 points, are on pace to earn their second straight Presidents Trophy. That makes them only slightly hotter than the Wizards, who have won 10 of their last 12 games and 14 straight at home. 
   
It’s a far cry from <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2016-12">last month</TIMEX3>, when both teams were struggling (at least by their standards). Each team’s ascent has been built on offensive production, but their postseason hopes will hinge on improved defense. 
   
The Capitals and their fans have learned, painfully, that regular-season success means nothing when the playoffs roll around. They’ve won the Presidents Trophy twice before (in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010">2010</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3>) and bowed out in the Eastern Conference semifinals each time. 
   
In fact, <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> that the Chicago Cubs have ended their century-long title drought, the Capitals may have the most nihilistic fan base in North American pro sports. Social media has been awash with fans wondering if Alexander Ovechkin and company are peaking too soon, 2½ months before the end of the regular season. 
   
A bigger concern should be keeping everyone healthy and rested. Ovechkin is 31, and while he’s still an elite goal scorer (only three players have more than his 23), he could use a few nights off between <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-04">April</TIMEX3> to save his legs for the playoffs, as the San Antonio Spurs used to do with Tim Duncan and the Cleveland Cavaliers do with LeBron James. His title window is slowly closing, so the Caps want him as fresh as possible in <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017-SP">the spring</TIMEX3>. 
   
The good news is that Washington doesn’t live and die with Ovechkin’s scoring quite as much as it once did. Seven other Capitals have at least 10 goals at the break, and for a change, all four lines are a threat to score. 
   
And in his third season, coach Barry Trotz seems to have found the happy medium between the breakneck style favored by former coach Bruce Boudreau and the grind-it-out mentality of his successor, Dale Hunter. The Capitals have allowed a league-low 102 goals, with Braden Holtby a strong candidate to win his second straight Vezina Trophy as the NHL’s top goalie. Yet they’ve scored at least five goals in nine of their past 13 games. 
   
Yes, the playoffs are a different animal, and the Capitals <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="SET" value="XXXX">annually</TIMEX3> seem to run into a hot opposing goalie. But they seem more constituted for a sustained postseason run than at any point in Ovechkin’s career. 
   
The Wizards face a clear obstacle in James’ defending NBA champion Cavaliers, but qualifying for the playoffs would be an improvement after missing them <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3>. And after beating likely playoff teams Charlotte and Boston on consecutive nights <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2017-W03">last week</TIMEX3>, they’re establishing themselves as contenders. 
   
Like the Caps, the Wizards can score. Entering Friday’s game, they had topped 100 points in 12 straight contests, and they ranked 10th in the league in scoring (106.6 points per game). 
   
Thanks to the Golden State Warriors, today’s NBA is a perimeter-oriented game, and the Wizards have one of the league’s better trios in John Wall, Bradley Beal and Otto Porter. Wall (23.1 points, 10.1 assists) would be an MVP candidate if it weren’t for the dazzling seasons enjoyed by James Harden and Russell Westbrook. Beal (21.9) has managed to stay healthy for a change, and Porter (14.2) is in the running for most improved player. 
   
The Wizards are still behind the NBA curve in quantity of 3-point shots; only four teams have attempted fewer. But they’re shooting a respectable 37 percent, with Porter leading the league at 46.5 percent and Wall slowly improving that facet of his game. 
   
Big men Marcin Gortat and Markeef Morris are competent complements to the perimeter trio. The Wizards will need to improve their defense (they allow 105.7 points per game) and get better production from the bench, but if they can manage to earn one of the Eastern Conference’s top four seeds, they’ll be tough to beat at home in the first round. 
   
That’s a long way off, and the hot streaks <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> being enjoyed by the Wizards and Capitals could disappear like a <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DURATION" value="P1D">24-hour</TIMEX3> virus before <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2017-SP">the spring</TIMEX3>. Still, long-suffering fans in D.C. must find it refreshing to see their both of their teams healthy in <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2017-01">January</TIMEX3>.
