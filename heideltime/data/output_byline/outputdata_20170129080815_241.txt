X Factor boss Simon Cowell is reportedly looking into claims The Voice is copying the 'Six Chair Challenge'. 
 
It's been claimed <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3> that the music mogul and his team are investigating into similarities between The X Factor's Six Chair Challenge and The Voice's new 'four chair challenge' format. 
 
The Six Chair Challenge was introduced to The X Factor back in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2013">2013</TIMEX3> and sees contestants battling for a seat at the judges' houses stage of the competition. If they are chosen to make the next round, they take a seat but can be replaced by another act. 
 
In The Voice's allegedly new similar format, in the battle rounds, acts who are chosen to be stolen after losing their battles take one of four seats. If a coach opts to steal again, the act in the chair is replaced by the newly stolen act. 
 
The new stage of The Voice will NOT appear on the UK version of the show <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017">this year</TIMEX3> after The X Factor's production company Fremantle stepped in, according to the Daily Mirror newspaper . 
 
But the tabloid reports that other European shows may be copying The X Factor with the change in format. 
 
"Simon listened to advice but decided to continue with his action against Talpa [who make The Voice]. He is speaking to lawyers who specialise in format protection," a source said. 
 
A spokesperson for Syco declined to comment on the report, however a source close to Simon told the newspaper: “Simon’s team identify what factors make any new shows different and what is intellectual property and copyright. This is normal practice.”
