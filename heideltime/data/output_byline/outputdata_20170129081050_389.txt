Flight SQ286 was meant to depart for Singapore at 1.30pm, but there was a problem with the front wheel of the Airbus A380. 
 
Auckland Airport said the flight was re-scheduled to depart <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="TIME" value="XXXX-XX-XXT17:00" mod="APPROX">about 5pm.</TIMEX3> It was then further delayed to <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="TIME" value="XXXX-XX-XXT20:00">8pm.</TIMEX3> 
 
At 9.15pm, the plane was still on the tarmac, but departure was thought to be imminent. 
 
The passengers were not allowed off the plane, but had been provided with food. 
 
Meanwhile, an Emirates flight from Dubai, via Melbourne, due to land at Auckland Airport just before <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="TIME" value="XXXX-XX-XXT14:00">2pm</TIMEX3>, was diverted to Ohakea Air Force Base. 
 
Auckland Airport is still waiting to hear from the airline why flight EK-406 - also an A380 - was diverted. 
 
It landed in Auckland just before 6.3
