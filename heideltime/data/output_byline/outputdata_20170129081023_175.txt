Paul Merson has suggested that Arsene Wenger’s touchline antics were a result of the uncertainty surrounding Mesut Ozil and Alexis Sanchez’s futures at Arsenal.  
Wenger has received a four-game touchline suspension after the Frenchman pushed a fourth official during Arsenal’s tense 2-1 win against Burnley at the Emirates Stadium <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-W03-WE">last weekend</TIMEX3>. 
 
Both Ozil and Sanchez are still in negotiations with the north London club about new contracts amid growing uncertainty surrounding whether Wenger’s key men will stay at Arsenal. 
 
Arsenal are in second place in the Premier League and eight points behind Chelsea but Wenger will <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> be absent from the touchline when the Gunners take on the Premier League leaders at Stamford Bridge <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-W05-WE">next weekend</TIMEX3>. 
 
Speaking to Daily Star about Wenger’s behaviour <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-W03-WE">last weekend</TIMEX3>, Merson said: 
 
“You can’t do what Wenger did. It’s out of order. But I think the situation with Alexis Sanchez and Mesut Ozil is playing on his mind as well. 
 
“It’s been going on for weeks <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> and it’s taking it’s toll. It should have been done by <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> but I think both players are waiting to see what happens.” 
 
Ozil moved to Arsenal in a £42.5m deal from La Liga outfit Real Madrid in the <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2013">2013</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-SU">summer</TIMEX3> transfer window. 
 
Sanchez completed a £35m switch to Arsenal from Barcelona <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P1Y" mod="LESS_THAN">less than 12 months</TIMEX3> after Ozil’s move.
