A spokeswoman for the Trump administration, Hope Hicks, told CNN on <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> that, "despite what the media reports, we are an incredibly inclusive group and we took into account all of those who suffered,"

Hicks retorted that the speech was meant to be inclusive of all those who suffered during the Holocaust including the five million non-Jews who were murdered in the genocide orchestrated by Adolf Hitler.

“Priests, gypsies, people with mental or physical disabilities, communists, trade unionists, Jehovah's Witnesses, anarchists, Poles and other Slavic peoples, and resistance fighters,” she noted.

The speech came under fire by several Jewish organization leaders, who found it “puzzling and troubling” that it failed to explicitly mention the six million Jews who perished in a targeted genocide against them.

“It is with a heavy heart and somber mind that we remember and honor the victims, survivors, and heroes of the Holocaust,” the presidential statement read. “It is impossible to fully fathom the depravity and horror inflicted on innocent people by Nazi terror.”

Trump has been accused of flirting with alleged white supremacist and neo-Nazi during his controversial presidential campaign.

Anti-Defamation League (ADL) Director Jonathan Greenblatt expressed his disapproval of the speech in a series of tweets. which he felt downplayed the suffering and persecution of the Jewish people in the Holocaust, a common theme of nationalist movements, he added according to CNN.

He also noted that the speech was a departure from previous speeches given by both Trump’s republican and democratic predecessors.

The executive director of the Anne Frank Center, Steven Goldstein, echoed Greenblatt’s criticism of Trump’s oblique phrasing.

“How can you forget, Mr President, that six million Jews were murdered because they were Jews?” Goldstein remarked.

“You chose the vague phrase ‘innocent people.’ They were Jews, Mr President.”

In a statement to CNN, Greenblatt mentioned that International Holocaust <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2016-11-11">Remembrance Day</TIMEX3> was put in place because of Holocaust denials, but also the numerous countries such as Iran, Russia, Polan…
