Despite victories from seniors Keaton Cullimore and Jacob Sullivan , BYU men’s tennis dropped its second match of <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-W03-WE">the weekend</TIMEX3> to Cornell, 4-2, at the Murr Center Tennis Courts on <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TAF">Saturday afternoon</TIMEX3>. 
 
“I liked the way our guys dug in when their backs were against the wall,” BYU head coach Brad Pearce said. “We played better overall tennis <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3>, but we still didn’t win. All the Ivy League schools have very good tennis programs, so it was a great opportunity to get better.” 
 
BYU (2-3) struggled to match the Big Red’s pace as Cornell (3-0) quickly took control with victories at first and third doubles to claim the doubles point. At first doubles, Sullivan and John Pearce fell 6-1 to Chris Vrabel and Bernardo Casares followed by Cullimore and Derek Vincent ’s 6-4 loss at No. 3 doubles to Lev Kazakov and Dylan Brown. 
 
In singles play, Jeremy Bourgeois fell 6-1, 6-2 to Kazakov on court No. 1, and Pearce dropped his match to Daniel Grunberger, 6-3, 6-4, at fourth singles. With the Cougars facing a 3-0 deficit, Sullivan fought back at No. 5 singles for a close 7-6(5), 6-4 victory over Pietro Rimondini. The point wasn’t enough, however, as Casares clinched the match for Cornell, pulling out a three-set win over freshman Sam Tullis , 6-4, 2-6, 6-3. 
 
Cullimore upset No. 62 Chris Vrabel in a three-set tiebreaker, 6-2, 4-6, 7-6(6), at No. 2 singles to claim the second and final point for BYU. 
 
BYU hosts three regional opponents <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-W05-WE">next weekend</TIMEX3> at the Indoor Tennis Courts. The Cougars face Denver on <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-02-03">Friday, Feb. 3</TIMEX3>, at <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="TIME" value="2017-02-03T17:30">5:30 p.m.</TIMEX3> MST, before competing in a doubleheader against Montana State and Northern Arizona on <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2017-02-04">Saturday, Feb. 4</TIMEX3>, at <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="TIME" value="2017-02-04T24:00">12 p.m.</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="TIME" value="2017-02-04T17:30">5:30 p.m.</TIMEX3>, respectively.
