New Delhi, <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Jan 29</TIMEX3> (PTI) Steelmaker SAIL, which has reached the last leg of its Rs 70,000 crore modernisation programme, <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3> said post modernisation there would be 60-70 per cent jump in production capacity which is a challenge for the PSU as demand for domestic steel remains weak. 
 
Modernisation at the Bhilai Steel Plant (BSP) of India’s largest steelmaker was likely to be over in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="PXM">the next few months</TIMEX3> and with this, the entire process of modernisation will be complete, SAIL Chairman P K Singh said in an exclusive interview to PTI. 
 
“Except Bhilai, modernisation everywhere else is complete,” Singh said. 
 
Bhilai Steel plant (BSP) is the largest facility of the state-run steel giant. 
 
“We will be under the process of ramping up our production. Our capacity will also find a 60-70 per cent jump. 
 
That is a real challenge for the company. To ramp up, produce, and sell. That is the biggest issue for the company,” the chairman said, voicing concerns. 
 
Steel Minister Chaudhary Birender Singh <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> inaugurated the new Universal Rail Mill (URM) at SAIL’s Bhilai Steel Plant and flagged off the first rake from the new mill, he said. 
 
The Rs 1,200-crore URM will take BSP’s total capacity to produce rails at 2 million tonnes per annum (MTPA), which will be the largest rail production capacity in any single location for a plant the world-over. 
 
Elaborating, he said that the company had a production growth of 17 per cent in the last calender year and he expects an output growth of 15-17 per cent <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017">this year</TIMEX3> as well. 
 
“This extra production, which is coming particularly when the demand is not growing….There lies the challenge,” he said. 
 
The production is growing almost 7-8 per cent but demand is growing by 3 per cent, he said adding the per capita consumption, which is at 61 kg, needs a rapid push. 
 
“We are also driving mass scale campaign where we are meeting various ministries, consumers, various users to increase the steel consumption. We are also getting a lot of help from the government,” he said. MORE
