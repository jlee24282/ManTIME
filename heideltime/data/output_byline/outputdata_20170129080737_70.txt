Supt. Rafael Dumlao and other persons linked to the kidnapping and death of South Korean businessman Jee Ick-joo cannot be arrested on the basis of the warrant issued by the Angeles City regional trial court, justice secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II said on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday, January 29</TIMEX3>. 
 
“There should first be a clarification from the court and amendment of the arrest warrant that will change the name ‘Sir Dumlao’ to ‘Supt. Rafael Dumlao’ before he could be put under arrest,” Aguirre explained in an interview.

Dumlao, the regional head of the PNP Anti-Illegal Drugs Group (AIDG) in Pampanga, has reportedly left the PNP’s restrictive custody in Camp Crame in Quezon City over <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-W03-WE">the weekend</TIMEX3> with his wife after attending the Senate inquiry on the alleged “tokhang for ransom” case <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-01-26">last Thursday</TIMEX3>. 
 
Aguirre said the court should also make the same amendment for other persons named only as “Pulis,” “Jerry,” and “Ding” in the arrest warrant issued against Police Officer 3 Ricky Sta. Isabel in the kidnapping for ransom with homicide case filed by the PNP Anti-Kidnapping Group. 
 
In the case of “Ding,” Aguirre said that alias has been identified as that of Gerardo Santiago, the retired police officer who owns the Gream Funeral Parlor where Jee’s body was cremated. 
 
He said that the alias “Jerry” is a National Bureau of Investigation asset who was allegedly among those who forcibly took the Korean businessman from his home in a supposed anti-drugs operation. 
 
“This ‘Jerry’ is a confidential informant of the NBI and he has a lot of things to tell on this case,” he said. 
 
Both “Jerry” and Santiago have surrendered to the NBI, Aguirre said, as he explained that the identity of “Pulis” is still being determined. 
 
Aguirre said the AKG has asked the Department of Justice to amend the aliases in the case filed with the Angeles City RTC. 
 
Once the criminal charge sheet is amended, the PNP should still wait for the issuance of the amended arrest warrant before Dumlao could again be taken into its custody. 
 
Sta. Isabel has been tagged as the kidnapper and killer of Jee based on statements of fellow accused SPO 4 Roy Villegas and Ramon Yalung. 
 
Sta. Isabel, who served under Dumlao’s unit, denied the allegation and claimed his superiors made him the fall guy. 
 
He has asked the RTC to reinvestigate the criminal case against him.
