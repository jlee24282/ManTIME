DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. – The new Cadillac DPi-V.R has controlled the opening <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="PT12H">12 hours</TIMEX3> of the 55th Rolex 24 at Daytona, with the No. 10 Konica Minolta Cadillac leading most of it. Ricky and Jordan Taylor, Max Angelelli and Jeff Gordon sahre the car. 
 “The Cadillac is very good,” Ricky Taylor said. “Our DPi-V.R is pretty good drive in the drizzle conditions. We are in the lead and we want to hold it as long as we can. That helps keep you motivated in the car. We want to keep the lead into the morning. It looks we will be racing the No. 5 Cadillac.  We are going to try and hold the gap and keep it clean for <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="PTXH">the next several hours</TIMEX3>.”  
Ford has been up front for most of the race in the GT Le Mans class, but it’s Porsche that has moved ahead with its new 911 RSR at Hour 12. 
 
The GT Daytona class has witnessed the biggest roller coaster, with seven of the nine manufacturers (all except Lamborghini and Aston Martin) having led in class at some point. Acura and Lexus have both led on debuts with their new cars, and Acura holds the top spot at Hour 12. 
 
Lastly it’s been Performance Tech Motorsports leading the Prototype Challenge class most of the way. 
 
There have been eight full-course cautions and six race retirements, all in the GTLM and GTD classes. 
 
Track conditions are treacherous with rain causing a slick track surface.
