Re: Letter, <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-16">Jan. 16</TIMEX3>, "Not hypocrites" 
 
To the man who accuses pro-lifers of only being concerned with the preborn baby, which he refers to as fetus, and not the pregnant mother, we boldly disagree. Our Pregnancy Counseling Centers, many with medical clinics, welcome any girl or woman before or after an abortion. 
 
Pro-lifers are in front of abortion clinics throughout our country and many other countries, offering alternatives to destroying a life. We have heard over and over again from those who have experienced abortion about the painful aftermath and their deep regrets. The doors to Catholic and other Christian churches are open to Christ’s mercy and forgiveness along with post-abortion ministries such as Rachael’s Vinyard, Silent No More and many other aftermath of abortion groups throughout our country. 
 
A new center has opened in Fort Walton Beach with assistance and needs for pregnant women, including medical. Approximately half the women in pro-life efforts <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3> have had one or more abortions. When they are permitted to speak in classrooms, generally private schools, most, if not all who were pro-choice, change their mind. Young people deserve the whole picture — the truth. When adoption is presented, especially from a person who has been adopted, students see a positive alternative to killing. 
 
Teens are aware of the <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> culture of death in our country, led by the “father of lies,” the "angel of death,” as the Bible calls him. Teen suicide in the U.S. per capita is one of the highest in the world. This is because they are being sold the mantra, "If it feels good, do it.” In this culture, sex sells, and when good, consistent abstinence until marriage programs are implemented in a school the students respond and realize self-control, concern for others' welfare and sacrifice are necessary to be happy! 
 
The letter writer is 100 percent wrong, we care deeply for women. Many of the hundreds of thousands in next Saturday’s March for Life in Washington, D.C., will be holding signs, "ABORTION HARMS WOMEN." Let's see how much the press will cover it!
