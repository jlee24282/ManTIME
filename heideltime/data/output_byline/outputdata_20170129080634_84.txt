To the Editor: I have been a union member for <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DURATION" value="PXY">many years</TIMEX3> and have always been opposed to the political slant of the unions. However, I recognize the importance of unions as an insurance protection against aggressive managers. 

No one likes needing insurance, but we all know that it does provide a degree of protection. I believe everyone should be offered the right to work and not be forced or intimidated to join a union. That said, I also believe that no union should be forced to represent anyone that doesn't pay dues to the union. Shouldn't people be allowed to choose to join a union or not? 

I chose to join our union, the NALC, for the protection it provides and the family atmosphere it provides. Like our own family, we may have many differences of opinions but when the need arises we stick together. So I believe everyone should be offered the right to choose to join a union.
