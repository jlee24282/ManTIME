A few readers <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-W03">last week</TIMEX3> contacted the Union-Tribune to say they didn’t like the play in last Sunday’s paper of the Women’s <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-03">March</TIMEX3> in San Diego. They had wanted to see it covered with a big A1 photo. 
 
A picture from the Women’s <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2016-03">March</TIMEX3> in Washington, D.C., received the lead play — a six-column wide, 6-plus-inch-deep shot. Below it appeared a two-column wide, 2-plus-inch-deep photo of a girl at the San Diego event. The caption teased to a story on the San Diego march on A3 written by three U-T staffers. The story was accompanied by two photos — a six-column-wide shot and one three columns wide. 
 
The coverage was insufficient for reader Jean Walcher of South Park. 
 
“I just wanted to voice my great disappointment at the ... coverage of Saturday’s Women’s <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2016-03">March</TIMEX3> in Sunday’s paper,” Walcher wrote. “To be among 40,000 fellow San Diegans marching through downtown San Diego was beyond inspiring. Many of us would have been so excited to have looked at Sunday’s paper and been greeted with a big front-page photo of our hometown march. Instead, the cover photo was of the D.C. march, and we were relegated to A3. 
 
“I know the paper had photographers there, so can’t understand this thinking of not featuring our hometown march. Would have resonated so much more for your readers.” 
 
The event was a rare occurrence — tens of thousands of people marching in San Diego eclipsed by an even more enormous related demonstration in the nation’s capital. 
 
“We too thought depicting San Diego’s march on page 1 was important, which we did with the photo of the young girl and a reference to our comprehensive local story on A3,” said U-T Design Director Michael Price, who designed that day’s A1. “But the home base, if you will, of the protest was D.C. Washington was its heart, all other protests across the country and the world sprung from the plan to march on Washington. 
 
“The photo we chose to run largest on A1 and its accompanying national story, I believe captured the sweep and gravity of the event in terms of reporting and visuals, and provided the context necessary to support what was nearly five pages of related coverage.” 
 Massive protest and a profanity  
Reader Paul Tessaro of Mission Hills caught something in last Sunday’s front page photo of the Women’s <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2016-03">March</TIMEX3> with aid of his iPad, which he used to enlarge the picture. 
 
In the lower right, a sign can be seen that displays the vulgar word President Donald Trump used in the infamous “Access Hollywood” recording in <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2005">2005</TIMEX3>. Although small, the word can be read without the photo being enlarged. 
 
Photo editors routinely scan protest-type shots when they edit photos to guard against profanity being published. 
 
“If we don’t run those words in stories, we don’t run them in photos,” said David Poller, one of the U-T’s photo editors.Despite photo editors’ best efforts, a word or image can slip by, especially when the photo is like the one of the Women’s <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2017-03">March</TIMEX3>, in which a sea of handmade signs appeared. 
 San Diego County’s Mount Laguna  
A story on A1 <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2017-01-20">Jan. 20</TIMEX3> about the weather reported on how much snow was expected to fall on “the peak of Mount Laguna.” A story about the weather <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2017-01-21">Jan. 21</TIMEX3> also referred to “the top of Mount Laguna.” Can you spot the error? 
 
Gary Mortenson, a former U-T copy editor, did and called in. Mount Laguna is an unincorporated community in the Laguna Mountains. It is not a mountain peak.
