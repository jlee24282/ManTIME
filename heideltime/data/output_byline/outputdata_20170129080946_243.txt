The News Sentinel and other publications have had articles about <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> college graduates unable to find employment. This is the tip of a scandal of unbelievable proportion and importance for our country. 
 
The goal of education is allegedly to prepare kids for life and to earn a living. How is this goal met by giving young adults meaningless degrees in exchange for $50,000 or more in student loans or parents emptying savings that will need to be paid back in real dollars? This is a failure at so many levels. 
 
Start with parents. Kids in high school for the most part don’t have part-time jobs. They have no experience with the workplace or what kind of vocation they might enjoy. They also have no idea that an employer needs to compensate them for the value that their work provides for the business. 
 
I once asked a group of students how much they expected to make right after college graduation. The answers ranged from $50,000 to $200,000 <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3>. The all expected to quickly earn even more. When I told them that they would be expected to provide the business with enough value to cover their wages, workers' compensation, Social Security, taxes, medical insurance, the lease on the building, advertising, marketing and, of course, sufficient profits to keep the shareholders happy and the paychecks cashing, they were dumbfounded. I then told them that they would need to provide the company with $125,000 of value to justify their $50,000 salary. That was the first time they heard that, I assure you. 
 
Parents could start the process by sitting their kids down and explaining their work experiences or even getting them some part-time work instead of one more extracurricular activity. 
 
Education also plays a role. We have taken vocational training out of high school. This has removed an important source of experience for students. They can’t find a calling as an electrician, welder, machinist, mechanic, plumber, carpenter, HVAC installer/repairman or dozens of others if they aren’t exposed to them. How old was the last repairman you hired? These types of courses need to be reinstated in high schools. 
 
As for colleges, <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P2Y">the two-year</TIMEX3> schools are doing their part. Universities are another matter. Most state schools pay their deans more money <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="SET" value="XXXX">annually</TIMEX3> than many of their students will earn in their lifetimes. The professors are tenured and untouchable. The administrators are all involved in the support of the structure. The alumni pour money into the endowments, which are ridiculous for state schools supported in part by tax dollars. The students get annual tuition increases in spite of the schools sitting on million- or even billion-dollar endowments. We need to recognize the value of a college degree is in part calculated by the education industry, which is protecting its own interest. 
 
The best example of career guidance I’ve experienced was <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">several years ago</TIMEX3>. My home needed sewer work. The young man in charge of the crew was not what I expected. He explained that after high school his father told him he wasn’t going to college. He was going to learn the family plumbing business. His dad told him his business wasn’t going to be obsolete or outsourced. <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2022">Ten years later</TIMEX3> he owns the business. He told me he has one of his old buddies working for him -- one of the college graduates.
