Berlin: A wild boar has gone on a rampage in a northern Berlin park, causing minor injuries to three people before being shot dead by police. 
 
A sounder of boars showed up near the city's Tegel Airport <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="TIME" value="XXXX-XX-XXT14:00" mod="APPROX">about 2pm</TIMEX3> on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>Â before one of the male boars moved away from the group to a nearby park, local police said. 
 
The boar then proceeded to attack a number of people, injuring a woman on her leg as well as two other men. 
 
Police shot the animal dead, in order to prevent it from injuring any further passers-by. By that stage, the rest of the animals had already moved on, police said. 
 
Meanwhile, in the western German city of Siegen, a wild boar disrupted traffic and smashed down the front door of a hairdressing salon on <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>. 
 
The animal was also eventually shot dead by the authorities.
