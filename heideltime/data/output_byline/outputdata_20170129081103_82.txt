Wilmington did cut it down to 11 before Burlington opened it back up in the fourth.

GIRLS HOCKEY 
 
The WHS girls’ hockey team fell to Burlington, 7-2, <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="TIME" value="2017-01-25TNI">last Wednesday night</TIMEX3>. The loss puts the team’s overall record to 2-4-4. 
 
“We were in that game in the second period, trailing by a goal,” said coach Mike Gautreau. “We had a turnover while on the power play and a Burlington player got the puck and scored a short-handed goal. That seemed to change the momentum and we could never get it back.” 
 
Olivia Wingate scored the Wildcats’ first goal with helpers going to Payton Fuller and goalie Melanie Hayden, according to the scoresheet. Wingate assisted on the second goal sending Sam Grasso in on a breakaway and she found the back of the net. 
 
“We’re playing better and the effort is there,” said Gautreau. “It’s always there. I just think the girls need to listen a little better in special team’s situations. That’s what we’re going to be working on a lot in the next few practices — special teams.” 
 
Wilmington has still been dealing with the injury bug, and that will continue <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2017-W04">this week</TIMEX3> as defenseman Molly Foley will most likely play one more game before missing the rest of the season due to knee surgery. 
 
“That’s going to be a big loss for us,” said Gautreau. “We’re going to need and find someone to fill her shoes.” 
 
Despite the team losing 7-2, Gautreau said Hayden played exceptionally well. 
 
“The score doesn’t reflect that, but she played another great game for us,” he said. “She has kept us in every game this season and we don’t even have a full team with all of the injuries.” 
 
Wilmington has a busy slate <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="2017-W04">this week</TIMEX3>. On <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="2017-01-25">Wednesday</TIMEX3> the team faced Arlington with results not known as of presstime. On <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="TIME" value="2017-02-02TAF">Thursday afternoon</TIMEX3>, the ‘Cats will host St. Joe’s Prep in a non-league game before hosting a very good Winchester team on <TIMEX3 tid="t34" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TAF">Saturday afternoon</TIMEX3> at <TIMEX3 tid="t35" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28T14:00">2 pm.</TIMEX3> The home stretch will continue <TIMEX3 tid="t36" type="DATE" value="2017-02-01">next Wednesday</TIMEX3> with Reading coming to town.
