BALTIMORE (WJZ) — <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DURATION" value="P1D">A day</TIMEX3> of fans, fun, and a full convention center. Orioles FanFest took over Downtown Baltimore <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>, as fans got a chance to get up close and personally meet some of their favorite players during the annual event.   RELATED:  Pre-Season Excitement For The Orioles At FanFest <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3>   “Oh goodness, we’ve been to FanFest for <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P15Y">15 years</TIMEX3> at least,” says Orioles fan Frank lhotsky.   “In our family, we say there are only two seasons: baseball and <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-WI">winter</TIMEX3>,” he says.   Generations of excited fans came with a line the lead up to the Baltimore Convention Center for Orioles FanFest, where a fan could get a chance to see a little of everything — and lots of it in orange and black.   Including, a suit worn by diehard O’s fan Ryan King.    “A lot of orange, I love to see that,” says King.   He’s wearing a bright orange suit, complete with orange top hat.   “Only a few occasions I bring it out, it’s for formal wear: FanFest, opening day, and god willing, post-season,” he says.   While as eye-catching as it is, the day was not about decked-out fans, but the Orioles players too. And everywhere you looked you saw fans getting a chance to meet the players they to root for all season.   Those same fans also got to see some of the faces they see <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EVERY">every day</TIMEX3> on WJZ .  As part of our continuing community commitment, many of WJZ’s on-air staff, like Rick Ritter, Bob Turk, Devin Bartolotta and Tim Williams took pictures with O’s fans.   FanFest is <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> that many wait for all year.   “And get a lot of free stuff too, which is good.” says Ihotsky.   Orioles FanFest has been around since <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="1988">1988</TIMEX3>. Since <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2011">2011</TIMEX3>, there has been an autograph policy, where the money collected goes towards OriolesREACH , which has raised $700,000 dollars for the foundation’s charities.
