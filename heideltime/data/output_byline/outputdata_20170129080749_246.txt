Attention Voters! Do not be deceived by the Beacon Hill politicians we <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> placed in office who are supposed to represent us - the hard-working, law-abiding taxpayers of this Commonwealth. Their very first legislative act was to ... vote themselves an obscene pay increase (along with their pensions)? Really? Who, pray tell, ran their campaign on this promise? Thanks to my State Senator Ryan Fattman (R), along with Senators Anne Gobi (D) and Michael Moore (D) and the Republican Representatives, for voting "NO" to this obscene first-act on Beacon Hill. <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3>, the real test will come when the Governor vetoes this bill and the Legislature overrides it. Will those politicians who voted "NO" take the pay increase anyway? I contacted Senator Fattman's office and was told that he would write a letter to the Senate clerk stating that he will not take the pay increase. What will the other Legislators do? Keep your eyes wide open, for the opportunity for hypocrisy will be on full display in the <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="FUTURE_REF">coming days</TIMEX3> on Beacon Hill. And remember, we get to vote again in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P2Y">two years</TIMEX3>.
