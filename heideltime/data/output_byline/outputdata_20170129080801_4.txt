Stephen Curry was electric on <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TNI">Saturday night</TIMEX3>.  The conventional wisdom on Stephen Curry’s performance in the <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3>-<TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017">17</TIMEX3> season says that he has suffered from the Golden State Warriors’ offseason acquisition of Kevin Durant.  Curry is still the league’s preeminent perimeter threat, but he has not captured the same level of excellence on off-the-dribble, several-feet-past-the-line three-pointers.
