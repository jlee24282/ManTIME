One of major educational programs that OSU Extension conducts on behalf of the Ohio Department of Agriculture are the re-certification sessions for farmers who have a restricted private pesticide applicator license. 
 
In order to purchase and buy restricted pesticides to help combat troublesome weeds, diseases and insects, farmers are required to pass a competency test from the Department of Agriculture and then attend a <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="PT3H">three-hour</TIMEX3> re-certification session <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="SET" value="P3Y" quant="EVERY">every three years</TIMEX3>. 
 
In <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3>, we have 50 Ashtabula County farmers who will need to complete their re-certification by <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-03-31">March 31</TIMEX3>. 
 
<TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Today</TIMEX3>, I would like to share information on our upcoming re-certification programs and how non-licensed farmers can become certified. 
 
We have only one private pesticide re-certification session remaining <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-WI">this winter</TIMEX3> for farmers to complete their private pesticide applicator renewal. 
 
We had our first session <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017-01-13">Jan. 13</TIMEX3> in Williamsfield and our <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2017-01-02">second Jan. 27</TIMEX3> at the Geauga County Extension office. 
 
So our last chance for producers to obtain their re-certification close to home will be <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2017-02-08">Feb. 8</TIMEX3> at the Trumbull County Extension office.  
 
This session offers renewal credits for pesticide re-certification for CORE and for the six agricultural specific areas. 
 
These agricultural specific areas include Category 1— Grain and Cereal Crops; Category 2 — Forage Crops and Livestock; Category 3 — Fruit and Vegetable Crops; Category 4 — Nursery and Forest Crops; Category 5 — Greenhouse Crops; and Category 6 — Fumigation.  
 
The registration fee is $35 per person for the private pesticide applicator re-certification session. Pre-registration is required <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="P8D">eight days</TIMEX3> prior to the session date. An additional late registration fee of $25 per person will be added for any late registration. 
 
More information can be obtained by calling the Geauga County Extension office 440-834-4656. A registration flyer can also be obtained at: flyer can be found at: http://go.osu.edu/ne-events 
 
There are two training opportunities for any farmer looking to obtain a new private or commercial pesticide applicators license in Northeast Ohio. 
 
OSU Extension will be offering two training sessions that will help participants prepare for the CORE pesticide license exam. 
 
The class will be offered <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2017-01-31">Jan. 31</TIMEX3> at the Geauga County Extension office in Burton and then again <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2017-03-14">March 14</TIMEX3> at the Trumbull County Extension office in Cortland. Both classes are scheduled 1-<TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="TIME" value="2017-03-14T16:30">4:30 p.m.</TIMEX3> and the registration cost is $35 per person. 
 
That includes the CORE study materials and light refreshments.  
 
To register for the Geauga class call 440- 834-4656 and to register for the Trumbull class call 330-638-6783. 
 
We are also pleased to open our local Extension offices up to the Ohio Department of Agriculture (ODA) to administer the pesticide applicator exams. 
 
Here in Ashtabula County, the ODA will be testing <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="TIME" value="2017-03-14T10:00">10 a.m.</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2017-03-08">March 8</TIMEX3>. Additional testing dates will be <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="2017-02-22">Feb. 22</TIMEX3>, <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="2017-03-22">March 22</TIMEX3>, <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DATE" value="2017-04-26">April 26</TIMEX3>, <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DATE" value="2017-05-24">May 24</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DATE" value="2017-06-28">June 28</TIMEX3> at the Geauga County Extension office and <TIMEX3 tid="t34" type="DATE" value="2017-02-13">Feb. 13</TIMEX3>, <TIMEX3 tid="t35" type="DATE" value="2017-03-13">March 13</TIMEX3>, <TIMEX3 tid="t36" type="DATE" value="2017-04-10">April 10</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t37" type="DATE" value="2017-05-08">May 8</TIMEX3> at the Trumbull County Extension office.

To close today’s column, I would like to share a quote from Charles Spurgeon who stated, “A lie can travel half way around the world while the truth is putting on its shoes.” 
 
Have a good and safe day.
