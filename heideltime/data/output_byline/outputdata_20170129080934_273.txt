Miguel Angel Samudio helped Club America to a 1-0 win over Veracruz. 
Week 4 in the <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> Liga MX Clausura brought victories for Chivas and Club America, while Monterrey continues to struggle. 
 
Here's a look at the biggest talking points of <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-W03-WE">the weekend</TIMEX3>: 
 
1. Chivas, America return to winning ways 
 
Whenever Mexico's two biggest teams lose a game, there is a certain amount of pressure, but both Club America and Chivas followed up defeats <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-W03-WE">last weekend</TIMEX3> by picking up wins on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>. 
 
Las Aguilas started the round of matches in last place in the Clausura <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> table with question starting to be asked about coach Ricardo La Volpe's future. 
 
It was <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> signing Paraguayan Cecilio Dominguez who impressed the Estadio Azteca crowd on his debut, netting the winner against Veracruz in the 61st minute with a diving header after a neat move. 
 
This was a game America had to win. Goalkeeper Agustin Marchesin had leaked eight goals in his first three games of the year and had looked slightly nervous, but the clean sheet and three points should steady Las Aguilas moving forward. 
 
Over in Queretaro, Chivas earned a 1-0 against Gallos Blancos thanks to a <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-H1">first half</TIMEX3> goal from Jesus "Chapo" Sanchez, following an exquisite through-pass from Orbelin Pineda. 
 
It was a fully deserved victory for Guadalajara, with Queretaro was once again disappointing. Gallos Blancos have <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> gone <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="PT6H">360 minutes</TIMEX3> without scoring a goal and Victor Manuel Vucetich will be worried about his team's lack of punch.

2. Cardona's return to Monterrey's starting XI ends badly 
 
Monterrey coach Antonio Mohamed handed Colombian international Edwin Cardona his first Liga MX start in <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION" value="P5M">five months</TIMEX3> and it ended with a red card in the 22nd minute. 
 
The debate raged over whether Cardona raised his arm with intentional force to strike Leon's Fernando Navarro, but the 24-year-old gave the referee a decision to make when he didn't really need to. 
 
The player asked for forgiveness from the fans after the game, but it was the latest chapter in a strange relationship between Cardona -- one paper on of the best players in Liga MX -- and Monterrey. It just doesn't seem to be working and watching it is highly frustrating. 
 
Rayados managed to scrape a 0-0 draw against Leon, but Mohamed is still scrambling to put together a side that works as well on the pitch as it looks on paper. 
   
3. Pressure on Cruz Azul's Jemez as Xolos stay top 
 
Miguel Herrera's Club Tijuana remains top of the Liga MX after racking up its second consecutive 1-0 victory, this time at Estadio Caliente against Cruz Azul on <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3>. 
 
A set piece goal from Juan Carlos Valenzuela was enough to take the points in a bitterly fought game with a total of 38 fouls over <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DURATION" value="PT90M">the 90 minutes</TIMEX3> and in which neither team was able to really dominate. 
 
Martin Rodriguez's miss in <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2017-H1">the first half</TIMEX3> could've changed the course of the whole game, but the bottom line <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> is that La Maquina is without a win in five. 
 
"Football is punishing us," said Spanish coach Paco Jemez after the match, adding that the result was unfair and that no fan could criticize the effort and performance his team put on. 
 
Jemez's take is a perfectly rational way of looking at the game and his team's lack of luck <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DURATION" value="P2W" mod="MORE_THAN">over the last two weeks</TIMEX3>; it's just that things at Cruz Azul have rarely been rational <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DURATION" value="PXY" mod="MORE_THAN">over the last few years</TIMEX3>. There will inevitably be talk about crisis and such, as unfair as that will seem to Jemez.
