Jhye Richardson, the Perth Scorchers pacer, wasn't going to be a part of the Playing XI until early morning of the final of the Big Bash League. With Mitchell Johnson set to lead the attack, and Tim Bresnan and Andrew Tye being certainties for their spots, coach Justin Langer was left deciding between Richardson and left-arm pacer Jason Behrendorff for the fourth pacer's spot. 
 
Behrendorff was in with a chance making a surprising return to the line-up from injury, having not played competitive cricket since <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2016-11">November last year</TIMEX3>. While the 20-year-old Richardson was young and fitter, Behrendorff brought with him a lot of experience. Nonetheless, with the Scorchers coach unsure of the left-arm pacer's fitness, he decided to eventually play Richardson in the all-important clash. 
 
The move paid off richly as the bowler returned with three crucial wickets - Moises Henriques, Brad Haddin and Jordan Silk, apart from effecting the brilliant run-out to send Nic Maddinson back to the dugout. 
 
"It was just such a dilemma, I reckon I asked at least 50 people their opinion about whether we should go Jason Behrendorff or Jhye Richardson," Langer said after the Scorchers' convincing nine-wicket win over the Sixers on <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> (<TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">January 28</TIMEX3>). "It's hard to leave someone like Behrendorff out, he's been our most influential bowler of the last <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P3Y">three</TIMEX3> or <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="P4Y">four years</TIMEX3>. 
 
"But it came really clearly to me <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29TMO">this morning</TIMEX3> when I was meditating. If we were talking about being fit to play and to perform, then as good as Behrendorff is, I just left he hadn't played enough cricket. Richardson was battle hard and his fielding - if he didn't take one wicket <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3>, that run out of Maddinson earned every cent of his wage <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29TNI">tonight</TIMEX3>." 
 
"He was pumped. I had to make two tough phone calls, but I wussed out and called Jhye first," Langer added. Not surprisingly, Richardson was ecstatic on receivingthe call from the former Australian opener on <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TMO">Saturday morning</TIMEX3>. 
 
It was a tough season for the Perth Scorchers with three front-linepacers - Nathan Coulter-Nile, Joel Paris and Behrendorff not being able to play due to injuries. However, with a player from the <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3>-graduated Under-19 batch being able to stand up and deliver in big matches comes as good news. He played eight matches in the <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3>-concluded season and took 11 wickets. 
 
"It's unbelievable. At the start of the season I couldn't have even dreamed of it," Richardson said. "I'm speechless. 
 
"I was probably a bit lucky with injuries throughout the squad (to play as many games) but I had to trust myself and hard work I've done and it paid off."
