ATLANTA -- A local immigration attorney says at least four people, all legal residents who live in the Atlanta area, were detained for <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="PT5H" mod="MORE_THAN">more than 5 hours</TIMEX3> at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>. 
 
<TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> Rep. Hank Johnson is saying that number could be higher than 10 on <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> alone. 
 
Among those who were stopped on their trip home were a family of three, including a 10-year-old child, and a grandmother who is not related to the other detainees.  Hours later - after <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28T19:00">7 p.m.</TIMEX3> - the family was released to go home. 
 
Too emotional to speak on camera, they said they wanted to get their 10-year-old daughter home. 
 
Brother-in-law Mansour Kenareh said the Suwanee family was in good spirits but frustrated. 
 
A spokesperson tells 11Alive that, of the detained travelers 11Alive originally reported on, all of them were from Iran but legal residents of Georgia. They were returning from vacation in Iran on a flight from Amsterdam when they were detained <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28T24:30" mod="APPROX">around 12:30 p.m.</TIMEX3> Neither airport nor federal officials have confirmed these reports as of <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TAF">Saturday afternoon</TIMEX3>. 
 
The detainment reports come amidst others around the country following a crackdown on immigration by the newly seated Trump administration. The President’s executive action temporarily bans citizens from 7 Muslim-majority nations from entering the US.  Immigration activists say that includes green card holders. 
 
"If you had come in at 4 <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TAF">yesterday afternoon</TIMEX3> you would not have this problem," Immigration Attorney Sarah Owings said. 
 
Owings said the travelers she had learned of were visiting family in Iran when they ran into issues returning to America while at Hartsfield-Jackson. 
 
"Based on this executive action which was very hasty - very last minute - it was not something that was discussed by the legal community," Owings said. "Or even the agencies that are impacted by this because they don’t actually know what they’re doing or how to do it." 
 
Kenareh said his in-laws have been in the US for a little <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DURATION" value="P1Y" mod="MORE_THAN">more than a year</TIMEX3>. The father is in the process of opening a business locally.  Kenareh hopes the issue is resolved soon. 
 
"I don't blame the  people who are doing their job," he said. "I give them credit, they are confused." 
 
USA TODAY reports that  about 50 people were detained at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport , according to Alia Salem, executive director for DFW Chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR). Families have been waiting at Terminal D in anticipation of meeting relatives who been held up in U.S Customs. A representative with CAIR met with families waiting for relatives. Some of them have been waiting for <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DURATION" value="PTXH">several hours</TIMEX3>. 
 
Meanwhile at Philadelphia International Airport,  two Syrian families, described as Christians, were briefly detained <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> after arriving from Qatar and sent back <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="UNDEF-REF-hour-PLUS-3">three hours later</TIMEX3>. The families included two brothers, their wives and two children, according to a family member form Allentown, Pa., NBC10 reported . 
 
Mohammed Al Rawi, chief information officer for Los Angeles County, said on Facebook that his father was removed from a flight in Qatar as a direct result of the order. 
 
In addition to protests planned at airports around the country, there is also one planned for Hartsfield-Jackson in response to the executive orders.
