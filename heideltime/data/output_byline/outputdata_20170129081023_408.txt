Frontman Jonas Bjerre had the following comments about the making of the new effort, "The live shows around that album saw us hit a creative peak, writing tracks on-the-road and the spark was lit. 
 
"Breaking the normal cycle felt right and we wanted to make an album spontaneously retaining the energy we'd generated on that world tour, rather than wait the normal <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="P3Y">three</TIMEX3> or <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="P4Y">four years</TIMEX3>." 
 
The group will be kicking off the first run of dates promoting the new album on <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2017-05-17">May 17th</TIMEX3> in Amsterdam at the Paradiso and so far they have confirmed dates that run until <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2016-05-27">May 27th</TIMEX3> where they will perform at the Immergut Festival in Neutrelitz, Germany.
