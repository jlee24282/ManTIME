RUSTON - COURTESY LA TECH SPORTS INFORMATION 

Ty Petty and Alex Johnson combined for 49 points and Middle Tennessee scored 34 <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2016-Q4">fourth quarter</TIMEX3> points to down Louisiana Tech 79-65 <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TAF">Saturday afternoon</TIMEX3> in Conference USA action at the Thomas Assembly Center. 

The Blue Raiders (12-8, 7-2 C-USA) snapped LA Tech’s three-game winning streak in a game that saw the Lady Techsters (10-10, 5-4 C-USA) lead by three with just <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="PT6M" mod="MORE_THAN">over six minutes</TIMEX3> to play before Middle Tennessee rallied. 

“I give Ty Petty a lot of credit,” said Tech head coach Brooke Stoehr. “She made some plays late and Alex Johnson is a tough match-up inside. Petty is a very experienced senior guard and she was a big reason for their finish. Middle is an experienced team that has won a lot of games during <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="200">the last decade</TIMEX3>. 

“I thought we did a pretty good job against Johnson for most of the game, but she is so tough inside. I said she was the best post player we have faced <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2017">this year</TIMEX3> and she showed people why. It’s a game where we put ourselves in position but just didn’t make the plays late. 

“They had about 10 straight possessions (in <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2016-Q4">the fourth quarter</TIMEX3>) where they either scored or got to the free throw line. We didn’t do as good of a job making Petty use the screen and she hurt us. I thought the three-pointer (Charity Savage) hit was big for them.” 

After trailing by as many as 13 points in <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2017-H1">the first half</TIMEX3> when Abbey Sissmon’s three-pointer gave the Blue Raiders a 35-22 advantage with 2:41 to play before halftime. However, Tech scored the final seven points of the half including Kierra Anthony’s runner off the glass as <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2017-H1">the first half</TIMEX3> buzzer sounded to cut the deficit to 35-29 at the half. 

Anthony scored 15 of her career-high tying 23 points in <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2017-H1">the first half</TIMEX3> keeping the Lady Techsters in the game, a contest that saw 51 fouls called and 48 free throws shot.
