Social media commenters take her to task for being tone deaf. On <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> when Donald Trump’s executive order banning immigrants from 7 Muslim countries sparked outcry on social media and protests at airports from coast to coast, the president’s daughter had something else on her mind: her date outfit.

Just after midnight on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29TMO">Sunday morning</TIMEX3>, Ivanka Trump posted a photo of herself on her Instagram and Twitter accounts dressed in a glamorous silver metallic gown, with her husband Jared Kushner dressed in a tuxedo by her side. The couple is standing in front of a mirrored wall, which shows Kushner’s hand resting on Trump’s posterior.

The photograph generated swift reaction on social media, with some comments highlighting the inappropriateness of the post in the midst of the humanitarian chaos that ensued <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> in the U.S., after dozens of refugees from Syria, Iraq and other banned countries were detained at U.S. airports, American Civil Liberties Union lawyers rushed to offer aid, and protesters clogged terminals and streets in New York, Los Angeles, Dallas, Chicago, Seattle and San Francisco.

Ivanka has faced criticism on several fronts in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent weeks</TIMEX3>, most notably when her namesake fashion label promoted a $10,000 bracelet she wore during a 60 Minutes interview the Trump family gave after the election. In <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017-01" mod="START">early January</TIMEX3>, to comply with ethic guidelines, she officially stepped away from her brand. But she has continued to play the role of a fashion plate in her new home in Washington, D.C., documenting on her social media channels her outfits in a style similar to a fashion magazine.

At the inauguration, Ivanka received attention for wearing designers Oscar de la Renta and Carolina Herrera. And interest in an Aspinal of London bag she carried to the National Prayer Service spiked, suggesting she in her new role in the Washington spotlight adjacent to, for <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3>, the Trump administration.

No word yet on who designed the metallic silver gown she wore <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TNI">Saturday night</TIMEX3>. @chrislhayes @IvankaTrump wow who wore it better pic.twitter.com/HhWBPO3A9V @IvankaTrump glad you're enjoying your new house in DC while Syrian children die
