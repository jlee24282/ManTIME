Get your weekly dose on the goings-on in the fashion and entertainment industry. The 28-year-old model, famous for modelling for plus-sized lingerie, has admitted that boxing is her favourite form of exercise as she throws punches not to just lose weight but also to feel healthy, reported FemaleFirst.

"Lately I've been obsessed with boxing. When I'm sweating and kicking ass in front of 30 other people at the gym, it definitely helps to dress the part," Ashley said.

She added that she also sets weekly fitness goals for herself, "Like 'I'm going to work out <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P3D">three days</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-W04">this week</TIMEX3>' instead of 'I'm going to lose three pounds <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-W04">this week</TIMEX3>.'"
