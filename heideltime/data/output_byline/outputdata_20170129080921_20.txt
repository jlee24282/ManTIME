BEAUMONT, Texas (NSU) - For three quarters <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> against Lamar, the Northwestern State women’s basketball team took care of the basketball and was efficient offensively. 
 
In <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2016-Q4">the fourth quarter</TIMEX3>, the Lady Demons did not accomplish either of those goals, and the homestanding Cardinals took advantage. Lamar forced 10 <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2016-Q4">fourth-quarter</TIMEX3> turnovers, erasing a three-point deficit and handing Northwestern State its third straight loss, 73-60, at the Montagne Center. 
 
“We played <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="PT30M">30 minutes</TIMEX3> like we needed to,” first-year head coach Jordan Dupuy said. “Unfortunately, we didn’t play the last 10 that way. We had way too many turnovers. They rattled us. They stayed in their run-and-jump pressure in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2016-H2">the second half</TIMEX3> in the half-court and didn’t allow us to run our sets.” 
 
Lamar (15-5, 7-2) came into the game leading the nation in turnovers forced per game (25.44), but the Lady Demons handled the Cardinals’ defensive pressure well for much of the game. 
 
In the first <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="PT30M">30 minutes</TIMEX3>, Northwestern State (9-11, 3-6 Southland Conference) committed just 11 turnovers while handing out 15 assists, building a three-point lead after three quarters. 
 
The Lady Demons were the defensive aggressors for much of the game, forcing the Cardinals into 16 turnovers and turning them into 20 points. After Lamar took an 30-22 lead with 7:24 to play in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2017-H1">the first half</TIMEX3>, Northwestern State showed its ability to play defense. 
 
The Lady Demons held Lamar scoreless for 6:11 as Beatrice Attura took over offensively. 
 
Attura put together a personal 11-0 run and Cheyenne Brown’s bucket made it a 13-0 NSU run that extended the Lady Demons’ lead to 35-30 before Lamar scored the final four points of the half. 
 
Attura finished <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2017-H1">the first half</TIMEX3> with 17 points and nine assists but did not attempt a field goal in <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2018-H2">the second half</TIMEX3>. Brown, meanwhile, tallied her second straight double-double, scoring 15 points and grabbing 10 rebounds. 
 
“They started running people left and right at her,” Dupuy said of Attura, who moved into 24th on NSU’s all-time scoring list with 1,204 points. “They took the ball out of her hands.” 
 
The Cardinals started <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2016-Q4">the fourth quarter</TIMEX3> with a 7-0 run before Shahd Abboud (17 points) hit a free throw to break the drought. However, Lamar continued to pressure the Lady Demons effectively. 
 
After scoring just six points off turnovers in the first three quarters, Lamar turned NSU’s 10 <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2016-Q4">fourth-quarter</TIMEX3> turnovers into 15 points. 
 
“In my view, there are no such things as moral victories,” Dupuy said. “There are a lot of positives to build off of. We had a great three quarters from our team. We were making the extra pass, sharing the basketball on offense. We have to bottle that up and do it for four quarters.” 
 
Mo Kinard led Lamar with 20 points while Kiara Desamours added 18, Kiandra Bowers chipped in <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2016">16</TIMEX3> and Chastadie Barrs 11 for the Cardinals. 
 
Northwestern State will take its final week-long break of the season, returning to action <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2017-02-04">Feb. 4</TIMEX3> against Stephen F. Austin inside Prather Coliseum. The matchup with the Ladyjacks is the annual “Pack Prather” promotion and will mark NSU’s first home game in <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DURATION" value="P3W">three weeks</TIMEX3>.
