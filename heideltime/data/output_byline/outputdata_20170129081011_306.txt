PM Modi dedicated Sundays Mann Ki Baat to students who are appearing for board exams <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017">this year</TIMEX3>. 

Do not think about exams as pressure. Exams should be celebrated as festivals. It is upto you, how you want to appear for the exams, said he. 

Modi urged students not to run behind marks. 

Smile more and score more. Remain happy and stress free to score more marks in the exams, said he. 

When you are relaxed, the recall value will be more, he added. 

Modi also asked students to refrain themselves from any shortcut means to earn marks. 

Only studying for marks will lead to shortcuts and one will limit himself or herself. Important to study for knowledge, said he. 

The PM said it it important to compete with oneself not with others. 

Look at the life of Sachin Tendulkar. He kept challenging himself and bettered his own records. That is what is inspiring. Competing with others can make you unhappy and jealous. Complete with yourself and you will be energised more determined to excel, said Modi.
