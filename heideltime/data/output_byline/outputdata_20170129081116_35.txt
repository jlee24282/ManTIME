History Colorado, parent organization of El Pueblo History Museum, has responded to a Colorado Open Records Act request submitted by State Rep. Clarice Navarro. The request for documents was spurred by an incident at the museum on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-20">Jan. 20</TIMEX3>, during which a pinata bearing the resemblance of President Donald Trump was struck several times and then hung from the rafters. 
 
Pueblo Republican Brian Mater also submitted a request for El Pueblo records. The state has not yet responded to his demands. 
 
In its email to Navarro, History Colorado Human Resources Director Dany McCoy revealed that the budget for El Pueblo during fiscal year <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> is $317,364, of which $153,064 is from limited gaming funds and $164,300 is from the museum cash fund where all earned revenues are deposited (rentals, admissions, educational programs, retail sales, etc.). 
 
McCoy went on to state that their contact info for Chicanos Against Trump, the local organization that organized the Inauguration Day protest, was Vicente Martinez Ortega. 
 
Navarro asked for copies of emails and other communication addressed to or sent by El Pueblo staff regarding the anti-Trump rally. 
 
In the email response, McCoy said, “There was only one email between (sic) from Mr. Ortega asking one of our employees about the layout of the building.” 
 
In response to Navarro’s question about who hung the pinata, McCoy said, “The event organizer Mr. Ortega and his team.” 
 
The Republican who represents Colorado’s House District 47 then asked if El Pueblo Museum had a “set of standards.” In response, McCoy said, “We have a contract that we are <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> in the process of updating,” 
 
“I’m disheartened that this has happened,” wrote Navarro in an email to The Pueblo Chieftain. “It has cast a cloud over the El Pueblo History Museum, and for that I’m concerned. 
 
“The El Pueblo History Museum is an attribute of the community of Pueblo and all of Southern Colorado,” continued Navarro. “I believe a lesson has been learned here by many parties, including myself, and again, steps are being taken to ensure this never happens again. 
 
“The El Pueblo History Museum is a great piece of all that Pueblo has to offer, but it must always be remembered, especially by staff, that it is a taxpayer-funded entity, and it should be treated as such. 
 
“I’ll continue to monitor this, and I’m confident progress is being made to aid in the fair and equitable treatment of each and every group. 
 
“I thank History Colorado and the El Pueblo History Museum for being responsive to me and my office, on what I consider a very serious and offensive incident,” she said.
