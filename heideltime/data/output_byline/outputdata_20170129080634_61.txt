DURHAM - The University of New Hampshire men's hockey team ended its scoring drought <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TNI">Saturday night</TIMEX3> at the Whittemore Center. It could not put a stop to its losing streak, however. 

Two third-period goals carried No. 19 Providence College to a 3-2 victory over the Wildcats in front of a crowd of 6,204. 

The triumph marked Providence's fifth straight and its second consecutive series sweep. The Wildcats (11-11-4, 6-5-3 Hockey East) have lost three straight and have not won since their 5-3 home win over Northeastern <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-01-12">Jan. 12</TIMEX3>. 

Friars freshman forward Brandon Duhaime broke a 1-1 tie 4:50 into the third period when he scored on a low shot from the slot. Teammate Bryan Lemos' backdoor goal with 6:16 remaining to give the Friars (14-8-4, 6-6-2 Hockey East) a 3-1 advantage. 

Wildcats junior goaltender Danny Tirone made 44 saves in defeat. 

Tyler Kelleher's power-play goal with 1:44 remaining in the second period ended UNH's <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> scoreless stretch and knotted the score at 1-1. The Wildcats senior forward put home a backdoor goal off a cross-ice feed from Michael McNicholas. 

Kelleher's tally was UNH's first since Patrick Grasso's power-play goal 4:51 into the second period of the team's 2-2 tie at No. 15 Notre Dame on <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017-01-20">Jan. 20</TIMEX3>. 

Grasso capped the Wildcats' scoring when he scored from the slot with <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="PT40S">40 seconds</TIMEX3> remaining. His goal could have tied the game if teammate Matt Dawson's goal was not waved off <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="UNDEF-REF-minute-MINUS-2" mod="LESS_THAN">less than two minutes earlier</TIMEX3>. 

Dawson nearly cut Providence's lead to 3-2 with 1:58 left. The sophomore defenseman's shot from the high slot went by Providence goaltender Hayden Hawkey (21 saves). After the review, the referees disallowed the goal due to contact with the goalie in the crease. 

Providence junior forward Brian Pinho's scored on a one-timer off a feed from Josh Monk 9:27 into the middle frame to open the game's scoring. 

The Wildcats nearly grabbed a 1-0 lead 2:42 into the second period. Junior forward Jason Salvaggio's shot from the right circle trickled through Hawkey's legs but the goaltender located and covered the puck before it crossed the goal line. 

UNH played without Salvaggio for <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DURATION" value="PT10M">10 minutes</TIMEX3> in the third period after he received a misconduct penalty 5:43 into the frame.
