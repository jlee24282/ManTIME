GARDAÍ have appealed for witnesses after a young man died in a collision between a car and a coach on the Mallow-Killarney road in north Cork. The collision, which occurred shortly before 6.30pm <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TEV">yesterday evening</TIMEX3>, resulted in the entire road being closed. Both vehicles collided some 4km outside Mallow, not far from the Cork Racecourse site.

The young man, the driver and sole occupant of the car, suffered multiple injuries in the collision and died before he could be transferred to Cork University Hospital (CUH). It is understood the 21 year old worked in the equestrian industry and was from the north Cork area. The coach driver, a middle-aged man, was taken to CUH for assessment as a precautionary measure. The three passengers were unhurt and did not require hospital treatment. Mallow Gardaí have <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> appealed for anyone who may have witnessed the collision to contact them to assist their investigation.

"The stretch of road is <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> closed to facilitate a Garda Forensic Collision Examination. Local diversions are in place," a garda spokesman said. "Investigating Gardaí are appealing for witnesses.

Gardaí said the identity of the deceased will only be confirmed when all relatives have been notified.

The Office of the Cork Coroner has been notified and a post mortem examination is expected to be conducted at CUH <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="TIME" value="2017-01-30TMO">tomorrow morning</TIMEX3>.
