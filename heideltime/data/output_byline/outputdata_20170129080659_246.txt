JUST days after three people lost their lives crossing a flooded river crossing, another group has been swept off a road near Jabiru.

Police expressed their frustration on Facebook after a Toyota Prado with six people on board was washed off Magela Crossing on the Oenpelli Road just before midday <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3> after trying to cross the flooded path.

All passengers managed to get to shore safely.“The Toyota Prado attempted to cross the creek, which was running at just below 1.4m with a fast flow, but got into trouble about halfway across,” the Facebook post stated.

“Police continue to urge all drivers not to take the risk. If it is flooded — forget it.”

Magela Crossing is listed as ‘Impassable’ on the Secure NT website.
