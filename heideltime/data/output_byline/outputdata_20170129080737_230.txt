As a local resource for Gallatin and Park County businesses, the Small Business Development Center (SBDC), announced the opportunity to participate in a beta test project. The SBDC has partnered with the MSU Launchpad, the Gallatin County BEAR program and the MSU Jake Jabs College of Business & Entrepreneurship on this endeavor. 
   
The Bozeman area <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> applied for and has been awarded a pilot program sponsored by The Local Crowd, a Laramie-based LLC, who received a USDA Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 and Phase 2 award to design and test a crowdfunding incubator to help small businesses in rural communities access new sources of non-traditional capital. 
   
The Local Crowd model combines the power of Internet crowdfunding with an educational focus designed to increase the knowledge base and sophistication levels of rural entrepreneurs and investors in using the Internet to raise money and make investments in local companies. The program has the potential to develop a new funding ecosystem ultimately revitalizing local businesses, encouraging entrepreneurial activity and creating a new way for investors to support projects they care about locally.
