President Trump's travel ban is being implemented again <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3> by US Customs at Dublin and Shannon airports, as well as at Ports of Entry across the United States. 
 
A note on the US Embassy website says that nationals of the countries listed, who have already scheduled a visa interview in Dublin, should not attend their appointment, as the Embassy will not be able to proceed with their interview. 
 
Clare based Senator, Martin Conway, is the Seanad Spokesperson on Justice, Equality and Human Rights - he says it's disappointing to see the ban imposed in pre-clearance areas at Irish airports. 
 
Meanwhile, Donald Trump insists his immigration reforms are "not a Muslim ban", and says they're "working out very nicely". 
 
The US president has been widely criticised for temporarily halting the arrival of refugees and putting controls on travellers from mainly Muslim countries. 
 
The executive order which has been implemented at Dublin and Shannon Airports, bans nationals from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen for <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P3M">three months</TIMEX3> - it bans those fleeing from war-torn Syria indefinitely - and it stops the admission of all refugees for <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P4M">four months</TIMEX3>. 
 
There have been protests at some airports, but Mr Trump is standing by his decisions. He stated that: 'we are going to have very very strict ban, and were going to have extreme vetting which we should of had in this country for <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="PXY">many years</TIMEX3>.'
