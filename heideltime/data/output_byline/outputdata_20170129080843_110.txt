It seemed like a mini sci-fi museum. There were smart air and water purifiers, smart lights, smart kettles, surveillance cameras and a smart induction heating rice cooker. Apparently, this supercomputer-backed rice cooker uses an advanced electromagnetic heating technology coupled with a micro-pressure heating technology that allows you to heat your rice uniformly. <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3>, while this seemed really cool, it will set you back by Rs 13,000 and therefore ideal for window shopping. And I’m not sure how Indian customs would react to a smart rice cooker that looked like it had popped out of a Transformers movie.

In fact, most of my time there was spent translating and window shopping. I realised that was because of a couple of things. Firstly, the store only accepted Chinese currency and Chinese cards, both of which I didn’t have. For most of the trip I was using my travel card and very limited local currency. Secondly, while Xiaomi has gained a lot of ground in India in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P2Y">the last two years</TIMEX3>, sadly, it still isn’t a brand that Indian buyers associate with premium quality or premium service. Perhaps that’s prejudiced but traditionally Indian buyers are wary of buying Chinese products, no matter how superior they might actually be to Apple or Samsung devices under the hood. Having said that, I did purchase a small portable speaker and a fitness band from the store.
