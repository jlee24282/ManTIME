The Afghan National Army's Special Forces carried out operations in Sangin and Naw Zad districts of southern Helmand province on Friday， destroying six heroin factories， it said in a statement posted on the ministry's website.

Among the drugs and materials， 1，000 kg of morphine， over 16，000 kg of ammonium chloride， 277 barrels of a chemical substance which has been used in making heroin， were also destroyed， the statement added.

"One militant was killed and two others wounded as a result of the raids， which were conducted on confirmed tip-offs， and the security force also destroyed four vehicles， three motorcycles and six weighing scales，" the statement noted.

Helmand， notorious for poppy growing， is also a known Taliban stronghold.

Some 4，800 tons of opium has been produced in Afghan provinces where government security forces had little presence in 2016， according to Afghan officials.
