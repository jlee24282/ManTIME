In the poem “Lost,” Lynn poet Gladys Hidalgo illustrates a fierce honesty. “Anarchy imprinted in my mixed blood,” she writes, “I contain the history of the south east even the west if you fly in the right direction /My pen bleeds the tears I refuse to shed for the fallen/soldiers of a war we’ve been fighting since the beginning of time/It’s never been so hard to be yourself.” There’s a raw, emotional truth to her writing, one that makes her work compelling.
