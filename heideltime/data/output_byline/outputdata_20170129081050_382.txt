Video: Wet 'N' Wild to hire hundreds... 
PALM SPRINGS, Calif. - Wet 'N' Wild Palm Springs is <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P2M">two months</TIMEX3> away from re-opening for the <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> season, but before they open the park gates, they're hiring more than 300 employees.  
 
<TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TMO">Saturday morning</TIMEX3> the water park hosted a job fair.  
 
Dennis Campbell Jr. is one of many applicants who's hoping to get hired.  
 
"I always wanted to take care of my family financial needs and I always wanted to have a job just to feel good about myself, and I think this is the place I want to do that," Campbell said.  
 
Wet 'N' Wild operations manager, Corion Wynn, said a willing and positive attitude are qualities he looks for in a candidate.   
 
The park is hoping to fill positions in at least 10 different departments.  
 
"For the lifeguards you need to be able to swim 200 yards none-stop. You need to be able to tread water and retrieve a brick. For slide attendants it's a lot easier. You just need to be able to safely dispatch people and get them down the slide safely. EMT and security guards have a little more additional training they need before hand," Wynn explained. 
 
The park will continue to accept applications into <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-SU">the Summer</TIMEX3> months. You must be <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P16Y" mod="EQUAL_OR_MORE">at least 16 years</TIMEX3> of age to apply for most positions.
