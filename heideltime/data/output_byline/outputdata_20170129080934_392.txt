Name: Outbound - The Best Local Outdoor Adventures. 

What it does: The app directs you to places and tour providers that cater to outdoor interests, such as backpacking, camping, hiking, kayaking, fishing, kite boarding, mountain biking, running, skiing, stand-up paddle boarding, surfing, yoga, photography, and more. 

Available: In the App Store, requires iOS 8.0 or later. Compatible with iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch. 

Cost: Free 

What's hot: I tested the app while on a trip to Charleston, S.C., and although I've been to that city more than 10 times in as <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="PXY">many years</TIMEX3>, I was impressed that it turned me on to activities and destinations I never knew about, such as <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> trip to Congaree National Park. There are a lot of ways to use the app; for far-reaching inspiration, go to the home page and "Search by Activity" - click on an interest, such as swimming, but instead of a specific location, click on "Anywhere" and see where the app takes you. The results took me to La Laguna, Nicaragua; Slide Lake in Wyoming; and a blue hole in Grahamsville, N.Y. - places I might never have known about or considered when researching a <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-SU">summer</TIMEX3> adventure. Yes, you can sort by season, too. 

What's not: The app sometimes crashed when I clicked into deeper pages. That didn't bother me too much because the quality of the content was so high. I was testing it on an iPhone 6 Plus Version 1
