We're ready to hop on a plane to The Land Down Under, AKA Australia, AKA The Land of Wombats as so eloquently put by Colin Hay of Men At Work during his performance at the iHeart80s Party in San Jose, California at the SAP Center <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-W04-WE">this weekend</TIMEX3> (<TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Jan. 28</TIMEX3>). 
 
In <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="1983">1983</TIMEX3>, Men At Work became the first Australian artists to have a No. 1 album and No. 1 single on the United States Billboard charts simultaneously ( Business as Usual and "Down Under"). So it would NOT be an <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="198">80s</TIMEX3> party without some of that Men At Work music we know and love.  
 
{ "position1" : { "type" : "live", "id" : 5060, "name" : "iHeart80s Radio", "description" : "Commercial-Free <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="198">80s</TIMEX3> Hits" } } 
 
Colin has released quite a few solo albums over the years, and so to kick off his iHeart80s Party performance, performed his <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> solo single "Tumbling Down."  
 
From there, he took us down memory lane with songs like "Who Can It Be <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3>," "It's A Mistake," "Overkill," "Be Good Johnny," and (of course) "Down Under."
