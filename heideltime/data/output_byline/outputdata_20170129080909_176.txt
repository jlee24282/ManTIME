The plane to Sydney can't leave soon enough for Scott Waldrom and the New Zealand Sevens team. 
 
Not absolutely everything went wrong for them in Wellington <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-W04">this week</TIMEX3>. But plenty did, culminating in a 17-12 loss to Argentina that meant the three-time defending champions finished sixth.  
 
South Africa won the final, with a convincing win 26-6 over Fiji 
 
The World Sevens Series continues in Sydney <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-W04-WE">this weekend</TIMEX3> and New Zealand co-coach Waldrom is desperate for the change in scenery to also herald a change of fortunes. The team had been fairly chipper after beating England 24-0 on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29TAF">Sunday afternoon</TIMEX3>, but the Argentine defeat knocked the smile off everyone's face. 
 
"It's been a pretty tough week. We had to deal with a lot around the old [Gordon] Tietjens controversy, the poor [crowd] numbers and the lack of support and then the coach getting Bell's Palsy so his face is a bit munted and he's talking a bit funny," Waldrom said. 
 
  
   
   
 
"The guys have been through a lot and to walk away on that note's been disappointing, because we know we're better than that." 
 
Bell's Palsy is a kind of facial paralysis which affected Waldrom in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="PXD">the last few days</TIMEX3> and was the last thing he needed. 
 
Particularly at a time when the team have been under pressure regarding the lack of spectator interest in this tournament. One of the - many - remedies mooted has been for New Zealand to pick more "name" players. Who knows, it might work. In the meantime, though, that kind of talk hardly makes young players feel they deserve to be here representing New Zealand. 
 
"We've tried to stay away from it. It's nothing we can control. Obviously better performances might get more support," said Waldrom. 
 
Fiji's supporters at Westpac Stadium appeared to outnumber - and definitely out-sung - New Zealand's in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3>'s quarterfinal and that hurt the team. 
 
"Obviously we were out-supported by the Fijians in that one and to me it felt the Argentinian crowd was even louder than ours. That's a little bit disappointing for the boys that when they do get to play in front of a home crowd, it's not there." 
 
A lack of support won't hurt so much when the team hit Sydney where Waldrom is confident they'll be better. They'll definitely need to be, because they can't continue to make the sort of soft errors and missed tackles that thwarted their title aspirations in Wellington. 
 
"There was some pretty stern words from everyone after that [Argentine] game and we're certainly good enough. You've just got to look at some of the games <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">yesterday</TIMEX3> [<TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>] and the England game," Waldrom said. 
 
"If we can put in six games like that then we can certainly be a contender for the cup." 
 
Tim Mikkelson hobbled off early against Argentina and captain Scott Curry copped a few knocks too. Waldrom indicated that New Zealand would probably take the same side to an event at which they're again the defending champions. 
 
South Africa will be the undoubted favourites in Sydney after claiming their convincing win at Wellington.
