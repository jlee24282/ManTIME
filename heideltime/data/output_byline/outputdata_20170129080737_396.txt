"A happy mind is the secret for a good mark sheet," the Prime Minister said. When a student is under tension, knowledge takes a back seat. "Do not let that happen," he told students. 
 
It is important to study to gain knowledge and not marks, he said. For a student, studying for marks is limiting. "It is important to study for knowledge," he added. 
 
To the parents, he said, "I urge parents to accept rather than expect. Our expectations from our children should not get heavy".
