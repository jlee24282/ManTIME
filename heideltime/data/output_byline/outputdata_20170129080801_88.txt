Wayne Rooney is ready to leave Manchester United in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-SU">the summer</TIMEX3> transfer window and finish his career in China, according to reports . 
 
Ambitious Far-East clubs are allegedly willing to pay the Englishman up to £1 million <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P1W">a week</TIMEX3> for his services, which would see him become the world’s highest paid footballer by far. 
 
He has <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> beaten Sir Bobby Charlton’s Man United goal record with a fabulous free-kick, but has lost his automatic starter status for club and country. 
 
The Sun’s Neil Custis claims Rooney is on the search for more first-team football as he enters the latter stages of his career. 
 
Rooney was said to be hoping to start Thursday’s EFL Cup semi-final second leg at Hull as his side were already 2-0 up, but he was left on the bench as United stumbled into the final with a 2-1 defeat. 
 
Whether Rooney decides to finish his career at Old Trafford or move elsewhere, he will always go down in the history books as a club legend. 
 
He’s been heavily criticised in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent months</TIMEX3> but deserves the right to play out his career wherever he likes, Mourinho has already talked about his extending his stay and there’s no doubt that having him at the club would be a massive boost for youngsters coming through the ranks hoping to emulate his career.
