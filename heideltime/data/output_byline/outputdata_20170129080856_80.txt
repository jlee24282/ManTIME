It can also shrink the globe in somewhat good manner," JD (U) leader Pawan Varma told ANI, adding the United States is the only country that can influence Pakistan to severe its nexus to the support and nurturing of terrorism. 

Meanwhile, the Congress Party disapproved Trump's ban, saying scrutiny should take place if there is any doubt on somebody.
