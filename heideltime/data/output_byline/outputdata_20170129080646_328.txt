James Bond star Naomie is nominated for the best supporting actress award after playing a crack addict in coming-of-age drama Moonlight.

Dev earned a best supporting actor nomination for his performance in Lion, the true story of Saroo Brierley, a young Indian boy who was separated from his family and adopted in Australia.

The Slumdog Millionaire star will compete for the award with fellow Briton Hugh Grant, who is nominated for his role in comedy Florence Foster Jenkins.

Hugh’s co-star Meryl Streep, who <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> became the first star to be nominated for 20 Oscars, is up for the SAG award for best actress.

Other British nominees include Emily Blunt, who earned a best actress nod for her starring role in psychological thriller The Girl On The Train.
