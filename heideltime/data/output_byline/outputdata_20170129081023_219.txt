Brown assumes the role of VP of Sales and Marketing during an exciting time of growth and expansion for DATAMARK. As a result of this <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> growth, DATAMARK <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> announced the opening of a second service delivery center in India, located in the country’s financial and commercial center of Mumbai. DATAMARK’s service footprint <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> extends across multiple locations in the U.S., Mexico and India. 
 
After joining DATAMARK in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2000">2000</TIMEX3>, Brown played an active role in leading software development projects for clients in the financial services, insurance and healthcare payer sectors, helping achieve new levels of process efficiency and cost savings.

She then continued to partner with Sales and Marketing to expand partnerships, services, and locations and was instrumental in driving initiatives which led to over $15 million in new revenue for DATAMARK, including the expansion of a partnership in <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2010">2010</TIMEX3> with a Fortune 100 financial services client, yielding the opening of a new domestic operational facility. 
 
In <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2012">2012</TIMEX3>, Brown established DATAMARK’s Business Engineering Department, to serve as a team of technical sales specialists for the company, and also introduced Consulting as a new service in the company portfolio. In this capacity, she and her Engineering department were involved in engagements which led to multiple new client partnerships as well as significant incremental revenue increases over the years. Thus, soon after, she was promoted to DATAMARK’s Senior Management Team as Director of Engineering, responsible for oversight of the Business Engineering and Software Development and Validation departments. In this role, she continued to exceed client expectations, establishing DATAMARK as an industry leader in core business technology to enhance operational services, including the DATAMARK proprietary Document Tracking System and INDIGO Processing System. With her extensive experience with technology and process improvement, Nina has been uniquely poised to identify opportunities for business optimization and business growth, thus continuously working to strengthen and expand the DATAMARK client base. 
 
Throughout her career at DATAMARK, she has worked closely with the Sales and Marketing teams, applying her process redesign expertise to RFP responses and business process improvement solutions for clients. Brown has also represented DATAMARK as a subject matter expert in numerous webinar presentations, marketing videos, and at industry events and tradeshows. In her new role, Brown will integrate Business Engineering with Sales and Marketing, creating a cohesive structure for business development aligned with technical sales. 
 
“I’m delighted to be leading our Sales and Marketing teams as DATAMARK moves to add new clients to our BPO and contact center services portfolio,” Brown said. “We will continue to build on our reputation as a business service provider that brings together best-fit technology solutions and a talented international workforce that acts with integrity to exceed the expectations of our partners for customer service, quality, timeliness and security.”
