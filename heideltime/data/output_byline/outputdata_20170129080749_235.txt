SCUNTHORPE United manager Graham Alexander has revealed the reasons why he allowed Luke Williams to leave on loan for the rest of the season. 
 
Williams joined Northampton Town on loan for the rest of the season on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3> after struggling to break back into the first team after a spell out with injury. 
 
Williams injured himself back in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2016-08">August</TIMEX3> against AFC Wimbledon which kept him out for a while and since then has not been able to break back into the side. 
 
Alexander said the midfielder needed game time, which is why he decided to let Williams join the Cobblers on loan. 
 
"Luke has been frustrated at not getting game time," Alexander told the Telegraph. 
 
"He got injured at the start of the season and missed a lot of football and I just think the form of Josh and Duane has made it extremely difficult for him and Haks to break in. 
 
"Luke has been frustrated and I looked at it from <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> until the end of the season and I didn't know whether Luke would get the game time he needed for his career. 
 
"We were getting lots of interest and lots of clubs were phoning up about him because of his quality." 
 
Alexander revealed it was Williams' decision to leave on loan until the end of the season. 
 
Williams featured in the Cobblers 3-0 victory over Coventry City and Alexander hopes the midfielder will be able to get game time so he comes back in good shape during <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-SU">the summer</TIMEX3>. 
 
"I spoke to him on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-01-26">Thursday</TIMEX3> and spoke to him about the situation but it let it be his decision as I always do with the players," Alexander continued. 
 
"He thought it was a good idea to go there and play games and he played <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3> and won. 
 
"We know of Luke's qualities and he will be back with us in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-SU">the summer</TIMEX3>, hopefully with 19 to 20 games under his belt."
