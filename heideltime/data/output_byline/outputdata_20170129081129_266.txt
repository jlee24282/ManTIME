INDIANAPOLIS — On <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="TIME" value="1969-04-17TNI">the night of April 17, 1969</TIMEX3>, Dick Tinkham sat courtside for a playoff game many expected the Indiana Pacers to lose. 
 
The Pacers were <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P2Y">two years</TIMEX3> into existence, facing a Game 7 against the Kentucky Colonels after falling behind 3-1 in the series. About 11,000 fans packed into Indiana State Fairgrounds Coliseum for the game, cheering and hollering the entire time. 
 
Except there was Tinkham, who co-founded both the ABA and the Pacers franchise, watching more nervously than everyone else because he knew a secret: The Pacers were <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3>-to-day operation with no long-term existence guaranteed. 
 
“We’d raised some money, we’d spent the money, and we realized we had to go pretty far in the playoffs to continue to operate because the team, early on, was not a raving investment vehicle for people,” Tinkham said. “I’m sitting there realizing, ‘What happens (if we lose)?  We don’t have a plan. You end on a playoff loss, who wants it?’ We honestly didn’t have a long-range plan at that point. We just figured we had to win.” 
 
Bob Netolicky, an ABA Pacers great, didn’t know the consequences of the game as a 26-year-old ballplayer out of Drake. He remembers Game 7 fondly for scoring 32 points and grabbing 16 rebounds, pushing the Pacers to their first-ever playoff series victory. 
 
But he didn't know that a loss might have meant the end of the Pacers. 
 
“I think, 'Thank God we didn’t know what was on the line,' because I don’t know if it would have affected the players or not,” Netolicky said, adding: “If we lost that game, which we were supposed (to do), the Pacers would fold.” 
 
Perhaps less surprising <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> that the Pacers are celebrating their 50th season as a franchise — they were founded <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="1967-02-02">Feb. 2, 1967</TIMEX3> as an original member of the ABA — the winning didn’t stop after they beat the Colonels, 120-111, that night in <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="1969">1969</TIMEX3>. 
 
The Pacers eliminated the Miami Floridians 4-1 in the next round, then suffered a 4-1 series loss in the ABA finals to the Oakland Oaks. But they had saved the franchise. Indiana won its first championship the following season and reached the finals five times total, adding two more titles in its <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DURATION" value="P9Y">nine years</TIMEX3> in the ABA. 
 
But <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2017" mod="APPROX">nearly 48 years later</TIMEX3>, Tinkham and Netolicky still talk about the night the franchise won its first playoff series as the moment that changed everything for the organization.

“The defining moment was one in which we understood we had to win to stay in business,” Tinkham said. “Because there were other owners in the league who had a lot more money than we had who weren’t winning and they were folding. The box office was not giving them enough money to operate on.” 
 
Tinkham doesn’t sugarcoat the early days. The way he tells it, on that day in <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="1967-02">February 1967</TIMEX3> when the official announcement was made that Indianapolis would once again house a professional basketball team, none of the owners knew much about the basketball industry. 
 
Netolicky refers to the years in <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="196" mod="END">the late 1960s</TIMEX3> as the sport’s “dark ages,” where “the NBA was about as popular as night bowling.” 
 
It was a different time, long before the days of superstars such as Paul George making roughly $240,000 per game. A single payday for George <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> would have covered the total salaries of all of the players from the first <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DURATION" value="P2Y">two years</TIMEX3> of the team, according to team salary records provided by Scott Tarter, a lawyer who runs Dropping Dimes, an ABA charity, and collects historical documents connected to the league.

To add further perspective: The NBA struck a <TIMEX3 tid="t34" type="DURATION" value="P9Y">nine-year</TIMEX3>, $24 billion media-rights deal with ESPN and Turner Sports in <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DATE" value="2014">2014</TIMEX3>. Local television carried Pacers games from the birth of the franchise,  generating around $2,500 in revenue. 
 
Nevertheless, the Pacers compiled a roster oozing with talent — players such as Hall of Famers Mel Daniels and Roger Brown and Freddie Lewis — and won their first playoff series in their second year in the ABA.

“That’s when really I think the city got behind us,” Netolicky said. “That was the game that kind of turned it all around for the city.” 
 
In a way, the Pacers winning that Game 7 helped revitalize Downtown Indianapolis. 
 
The city was just closing its last hotel Downtown when Richard Lugar became mayor in <TIMEX3 tid="t38" type="DATE" value="1968">1968</TIMEX3>. Hesaw the potential in talks between the Pacers and architects looking to build what would become Market Square Arena. 
 
Tinkham said he contacted Marriott in hopes of putting a hotel close to the arena’s originally proposed location near I-465, but Marriott’s evaluation revealed a hotel location would be better suited for Downtown. That led the city to urge the Pacers to build their future home arena on East Market Street. 
 
The addition of the arena helped Lugar’s administration push the city’s new identity as a “Great American City” following Unigov, which consolidated the governments of the city and Marion County in <TIMEX3 tid="t39" type="DATE" value="1970">1970</TIMEX3>. 
 
“Here we are <TIMEX3 tid="t40" type="DATE" value="2000">30 years later</TIMEX3>, we’ve got the (Indianapolis) Colts,” Netolicky said. “Without another ... pro franchise Downtown, you think the Colts would have even looked at Indianapolis?”

And yet, none of them knew — not even Tinkham — what winning that night in <TIMEX3 tid="t45" type="DATE" value="1969">1969</TIMEX3> would do for the face of the basketball and the city. No one understood at the time how important winning a game of basketball could be for the lives of millions. 
 
But that night, Tinkham learned what it took to survive in basketball. 
 
“What we found out as a result of that game was, and I hate to keep repeating myself, but you have to win,” Tinkham said. ‘You have to win in order to survive. That’s what that game taught us.”

 INDIANA PACERS vs. HOUSTON ROCKETS  
Tipoff: <TIMEX3 tid="t48" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29T18:00">6 p.m. Sunday</TIMEX3>, Bankers Life Fieldhouse. 
 
TV:  Fox Sports Indiana. 
 
Radio:  WFNI-AM (<TIMEX3 tid="t49" type="DATE" value="1070">1070</TIMEX3>). 
 
Storylines: 
 
>> According to ESPN, Houston MVP candidate James Harden assisted on or scored a total of 80 points in the Rockets' 123-118 win <TIMEX3 tid="t50" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3> against Philadelphia. The Western Conference All-Star starter concluded that game with 51 points, 13 assists and 13 rebounds for his 14th triple-double of the season. Harden enters <TIMEX3 tid="t51" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3> averaging 29.1 points, 11.6 assists and 8.3 rebounds per game, all career highs.  
 
>> The Pacers (24-22) continue to look like a different team at home than they do on the road. <TIMEX3 tid="t52" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3>'s win over the Kings at Bankers Life Fieldhouse pushes the Pacers home record to a robust 17-6. Meanwhile, they are 6-17 on the road while allowing opponents to score 8.2 more points per game (110.9) on the road that at home (102.7). 
 
>> Pacers coach Nate McMillan's decision to insert C.J. Miles into the starting lineup has paid dividends through three games. Not only are the Pacers 2-1, but Miles is +23 in game +/-, and he's averaged 12.3 points and 3.6 rebounds per game. He also has knocked down 11 of his 22 attempts from beyond the arc.  
 
>> The Pacers have been successful at home, but there will be no climbing out of 16-point holes — like they did against the Kings — against Harden and the Rockets (35-15). If they have another lapse like they did in <TIMEX3 tid="t53" type="DATE" value="2016-Q3">third quarter</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t54" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3>, expect Houston to put them away.   Rockets 116, Pacers 106.
