DUNK CITY - 

Demetris Morant scored a career-high 25 points and grabbed a career-high-tying 17 rebounds as the FGCU men's basketball team (17-6, 6-1 ASUN) dominated Jacksonville (14-10, 2-5 ASUN) in the paint en route to an impressive 78-56 win <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TNI">Saturday night</TIMEX3> in front of a near sold-out crowd at Alico Arena.

The Eagles - who lead the nation in points in the paint at 42.8 per outing - tallied 58 against the Dolphins while only surrendering 14. All but eight of FGCU's points came in the paint or at the free throw line.

Morant (Miami, Fla./UNLV/Bishop rman HS) was an uber-efficient 11-14 from the field, including throwing down eight dunks - matching the entire number of field goals Jacksonville made as a team in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2016-H2">the 2nd half</TIMEX3>. Dunk City - which is 3rd in the nation in field goal percentage at better than 51 percent - had a season-high 12 slams, energizing the crowd of 4,402.

In addition to Morant's career night, Brandon odwin (Norcross, Ga./UCF/Norcross HS)tallied 16 points and passed out a game-high seven assists, and Zach Johnson (Miami, Fla./Norland HS) netted 11 points and secured five rebounds.

FGCU held just a 36-33 halftime lead as the Eagles allowed the Dolphins - who came into the game ranked 7th in the nation in 3-pointers made - to shoot 50 percent from beyond the arc in the opening <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="PT20M">20 minutes</TIMEX3>. JU scored 31 of its 33 1st-half points from the 3-point line or free-throw line, while FGCU scored 34 of its 36 1st-half points in the paint or at the free-throw line.

While Morant set the tone offensively for the Eagles, Kevin Mickle (Brooklyn, N.Y./Broward CC/CCSU/St. Benedict's Prep) set the tone defensively. After not playing at all in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-H1">the 1st half</TIMEX3>, Mickle played <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="PT13M">13 minutes</TIMEX3> in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2016-H2">the 2nd half</TIMEX3> and arguably had the biggest impact in slowing the Dolphins' perimeter attack. After going 9-18 from 3-point range in <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017-H1">the 1st half</TIMEX3>, JU went just 2-17 in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2016-H2">the 2nd half</TIMEX3>.

The Eagles - who didn't make a 3-pointer in <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2017-H1">the 1st half</TIMEX3> - made two in the first <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="PT4M">four minutes</TIMEX3> of <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2016-H2">the 2nd half</TIMEX3> and opening the stanza on a 12-3 run and open up the game. From there, JU was only able to get as close as eight the rest of the way as the Eagles put on show to remain one game clear of USC Upstate and Lipscomb at the top of the ASUN standings.

"It was a slow start, and we did a good job of withstanding them making nine 3s in <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2017-H1">the 1st half</TIMEX3>," commented FGCU head coach Joe Dooley. "We got it going in <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2016-H2">the 2nd half</TIMEX3>. Meech was obviously terrific, but I thought Kevin was the guy who got us energized at the defensive end. That's what we really needed. After that we played a lot better, even though we didn't shoot it great from 3-point range, but our defensive field goal percentage was solid."

FGCU held Jacksonville - which came into the contest averaging 80.2 points per game - to a season-low point total, season-low field goal total (18) and season-low field goal percentage (32.7, 18-55).

J.R. Holder led the Dolphins with 21 points, while Cody Helgeland tallied 11 - nine of which came in the opening <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DURATION" value="PT8M">eight minutes</TIMEX3> of the contest. FGCU out-rebounded JU by 24 (50-26), with the 50 caroms representing a season high for the Eagles.

FGCU would finish the game at 53.3 percent (32-60) from the floor, despite going just <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2017-02-17">2-17</TIMEX3> (11.8 percent) from 3-point range. From 2-point range, the Eagles shot an incredible 70 percent (30-43).

FGCU is <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> 69-13 (.841) at Alico Arena since the start of the <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2012">2012</TIMEX3>-<TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2013">13</TIMEX3> season, including a 10-2 mark <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2017">this year</TIMEX3>. In ASUN games, the Eagles are 31-4 (.886) against league foes in the regular season in that same timeframe.

The Eagles will remain at home when they welcome North Florida (9-15, 4-3 ASUN) on <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2017-01-30">Monday, Jan. 30</TIMEX3>, for a <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="TIME" value="2017-01-30T19:00">7 p.m.</TIMEX3> tipoff. The contest will be the second between the two sides in <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DURATION" value="P6D">six days</TIMEX3>, with FGCU pulling out an 86-82 win in Jacksonville on <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="TIME" value="2017-02-01TNI">Wednesday night</TIMEX3>.
