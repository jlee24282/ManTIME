The extreme heat will continue on <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="TIME" value="2017-01-23TNI">Monday night</TIMEX3> through to <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-24">Tuesday</TIMEX3> before an afternoon cool change brings some relief. 
 
"It's going to be a hot start to the school year," Bureau of Meteorology duty forecaster Rob Taggart said. "Dropping off the kids, it's going to feel pretty warm and humid." 
 
While a sea breeze will keep Sydney's predicted maximum to a comparatively mild 32 degrees on <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-01-23">Monday</TIMEX3>, Richmond is poised to break an all-time record with a <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-01-06">sixth January</TIMEX3> day above 40 degrees. 
 
There will be no relief on <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="TIME" value="2017-01-30TNI">Monday night</TIMEX3> with temperatures in the west still hovering around or even above 30 degrees at midnight, Mr Taggart said. 
 
Compounding the heat is a "widespread severe fire danger" in southern NSW and far western NSW on <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2017-01-23">Monday</TIMEX3>, with a "very high fire danger" for Sydney and the Hunter region, Mr Taggart said. 
 
In central and south-western parts of state, <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3>'s floods have left the region vulnerable to grass fires . 
 
"Grass fuel loads are pretty high because of all that rainfall," Mr Taggart said. "The grass is pretty brown and there's a lot of it. It's ready and waiting to go." 
 
The state's maximum temperature is expected in Wilcannia, with a blistering top of 46 degrees.

If <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2017-01">this January</TIMEX3> has seemed hotter and drier than usual, that's because it has been - especially at night. 
 
Maximum daytime temperatures in Sydney <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2016-01">last January</TIMEX3> averaged 27.4 degrees. <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2017-01">This January</TIMEX3> has so far averaged 29.1 degrees, which should rise with two more hot days to end the month. 
 
Meanwhile, Sydney has smashed the previous record for hot nights in <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2017-01">January</TIMEX3>, with four nights (so far) staying above 24 degrees. The previous record was two. 
 
Sydney is on track to break the record for the number of <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2017-SU">summer</TIMEX3> days above 35 degrees, with just two more needed to break the all-time record 
 
Mr Taggart said <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2017-01">this January</TIMEX3> has been "almost certainly one of the hottest on record". 
 
And the heat won't end <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2017-W04">this week</TIMEX3>. <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2017-W05-WE">Next weekend</TIMEX3> is forecast to again hit 40 degrees, Mr Taggart said, as the Bureau forecasts a "hotter than average" <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2016-02">February</TIMEX3> with hot conditions pushing into <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2016-03">March</TIMEX3>. 
 
<TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="2017-01">January</TIMEX3> is also likely to end with less than half the month's average rainfall. So far the city has had 48.8mm, much lower than the average of 102.5mm. 
 
It's also significantly less than <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3> when Sydney received 249.8mm during <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="2017-01">January</TIMEX3>. 
 
Elsewhere in the state, Moree is in the middle of a remarkable hot streak, with the town sweltering through 34 consecutive days above 35 degrees. Mr Taggart expects that to stretch to <TIMEX3 tid="t34" type="DURATION" value="P41D">41 days</TIMEX3> based on <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> forecasts, close to the state record. 
 
"The forecast for <TIMEX3 tid="t36" type="DURATION" value="P7D">the next seven days</TIMEX3> is pretty horrific," Mr Taggart said. "That heat is completely unrelenting." 
 
"The forecast seems bad for Richmond and Sydney, but it's nothing compared to Moree."
