Newspapers, coins, stamps and a Sears catalog were among the 46 items recovered from a time capsule placed at the former Safety Hall in Redlands <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="1967" mod="MORE_THAN">more than 50 years ago</TIMEX3>.

Without knowing what they would find, city officials opened the time capsule <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-01-26">Thursday</TIMEX3> at the A.K. Smiley Public Library. They discovered numerous documents reflecting the city and community in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="1962">1962</TIMEX3>, when Safety Hall was built.

“Smiley Library has a unique role in the community,” said Don McCue, library director. “All things historical we feel we have the responsibility for, and this time capsule is included in that.”

Mayor Paul Foster read an inventory of the items in the capsule as McCue removed them one by one, displaying them on a table in the library’s assembly room.

There were membership rosters for community organizations, city documents and documents from the Redlands Unified School District and the University of Redlands.

After learning about the time capsule, Nathan Gonzalez, head archivist at the library, scoured through newspaper archives to find out more.

He learned the capsule was placed inside the outer wall of the building on <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="1962-11-24">Saturday, Nov. 24, 1962</TIMEX3>.

“Thank goodness for newspapers,” said McCue, who attributed articles with providing details about the capsule.

<TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2017-01" mod="START">Earlier this month</TIMEX3>, city staffers removed the time capsule and plaques from the building, which has been vacant since it closed in <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3>.

The city <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> sold the building to VantageOne Real Estate Investments.

The time capsule was discovered by ECORP Consulting Inc. in Redlands when going through building documents, said Tom Robinson of VantageOne, who attended the ceremony <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2017-01-26">Thursday</TIMEX3>.

“We are grateful to you for opening the doors over there for us, for our team, our staff to take these bits of Redlands history out of the building before you progressed with other work being done on that site,” Mayor Paul Foster told Robinson.
