The Olympic champion was the leader after the opening two rounds, but he carded a one-over-par 73 to slip back to seven under, two shots off joint leaders Patrick Rodgers and Brandt Snedeker. 
 
Rodgers, who is searching for a first PGA Tour win, fired five birdies in his 67, the joint-best round of the day, to propel himself into contention, while defending champion Snedeker compiled a 70. 
 
Rodgers said on pgatour.com: "The conditions were awesome, that's why we come to San Diego, the sun was out and there was no wind, so it was fun to make a few birdies." 
 
Tony Finau also shot 67 to move up to eight under with Cheng Tsung Pan. 
 
Rose is one of eight men on seven under.
