 Bengaluru:  Former Karnataka Chief Minister SM Krishna, who has quit the Congress, <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3> dismissed speculations about changing camps and a possible meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The leader, who had been one of the towering figures of the Congress for <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P50Y" mod="LESS_THAN">nearly 50 years</TIMEX3>, had quit <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TNI">last night</TIMEX3>, miffed that he was being sidelined in the party. The senior leaders of the state Congress - including Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and state party chief G Parameshwara - had said they were unaware of Mr Krishna's decision. 
"I felt for some time that Congress doesn't need me, the party <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> depends on situation managers. They do not want time-tested leaders and workers," said Mr Krishna, who had served as a central minister under former Prime Ministers Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi and had been the External Affairs Minister in the Manmohan Singh government since <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2009">2009</TIMEX3>.   
"I have won elections and have been defeated. According to me, age is a state of mind, age shouldn't be a criteria, there are people who are young but not active," said Mr Krishna, who had quit as the Governor of Maharashtra in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3>. 
Aiming to return to active politics, he had toured the state extensively to campaign ahead of the <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2013">2013</TIMEX3> assembly elections in the state, which the Congress won . "Nobody questioned my age then. Unfortunately it is somebody else who decides, not me," he said. 

 
Mr Krishna said many have asked him to reconsider, "But I stick to my decision of quitting Congress." 
While the next step is not decided, he said it was a time for "introspection" for him - a process that will involve family and friends. "I have no plans to meet the PM. All are speculations...  I am not in a position to spell out what my future plan is," Mr Krishna said. 

But he made it clear that he was not planning to retire. "Retirement is not a word in my dictionary... I had said few years back that 'a politician never retires he fades away'.
