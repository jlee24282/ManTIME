Despite some outstanding individual performances, including several state qualifying efforts, the Wilmington High Boys Track team suffered a 44-42 loss to Middlesex League rival Stoneham in their most <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> dual meet, held on <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-10">January 10</TIMEX3> at Boston University. 
 
While the Wildcats were unable to come away with a win, coach Mike Kinney was anything but disappointed in his team’s effort on the day. In fact, it was just the opposite. 
 
“I am extremely proud of this team’s resolve, commitment and work ethic,” Kinney said. “Their hard work is going to pay off as we press forward looking towards the league and state meets at the end of the season. Overall, we have a young team but have received outstanding leadership from the seniors.” 
 
One of the biggest highlights of the meet for the Wildcats was senior Nick Gorham throwing a monster personal best throw of 44’11” to take the shot put.

Other top performances for the Wildcats came from sophomore Kevin Elderd, who ran a personal best of 5:06 to take second in the mile, along with fellow sophomore Ben Packer, who took second in the two mile in a time of 11:06.62. Senior Ryan Aldrich, meanwhile, took second place in the 600 meters in a time of 1:32.40. 
 
The Wildcats best event of the day was the 300 meters, where they swept the top three spots behind the efforts of juniors Sean Braz (40.25) and Tom Hogan (40.42), along with sophomore Joe Dumolin (40.93). 
 
Senior Dave Bell had an outstanding day, grabbing a third place finish in the 55 meter dash in a time of 7.11, while also helping to lead the Wildcats to a win in the 4x400 relay, running the first leg in 57.5 seconds. Bell was joined in winning the 4x400 by Sean Braz, Ryan Aldrich and Ray Russell. 
 
In the high jump, sophomore Jordan Olatilu took second place with a top mark of 5’05”, while Dumolin placed third at 5’03”. Sophomore Sam Vince meanwhile, ran a personal best 9.99 to take second in the 55 meter hurdles.
