TROY – The Troy Trojans chipped, clawed and skimmed away at Georgia State’s 14-point halftime lead but fell short of victory in a 78-72 loss to the Panthers <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> at Trojan Arena. 
   
“A tough loss to a really talented team, one of the hottest teams in the league <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">right now</TIMEX3>,” Trojans head coach Phil Cunningham said. “As poorly as we played for the first 10, <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="PT12M">12 minutes</TIMEX3> and couldn’t get anything going offensively, we were in the game. We had a five- or <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="PT6M">six-minute</TIMEX3> stretch where they took control of the game at the end of the half.” 
   
Georgia State (13-7 overall, 6-2 Sun Belt Conference) entered the contest with a four-game winning streak – its last loss coming to Troy in Atlanta on <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-01-09">Jan. 9</TIMEX3>. Despite seven turnovers in the early going, the Trojans (11-11, 3-5) pulled within 21-19 on a trey from Jeremy Hollimon with 5:57 left in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-H1">the first half</TIMEX3>. 
   
That served as Troy’s last basket from the field in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-H1">the first half</TIMEX3>, though, as the Trojans’ turnover woes continued. 
   
Troy managed just three shots in the final 5:57 and committed four turnovers in the stretch. That allowed the Panthers to build a 34-19 lead with <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="PT55S">55 seconds</TIMEX3> left in the half. 
   
“We have had some struggles with turnovers, but give them credit. It’s that zone,” Cunningham said. “Whenever we play Georgia State, we talk about keeping your head up because they’ll create some turnovers – but they turned them into points <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29TNI">tonight</TIMEX3>.” 
   
Kevin Baker broke the scoreless streak with three free throws, but D’marcus Simonds scored on a layup with <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="PT2S">two seconds</TIMEX3> left to give the Panthers a 36-22 advantage. Simonds, a freshman, had eight of his 26 points in the stretch. 
   
“That was a stretch when we had no answer for Simonds,” Cunningham said. “Simonds really controlled the end of that <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2017-H1">first half</TIMEX3>.” 
   
Troy, though, chipped away at the Georgia State lead in spurts. Jordon Varnado opened the half with a layup then blocked a Panther shot on the other end. 
   
DeVon Walker rebounded and fed Wesley Person for a trey. After Georgia State hit a free throw, Person buried another long-distance shot, and Troy trailed 37-30 just 1:24 into <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2016-H2">the second half</TIMEX3>. 
   
“We said we had to play with more energy coming out in <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2018-H2">the second half</TIMEX3>,” he said. “A couple of threes and the big block – some good looks – kinda sparked us to go on that run.” 
   
The Trojans pulled within four on a layup from Alex Hicks with 10:49 left, but the Panthers pushed it out to nine on a layup from Jordan Session with 9:28 left. 
   
Still, Troy kept making charges. Baker buried a pair of treys – including a 30-footer – and Hollimon added a pair of free throws. His last make from the charity stripe cut the Panthers’ deficit to 60-57 with 6:06 left in the game. 
   
Georgia State responded, though, with a 7-0 run. Malik Benlevi dunked over the Trojans and followed with a layup. Jeff Thomas, who was 3-of-4 from the outside, followed with a trey to up the Panthers’ lead to 67-57. 
   
“Stops, you got to get stops,” Hollimon said. “You can’t trade buckets when you’re trying to come back and take the lead. We didn’t get the stops we needed.” 
   
Yet, Troy made one final push. 
   
Down 74-64, Person notched a trey. Daniel Peace came up with a steal, and Baker found Person for another trey with <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DURATION" value="PT49S">49 seconds</TIMEX3> to go. 
   
Georgia State iced the game at the free throw line. 
   
Behind Simonds, Jeremy Hollowell had 14 points, while Thomas added 11 to pace the Panthers. Person had 25, while Hollimon netted 16. Varnado and Baker chipped in nine each.
