<TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="XXXX">A year ago</TIMEX3> at this time, Erin Shoemaker was banned to the sidelines, due to a knee injury that cut short her season with the Bartlesville High School varsity girls basketball season. 
 
Shoemaker displayed <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="TIME" value="2017-01-27TNI">Friday night</TIMEX3> what the Lady Bruins missed. 
 
She churned out a game-high 17 points — including five three-pointers — to energize Bartlesville to a 56-44 thumping of the Jenks High School Lady Trojans, at the Phillips Fieldhouse. 
 
The squads met in Bartlesville’s Throwback Game — which is played in the Fieldhouse that was home for College High/Bartlesville High hoops from <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="1940">1940</TIMEX3>-<TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2005">2005</TIMEX3>. 
 
The throwback label turned out to have a double-meaning — both Jenks and the Lady Bruins played fierce, old-school, blue-collar determination. 
 
Joining Shoemaker on the ledger of double-digit scorers for the Lady Bruins were Jena’ Williams and Avery Allen with 13 points apiece. 
 
Lauren Richter — with nine points — just missed out on being part of that group. 
 
Makenley Church and Tatiana Gilford tallied 15 and 11 points, respectively, for Jenks, in the Frontier Valley Conference clash. 
 
Jenks struck like lightning in the opening seconds, with a layup — off the opening tip — by Church. 
 
Bartlesville (9-7, 5-2) pulled even on a slicing layup drive by Allen, who stormed through the unguarded middle of the paint, 2-2. 
 
The teams continued <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="PTXM">the next few minutes</TIMEX3> to trade points. Bartlesville went ahead, 4-2, on two free throws by Richter, but Jenks later regained the lead, 7-6, on a free throw by Church. 
 
Two more Richter free throws — with 2:14 remaining in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-Q1">the first quarter</TIMEX3> — flip-flopped the lead in favor of Bartlesville, 8-7. 
 
Shoemaker shoehorned in a three-pointer, with <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="PT1M">about a minute</TIMEX3> remaining in the period, to power Bartlesville to an 11-7 advantage — which is where the score would remain at the end of <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2017-Q1">the quarter</TIMEX3>. 
 
Shortly before Shoemaker’s trey, Williams took a charge under the Jenks basket to prevent the Lady Trojans (5-11, 3-5) from regaining the lead. 
 
Jenks burst back — on a 6-2 run — early in the second period to forge the game’s third tie, 13-13. 
 
Both offenses then stalled for <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="PTXM">several minutes</TIMEX3>, with Bartlesville missing on two three-point attempts on the same possession — thanks to an offensive rebound by Trinity Parker — and Jenks failing to find the bottom of the net. 
 
But, the Lady Bruins finally broke the tie when Richter nailed 1-of-2 free throws with 2:27 remaining until halftime, 14-13. 
 
However, Jenks’ Church then had a three-point prayer answered and the Lady Trojans went ahead, 16-14. 
 
But, Bartlesville’s scoring hiatus then ended. 
 
Bartlesville surged on a 10-0 run — in the final 1:02 of the half — to take an eight-point lead into the break, 24-16. 
 
Shoemaker fueled the rally by canning a three-pointer, while Parker made a stick-back on a missed transition layup. 
 
When Bartlesville — which is coached by Krista Binam — opened <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2016-H2">the second half</TIMEX3> with an 8-0 run, it was beddy-bye time for Jenks. 
 
Richter started <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2016-Q3">the third quarter</TIMEX3> scoring on a layup — set up by Shoemaker’s zip pass. 
 
Shoemaker then stuck in two three-pointers to extend the Lady Bruin lead to 32-16. 
 
Jenks trailed the rest of the way by double-figures. 
 
Bartlesville reached the 40-point mark on two free throws by Emily Hicks — with 1:08 left in <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2018-Q3">the third quarter</TIMEX3> — to put the Lady Bruins up by 15, 40-25. 
 
Bartlesville took a 12-point lead into the final period, 42-30. 
 
Williams’ three-pointer at the opening of <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2016-Q4">the fourth quarter</TIMEX3> widened the gap back to 15, 45-30. 
 
Bartlesville achieved the 50-point plateau — for the ninth-time this season — on Williams’ driving layup from the right wing. That stretched Bartlesville’s lead to 16 points, 50-34. 
 
Bartlesville closed out its scoring on three-pointers by Allen and Shoemaker. 
 
The Lady Bruins recorded nine treys in the game. 
 
Next up, Bartlesville will play host <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2017-01-24">Tuesday</TIMEX3> to Broken Arrow (10-7, 5-3) and <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3> to Tulsa Union (9-7, 4-3).
