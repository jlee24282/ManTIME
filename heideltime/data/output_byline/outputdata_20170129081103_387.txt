Only <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="PT60H" mod="APPROX">around 60 hours</TIMEX3> of <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01">this January</TIMEX3> transfer window remains and <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> it is reported that Newcastle have had a £16m offer for James McCarthy turned down. 
 
It is claimed that Everton Chairman Bill Kenwright has told Newcastle that the player won’t be joining them, even though he is no longer a first team regular. 
 
The Mail have ran the story and whilst the Magpies could do with extra quality in the middle of the pitch, it is difficult to believe that they were willing to pay £16m for it, or indeed any sizeable transfer fee, especially as the constant message <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-01">this month</TIMEX3> has been that only loan deals will potentially happen. 
   

   
James McCarthy signed three and a half years ago and is a decent player but spending that kind of money on a midfielder who doesn’t score or create goals would be a surprise. 
 
In those three and a half years on Merseyside since moving for £13m from Wigan, McCarthy has only scored five Premier League goals and got six assists. Predictably, one of his five goals came against Newcastle , scoring the first one in a 3-0 win in <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2015-03">March 2015</TIMEX3> – the game when Coloccini was sent off. 
 
The scousers have signed Schneiderlin from Manchester United, Besic is coming back from injury, and teenager Tom Davies has emerged as yet another potential star from their production line, so no surprise if Everton would sell James McCarthy if the money was right. 
 
He has only started six Premier League matches this season and the last of those was <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2016-W50">six weeks ago</TIMEX3> when Everton lost at home to Liverpool. 
 
However, unlikely that Everton would consider a loan deal with no guarantee of a permanent transfer at the end of the season, which also appears to be the situation with other potential targets, such as Andros Townsend and Modou Barrow.
