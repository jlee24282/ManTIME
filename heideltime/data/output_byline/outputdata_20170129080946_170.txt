This year’s Winterfest theme is hanging out with Harry Potter, and the plan is to turn Carson High School into Hogwarts with teachers creating a Hogwarts themed door followed by a door decorating contest. And who posited the Harry Potter Winterfest week? CHS’ own Anya Woodbury, a Leadership student who wants to make sure her senior year is unforgettable. 
 
According to Woodbury, “I mean, I’ve always loved Harry Potter books, so I thought why not have Harry Potter as a theme? Many students have supported the idea, and <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> it already looks to be a success.” 
 
Winterfest week is <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-30">Jan. 30</TIMEX3>-Feb. 4. Classes are as follows: freshman are Hufflepuff (yellow/blue), sophomores are Ravenclaw (black/blue), juniors are Slytherin (green/black), and seniors are Gryffindor (red/yellow). Die hard Harry Potter fans, those who are teachers and administrators, are being asked to dress up as characters. Candidates for Winterfest King and Queen were announced at an assembly during AB55 <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Jan. 27</TIMEX3>. They are freshman: Sergio Montes and Olivia Singleton, Bradley Maffei and Taryn Encinas, Mark Anthony Ramirez and Alexis Philippi; sophomores: Garrett Clampitt and Taylor Dawley, Chance Smith and Nicole Hawkins, Jacob Richetta and Jazzlyn Barden; juniors: Adam Lackey and Natalie Rogers, Ramses Carrillo and Hanna Masters, Charly Lawlor and Melanie Proctor; seniors: Luke Myers and Katie Liemandt (red), Tez Allen and Skylar Swartz (blue), Spencer Rogers and Haylee Krupp (green), Luis Pompa and Chloe Dodge (yellow), Jayson Artz and Sophia Ruedy (white), and Italo Da Silva and Shaylin Segura (black). CHS Leadership is going to have a Quidditch tournament as the lunchtime activity for the entire week, and Leadership teacher Ann Britt will have a team of teachers play against the student champs on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">the last day</TIMEX3> of Winterfest. Quidditch teams must have seven players, and there must be at least two girls per team, and the Quidditch tournament will start <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-01-30">Jan. 30</TIMEX3> and continue through <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-02-03">Feb. 3</TIMEX3> during lunch in the big gym. Winners of the tournament will receive T-shirts and forever be known as the first to participate in a CHS Quidditch tournament. In fact, “Wizarding World of Winterfest” long sleeve T-shirts are on sale at the Student Store for $10.
