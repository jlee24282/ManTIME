FRANCONIA - It's been a long time coming, but big league ski racing has arrived at Cannon Mountain. 

<TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-W03-WE">Last weekend</TIMEX3>, the Franconia Ski Club hosted two FIS-level men's giant slalom races on Baron's Run at Cannon's new Mittersill facility, and UNH held the alpine events of its <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-WI">winter</TIMEX3> carnival on Baron's Run and the adjacent Taft Training Slope <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>, drawing top collegiate racers from throughout the Northeast, along with a few past and <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> members of the U.S. Ski Team. 

"This is a game changer," Franconia Ski Club coach Ryan Boissonneault said of the training and racing venue at Mittersill, which has been in the works since <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2012">2012</TIMEX3>. "The U.S. Ski Team guys were helping out <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3> with our kids who were training. They're really good role models." 

Six members of the U.S. Ski Team's Europa Cup men's group raced in both <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2017-W03-WE">last weekend</TIMEX3>'s events and the UNH carnival. They also trained on the Taft slope <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017-01-26">Thursday</TIMEX3>, preparing for their next race circuit, a series of NorAm races in Colorado, which includes some speed events. 

"<TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2017-01-26">Thursday</TIMEX3>'s training was absolutely phenomenal," said Chad Wolk, assistant coach for the U.S. Ski Team group. "We had a 12-gate Super-G on Taft, and the guys took eight or nine runs in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="PT1H">an hour</TIMEX3> and a half." 

The Mittersill venue has been a cooperative effort between the Franconia club and partner Holderness School, the state-owned ski area at Cannon, and the U.S. Ski and Snowboard Association (USSA). Mittersill was designated a USSA training site in <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3>. 

Baron's Run, part of the original Mittersill Ski Area, which opened in <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="1945">1945</TIMEX3> and closed in <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="198">the 1980s</TIMEX3>, was widened and graded, with snowmaking added. The trail is designed as a giant slalom and Super-G course. The Taft Training Slope, which is wide enough to accommodate multiple training courses simultaneously, and adjacent Valar T-bar were opened this season. 

"Baron's is a really cool hill. It definitely has a European feel," said Wolk. "It's got enough of a pitch and is long enough that you can be creative with the set (of a course). It has some tactical challenges in the middle, then a long flat at the bottom. It penalizes if you do make mistakes." 

Funding for the $4 million project came from the USSA Facilities Foundation, a federal Northern Borders Regional Commission Development Grant, the Kelly Brush Foundation, the Macomber Family Foundation, and more than 500 distinct gifts from individuals and families. 

"The smaller need that the Mittersill Project originally hoped to address was the lack of appropriate terrain on which to train giant slalom (at Cannon)," said FSC President Christina Valar Breen. "Little did we know that our hopes for a partially dedicated training hill would produce world-class results. FSC <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> has venues commensurate with the quality of its development program, and the East has a new alpine ski racing resource, right in the heart of New England." 

UNH will host the NCAA finals at Mittersill in <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2017-03">March</TIMEX3>, with the men's and women's giant slalom slated to be held on Baron's Run <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2017-03-08">March 8</TIMEX3> and the slalom on Taft <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2017-03-10">March 10</TIMEX3>. 

<TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2017-W03-WE">Last weekend</TIMEX3>'s races were the first held on Mittersill in <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DURATION" value="PXDE">several decades</TIMEX3>, and the local ski racing world is excited about the prospects for the future - both for the chance to see great racing and for the training opportunities it opens for young ski racers in the region. 

"We are so lucky to have this venue in our backyard," said Ivar Dahl, snow sports director for Holderness School, and a former Franconia Ski Club racer and longtime coach. "Mittersill brings a wider variety of terrain, ample room, the ability to run full length GS. variability, and more interaction with coaches, teammates, and visitors. It's the ultimate playground for alpine ski racers." 

It's not just the coaches who are excited about the opportunities Mittersill presents; the club kids who are there on the hill training alongside collegiate racers and U.S. Ski Team members - and watching them ski - are liking the new normal. 

"The other day, we trained next to UNH kids, and I've seen some U.S. Ski Team racers warming up," said Nolan Sweeney, age 13, who lives in Littleton and trains with the FSC Academy. "The hill is really great. You know it's a good hill with the U.S. Ski Team is training here." 

It seems likely those U.S. Ski Team racers will continue showing up at Mittersill when they're in the area. 

"Everything we've seen here has been positive," said Wolk. "People are excited to have racing here. Everyone in the East should come here and train."
