The new hassle-free 'maintenance menu' follows the launch of Hyundai Sense Service Plans <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2016-FA">last autumn</TIMEX3>, and brings similar benefits to owners whose cars exceed <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P5Y">the five-year</TIMEX3> warranty period.

Owners can choose from three eSENSEtials servicing tiers: Base, Interim and Full, all of which include the same core benefits.

All work will be undertaken by trained Hyundai technicians, plus all applicable engine management software updates, and a <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P2Y">two-year</TIMEX3> Hyundai warranty on all parts fitted during the service.

In addition, owners receive an official Hyundai stamp in the vehicle's service book and have the car's Digital Work Record updated.

One of the most significant benefits is the inclusion of <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">12 months</TIMEX3> free AA Roadside Assistance, offering year-round cover for breakdowns that occur more than 0.25 miles from home.
