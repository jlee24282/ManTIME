Patrons at the trance music festival told 9NEWS drug taking at the event was “rampant”, despite warnings from Victoria Police. 
 
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29TMO">this morning</TIMEX3> denied any alterations to the state’s pill-testing policies at music events. 
 
“We won’t be making any changes,” Mr Andrews said at a press conference. 
 
Earlier, festival director Tim Harvey said in a statement that organisers would work with authorities to determine “exactly what happened”.

“Rainbow Serpent considers the safety of patrons a priority,” the statement read. 
 
The man’s cause of death is yet to be determined. 
 
In <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2012">2012</TIMEX3>, the death of a 34-year-old man from a drug overdose at the festival sparked debate around drug testing. 
 
The festival has previously expressed support for pill-testing, advocating for the Victorian government to bring in relevant laws. 
 
The festival hosts about 10,000 people <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="SET" value="P1Y" quant="EACH">each year</TIMEX3>.
