​When looking to fill out your rotation through the minor league level, it's always helpful to target candidates with divisional familiarity. 
 
Ex-Phillie Vance Worley certainly fits the bill for the Nationals and, if he's able to advance past the Triple-A ceiling, will be headed to Washington <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-SU">this summer</TIMEX3>. 
 
While just hours ago an Orioles return seemed possible, it turns out Worley's next innings will be a few miles down the beltway. 
   
Duquette said that #Orioles have been in touch with Vance Worley about possible return.

No matter where he goes, Worley seems to post solid numbers, totaling a 3.53 ERA in 86.2 innings of mostly relief in Oriole gear last season. He was an even-more-impressive 8-4 with a 2.85 ERA in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2014">2014</TIMEX3> during his semester in Ray Searage School along the Monongahela in Pittsburgh. 
 
There's not a lot of untapped potential, but there are plenty of solid innings here.
