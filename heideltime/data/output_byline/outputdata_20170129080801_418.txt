MINISTER in the Ministry of the Attorney General, Stuart Young, says Attorney General (AG) Faris Al-Rawi is seeking to have hangings resume but the Government has no plans for a State of Emergency.

Young made the comments <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">yesterday</TIMEX3> at the post-People’s National Movement (PNM) general council media conference at Balisier House, Port-of-Spain. 

He pointed out that the AG has been commenting about hangings and it remains the law. 

“As a Government the Attorney General is looking at the implementation of the law and he is driving that charge,” Young said. 

Asked whether the option of a State of Emergency had been discussed, he responded “absolutely not”. 

In <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011-08">August 2011</TIMEX3>, the then People’s Partnership administration implemented a State of Emergency reportedly in response to a threat to national security. 

<TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Yesterday</TIMEX3> Young, the PNM PRO, said the party has recognised the state of crime is cause for concern. 

“As a party we think it is unacceptable. 

And we will as a party work along as a Government to do and to pursue initiatives which we think the Government may be able to influence to address the major areas of crime taking place in Trinidad and Tobago,” he said. 

Young also said that as Government “we have been addressing it” and noted regular meetings with divisional heads of the Police Service, Defence Force, Strategic Services Agency and members of law enforcement. 

“It is a serious matter of concern. 

We believe initiatives need to be taken to address it frontally and to deal with it head on,” he added
