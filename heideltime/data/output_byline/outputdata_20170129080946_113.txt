, at <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="TIME" value="XXXX-XX-XXT05:58" mod="APPROX">approximately 5:58 a.m.</TIMEX3>, Long Beach Police were dispatched to the area of Redondo Avenue and 7th Street regarding a hit & run traffic collision involving a vehicle and a pedestrian. 
 
Arriving officers discovered an alert female adult pedestrian lying in the roadway in the 600 block of Redondo Avenue. Long Beach Fire Department paramedics responded and transported the victim, with severe injuries and in critical condition, to a local hospital where she later succumbed to her injuries. 
 
The victim has been identified as 78-year-old Jackie Morris, a resident of Long Beach. 
 
Collision Investigation detectives also responded to the scene. The preliminary investigation revealed the vehicle was traveling in the #1 lane when it struck the pedestrian who was pushing a shopping cart and attempting to cross Redondo Avenue mid-block. The vehicle stopped momentarily after the collision then sped away northbound Redondo Avenue, past 7th Street. 
 
Thanks to the assistance of a proactive local business owner and others, detectives were able to recover video footage. The suspect vehicle appears to be a <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2013">2013</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3> silver four-door Nissan Sentra sedan, possibly with tinted windows. Detectives believe the vehicle may likely have minor to moderate front-end damage and a missing the driver's side mirror. The vehicle remains outstanding. 
 
The investigation remains ongoing and detectives are hopeful that by releasing video and photos, someone who recognizes the vehicle or was in the area of 7th Street and Redondo at the time of the incident will come forward.
