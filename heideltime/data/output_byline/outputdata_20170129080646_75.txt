“There’s a guy not known as a pinner,” said the Nazareth head wrestling coach after his team’s 40-20 defeat at the hands of Bethlehem Catholic <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TNI">Saturday night</TIMEX3> in the Eastern Pennsylvania Conference championship match at Easton Area Middle School.

But pin was exactly what the Blue Eagle junior did against the Golden Hawks, decking Luc Mauro in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="PT1M">1 minute</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="PT4S">4 seconds</TIMEX3> at 170 pounds to erase a Becahi lead and give his team a necessary and enormous boost of confidence, enthusiasm and intensity.

Keifer, a modest sort who gives a friendly if slightly uncomfortable little smile when praised, said a pin wasn’t initially on his mind.

“I shot in a low leg shot and I felt him going for the cradle,” Keifer said. “So I figured I’d try a cradle, and I got and I was happy to get the pin.”

Maybe even happier was the enormous Nazareth fan gathering that saw Keifer’s fall as a pathway for the Blue Eagles (13-1) to hand the Golden Hawks (11-3) a stunning upset and their first loss to a District 11 foe since <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2011">2011</TIMEX3>.

That didn’t happen, due to big Becahi bonus points up top and the Hawks’ penchant for gobbling up the tossups, but it didn’t make Keifer’s big moment any less special. He posted the sole Nazareth fall of the night and delivered in the clutch in a way that had Crowell smiling.

“A guy not known as a pinner went out and got a pin for the team,” Crowell said. “It’s one thing to do something for yourself. To do it for your teammates in a big spot – that was awesome.”

Keifer was happy to help the team, but disappointed the Blue Eagles couldn’t knock off the defending EPC, District 11 3A and PIAA 3A champions.

“We are hoping to get another shot at them,” Keifer said. “We have to fix up some mistakes and sharpen things up so we can win the close ones the next time.” While nothing is certain, rematches in the D-11 and PIAA team tournaments are a very realistic possibility.

One thing Keifer has personally sharpened up is his conditioning, helped by some dawn-patrol activity.

“We run every morning from 6:20 to <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28T06:45">6:45 a.m.</TIMEX3>,” Keifer said. “It has made a huge difference for me staying in shape and being able to go <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="PT6M">six minutes</TIMEX3> on the mat.”

Of course, if Zac Keifer starts becoming more of a pinner, he won’t need to spend <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="PT6M">six minutes</TIMEX3> on thet mat all that often.
