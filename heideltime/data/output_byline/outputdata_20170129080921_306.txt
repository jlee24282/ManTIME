Apparently worried by the furore generated by the verification of workers embarked upon by his government, Kogi State Governor,   Yahaya Bello, has granted <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P6W">a six-week period</TIMEX3> for aggrieved workers to sort out their complaints with the panel he raised. 

Yahaya-Bello 

The governor, who announced the development in Lokoja <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>, said there would be no room for workers not captured by the panel after the expiration of the deadline. 

“We have had to take decisions that are hard, and we have had to follow through despite the consequences, because we believe in the outcomes. The process has been painful – for both Government and governed alike, but slowly and steadily, we are making progress. 

“To those workers who have been cleared but who could not be paid by <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2016-12">last month</TIMEX3> because of problems peculiar to the payroll for some MDAs or LGAs, we tender unreserved apologies. 

We have since made tremendous progress in updating the system and I assure you that many more of our workers will be paid soon. 

“In any case, we want to help every worker who can be cleared to get cleared. This has informed our setting up a final Staff Screening Complaints Appeal Committee <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-W04">this week</TIMEX3> whose members are drawn from the Kogi State Civil Service, sister states, Civil Society Organisations, Labour Unions, Staff Associations and a broad section of credible individuals. 

“They have <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P6W">six weeks</TIMEX3> to entertain every complaint, hear every appeal and tie off all loose ends. Once the work of this Committee is done I would have satisfied myself that the Administration has really bent over backwards to be fair to every Kogi worker. We will then go ahead to shut the doors. 

“This new Committee will use their finding where applicable to either soften or strengthen the technical data which make up the bulk of the reports from the previous stages of the Screening Exercise. Her final Report will be regarded as the definitive conclusion to the Screening Exercise.
