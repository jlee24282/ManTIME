It is <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="TIME" value="2017-01-26TMO">Thursday morning</TIMEX3> and past time for this column to be on its way. 
 
Joseph, 14, Lovina, 12, and Kevin, 11, are almost ready for the school bus. Son Benjamin, 17, is hitching up a horse to take our daughter Susan to work. The temperature is staying right around the freezing mark <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29TMO">this morning</TIMEX3>. All our snow has disappeared. The weather lately seems too warm for this time of the year. We are hoping for more cold weather <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-02">next month</TIMEX3> which makes it easier to butcher beef and pork. When the temperature is cold, you can keep the meat cold while you work with it. 
 
Our week started out differently from usual. Susan and I were washing laundry in the basement when daughter Loretta, 16, heard something fall upstairs in the hallway. She called up to daughter Verena, 19, and didn’t get an answer. Since it takes Loretta longer to climb the stairs, she yelled down to the basement for us to come help. 
 
Verena was breathing but could not open her eyes or talk to us. I called her doctor and they said to take her to the ER. Lots of tests were done, but she would not respond. The doctors decided to transfer her to a bigger hospital <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="PT1H">an hour</TIMEX3> away. She was admitted there and a CT scan, MRI, and lots more testing was done. She started opening her eyes and finally said a few words to me. <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="TIME" value="2017-01-24TEV">Tuesday evening</TIMEX3> she was released and we brought her home. The doctors think it was due to some <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> head trauma that caused her to black out like that. 
 
She has a history of lots of small concussions since a bad one in <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2009">2009</TIMEX3> in which she lost <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="P1Y" mod="MORE_THAN">over a year</TIMEX3> of her memory. She has been through a lot. She seems weaker than usual since she’s home and has headaches. She would be interested to hear from others that have dealt with post-concussive syndrome after a brain concussion. She has had her share of hospital visits due to past concussions. The brain is hard to figure out and doctors still have lots to study about how differently one brain heals from another. 
 
It’s a scary moment for the family when you can’t get someone to respond and not sure what will happen. That is when we especially depend on God! He is in control. Let us trust him for he makes no mistakes. 
 
<TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Today</TIMEX3> we will go help daughter Elizabeth with her cleaning preparing for church services at their house. Her husband Timothy’s family went to help them on <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2017-01-24">Tuesday</TIMEX3>. Church services will be there <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DURATION" value="P1W">a week</TIMEX3> from <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3>. This is a new experience for them to host church services. Jacob and Emma will host services <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DURATION" value="P2W">two weeks</TIMEX3> after Timothy’s so we also want to help Emma with her cleaning. It doesn’t look like there will be much time to rest <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2017-WI">this winter</TIMEX3>. Our friend Beth is going to take us to Elizabeth’s with her van. I didn’t want Verena to ride in the buggy yet. Verena will go along but can rest over there. She can help keep Baby Abigail entertained while we clean. 
 
Time is going fast and I need to be ready to go by <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29T08:30">8:30 a.m.</TIMEX3> God’s blessings to all. Prayers would be greatly appreciated and we will do likewise in great weakness. Stay healthy.
