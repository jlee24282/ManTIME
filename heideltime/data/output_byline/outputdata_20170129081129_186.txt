 Both the leaders avoid answering how the seats in Rae Bareilly and Amethi, both bastions of the Gandhi family, will be divided between the Congress and SP.  We are going to fight united and show the BJP that you cannot divide this country, you cannot trample over the people in this country and win elections: Rahul.  Akhilesh echoes Rahul on whether Dimple Yadav, the UP CM's wife, will be on the campaign trail.  On whether Priyanka campaigning, Rahul says it's a decision that's up to her.  SP- Congress alliance in Lok Sabha not yet discussed, but is a possibility, the Congress vice president says.  Our goal is to defeat the RSS-BJP ideology: Rahul  This is a historical alliance, Gandhi says, responding to a reporter's question.   Uttar Pradesh's DNA holds brotherhood and progress, not anger, Rahul Gandhi says.  'Ache din waalon ne ache din dikhaaye nai' (Those who meant to show us the good days haven't shown us the good days), Akhilesh says, taking a dig at PM Narendra Modi .  The two parties, Rahul adds, are fighting the election together based on their similarities.  We want to bring a new kind of politics to Uttar Pradesh, the Congress leader.  The country and its people are hurting because of politics of anger, says Rahul.  We are two wheels of a cycle moving towards development, says Akhilesh on alliance.  Together, Congress and the SP will speed up the progress and prosperity in UP, the CM adds.    There is no doubt that we will secure a majority in the Assembly election, Akhilesh says.  People want this alliance to succeed, Yadav adds.   We've known each other, but I am happy that we <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> get to work together, UP CM Akhilesh says.  This is a triple P: Progress, prosperity and peace, says the Congress vice president.  This is like the meeting of Ganga and Yamuna, says Rahul.  Rahul hugs Akhilesh once. Cameramen request for an encore. The duo. They oblige.  Theme song prepared for SP-Congress alliance plays before the two address the gathering.
