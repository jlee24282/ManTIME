PETALING JAYA: India’s external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj has asked for information from the Indian High Commission over an Indian national stranded in Malaysia. 
 
“I have asked for a report from Indian High Commissioner in Malaysia,” Swaraj tweeted on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>. 
 
According to The Indian Express, Swaraj’s request was in response to reports that Jagat Singh, from the state of Uttarakhand, had his passport seized by his employers when he wanted to return to India. 
 
Jagat, who reportedly worked in a hotel in Malaysia, was forced to continue working. 
 
It was reported that he was able to elude his employers but found himself stuck in Malaysia. 
 
He contacted his family back home to inform them of his plight, after which they requested the assistance of Swaraj.-thestar
