Ask yourselves: In <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3>, how many citizens jumped the White House fence? That answer is 6! One man even made it all the way in with a knife. You really believe terrorists would attack civilians instead of the White House or a Military Base or a Federal building? They would NOT! People that have no Army, no Navy, no type of Aviation supposedly attack a Super Power and take responsibility. Ask yourselves why would they attack then claim responsibility when they could move in silence, hitting place after place, undetected? F.Y.I: There are well over a BILLION MUSLIMS in the WORLD and they've made up less than 1% of all attacks since World War II. Think about that. Our own government plots against us and blames it on other countries. Don't live in fear. Open your eyes and don't fall asleep. All those who were banned never once attacked Americans. Revolution! #wakeup 
     
Keep calm and remember Trump is right there are 1.2 billion Muslim's in the world and about fifteen to twenty five percent are radicals, possibly higher. . "You're looking at 180 million to 300 million people dedicated to the destruction of Western civilization and you're worried about Trump protecting you, are you that stupid that maybe you want to see another attack and then at that point you will see the light? At that point you will start saying OK <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> I believe the facts, and if the president knew this why didn't he do something to try and save us, that's what he is trying to do, you snowflakes. The temporary ban and extreme vetting will help us gather much information during this process. Islam is not a religion it's an ideology , get yourself a Quran and read it, you need to do this, read everything on it on your own, once you do all the pieces of the puzzle will come together. You got a president <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> that is looking out for you. Of course not all Muslim's you meet seem bad but if their allegiance is to the Quran get yourself a Quran. I have Muslim friends that never read it. What happens when they are called upon. Just want to be safe, I am sure you don't want to see another terrorist attack ever, same as me. God forbid something happens, the right will be showing in the aftermath all these protesters disrupting what Trump wants to do, and they will look bad, this ain't a contest, it's simply about safety. Temporary ban, extreme vetting, protest all you want Trump is right. 
     
I find it amazing how quickly these people come up with their professionally made signs. Makes one wonder where they came from and who is funding these organized protestors.
