This is the best and most interesting orientation session I have ever had. I feel its importance more after reaching the US. Especially to know about accommodation, leasing agreement, coins usage; like I didn't know what dime is. I just wanna thank Jennifer for spreading awareness about US culture in India. All the best for everyone who participates in this session. 2 Authentic Journeys Chronicle <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2014">2014</TIMEX3>-<TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3> www.authenticjourneys.info Participant Feedback Vinodh Subramanian Attended: US Culture Awareness Predeparture Program  3. “The US culture training was quite helpful for me. In fact I was able to put much of the session into practice here in the US in real time. Starting from a hand shake, food habits, public transport, usage of words, work culture, dress etiquette, meeting etiquettes and lot more. The bonus part is that she still keeps contact with everyone and sends news letters based on the season, climate, functions and festivals here in the US. This gives us enough heads up about the upcoming things/ events in our pipeline. Jennifer is a true helper. I even reached out to her via mail/calls for some of my personal issues/questions and she helped to the best of her ability. The course is a real value-add and I highly recommend it to people who are ready to start their stint in the America.” (Abbreviated) 3 Authentic Journeys Chronicle <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2014">2014</TIMEX3>-<TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3> www.authenticjourneys.info Participant Feedback Hari Krishnan Attended: US Culture Awareness Predeparture Program  4. The other day, for the first time ever, I spoke on the phone with my cousins who were born and raised in the U.S. I have never spoke to them on the phone before. Even when they used to come to Kerala, I avoided talking with them, because I was too shy and worried we couldn’t understand each other. Your classes have helped me understand how to speak across cultures as well as improve my listening skills. I have been able to improve my working relationships as well as my family relationships. I am so happy! Thank you!! 4 Authentic Journeys Chronicle <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2014">2014</TIMEX3>-<TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3> www.authenticjourneys.info Participant Feedback Name Withheld Attended: Accent & Clear Speaking Sessions  5.
