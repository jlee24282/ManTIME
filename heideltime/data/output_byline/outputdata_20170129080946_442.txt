Buddhist spiritual leader Dalai Lama will attend the inaugural session along with a host of leaders from India and abroad, Speaker Kodela Sivaprasada Rao said addressing a press conference. 

The vision of NWP is to enable and encourage social, political and economic empowerment of women in all strata of the society. 

"The NWP will come out with Amaravati Declaration on women empowerment at the end of <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P3D">the three-day</TIMEX3> deliberations," the Speaker said. 

"National Women's Parliament will be a common platform for women from diverse backgrounds like politics, arts and culture, sports, education, industry, media, cinema, judiciary and social sector to share their knowledge and research in the area of women's social, economic and political empowerment," he said. 

Asked if a resolution would be passed at the conclave seeking the long-pending 33 per cent reservation for women in Parliament and state legislatures, the Speaker said the issue would only be "discussed". 

"We want to stay clear of any controversial issues," Kodela said. 

The NWP, a first-of-its-kind conclave in India, would facilitate interaction between women from varied backgrounds and also girl students to raise awareness on issues like malnutrition, social security, sexual harassment, sanitation, oppression and other gender-based problems. 

"One of the objectives of this conclave is to make girls realise their potential and make them aware of the canvas where they can leave their footprints. 

"Our endeavour is to enhance the network between eminent women and girl students to enable them to take leadership roles in all sectors," Kodela added. 
There would be seven plenary sessions at the event with 

discussions on subjects like socio-political challenges in women empowerment, women's status and decision-making power, building own identity and vision for the future. 

As many as 91 parliamentarians, 401 legislators, 300 social and corporate sector leaders from India and abroad are expected to attend the NWP while over 10,000 "socially and politically sensitive" girl students of higher education will interact with the women leaders, the Speaker said. 

Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan, Bangladesh Parliament Speaker Shirin Sharmin Chaudhury, Governor E S L Narasimhan, Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje Scindia, Puducherry Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi, noted Gandhian Ela Bhatt, Lata Mangeshkar, actresses Juhi Chawla, Manisha Koirala, Sania Mirza, Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus and a host of other luminaries will attend the event.
