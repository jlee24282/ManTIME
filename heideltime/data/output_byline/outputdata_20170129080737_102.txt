SUNBURY — Unmarried couples living together inside city limits could be arrested for breaking a Sunbury ordinance. 
 
That’s no joke. It’s actually the law, according to city ordinance 121-7 of <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="1971">1971</TIMEX3>. 
 
A single woman out for a night on the town should think twice before asking that nice gentleman at the bar to buy her a drink. She could be cuffed by Sunbury’s finest. 
 
The ordinance is specific to ladies.  
 
Once again in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="0121">121</TIMEX3>-7, the ordinance states that any solicitation of drinks is illegal and any owner or bartender that allows this behavior to take place is also in violation of the ordinance. 
 
“What?” stunned Sunbury police chief Tim Miller asked when presented with the question on whether he would command officers to make arrests based on the ordinances. 
 
“Not a chance.” 
 
It almost seems like city officials and former mayor, the Rev. Donald Morgan, may have received advice from two of the most famous fictional television landlords of all time: Stanley Roper and Ralph Furley. 
 
“Mr. Roper,” played by Norman Fell, and “Mr. Furley,” played by Don Knotts, were landlords on the hit ABC television show from <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="197">the 1970s</TIMEX3>, “Three’s Company.” 
 
Both landlords always tried to catch “Jack Tripper,” played by John Ritter, in a lie about his living arrangement with his two female companions. 
 
According to section B of 121-7, if a landlord or hotel manager even suspects the unlawful registration of an unmarried couple and rents to the couple anyway, he, as well, is at fault and in violation of the law. 
 
“We need to get these updated,” Miller said. “Many of the ordinances are extremely dated and an overhaul is in order. We can actually just get rid of a lot of these.” 
 
According to a spokesperson at the Pennsylvania Municipal League in Harrisburg, each municipality is responsible to update their ordinances as they see fit. Having old ordinances isn’t uncommon, the spokesperson said. 
 
The Pennsylvania Municipal League is a non-profit, nonpartisan organization established in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="1900">1900</TIMEX3> as an advocate for Pennsylvania’s Third Class cities. 
 
If you do happen to get arrested for any of these older ordinances and need to seek advice of a criminal defense attorney, several may come running to your rescue. 
 
“I would say some of these are unconstitutional and I believe we would win,” Sunbury attorney Joel Wiest said. “Thankfully I never had to defend anything like this.” 
 
Luzerne County criminal defense attorney Edward Olexa said he would take the case of a female looking for drinks and argue the justification for the law violates the equal protection guaranteed by the United States Constitution. 
 
“<TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Current</TIMEX3> constitutional law prevents a state or locality from singling out individuals in laws or ordinances based on gender unless they have an exceedingly persuasive reason for doing so,” Olexa said. 
 
“In these cases it is unlikely that the city of Sunbury would be able to cite such a reason for prohibiting the conduct by women and not prohibiting it by men.” 
 
Northumberland County Chief Public Defender Ed Greco was stunned when hearing the ordinances. 
 
“After I stopped laughing I can tell you it is completely unconstitutional and unenforceable,” Greco said. “So if anyone would be arrested please call me. I’m in the phonebook.”  
 
City Councilwoman Beth Kremer said because some of the ordinances are so old they just sit there on the books. 
 
“There are some pretty screwy ones out there,” Kremer said. “It would be time consuming but I would be willing to sit down and find a way to just get rid of these.” 
 
Another Sunbury code seeks to outlaw the sale of guns and fireworks in city limits. 
 
According to ordinance 121-4, no person in the city shall have in their possession with the intent to give away, sell or offer for sale any pistol, revolver or any other types of gun. 
 
“Obviously, this is another one that needs to be changed,” Miller said. “I can assure you that some of these older ordinances that are on the books will not be enforced and we really need to get updated.” 
 
Fines for these older ordinances range from $25 to $300 
 
“We know they (laws) are there and on the books but to take those out it costs thousands of dollars,” Sunbury Mayor David Persing said. “Once they would be taken out they need to be voted on and then it needs to go back to state codification to be rewritten and there is a large fee but believe me we know these are still out there and on the books.”
