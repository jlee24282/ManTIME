Prosecuting at Lincoln Magistrates' Court, Paul Wood said that items taken included 12 motorised gear boxes imported from the Netherlands, some batteries, a yellow transformer and scales which were together worth £6,000.

Then on <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2016-03-27">March 27</TIMEX3> police attended the Holland family home on Lincoln Road in Brant Broughton and found the equipment.

Referring to Matthew Holland's police interview Mr Wood said: "A traveller arrived in a white transit van and offered him all the items for £300 but he brought him down to £250.

"He said he didn't specifically ask if they were stolen. He said he was hoping to sell them on."

Mr Porter, who the equipment was stolen from, had previously had an issue with horses roaming on his land, and had called the police suspecting they belonged to the Hollands.

Two PCSOs and Mr Porter together met Matthew Holland who started "spewing abuse" at Mr Porter, repeating "I'm going to smash your face in", several times.

Mr Wood said: "He left him believing he was going to be assaulted even though he was in the presence of PCSOs."

In mitigation, Tony Freitas said: "He was trying to make a quick buck." READ MORE: He explained that both brothers come from a large travelling family and used to run a refuse site. It had become quite commonplace for people to take items directly to their house and they would take it to the tip.

He said: "This is a tradition that has carried on. I spoke to the mother and she confirms the same thing."

Speaking about the day of the argument, he said: "He admits he lost his temper, but no physical contact was made."

"He said if he did have a major problem with him and he was going to assault him he would have done it there and then."
