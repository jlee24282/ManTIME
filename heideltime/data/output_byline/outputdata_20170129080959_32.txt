<TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P9Y" mod="MORE_THAN">Over the past nine years</TIMEX3>, children in Burma, Peru, Ethiopia and Thailand have all been recipients of portraits created by Valley Central High School students in art classes. The program is called, “The Memory Project.” <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017">This year</TIMEX3>, 21 students in Kimberly Langlitz’ advanced drawing and painting classes created portraits of Syrian refugee children. Project leaders will film the children’s reactions when they receive the portraits, and compile them into a video which will be sent back to Valley Central as well as to other districts who participated. 
 
The organization connects art students with the children who have experienced trauma, whether through neglect, abuse or extreme poverty. The portraits are intended as a friendly keepsake. 
 
When the film is shown, Langlitz said there is never a dry eye in the room to see the joy that the portraits and the connections give the children. 
 
Feeding Our Neighbors 
 
The 28 ShopRite stores in the mid-Hudson have teamed with Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York, (which includes Orange, Sullivan and Ulster counties), to conduct the third Feeding Our Neighbors campaign. The two previous ones have collected more than $218,000 and 24,000 pounds of nonperishable food items. At the checkout counters, shoppers can make a donation of cash or nonperishable food for the campaign. Tom Urtz, ShopRite’s vice president of operations, <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> became a board member of Catholic Charities, Orange and Sullivan. He is well known in both counties for his leadership and the many campaigns that ShopRite has initiated. Urtz, a longtime friend of Orange County’s Veterans Coalition has been honored on several occasions by the group with awards for his leadership and support.
