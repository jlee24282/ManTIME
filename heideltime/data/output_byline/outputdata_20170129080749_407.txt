A stamp duty jackpot for the state's coffers 

Sydney's booming <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-SP">spring</TIMEX3> property market has delivered the new Berejiklian government a budget windfall.

The amount of residential stamp duty flowing into the state coffers hit new <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="SET" value="XXXX-XX">monthly</TIMEX3> records in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2016-11">November</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2016-12">December</TIMEX3>, Office of State Revenue figures show.

The NSW government collected $730 million from the residential property transfers <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2016-12">last month</TIMEX3> alone – about $100 million more than <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2016-12">the previous December</TIMEX3>. <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2016-11">November</TIMEX3>'s total of $718 million was up by $123 million compared with <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2015-11">a year earlier</TIMEX3>.

The results reversed a mid-year slump in the state's stamp duty receipts.

Turnover was very strong in the final quarter of the year. Stamp duty was paid on 21,239 residential transfers across NSW in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2016-12">December</TIMEX3>, which was 31 per cent higher than in <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2016-07">July</TIMEX3>.

The average stamp duty received per transaction in <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2016-12">December</TIMEX3> was $34,385 – around $2100 more than the corresponding month <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2015-12">a year earlier</TIMEX3>.

The strong stamp duty figures suggest Sydney's property market defied predictions of a slow-down and picked up pace in <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2016" mod="END">late 2016</TIMEX3>.

Figures released by the Domain Group <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2017-01-24">last Tuesday</TIMEX3> showed Sydney's median house price jumped 4.7 per cent in last <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DURATION" value="P3M">three months</TIMEX3> of the year to reach $1.124 million. The city's median unit prices rose nearly 3 per cent in <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2017-Q1">the quarter</TIMEX3> to $711,256.

Domain's measure of Sydney's median house price has risen by 69 per cent – or $450,000 – in <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DURATION" value="P4Y">the past four years</TIMEX3>.

While the end-of-year surge in stamp duty will bolster the state's already healthy bottom line, the figures also underscore how difficult it will be for the new Premier, Gladys Berejiklian, to improve housing affordability.

At her first press conference as Premier <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2017-W03">last week</TIMEX3> Ms Berejiklian vowed to address the housing affordability crisis, declaring it "the biggest issue people have across the state".

She said specific policies to deal with this challenge would be outlined "in the near future".

Stamp duty revenue will get a further boost in <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="FUTURE_REF">coming months</TIMEX3> as a new surcharge on the stamp duty paid by foreign investors comes into effect. The surcharge was introduced in the <TIMEX3 tid="t35" type="DATE" value="2016-06">June 2016</TIMEX3> state budget but revenue from the new measure is not expected until <TIMEX3 tid="t34" type="DATE" value="2017" mod="START">early this year</TIMEX3>.

Sydney's <TIMEX3 tid="t36" type="DURATION" value="P4Y">four-year</TIMEX3> housing boom has helped deliver the state government a massive increase in the transfer duty levies on the transfer of property and other assets.

In <TIMEX3 tid="t37" type="DATE" value="2011">2011</TIMEX3>-<TIMEX3 tid="t39" type="DATE" value="2012">12</TIMEX3>, just before the boom began, the government received $3.8 billion in transfer duty but that had swelled to nearly $9 billion by <TIMEX3 tid="t38" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3>-<TIMEX3 tid="t40" type="DATE" value="2016">16</TIMEX3>.

Residential stamp duty alone accounted for about 9 per cent of the state government's revenue last financial year.

The half-yearly review of the NSW budget, released <TIMEX3 tid="t41" type="DATE" value="2016-12">last month</TIMEX3>, lifted the forecast for the state's budget surplus for this financial year by about $300 million to $4 billion. The story first appeared on .
