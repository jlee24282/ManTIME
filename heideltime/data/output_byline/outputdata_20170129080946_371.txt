Bayern Munich edged past Werder Bremen 2-1 <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">yesterday</TIMEX3> for a Bundesliga record 13th consecutive win over them to stay three points clear at the top of the table. 
 
Bayern never hit top form but are <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> on 45 points with promoted RB Leipzig on 42 after they ended Hoffenheim’s unbeaten run this season with a 2-1 win. 
 
Dutchman Arjen Robben drilled in after <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="PT30M">30 minutes</TIMEX3> following a spectacular run down the wing from Franck Ribery and David Alaba doubled their lead, perfectly curling a free kick over the wall and into the top corner on the stroke of halftime. 
 
Max Kruse cut the deficit <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="PT7M">seven minutes</TIMEX3> after the restart, shaking off Alaba to fire in as the hosts looked more aggressive but Werder Bremen failed to find an equaliser and stayed in 15th spot, a point above the relegation playoff spot. 
 
“There are always problems during a season and <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3> it was difficult for us,” said Bayern coach Carlo Ancelotti. “But we deserved to win.” 
 
Leipzig kept up the pursuit of Bayern, coming from a goal down to beat 10-man Hoffenheim. 
 
Hoffenheim became the first visiting team to lead at Leipzig this season when Nadiem Amiri completed a sensational break and scored on <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="PT18M">18 minutes</TIMEX3>. 
 
But 20-year-old Timo Werner struck for the fifth straight home game, tapping in after <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="PT38M">38 minutes</TIMEX3> to level and take his tally to 11 league goals. 
 
Hoffenheim’s top scorer Sandro Wagner, who like Werner is hoping for a Germany call-up, was sent off with a straight red card on the hour for kicking Stefan Ilsanker, with Germany coach Joachim Loew in the stands. 
 
Leipzig made the extra man count and grabbed the winner with a deflected effort by Marcel Sabitzer in the 77th minute to leave fourth-placed Hoffenheim nine points behind.
