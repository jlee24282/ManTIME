ELLENSBURG — An already rough week for Central Washington’s men got worse <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TNI">Saturday night</TIMEX3>. 
   
Upset <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-26">Thursday</TIMEX3> at home by Concordia, the Wildcats were whipped 85-68 in GNAC play in Nicholson Pavilion. 
   
CWU’s third straight loss left the Wildcats 7-5 in the conference and 12-6 overall. It also dropped them into a fourth-place GNAC tie with Montana State Billings. 
   
Free throws, as they had been in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">last Saturday</TIMEX3> night’s loss at first-place Western Washington and again <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-01-26">Thursday</TIMEX3>, loomed large. 
   
While Central made 4 of 12, the Wolves (8-4, 11-9) were 24 of 31. 
   
Coach Greg Sparling calculated that over his team’s three-game losing streak the Wildcats have been outscored 73-24 from the free throw line. 
   
“I’m not blaming the officials, not at all,” he said. “But the thing is, we simply have got to find a way to get to the foul line more.” 
   
Center Fuquan Niles was Central’s lone double-digit scorer, and he posted a double-double with 12 points and 11 rebounds. 
   
But Dom Hunter, the GNAC’s scoring leader at 25.2 points per game, managed only nine on 4-of-17 shooting, and the team’s second-leading scorer, Naim Ladd, sat out with an injury sustained late in Thursday’s game. 
   
Ali Faruq-Bey led Western Oregon with 21 points and Demetrius Trammell, a transfer from Yakima Valley College, had 12 off the bench. 
   
“We have <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="P3D">72 hours</TIMEX3> before we take a <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="PT7H">seven-hour</TIMEX3> bus ride to Northwest Nazarene,” Sparling said, “and we’ve got to get a lot of things fixed.”

 WOMEN’S BASKETBALL  
  
Yaks fall short at TVCC 
   
ONTARIO, Ore. — The long trip to Treasure Valley — 310 miles and <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DURATION" value="PT4H">four hours</TIMEX3>, <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DURATION" value="PT30M">30 minutes</TIMEX3> under ideal conditions — was not kind to Yakima Valley’s women on <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>. 
   
Beaten decisively in the rebound column and outscored 19-3 at the foul line, the Yaks dropped an 89-75 NWAC East decision to TVCC. 
   
The loss dropped YVC into a third-place tie with the Chukars in the East. Both teams are 4-3 in region play while the Yaks are 13-6 overall and Treasure is 12-6. 
   
Sammi Blodgett and Alexis Perez scored 16 points each for Yakima Valley, which dropped out of the NWAC coaches top eight poll <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2017-W03">last week</TIMEX3>. Sequoia Swan had 14 points off the bench and Carly Davis added 10.

While YVC was whistled for 23 personal fouls, the Chukars picked up 10. 
   
Gentry Oldham had 23 points and 12 boards to lead Treasure Valley.

Wildcats fall to SPU 
   
ELLENSBURG — Taylor Baird finished with a double-double of 13 points and a game-high 13 rebounds, but it wasn’t enough for Central Washington as Seattle Pacific shut down the Wildcats in <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2016-Q4">the fourth quarter</TIMEX3> for a 54-51 come-from-behind victory in a GNAC women’s basketball game <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> at Nicholson Pavilion. 
   
Jasmine Edwards added 15 points for the Wildcats (3-9 GNAC, 8-12), who led by as many as seven points early in the fourth. 
   
After Central cut the Falcons’ lead to two points with <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DURATION" value="PT11S">11 seconds</TIMEX3> remaining, Edwards was fouled, but missed her second free throw which would have tied the game. 
   
Courtney Hollander finished with a game-high 17 points and pulled down 11 rebounds for Seattle Pacific (7-5, 15-5). 
   
Both teams struggled to shoot the ball from deep, as Central went 2 for 13 from 3-point range, while SPU finished 3 of 15.
