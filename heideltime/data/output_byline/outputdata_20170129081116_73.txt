The campaign of Fillon, a former prime minister who won the conservative Republicans' nomination <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3>, has been dealt a serious blow by claims his Welsh-born spouse Penelope did nothing to earn half a million euros ($534,000) paid from public funds <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P8Y" mod="MORE_THAN">over eight years</TIMEX3>.

Is racism legal in France? - asks Balotelli 
 
PARIS (Reuters) - A furious Mario Balotelli asked fans if racism was "legal in France" after the Nice striker accused Bastia supporters of abusing him during his team's 1-1 Ligue 1 draw on <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3>, prompting a French League investigation. 
     

  
Can conservative Fillon keep France's far-right at bay? 
 
Francois Fillon, having clinched the presidential nomination for the right-wing Republicans party, will <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> join a far bigger battle for the future of France, the European Union and mainstream politics in the West. 
    
"How can we not consider that there are forces at work to silence me and to weaken my candidacy, or even try to prevent me from appearing?" said Fillon in an interview with the Journal du Dimanche newspaper. 
 
"It is a terrible plot, but I am sure that the justice system will not allow itself to be exploited by these defamatory allegations," added Fillon. 
 
"I will not let myself be defeated ... We do not have the right to allow democracy to be spoiled by this behind-the-scenes manoeuvring, which is why I will fight with all my strength and to the end," he said.  
 
French authorities <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2017-W04">this week</TIMEX3> opened a preliminary inquiry into the allegations, which were first made by satirical weekly Le Canard Enchaine, and are also looking into payments Penelope Fillon received from a magazine owned by a friend of Fillon. 
 
Francois Fillon told the newspaper that he would only "answer to justice" and would "not submit to a trial by media", adding that he had already handed over wage slips to investigators. 
 
"The amount (allegedly) paid is false", he said, adding that Le Canard Enchaine had confused "gross and net" income. 
 
The newspaper alleged that Penelope received the money between <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="1998">1998</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2012">2012</TIMEX3>. 
 
It also said that in <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2012">2012</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2013">2013</TIMEX3>, Penelope Fillon was paid 5,000 euros <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DURATION" value="P1M">a month</TIMEX3> at La Revue des Deux Mondes magazine, owned by a friend of Francois Fillon.
