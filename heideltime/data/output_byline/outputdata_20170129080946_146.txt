Luis Enrique mounted a defence of the Chinese Super League's financial power on <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>, sticking up for players who have been accused of taking the cash <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> on offer in China. 

Chelsea's Oscar and Villarreal's Alexandre Pato are among the players who have made the move to Asia <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DATE" value="2017-01">this month</TIMEX3>, while Barcelona's Arda Turan has been regularly linked with a Guangzhou Evergrande. 

Shanghai SIPG paid over 163;50 million for Oscar and are reportedly paying the Brazilian 163;400,000-<TIMEX3 tid="t34" type="SET" value="P1W" freq="1">a-week</TIMEX3>. Diego Costa was also reported to be interested in an offer from Tianjin Quanjian and Chelsea coach Antonio Conte has said that "the Chinese market is a danger for all." 

However, Barcelona boss Luis Enrique doesn't share his sentiments, telling a news conference: "It seems absolutely perfect to me that [players] are going to China. 

"It's great if players can go to China and make a lot of money. It happens in all jobs. You, as journalists, also change jobs to earn more money and get together with your friends and they tell you: 'Great, you're a champion!'
