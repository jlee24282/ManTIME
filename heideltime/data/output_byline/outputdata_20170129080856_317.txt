Watch and discover stunning Antony Woodland Garden: 

 
Sir Richard Carew Pole, former president of the Royal Horticultural Society, said: "This is not the lost garden of Cornwall, but the undiscovered one. Sitting on the banks of the Lynher the garden has something for both serious gardeners and those after a relaxing walk in beautiful surroundings."

The gardens run along the Lynher Estuary, an area of outstanding natural beauty, and are also renowned for their stunning magnolias, rhododendrons, wildflowers and sculptures - loved by professional and amateur gardeners alike. 

The variety of flora and fauna has been planted by successive generations of the Carew Pole family, who have lived at grade one-listed Antony House since the <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="17" mod="START">early 18th century</TIMEX3>. The 100-acre garden is home to more than 600 varieties of camellias, including the National Collection of Camellia japonica, and nearly 250 types of magnolias.

The gardens are divided into two areas – the Woodland Garden and the Woodland Walk, situated where the River Lynher flows into the Tamar, with views across to Brunel's Royal Albert Rail Bridge. They boast beautiful walks, stunning scenery and the chance to see wild birds, including oystercatchers, grey herons, egrets, cormorants and shelducks along the estuary.
