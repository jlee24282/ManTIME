ANCHORAGE (KTUU) - An Anchorage man is facing charges of second degree murder and second degree assault for the fatal shooting of 19-year-old Tiwan Johnson Jr. at a parking lot in Muldoon <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="TIME" value="2017-01-24TMO" mod="START">early Tuesday morning</TIMEX3>. 
  
Prosecutors say 23-year-old Christopher Birotte fired multiple rounds at a car full of people in Muldoon <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="TIME" value="2017-01-24TMO" mod="START">early Tuesday morning</TIMEX3>, killing Johnson and seriously injuring another occupant named Eric Miller. 
 
Birotte turned himself in to Anchorage police on <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3> after learning that investigators had issued a warrant for his arrest in connection to the incident. He was arraigned at the Anchorage Jail court <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TAF">Saturday afternoon</TIMEX3>. 
 
An affidavit filed in court by APD detective Christina Roberts details the events leading up to the shooting. According to the document, a female driver took Birotte, Miller, Johnson and one other woman to the parking lot of a Brown Jug Liquor store on Muldoon Road. They were driving a blue Chevy sedan. Along the way, the group stopped at a gas station so Miller and Johnson could get cash to buy marijuana from Birotte. 
 
Once they made it to the liquor store parking lot, investigators say the three men got out of the car and began smoking together. Shortly after a fight broke between them. Birotte’s attorney, Rex Butler, say Johnson and Miller beat Birotte and robbed him of his backpack. 
 
“They beat him so bad that when he got home he had to literally crawl up the steps to his house, he couldn’t walk and his mother had to care for him,” Butler told reporters on <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>. “He was brutally beaten and robbed of his backpack. It was a planned event. They took him to a spot where they thought nobody would see what was going on.” 
 
According to the affidavit, security footage from a nearby business shows Miller and Johnson getting back into the vehicle with the two women, taking the backpack with them and leaving Birotte outside. As the vehicle starts to drive away, Birotte produces a gun and fires multiple rounds into the rear passenger window. 
 
The female driver later told police that she noticed Johnson was unresponsive after the gunfire and she started heading towards the Alaska Native Medical Center. On the way, Miller demanded to be let out of the car and so she pulled over to the side of the road to let him exit. 
 
At <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28T01:10" mod="APPROX">around 1:10 a.m.</TIMEX3> Anchorage police received a call from the female driver stating that Johnson had been shot and that she was driving him to ANMC. Officers responded to the hospital and found the Chevy unoccupied by the emergency room entrance. 
 
“There was blood and broken glass on the rear passenger seat and rear passenger door,” investigators described in the affidavit. 
 
Police made contact with the two female witnesses and brought them in for questioning. 
 
Johnson later died at the hospital. 
 
Miller meanwhile went to a residence in the Muldoon area where he contacted police to report that he’d been shot. He was also transported to ANMC and has since been treated and released, according to the hospital. 
 
When detectives interviewed Miller while he was being treated he told them Birotte had “shot at them because they stole his bag,” according to the affidavit. 
 
At the arraignment hearing on <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> the judge set Birotte’s appearance bond at $250,000 cash/corporate with a cash performance bond of $10,000. 
 
Johnson’s mother, who attended the hearing telephonically, urged the judge to set his bail higher. 
 
“I think it’s too low in my opinion because there’s no price for my child’s life,” she said. “He’s gone. I’m leaving out of state <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">right now</TIMEX3> to go bury my son.”
