| The ongoing revelations about the president’s potential vulnerability to Russian influence are unprecedented. My personal professional experience may help to place this in some context.

I served for <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P30Y">30 years</TIMEX3> in the U.S. Foreign Service, from <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="1970">1970</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2000">2000</TIMEX3>. During that time, my colleagues and I witnessed the transitions of six U.S. presidents and at least eight secretaries of state. I served at three embassies and two consulates on three continents. I worked with intelligence officers at every post, and I think it will be useful to offer a brief description of that function at a U.S. overseas mission.

Simply stated, the purpose of intelligence gathering is to provide our government with as much information about foreign governments and their policies and intentions as possible. Contrary to some <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> perceptions, this cannot be done solely using technology. Bugs and drones cannot reveal intentions. Ultimately, there is no substitute for information provided by human beings in positions to provide it.

How this is attained is not just the stuff of Hollywood — and the end of the Cold War has not changed anything. In general, all national intelligence agencies function similarly. Foreign government officials, businessmen, academicians and media figures are all targets.

I worked with CIA officers whose task was to identify host country nationals who were in positions, or who might attain positions later, in which they had information useful or vital to our national security. The process of identifying possible sources might take months, or years, but once identified as a likely source, a different officer, sent from Washington would make the "pitch." Should the target refuse, he or she was thus not able to identify who initially identified him or her.

During the Cold War, ideology was frequently the motivation for recruiting, but if the target was considered sufficiently important, money and other incentives would be offered. Creating a compromising situation could be used if necessary, and pure blackmail was the ultimate option. Such a trap could be initiated in a mundane fashion: dinner. Sports tickets. A bottle of Scotch. Even a small loan for a vacation. We were trained and expected to report even the most trivial contact.

Marital problems and tax or financial issues were vulnerable areas, but the idea that any of the gifts were offered because "they must like me" would be greeted with scorn or hilarity. In the very rare event that one was compromised and sensitive information was requested, there were two obvious reactions: One was to roll over and submit to being used in hopes the material would never be used. The other was to deny the accusations and try to denigrate the source of the charges and demand that the source be revealed.

Regarding sources, I’m amazed at the reluctance to understand why such sources need to be protected and not made public. Revealing the source not only ends the source’s usefulness and makes it more difficult to persuade others in the future, but it also reveals how the information was acquired. Even the legendary Enigma/Ultra code breakers allowed setbacks and even loss of life to protect a source that was so irreplaceable.

If any of this sets off alarm bells, it should. For a foreign intelligence officer, compromising a senior U.S. government official, let alone the head of state, would be considered a virtual fantasy. But what I have described above is the precise work that Vladimir Putin did for <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P30Y">30 years</TIMEX3>.

Dean Dizikes worked for <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P3DE">three decades</TIMEX3> in the U.S. foreign service, serving in embassies in Germany, Iran and other countries. He lives in Petaluma.
