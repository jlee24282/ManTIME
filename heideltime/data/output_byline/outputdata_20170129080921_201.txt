As the is blowing with the fury of <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-WI">Winter</TIMEX3> outside I decided to take a little break <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TNI">tonight</TIMEX3> and visit <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-SU">Summer</TIMEX3> in one of our wonderful parks.

Stevens Point is a wonderful little city with a wealth of trees and parks, it seems that every time I turn around I discover another nice little park.

A while ago I discovered Michael Koziczkowski Park and thought that it might me nice to share a little glimpse of it with you so I took out my phone and recorded a quick little tour for you to enjoy.

This is a quiet and often forgotten park hidden away along the McDill pond flowage.

Though Michael Koziczkowski park may be hidden away at the south side of town at the south end of Minnesota Ave and Business 51, it is named after a significant founder of our heritage in Portage County. Next time you are in Point, give me a call and we can go explore one of these parks together.
