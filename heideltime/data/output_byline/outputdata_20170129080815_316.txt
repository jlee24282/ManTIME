Glenn Matthews, of Celtic, pulls a ball to the leg side against Old Boys Collegians. 
   
Celtic have again fallen at the final hurdle in qualifying for the New Zealand club cricket championships. 
 
The <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3> South Canterbury <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P1D">one-day</TIMEX3> champions were no match for their Christchurch opponents Old Boys Collegians in their clash at Hagley Oval. 
 
Batting first, Celtic were in a strong position at 104-1 before they lost four wickets for 20 runs. 
   
Celtic's Tom Pavletich smashes one through the leg side in the team's eight wicket loss to Old Boys Collegians at Hagley Oval. 
   
Jeremy Liddy and Andrew Buckingham hit <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="195">50s</TIMEX3>, but they lacked support from the rest of the order as they were bundled out for 199. 
 
  
  
  
 
The pair batted patiently and guided the team safely through to the drinks break but things quickly fell away. 
 
Dan Laming, Glenn Matthews and Sam Carlaw all fell cheaply in a strong period of play from OBC. 
 
Celtic did well to make 199, however, as at 123-5 it looked as if they might fold for much less. 
 
OBC medium pacer Adam Hastilow led the bowling attack with three scalps. 
   
In the end OBC knocked off the total with ease. 
 
Carlaw, Celtic's captain, said they struggled to match the intensity thrown at them by OBC. 
 
"We dropped a couple of chances and just didn't play at the same tempo as they did." 
 
Set 200 for victory, the Christchurch Metro <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P1D">one-day</TIMEX3> title holders coasted to victory by eight wickets off the last ball of the 37th over. 
 
Opener David Wakefield and Jeff Case both recorded unbeaten half centuries, with a 101-run stand for the third wicket. 
 
Wakefield top scored with 55 after benefiting from two dropped catches, Case made 54 and Ben Ward supplied the third OBC fifty at first drop. 
 
OBC wicketkeeper-batsman Tom Taylor made a rapid fire start to the chase hitting 23. 
 
A couple of dropped chances aided OBC's cause as Celtic's bowlers were unable to contain their hard hitting opponents, on the same Hagley Oval surface used between the Black Caps and Bangladesh <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-W03">last week</TIMEX3>. 
 
Celtic lost by two wickets to St Albans in the same match <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3>. 
 
At a glance 
 
Celtic 199 all out in 48 overs (Andrew Buckingham 54, Jeremy Liddy 50; Adam Hastilow 3-37) lost to Old Boys Collegians 201-2 in 37 overs (David Wakefield 55no, Jeff Case 54no, Ben Ward 53) by 8 wickets at Hagley Oval.
