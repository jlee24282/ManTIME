By If you're looking for epiphanies, you won't find any in the study Terrebonne officials are using as the starting point for a long-term effort to make the parish less dependent on oil as a source of jobs. 
 
But the $70,000 study, paid for by local taxpayers, does offer the benefit of holding up a mirror to the parish and reflecting its strengths, weaknesses, challenges and opportunities. 
 
The effort, led by the Terrebonne Economic Development Authority, seeks to strengthen the three pillars of the parish's economy: oil and gas, seafood and agriculture and medical services. 
 
Economic-development officials also aim to encourage new industries based on recommendations in the study, which consultant Garner Economics completed <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3>. It says the parish is in a good position to grow and attract jobs in coastal restoration, aviation, food manufacturing and professional services such as engineering, accounting and law. 
 
"This is a five-to-<TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P7Y">seven-year</TIMEX3> strategy, and you can't have a strategy that just ignores oil and gas, agriculture and seafood and the gains the parish has made in the medical field," Matt Rookard, TEDA's chief executive officer, told The Courier and Daily Comet in a story published <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">a couple of weeks ago</TIMEX3>. "We have a lot of work to do, and it's not going to all happen immediately, but we have a lot of ideas on how to do it." 
 
Makes sense to me.  
 
<TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3>, let's make it happen, right? 
 
Please forgive that hint of sarcasm in my last sentence, but I have long been skeptical of so-called economic-development efforts, mainly because, at least around here, they rarely produce measurable economic development. To be fair, that is the case in lots of communities. 
 
Ours, as the study notes, faces significant and unique challenges that most others do not. For instance, focus groups cite high insurance costs as a significant deterrent to business growth. Predictions that the Gulf of Mexico will swallow almost half of Terrebonne over the next <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="P30Y">30</TIMEX3>-<TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P50Y">50 years</TIMEX3> aren't going to make insurance any cheaper.  
 
Coastal erosion, sinking land, rising seas and the threat of hurricanes <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P6M">six months</TIMEX3> of <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="SET" value="P1Y" quant="EVERY">every year</TIMEX3> won't make it any easier to attract businesses outside the oil industry, which has a vested interest in being close to the Gulf. 
 
Focus groups also cited bad roads, bridges, sewer systems and the other infrastructure that, done well, can enhance not just business but life for everyone, as a challenge. And that won't be easy to fix in a state that stumbles from one financial crisis to the next instead of creating a sustainable plan matches tax dollars with priorities for public services. 
 
But all is not lost. The plan offers a step-by-step plan aimed at generating new jobs. But making that happen will require somebody to step up and lead, accepting accountability for success or failure. If TEDA is going to lead, its board needs to make that clear to the public. It needs to tell residents how they will measure their own success and that of Rookard and his administration. And it will need to get public buy-in for an agency that I suspect many local residents have never heard of. 
 
Focus groups described a "perceived inertia" among decision makers that holds back the area. And that inertia is not limited to government officials but people in lots of leadership roles. 
 
"To redirect the parish’s trajectory for growth, leadership will need to be proactive and execute its economic development efforts differently," the study says. "It will need to be a champion for long-term investments that will add to the parish’s product and quality of place, as well as ensure that sufficient resources are available to fund such goals." 
 
In essence, the best things the parish can do to attract business are the same kinds of things it can do to make it a better place for the people who already call it home. Better schools, better roads, tax system that addresses real priorities at a reasonable cost, stemming coastal erosion. Even the small stuff, like making the entry points to the parish look a little nicer than someone's messy tool shed, can make a difference. 
 
"The status quo is not an option," the study concludes. "By taking on actionable and measurable plans to focus its entrepreneurial, retention and attraction efforts, Terrebonne will become more competitive. With added focus, the parish can make huge strides in its economic development efforts and build the community it desires."
