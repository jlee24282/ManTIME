"<TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">Recently</TIMEX3> it is seen that children and youths are involved in criminal activities, it is better to provide them counseling and love than strict controlling to keep them away from these.

She also asked the teachers to give special attention to the students so that the children and students stay away from criminal activities.
