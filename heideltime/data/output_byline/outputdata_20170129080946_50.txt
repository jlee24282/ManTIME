“It’s halftime,” was how Scott Rueck described it, referring to this 37 1/<TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DURATION" value="PT2H">2-hour</TIMEX3> intermission between installments of the Civil War. 

Yeah, there’s something weird about a schedule that had Oregon and Oregon State playing <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="TIME" value="2017-01-27TNI">Friday night</TIMEX3> in Eugene, then turning around and playing <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29TMO">Sunday morning</TIMEX3> in Corvallis. It’s almost as if the game didn’t really end, like someone pushed the pause button so they could resume the rivalry in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="PXD">a couple of days</TIMEX3>. 

It did end, even if the final score — Oregon State 43, Oregon 40 — would have looked better on a halftime box score. The Ducks had a chance in the final minutes, but just like the 11 previous meetings, the Beavers found a way to win. 

<TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> that the teams have gone to their separate corners, let’s talk halftime adjustments. For the Ducks, the biggest adjustment is this: How much can a team grow up in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2037">37</TIMEX3> 1/<TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="PT2H">2 hours</TIMEX3>? The Ducks played Oregon State to a dead heat for most of the night, but in <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="PT2M">the last two minutes</TIMEX3>, the Beavers’ experience took over. Senior Sydney Wiese called her own number and hit a three-pointer in the corner. Then Wiese stole the ball from Oregon freshman Sabrina Ionescu, leading to a layup from junior Breanna Brown. 

“You’ve got veterans making plays,” Rueck said. “I think that’s what you can expect.” 

The Beavers lost a lot from last year’s Final Four team, but they’re still rock solid. Picked fifth in the preseason, they’re <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> 19-2 with a legitimate shot at a third straight Pac-12 title. 

Oregon, meanwhile, is still figuring things out. The Ducks seem caught between two extremes, no longer young but not yet fully mature. 

“We’ve kind of stopped internally, as a coaching staff, talking about our youth,” coach Kelly Graves said <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2017-W03">last week</TIMEX3>. “Everybody knows we’re starting three freshmen and we have five freshmen in our rotation. 

“We’re a young team, but they’re 20 games in <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3>. They’ve had to grow up a little bit, and I think most of them have.” 

Somehow, though, we were talking about youth again <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="TIME" value="2017-01-27TNI">Friday night</TIMEX3>, if only to acknowledge the obvious. With the game on the line, Oregon State had players who had won Pac-12 titles and played in the Final Four. Oregon had players who were getting their first taste of the Civil War rivalry. 

“They just have veteran kids who have been through these wars, and they win most of them,” Graves said. “Experience never hurts, especially when it’s good experience.” 

Oregon is wildly talented, and the Ducks are only going to improve as the season goes along. At 14-7, they’ve put themselves in position for an NCAA Tournament bid if they finish strong. 

Ionescu is a star in the making, the Pac-12’s version of Russell Westbrook. Post player Ruthy Hebard is putting up Jillian Alleyne-type numbers as a freshman. The only frustrating part is knowing the Ducks can be much better than they already are. 

It’s easy to focus on Oregon’s youth, but between Lexi Bando and Maite Cazorla, the Ducks have two guards who have played big minutes in the Pac-12. They have the pieces to be good <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">right now</TIMEX3>, not just sometime in the future. 

In Graves’ first season, the Ducks lost back-to-back Civil Wars by scores of 70-37 and 77-48. <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2018">The next year</TIMEX3>, it was 60-33 and 59-45. Believing they could win this game was half the battle, and in that sense, <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="TIME" value="2017-01-27TNI">Friday night</TIMEX3> was a success. 

“I think there’s a belief in them,” Rueck said. “They’ve had some success. It’s the third year of coach Graves’ tenure, so it’s a natural progression for them. They believe they can win and should win, and that might have been a question for last year’s team.” 

It’s true, past Oregon teams brought some mental baggage into meetings with the Beavers. That’s one advantage of playing a bunch of freshmen: no bad memories popping up at crucial moments. 

At some point, though, the Ducks will need to snap their losing streak or risk passing it on to another generation. <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="TIME" value="2017-01-27TNI">Friday night</TIMEX3> proved they can compete, but when it comes to beating the Beavers, they still haven’t found a way. They had 37 1/<TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DURATION" value="PT2H">2 hours</TIMEX3> to figure it out. More Austin Meek
