Sing is by no means the first animation to incorporate the talent-show format into its narrative, but it’s certainly the most successful. While it’s not particularly original, this madcap caper based around a theatre-owning koala with big dreams has charm to spare and enough diversity in the music choices not to completely alienate older audience members – Dolly Parton rubs shoulders with Katy Perry, Stevie Wonder with Nicki Minaj.

Buster Moon (Matthew McConaughey) is clinging to his business by one koala claw; the bank is poised to prise the theatre from his grasp. His solution – a talent show – captures the public imagination, before disaster strikes. And that’s about it in the way of plot.

Each of the key contestants must overcome their own challenge, be it crippling stage fright, the invisibility of being a stay-at-home mum or a bank-robber dad with a vacancy in the family business. But the density of sight gags in this animation debut from Garth Jennings (Son of Rambow), the breakneck pacing and the fizzing energy of the storytelling make this an unexpectedly joyful experience. And I challenge you not to well up when Meena, the painfully shy elephant (voiced by Tori Kelly) finally sings Leonard Cohen’s Hallelujah.
