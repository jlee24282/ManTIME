New Delhi: India’s Under-19 cricket team trainer Rajesh Sawant was found dead in his hotel room in South Mumbai on <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29TMO">Sunday morning</TIMEX3>. 
 
Speaking to CricketNext , BCCI general manager (cricket operations) Ratnakar Shetty said that it was a case of a heart-attack and police were carrying out initial investigations. The body would be sent for post-mortem after that. 
 
“Sawant didn’t report for team activities and when officials tried to check in his room, he was found dead. In all probability it is a case of a heart-attack as he died in his sleep. As of <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> the police are investigating the matter and once they complete their investigation, the body will be sent for a post-mortem,” Shetty said. 
 
Sawant had worked as trainer with the Afghanistan team and with the India ‘A’ squad, coached by Rahul Dravid. He also worked with the Rest of India team before their Irani Cup match against Gujarat, which they won thanks to Wriddhiman Saha’s brilliant effort with the bat.
