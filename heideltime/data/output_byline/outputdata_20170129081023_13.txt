Riley McCarron has grown accustomed to fighting for a job. 
 
He’s ready to do it again. This time at the highest level. 
 
McCarron, the Dubuque Wahlert grad who rose from walk-on to starting wide receiver with the Iowa Hawkeyes, and LeShun Daniels both said they would be attempting a career in the NFL. 
 
The two Hawkeyes were at the Grand River Center on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>, signing autographs during the Dubuque Sports and Recreation Festival. 
 
“I’m going to train for pro day in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-03">March</TIMEX3> and then see what happens after that,” said McCarron, who led the Hawkeyes this season with 42 receptions for 517 yards and four touchdowns. “I’m going to give the NFL a chance and if that doesn’t work out then I’ll move on to the real world just like everyone else. 
 
“It’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, so I have to give it a shot.” 
 
Daniels said he expects to be either a third-day selection or sign as an undrafted free agent. 
 
Both players have fallback options if the NFL doesn’t work out. 
 
McCarron has a degree in accounting and already has a job offer in hand. Daniels said he would go back to school and pursue a Master’s degree to pursue a career as a strength and conditioning coach. 
 
“Hopefully I’ll get drafted or get picked up by a team to allow me to have a chance to go out there and compete,” said Daniels, who ran for 1,099 yards and 10 touchdowns. “Basically, I know that I’m going to be <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a Day</TIMEX3> 3 guy or a free agent type of player. That’s kind of what I knew, kind of what I expected and what I’ve been hearing. We’ll see how the process goes. 
 
“All I’m ready for is just a shot to go out there and compete.” 
 
Signing autographs in Dubuque was a unique experience for McCarron, who remembers Hawkeyes players who visited to sign at previous events. 
 
“It’s just fun to be back in Dubuque, the hometown, my roots, and see all these young kids going through the same things that I did when I was a little kid here in Dubuque growing up,” he said. “Just being a little motivation or encouragement for these guys is awesome. “ 
 
Both McCarron and Daniels contributed to Iowa’s rebound from a disappointing 7-6 campaign in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2014">2014</TIMEX3>. 
 
Iowa posted its first 12-0 regular season in program history in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3>, reaching its first-ever Big Ten Championship game and earning its first Rose Bowl appearance in close to <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P3DE">three decades</TIMEX3>. 
 
The Hawkeyes finished 8-5 <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-FA">this fall</TIMEX3>, losing to Florida in the Outback Bowl. 
 
“It’s been a great step in the right direction where the program is trying to go,” Daniels said. “Obviously you want to win championships going to a Big Ten school, especially at the University of Iowa. We want to start a tradition of getting back to winning football.” 
 
McCarron agreed that the program is in better shape <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> than when he first joined <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2012" mod="APPROX">nearly five years ago</TIMEX3>. 
 
“I think it’s in a better place and it’s going the right direction,” he said. “It was just a great group of guys we had graduate <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2017">this year</TIMEX3> and there’s no doubt it will keep going the right direction.” 
 
<TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3>, and no matter what career path he ends up following, McCarron is excited to get back to Iowa City on fall Saturdays to watch the Hawkeyes. 
 
Even if it will be a little different. 
 
“I’m sure it will be weird at first, just being back there but not actually playing. But I think it will be fun,” he said. “I’ll get used to enjoying the other side of football, being a fan again, and I think I’ll enjoy it.”
