I bought a cable to record audio to my go pro but when I use it the audio quality drops way off. 
 
The volume drops to near muted. I even tried plugging it into the passenger jack (with my headset plugged into the pilot jack) and the quality instantly dropped again. 
 
I'm guessing it's an issue with the cable, but wondering if there is something else I should check before I send it back.
