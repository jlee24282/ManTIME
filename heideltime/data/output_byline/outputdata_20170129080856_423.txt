Tengku Abdullah said he was shocked when informed that Siti Nurdarwisyah Abdul Rahman drowned in Kampung Tanjung Medang Hilir, Pekan. 

"It was a shocking news because I had just returned from visiting her relatives, and prior to that, have on numerous occasions reminded parents to monitor their children's safety during the floods. 

"However, it has been fated and I hope family members of the victim remain calm," said the Regent during a visit to the flood evacuation centre at Balai Raya Kampung Simpang Tebing Tinggi here <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3>. 

Accompanying the Regent was Tengku Puan Pahang Tunku Azizah Aminah Maimunah Iskandariah. 

In the incident <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">yesterday</TIMEX3>, Siti Nurdarwisyah was found missing at about 7.20 pm <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">yesterday</TIMEX3> by her father, who then sought the assistance of neighbours to look for his only child. 

The girl was found about half <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="PT1H">an hour</TIMEX3> later trapped in between the bushes in the flood water not far from her house and was then to Pekan Hospital for treatment, but died at 9.17 pm <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">yesterday</TIMEX3>. 

In another development, Tengku Abdullah hit out at some youngsters who had no care for their own life by doing dangerous stunts, including climbing and jumping from a signboard into a river where a recording of it went viral <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3>.
