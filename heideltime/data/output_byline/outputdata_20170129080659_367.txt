The Shooters party has a new man in the Hunter region, and he doesn't own a gun. 

JOHN Preston is the tax specialist whose fights with the states over X-rated films and tobacco excises eventually gave Australia the goods and service tax, or GST.

The bruising encounters in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="199">the 1990s</TIMEX3> over nearly $5 billion dollars <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3> of easy money to the states included Mr Preston’s home being bugged, and celebrated clashes with politicians and state authorities. He notes that he won in the end.

<TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> the former Liberal, who left the party in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2014">2014</TIMEX3> after leaked emails revealed his disparaging and sexist comments about a female Sydney City councillor, is gunning for Nationals MP Michael Johnsen’s seat of Upper Hunter.

“We’re going to have some fun,” said Mr Preston, 47, at Elderslie on <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3> of his role as Shooters, Fishers and Farmers spokesman for the Hunter, and his run as party candidate against Mr Johnsen at the <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2019">2019</TIMEX3> NSW election, despite not owning a gun.

The Upper Hunter is the first of what Shooters, Fishers and Farmers state director Filip Despotoski describes as “winnable” NSW seats held by Nationals MPs that will be targeted by the party.

In the <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3> election Mr Johnsen suffered a 20 per cent swing against him after a strong showing by Country Labor candidate and Muswellbrook mayor Martin Rush, leaving the Nationals with a marginal seat after continuously holding the Upper Hunter since <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="1931">1931</TIMEX3>.

The Shooters unveiled plans for the region <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> before NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian travelled to Tamworth, and then to Queanbeyan on <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3>, as part of a campaign to “reconnect” with regional NSW after the disastrous impact of the Baird Government’s greyhound and council amalgamation decisions in the regions.

Mr Preston on <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3> used “scandalous” Upper Hunter education figures to declare the seat had “endured years of benign neglect” under the Nationals.

“I looked at the education figures where you’ve got more than 70 per cent of children in some schools in the bottom quarter of students in the state, and I thought ‘This isn’t bad, this is horrific’,” Mr Preston said.

“They’re being completely let down by the education system, the National Party and their local MP. These figures are nothing less than scandalous. That will be one of our highest priorities, to address the woeful education outcomes. If you repeated these Upper Hunter numbers in Sydney it would be viewed as some kind of emergency. That is going to stop. We are going to make it stop.”

Mr Preston said he was moving to Muswellbrook from Sydney in <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2016-02">February</TIMEX3>. He knew the area after project managing construction of Muswellbrook Fair shopping centre and managing it for <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DURATION" value="PXY">several years</TIMEX3> from <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2007">2007</TIMEX3>. He grew up in the Cowra area, trained as an accountant and worked as a tax specialist in <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="199">the 1990s</TIMEX3>.

It was during this time he was involved in landmark High Court cases dealing with state and territory excises – first involving X-rated films in a case against the ACT Government, and the second involving tobacco excises against the NSW Government.

The states and territories lost the second case in <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="1997">1997</TIMEX3>, and overnight the basis on which they had levied excises of $4.9 billion <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3> on tobacco, alcohol and petrol ended. The Federal Government was forced to intervene, collect the funds and return them to the states. Within weeks the Federal Government was considering a report that concluded: “The present crisis may be the stimulus required to undertake major restructuring of the present pattern of consumption taxation.”

Mr Preston confirmed that in <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="1996">1996</TIMEX3> he was arrested and charged with money laundering and conspiring to defraud the State of NSW of $7 million in excises based on his business of buying and selling cigarettes. He and six others were charged despite the earlier launch of the High Court case challenging the rights of the states to charge the tobacco excises.

In a Fairfax Media report of the controversial case, which included the bugging of Mr Preston’s home, it was noted: “When the High Court found the fees were in fact unlawful, the charges against Preston and the six others evaporated.” 

Mr Preston said it was “nice to be at the centre of a seismic shift in Australian economic life. I’m used to being around the big stuff”.

He left the Liberal Party in <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2014">2014</TIMEX3> after publicity about leaked emails between himself and the then Sydney City councillor Edward Mandla in which Mr Preston called a female councillor a “company tart” and an “idiot”.

Mr Preston was present at a meeting with Mr Mandla and Shooters, Fishers and Farmers MP Robert Borsak – who is also an accountant - which eventually led to controversial changes in Sydney City Council elections that gave two votes to businesses. 

Mr Preston said he joined the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers party because it was “a party of policy”, and despite not owning a gun. He planned to buy one, he said.

He wanted to challenge the Nationals in the seat of Upper Hunter because of evidence of obvious disadvantage in the area, despite the mining boom.

“We have a view how we want to see the Upper Hunter go forward, especially for young people. For young people at the moment the best part of the Upper Hunter is the road out. We want to give young people aged 18 to 35 a reason to stay,” Mr Preston said.

Mr Despotoski said the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers party had “very active branches” in Muswellbrook, Scone and Newcastle. Running a strong candidate in the Upper Hunter would benefit the area, he said.

“One of the best things that can happen for this area is John running, whether he wins or not, because this is a winnable seat and the Nationals are going to have to fight. We will be looking at running candidates anywhere in regional NSW we think we can win,” Mr Despotoski said.

Michael Johnsen did not respond to Newcastle Herald questions.
