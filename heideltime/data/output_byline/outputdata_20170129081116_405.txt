Geelong - Germany's Nikias Arndt won the Cadel Evans Great Ocean Road Race on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3> after a tight sprint to the finish line that saw him narrowly beat Australians Simon Gerrans and Cameron Meyer.

Arndt (SUN) took the third edition of the 174-kilometre (108-mile) race in Geelong, Victoria, in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="PT4H">four hours</TIMEX3>, <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="PT19M">19 minutes</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="PT15S">15 seconds</TIMEX3>.

Local stars Gerrans (ORS) and Meyer (AUS) finished second and third respectively on the same time.

It was the first triumph for 25-year-old Arndt since he won a stage of the Giro d'Italia in <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2016-05">May last year</TIMEX3>.

Meyer attacked with about 800 metres to go and Arndt said he was not sure if he could catch the 29-year-old West Australian.

"I got in the slipstream and I felt I could go faster, but 250 metres to go I am not sure if I would catch him," Arndt told host broadcaster Channel Seven after the race.

"No one had team-mates left... Everyone was just ducking for wheels and trying to get out of the wind," Gerrans told Channel Seven.

"Yeah, Nicholas went a long way out. He did the whole sprint in the seat and in the end I had nothing left and couldn't get past him."

Three-time Tour de France champion Chris Froome finished <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION" value="PT43S">43 seconds</TIMEX3> behind Arndt.

Dutch rider Annemiek van Vleuten (ORS) won the women's race on <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> with a time of <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DURATION" value="PT3H">three hours</TIMEX3>, <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DURATION" value="PT4M">four minutes</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DURATION" value="PT13S">13 seconds</TIMEX3>.
