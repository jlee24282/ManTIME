The <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P15Y">15-year</TIMEX3> nonexclusive franchise agreement allowing Cable One to operate in Lewiston expires <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-12">this December</TIMEX3>. 
 
The agreement gives the city 5 percent of gross revenue, which has equaled about $220,000 in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent years</TIMEX3>, compared with the city's overall budget of about $64 million, said Lewiston Administrative Services Director Dan Marsh. 
 
It also requires Cable One to provide programming in eight broad categories, but doesn't specify what the channels are. 
 
The categories are news, weather, sports, entertainment, children's shows, education, cultural programming of local interest and governmental programming. 
 
The number of channels is "no less that the number of channels provided" by Cable One at the start of the agreement. 
 
It's not clear how happy Lewiston residents are with service from Cable One. City officials <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-W03">last week</TIMEX3> were unable to find the results of subscriber surveys that are required by the agreement once <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="SET" value="P5Y" quant="EVERY">every five years</TIMEX3>. 
 
What Cable One offers has been evolving in <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent years</TIMEX3>. The company dropped Viacom channels such as MTV in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2014">2014</TIMEX3>. It is not carrying KAYU-FOX because of a disagreement over retransmission fees. 
 
Cable One has stated previously it has no intention of leaving the cable business, but it has told stock market analysts it's putting its emphasis on pursuing high-speed internet customers. 
 
It's too early to know if Lewiston's elected officials will view negotiating a new contract as an opportunity to influence how Cable One approaches the Lewiston market, said Lewiston Mayor Jim Kleeburg. 
 
Whatever direction Lewiston goes would likely involve cooperation with the city of Clarkston and Asotin County. 
 
Those municipalities have similar agreements with Cable One, but they end at different times. Clarkston's runs through <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2019">2019</TIMEX3>, and Asotin County's ends in either <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2023">2023</TIMEX3> or <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2024">2024</TIMEX3> (the <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> contract lists both years). 
 
Were a company other than Cable One to seek to serve the Lewiston-Clarkston Valley, it would likely have to acquire the cable provider's infrastructure, said Joe Poire, executive director of the Port of Whitman County, who spent <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DURATION" value="P11Y">11 years</TIMEX3> in the cable industry. 
 
The public telecommunications network being constructed by the ports of Lewiston and Clarkston wouldn't have the capacity to serve a new company without significant investment that goes beyond what's contemplated, Poire said. 
 
No law requires communities to be served by cable companies, according to the Federal Communications Commission, which regulates the industry. 
 
But the chances of the Lewiston-Clarkston Valley ending up without cable services are low, regardless of what happens in the telecommunications industry, Poire said. 
 
"The ... market is big enough it's a viable asset."
