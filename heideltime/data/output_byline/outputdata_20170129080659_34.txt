“Airbnb is providing free housing to refugees and anyone not allowed in the US,” CEO Brian Chesky tweeted on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TNI">Saturday night</TIMEX3>, as protests erupted in major US airports over Trump’s order. On <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>, an estimated 100 to 200 people were prohibited from entering the US . 
   
Airbnb is providing free housing to refugees and anyone not allowed in the US. Stayed tuned for more, contact me if urgent need for housing 
 
— Brian Chesky (@bchesky) <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">January 29, 2017</TIMEX3> 
   
The company declined to provide additional details. 
 
Chesky has spoken out about Trump in the past. When asked about the then presidential candidate in France <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2016-SP">last spring</TIMEX3>, Chesky said that “anyone who tries to put up barriers against culture is going to be on the wrong side of history.” 
   
Not allowing countries or refugees into America is not right, and we must stand with those who are affected.

Airbnb relies on a network of thousands of hosts, who rent out rooms, apartments, and entire houses to, essentially, absolute strangers. Its entire business model is predicated on people immersing themselves in a variety of cultures. It also competes directly with a business Trump knows well: hotels . 
 
Others in the travel industry are also decrying the immigration order. Moral considerations or not, a curb on travel is bad for business. 
 
“The president’s order represents the worst of his proclivity toward rash action versus thoughtfulness,” Expedia CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, who was born in Iran , said in a statement emailed to Quartz. “Ours is a nation of immigrants. These are our roots, this is our soul. All erased with the stroke of a pen.”
