Labor warns that the NSW police commissioner must report to two ministers under the change exit   
The appointment of a new minister for counter-terrorism in NSW has been slammed by the Labor opposition as irresponsible and against the public interest. 
 
Unveiling a cabinet reshuffle on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3>, Premier Gladys Berejiklian announced corrections minister David Elliott – not police minister Troy Grant – would take on the new role. 
 
She said it was required "unfortunately due to the circumstances our world is in". 
 
"The sad reality is that this is an area of focus for governments around the world – NSW is already working closely with the Commonwealth and I want the Minister to take this work forward," Ms Berejiklian said. 
 
"Mr Elliott will work closely with the Attorney General, Minister for Police, the Minister for Education, the Minister for Family and Community Services and the Minister for Multiculturalism, as well as our federal counterparts, to ensure a whole-of-government approach to this issue". 
 
Under the change, the Terrorism (Commonwealth Powers) Act and the Terrorism (Police Powers) Act will remain the responsibility of the Attorney General. 
 
Mr Elliott will provide strategic policy direction for counter-terrorism in NSW, while the police will manage the tactical and operational response to terrorist attacks or threats. 
 
Mr Elliott told Fairfax Media: "Over the <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="FUTURE_REF">coming weeks</TIMEX3> I will be working to coordinate all stakeholders to ensure that the people of NSW can sleep soundly in the knowledge that we are as best prepared for any contingency as we can be." 
 
But opposition leader Luke Foley said the appointment was the result of an irresponsible deal. He alleged that the Liberals wanted to wrest police from Mr Grant, a senior Nationals MP. 
 
"The Nationals wanted police, the right wing faction of the Liberals wanted police," he said. "So she split it in two." 
 
"It's the police who keep us safe from terrorism," Mr Foley said. 
 
"The police commissioner <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> has to report to two people. It's scandalous and another deal that is counter to the public interest." 
 
Meanwhile, the troubled relationship between the NSW attorney-general and minister for police has been addressed, with Ms Berejiklian confirming a reshaping of the much maligned "justice cluster". 
 
The arrangement, whereby as justice and police minister Mr Grant held a more senior position than then attorney-general Gabrielle Upton, was heavily criticised by the legal profession. 
 
The NSW Bar Association said it provided Mr Grant "with unprecedented power in determining legal policy without the historical checks and balances". 
 
The NSW Law Society warned the arrangement meant police were "ostensibly responsible for criminal law policy, while at the same time, the traditional roles of the attorney-general as first law officer of the state, which includes preserving civil liberties, are being eroded". 
 
Ms Berejiklian has confirmed the cluster has been reworked so that new attorney-general Mark Speakman, SC, is the lead minister.
