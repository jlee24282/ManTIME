Jade Cheldelin couldn’t miss in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2016-Q3">the third quarter</TIMEX3> and, thanks to a team-wide defensive effort by the University of Redlands women’s basketball team in the fourth, visiting Caltech couldn’t score much at all over the final <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="PT10M">10 minutes</TIMEX3>. 
 
It all added up to a 53-38 victory <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TNI">Saturday night</TIMEX3> for the streaking Bulldogs, their fourth SCIAC win in their last five games. 
 
“We’re strongest defensively and my kids understand that if you want to play you’ve gotta play defense,” Bulldogs coach Rich Murphy said. “That <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2016-Q4">fourth quarter</TIMEX3> we did the job of boxing them out and making them take tough shots. That helped us a lot better than what we were doing <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-H1">the first half</TIMEX3>.” 
 
Cheldelin, who finished with a game-high 24 points, made her first five shots from the field to start <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2018-H2">the second half</TIMEX3> and her 12 <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2018-Q3">third-quarter</TIMEX3> points helped Redlands (9-9, 6-3 in conference) swell its four-point halftime lead to a 41-31 margin to begin the fourth. 
 
Caltech (3-16, 1-9) stayed stuck on 31 for the first 5:20 of the final period, by which point the Bulldogs had built their lead to 16, and the Beavers converted just two field goals in the fourth. 
 
“We’ve been really working hard on our defense in practice, so it’s all about taking away their length,” Cheldelin said. “They have a lot of length and a lot of height and we just tried not to cater to them too much.” 
 
The Bulldogs compounded the Beavers’ offensive woes by hustling for extra possessions under their own basket. 
 
Cheldelin got an offensive board that led to a pair of free throws and a 47-31 lead with 5:30 to play and on Redlands’ next possession Selena Iriarte hit the offensive glass for a new shot clock that saw Allison Siksnus convert a three-point play for a 17-point lead. 
 
Cassandra Lacey scored eight points for Redlands and tied Cheldelin for the team lead in rebounds with seven. 
 
Cheldelin enjoyed her third straight 20-point game and is averaging 13.5 per game on the season. 
 
“We’ve just got to win the next seven,” Cheldelin said. “We’ve been doing really well, we’ve been moving forward and we’ve definitely gotten better.”
