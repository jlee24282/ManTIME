The Gambian President Adama Barrow said <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> that every aspect of his tiny west African state would need an overhaul after ex-leader Yahya Jammeh's <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P22Y">22-year</TIMEX3> rule but that its dreaded secret police would remain 

Barrow faces an uphill task after taking over from Jammeh who left behind a dysfunctional economy and allegedly emptied state coffers ahead of his departure 

Rights group blame the notorious National Intelligence Agency NIA under his longtime control for forced disappearances and torture Barrow said the NIA was "an institution that has to continue" but that its name would be changed and training would be given to its operatives 

"The rule of the law that will be the order of the day" he said 

Barrow also addressed one of Jammeh's most controversial declarations from <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3> that The Gambia was an "Islamic republic" 

Barrow in contrast insisted the country -- whose population is 90 percent Muslim with the rest Christian and animist -- was a republic "not the Islamic republic" 

Civil servants would likely return to a <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P5D">five-day</TIMEX3> work week breaking with Jammeh's rule that <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3> was <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> off in line with his Islamic republic rules 

"My government is going to look at every avenue and there will be a complete overhaul of the system" Barrow said speaking at his first press conference since arriving back from Senegal 

The president promised his cabinet would be named <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2017-W05" mod="START">early next week</TIMEX3> so that he could "get the ball rolling" adding he would receive the first comprehensive information about the state of the nation's finances also on <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017-01-23">Monday</TIMEX3> or <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2017-01-24">Tuesday</TIMEX3>
