NEW YORK, <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Jan 28</TIMEX3> (Reuters) - A federal judge blocked the
deportation on <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> of dozens of travelers and refugees from
seven Muslim-majority nations, stranded at U.S. airports under
an order from President Donald Trump, after a lawsuit filed on
behalf of two Iraqis with ties to U.S. security forces. 
    
In the lawsuit filed in federal court in Brooklyn, New York,
the two men challenged Trump's directive on constitutional
grounds. The suit said their connections to U.S. forces made
them targets in their home country and that the pair had valid
visas to enter the United States. 
    
The lawsuit highlights some of the legal obstacles facing
Trump's new administration as it tries to carry out the
directive, which the president signed late on <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3> to impose a
<TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P4M">four-month</TIMEX3> ban on refugees entering the United States and a
<TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P90D">90-day</TIMEX3> hold on travelers from Syria, Iran and five other
Muslim-majority countries. 
    
In an emergency ruling on <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>, U.S. District Judge Ann
Donnelly ordered U.S. authorities to refrain from deporting
previously approved refugees as well as "approved holders of
valid immigrant and non-immigrant visas and other individuals
... legally authorized to enter the United States" from the
countries targeted in Trump's order.
