- - Cape Breton Screaming Eagles News Release SYDNEY- For the second time in as many nights, Kyle Jessiman shone brightly in the Cape Breton goal. The 17 year old netminder picked up his first career shutout as Cape Breton blanked the Québec Remparts 4-0.

After a choppy start that saw three whistles in the opening <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="PT40S">forty seconds</TIMEX3>, the Eagles would control the early part of the play and get the evening's first goal off the stick of Olivier Bourret. The Cape Breton forward spun around in the right faceoff circle and beat Evgeny Kiselev low along the ice. The lead would double on the first power play of the night for either team, when Giovanni Fiore completed a drop pass from Drake Batherson and slammed the puck in from the top of the circle. The Eagles took a 2-0 lead into the dressing room.

Penalty trouble would follow the Eagles from the first to the second period as the home side began the middle stanza short handed. Cape Breton would kill off three straight penalties including a <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="PT29S">29 second</TIMEX3> five on three. But Québec's best chance of the period would actually come on a short handed breakaway when Dmitry Buynitskiy wired the puck over the net.

Drake Batherson of the Eagles was denied on a breakaway of his own, but prior to that Cape Breton would push the lead to 3-0. Fiore skated up the left side of the and as he was falling would drop the puck to Ross MacDougall who would blast it past Kiselev. MacDougall's goal came in his first game against his old team, having been traded by the Remparts to the Eagles <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-01" mod="START">earlier this month</TIMEX3>. Massimo Carozza, acquired by Cape Breton from Québec at the <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3>-<TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2016">16</TIMEX3> trading deadline, was also playing his first game against his old club.

The Eagles locked the game down in the third period, limiting the opportunities as the shots were just 9-4 in favour of the home team. In the final <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="PT3M">three minutes</TIMEX3> Remparts head coach Philippe Boucher attempted to spark his offense and pulled the netminder for an extra attacker. The move did not succeed as Drake Batherson would fire the puck in off the left wing and hit the empty net for his second point of the night.

Jessiman turned aside all 23 shots from the Remparts, becoming the first Cape Breton netminder to record a shutout at Centre 200 since Philippe Trudeau. Kiselev stopped 33 of 36 shots in addition to the empty netter.

Cape Breton continues its home stand <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="TIME" value="2017-01-27TNI">Friday night</TIMEX3> against the Acadie-Bathurst Titan, and it will be Country Night at the Nest.
