It’s that time again. Tax season. 
 
Before you run away in panic, take a peek at the IRS’ gallery (https://www.irs.gov/uac/tax-quotes) of humorous and serious tax quotes to put things into perspective. 
 
But don’t fret about getting your taxes done. Help is as close as your local Polk County Library Cooperative (PCLC) library and the United Way of Central Florida. If your income is $64,000 or less, you can take advantage of free tax preparation services offered through United Way of Central Florida (UWCF), which runs through <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-04-18">April 18</TIMEX3>. 
 
The countywide free tax preparation sites and other tax-related resources can be found through UWCF’s website: http://www.uwcf.org/money. <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-WI">Winter</TIMEX3> Haven Public Library has compiled a handy printout of the <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> UWCF free tax preparation locations: http://whpl.mywinterhaven.com/IRSFormsStatus_files/UWCF%20Free%20Tax%20Prep%20Sites%202017.pdf. 
 
Three libraries are acting as UWCF free tax preparation sites this tax season.
