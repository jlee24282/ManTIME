Bent Paddle Brewing can do more than ferment and infuse hoppy ales; the Duluth brewery also has a way with fundraising. Lutheran Social Services of Minnesota announced Bent Paddle was the most impactful supporter of its <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2016-12">December</TIMEX3> Diaper Drive and rewarded the brewery with the Bottoms Up! Award <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-01" mod="START">earlier this month</TIMEX3>. 
   
During the drive, Bent Paddle helped advertise the need for diapers, offered an incentive for customers who donated to the drive and, at the end of the month, donated enough diapers to help LSS meet its goal of collecting 25,000 diapers for its Crisis Nursery. The large diaper cache will support families in need who visit the nursery throughout the year.
