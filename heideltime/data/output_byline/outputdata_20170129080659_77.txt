Saints Rams pitcher Kurt Schollum also starred with the bat in a win over Central. 
   
Former Black Sox pitcher Kurt Schollum played a dual starring role in Saints Rams' shutout win over Central to restart the Marlborough premier club softball competition. 
 
Rams beat Central 4-0 at Lansdowne Park on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> when the championship resumed after the festive season break. 
 
Schollum racked up 16 strikeouts, conceding just one safe hit - a first inning single to Central shortstop Ethan Jones. 
 
He also led the way with the bat for the Rams with two safe hits, including a fourth inning single to score Kyle Marfell for the game's first run in the top of the fourth inning. 
 
Schollum doubled in the sixth and scampered home after a fielder's choice and an error at home plate to double the Rams' lead. 
 
They wrapped up their victory with two more runs in the seventh frame to Denham Wisdom, who hit a two-bagger to leftfield, and Tyler Bird, who followed with a singe base hit.  
 
Errors again proved costly for Central, allowing both runners to score. 
 
Leadoff batter Bird had three hits from four at-bats for Rams while Schollum and Marfell went two from four. 
 
Rams amassed 11 safe hits off young Central pitcher Jontae MacDonald, who took seven strikeouts with power hitters Marfell and Schollum among his scalps. 
 
Saints Rams warmed up for the Central clash with a 16-1 five innings romp over Saints Aces. 
   
Schollum threw a no-hitter, taking eight strikeouts while conceding two walks. 
 
Wisdom hammered a three-run automatic home run in the third inning as Rams raced out to an 8-0 lead. 
 
Marfell, third baseman Drew Roberts and catcher Cairo Adams-Walsh all had three safe hits with Adams-Walsh batting 1.000 after also picking a walk. 
 
Third baseman Colin Hayes collected the Aces' only run in the bottom of the second inning, making base on a fielder's choice, advancing on another and scoring on a wild pitch. 
 
Meanwhile, former Marlborough representative Ryan Schollum was in brilliant batting form for his Canterbury club at the Vic Guth Memorial tournament in Auckland. 
 
Schollum, who <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> plays in Christchurch for former national interclub champions Albion, hammered three home runs on <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> and after the first <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P2D">two days</TIMEX3> led the RBI (runs batted in) averages with nine. 
 
His first home run as a solo shot against Auckland club Roosters then he followed with a two-run blast against host club Auckland United before going one better with a three-run effort in the Eden-Roskill game. 
 
Schollum won a player of the day prize at the tournament which is rated as one of New Zealand's best invitational events.
