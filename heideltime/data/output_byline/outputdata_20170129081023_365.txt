The owners of British Grand Prix circuit Silverstone are confident Liberty Media’s takeover of Formula One will give them room to make a profit and stay on the calendar. 
 
British Racing Drivers’ Club (BRDC) president Derek Warwick told Sky Sports television he was “very positive <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> about the future”. 
 
The BRDC owns the former World War Two airfield that hosted Formula One’s first world championship race in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="1950">1950</TIMEX3> and has a contract to <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2026">2026</TIMEX3>.

Media reports have indicated that Silverstone will have to pay nearly £17 million to host the race <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017">this year</TIMEX3>, rising to £26 million by the end of the contract.

“We know where we are going <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> with Liberty, we know where we’re going with Silverstone. 
 
“We are very positive we can <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> work this grand prix and make a profit in <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3>. 
 
“We’re looking forward to 2
