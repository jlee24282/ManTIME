The Board of Directors of the Montana East-West Shrine Game have approved the donation of $100,859 to the Shriners Hospital for Children in Spokane, Wa.

One-third of the sum will be retained for the local Baghdad Hospital Transportation Fund. The Spokane hospital is the sole beneficiary of the Montana Shrine Game, and has benefitted over $2,500,000 in the game’s history.

The <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3> game was held in Butte on the Montana Tech campus, with the West winning, 45-14. The East leads the all-time series 38-32.

The stop was the game's third in Butte since the game began rotating locations in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010">2010</TIMEX3>. The Montana Shrine Game has been one of the top performing games in the United States since beginning the rotation, donating over $700,000 in that span.

Events surrounding the <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3> game included: golf tournaments in Butte, Great Falls and Kalispell, a cheer camp, a screening clinic, a patient/player experience, a banquet, a high school athletic combine, a parade and a telethon.

“The <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3> game was a great success,” West coordinator Jeff Hartwick said. “We added some new events like the combine and telethon, which will continue to grow. The statewide golf tournaments are very successful.

"The game atmosphere at Montana Tech was incredible. Due to the work of game organizers and board members, and the generosity of the game sponsors, the <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3> game in Butte was one of the most successful games in the United States <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017">this year</TIMEX3> -- and one of the largest donations ever from the Montana Shrine Game.

“We want to extend our appreciation to all the sponsors, fans, players, cheerleaders, coaches, family members, Shrine Hospital patients and representatives, the Shriners from all three temples in Montana, the board of directors, and the huge volunteer group that helped with every aspect of the event. It’s a state-wide team event, and the success of this game is due to all of these groups.”

The 71st annual Montana East-West Shrine Game will be played at Rocky Mountain College in Billings on <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-07-15">July 15</TIMEX3>.
