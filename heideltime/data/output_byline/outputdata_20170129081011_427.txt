Adam Lallana & Liverpool 

One of the transfer stories which has popped up <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DURATION" value="PXW" mod="MORE_THAN">over the past few weeks</TIMEX3> has centred on Liverpool midfielder Adam Lallana

 

Lallana has been excellent for the Reds for most of the season and the likes of the Times have previously reported that his performances have triggered Barcelona and PSG to have a look at the England international

 

On <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3> the Express extend the list of Lallana’s suitors to include Tottenham

 

Whether that holds any weight is up for discussion but in any event it’s all rather immaterial as the Express believe that Liverpool and Lallana have agreed terms over a new deal

 Reds continue to lock up stars 

<TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-W03">Last week</TIMEX3> the big contract news out of Anfield was that Philippe Coutinho has signed a new <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P5Y">five year</TIMEX3> deal

 

According to the Express Lallana is <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> set to follow suit as the following is reported

 

Adam Lallana has agreed a new <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="P4Y">four year</TIMEX3> £120000 <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P1W">a week</TIMEX3> deal ending fears that he could be lured away from Anfield <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-SU">this summer</TIMEX3>

 

Tottenham Hotspur boss Mauricio Pochettino was keen on reuniting with <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="P28Y">the 28 year</TIMEX3>-old who he managed at Southampton

 

Lallana’s <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> contract expires in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2019">2019</TIMEX3> while he’s scored seven Premier League goals already this season

 

Hopefully this news will lift the spirits of Liverpool fans who have seen their side win just one of their last eight matches as they’ve been knocked out the EFL Cup and FA Cup in back to back matches
