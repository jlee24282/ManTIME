Following a hearing, which Blackwell was too ill to attend, the Board also announced that they have suspended the licence of Karkardi, a light-heavyweight who has won seven and lost one of his eight professional contests to date. 
 
The BBBC statement described Wilkins’ conduct as “detrimental to the interests of boxing”, and added: “In view of the seriousness thereof it is not in the interests or welfare of boxing for him to hold a trainer’s licence.”
