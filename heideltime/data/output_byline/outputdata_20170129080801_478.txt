Adelaide United 5-2 Sydney FC at Coopers Stadium Sky Blues’ final-day defeat hands premiership to Canberra Sydney FC capitulated to a stunning 5-2 defeat against Adelaide United on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3> allowing Canberra United to snatch the W-League premiership on the final day of the regular season.

Needing a win for their third top-of-the-table finish, Sydney FC somehow conspired to concede four goals in the opening <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="PT23M">23 minutes</TIMEX3> of a chaotic <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2018-H2">second half</TIMEX3> against second-from-bottom Adelaide. Canberra United defeated Melbourne Victory 5-1 on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> to lock up a home semi-final and heap the pressure on the Sky Blues for their visit to Adelaide.

Sydney had previously won 12 straight against Adelaide, yet showed of their normal attacking fluency when it mattered most.

Instead it was Adelaide who had the better of <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-H1">the first half</TIMEX3>, before finally turning the pressure into goals by scoring twice inside the opening <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="PT3M">three minutes</TIMEX3> of the second period.

An own goal from Servet Uzunlar and the first of a <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2016-H2">second-half</TIMEX3> double from Adriana Jones saw Adelaide race to a two-goal advantage within minutes of the restart.

To their credit, Sydney FC drew level by the hour mark with a quickfire double from half-time substitute Remy Siemsen, though her second was tapped home from an offside position.

However, the in-form Adelaide always looked dangerous and they soon regained the lead via a Jones penalty and an Emily Hodgson strike, before Sofia Huerta iced the cake late on.

The day got even worse for Sydney FC as Perth Glory edged a last-minute 1-0 victory over Western Sydney Wanderers to leapfrog into second.

That lone injury-time strike from Caitlin Doeglas ensured Perth Glory earned home advantage for next week’s semi-final against Sydney.

Melbourne City will travel to Canberra for the other semi-final, with the champions sneaking into fourth spot courtesy of a 2-0 win over Newcastle Jets in Coffs Harbour on <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3>.
