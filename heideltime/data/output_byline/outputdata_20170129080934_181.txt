Kelly Miller dances to Tranzition with her daughter Emily, 3, at <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-SU">the Summer</TIMEX3> Sounds of Southland concert at the South Alive community gardens on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3>. Emily's grandfather, Peter Miller, is the drummer in Tranzition. 
   
The sounds of <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-SU">summer</TIMEX3> were loud and clear on <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3>, but the not-so-summery weather might have been louder. 
 
The concert series, put on by Venture Southland, has battled with the Southland elements but is forging ahead with the rest of its concerts.​ 
 
Event organiser Angela Newell said despite having to cancel the Bluff concert scheduled for <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-01-22">January 22</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3>'s concert being postponed for <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="PTXH">a couple of hours</TIMEX3>, a lot of great Southland talent was on show. 
 
"They're very skilled and enthusiastic performers," she said. 
 
Bands Tranzition​ and Triple Shot played to a modest crowd at the South Alive community gardens on <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3>. 
 
Tranzition singer Stephen Wilcox said despite the less than ideal weather, it was nice to have the opportunity to perform outside. 
 
"It's good having a big sounds system ... It's nice to be able to perform in front of the audience like this," he said. 
 
Come rain or shine, violinist Fiona Pears will perform on <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2017-02-05">February 5</TIMEX3> at the band rotunda in Queens Park, with SIT CentreStage theatre booked in as the wet-weather venue. 
 
"<TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2017-SU">Summer</TIMEX3> has been quite bad all over the country so we've just got to take the good with the bad," she said. 
 
"We just roll with it - if people want to come out and join us, we'll be here."
