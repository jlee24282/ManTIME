The concert is supported with funds from Sir John Deane’s Sixth Form College and The Co-operative Funeralcare Northwich 
 
Sir John Deane’s Sixth Form College at Northwich has a lively and vibrant music department.  Some of the students have outstanding talents; a selection perform at this concert.  A similar concert in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2015-SP">the spring of 2015</TIMEX3> proved enormously popular and thoroughly astonishing. 
 
Performers expected to include: 
 
Marcus Reynolds – a fantastic pianist (one of the best SJD have ever had). 
 
Robyn Jones – a lovely soprano 
 
Thomas Rocke – a fabulous French horn player 
 
Seth Hamill – a great bass trombonist 
 
Hannah Faulkner - a beautiful flutist 
 
The final list of performers and the pieces to be played will be announced nearer the time.
