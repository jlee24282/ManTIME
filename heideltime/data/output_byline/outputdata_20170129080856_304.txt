The message from America's ruling elite is, as always - "do as I say, not as I do" - and nowhere is that more evident in the following chart. Simply put, follow the money! 
As we detailed <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-W03">last week</TIMEX3> , as US financial stocks have soared in the post-election Trumphoria, so bankers have been dumping over $100 million in personal stock holdings... 



  
But, as Barron's details, it's not just the bankers that are bailing out of US stocks (just as the corporate elite and their mainstream media lackeys cajole you and your hard-earned retirement funds back into the most-expensive market ever), it's everyone!! 

  
The massive spike in insider-selling (relative to buying) is broad-based... 

  
Still - listen to CNBC, buy some more NFLX or TSLA or the latest Biotech stock, we have reached a new permanantly high plateau...
