Port Vale face an anxious wait over the fitness of Nathan Smith after the 20-year-old was forced off during the 3-2 defeat at Scunthorpe with a suspected hamstring injury. 
 
Smith had to be substituted on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="PT54M">54 minutes</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">yesterday</TIMEX3>, ending his record of playing every minute of every game in all 34 of Vale's matches in all competitions this season. 
 

 
Port Vale lost 3-2 at Scunthorpe 
 
The youngster was replaced by Kjell Knops who was signed to play in central defence in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-SU">the summer</TIMEX3>, but has been used at left back because Smith and Remie Streete have been so impressive in the middle.

Knops had lost his place in the starting line up to left back Scott Tanser who made his Vale debut after signing from Rochdale on <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3> on a deal until the end of the season. 
 
Vale's battling performance wasn't quite enough against a Scunthorpe side who moved to the top of League One with the win. 
 
Tyler Walker fired Vale in front on <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="PT38M">38 minutes</TIMEX3> but Josh Morris levelled <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="PT4M">four minutes</TIMEX3> into <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2016-H2">the second half</TIMEX3> after Streete was judged to have fouled former Vale striker Craig Davies. 
 
JJ Hooper restored Vale's lead on <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="PT59M">59 minutes</TIMEX3> but goals from Ivan Toney, on 62, and Tom Hopper, on <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION" value="PT71M">71 minutes</TIMEX3>, condemned Vale to a 3-2 defeat which sends them down three places to 18 th .
