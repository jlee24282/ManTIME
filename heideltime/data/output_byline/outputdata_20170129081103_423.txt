IT services and consulting provider Ajilon has been working with mining company Roy Hill to support the company in optimising existing processes and analysing new initiatives for its business analytics platform. Built on Microsoft Azure, the business analytics platform enables Roy Hill to discover insights across their operations by rapidly processing, augmenting and visualising information.

Ajilonâ€™s National Solution Lead, Peter Hawkins said, "We are very proud of what we have delivered for Roy Hill. As with any cutting edge solution, it was not all easy but due to the collaborative nature of the partnership, we have been able to deliver a fantastic outcome and a first in Australia."

"The ability to analyse vast troves of data <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> enables specialists to identify opportunities to optimise and transform operational processes, resulting in productivity improvements and cost reductions."

Jeremy Dennis, National Analytics Lead at Ajilon, said the Azure-based business analytics platform has proven capable of processing "vast amounts of data [big data], streaming analytics [IoT], as well as visual analytics, data science and model management, all from a single technology stack."

According to Dennis, the platform can ingest large volumes of data in real time, enabling data scientists and engineers to self-serve visualisation tools, develop predictive algorithms, and combine disparate information sources to discover real value. "Using IoT technology, the platform can stream near real-time sensor data from the mobile assets to allow rapid process analysis and efficiencies."

Dennis said the business analytics capability delivered will enable Roy Hill to rapidly optimise existing processes and analyse new initiatives.
