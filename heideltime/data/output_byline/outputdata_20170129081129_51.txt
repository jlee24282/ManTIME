The Smoky Mountain Winterfest celebration is still going strong through <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2017-02">February</TIMEX3> and it is truly a beautiful event to attend.

While the wildfires were devastating to the area residents, downtown Gatlinburg was untouched by this tragedy and this town needs visitors to keep coming back. Tourism is their bread and butter. And believe me, you could not pick a better "Home away from Home." Southern Hospitality oozes from everyone you come across, while visiting the Smokies and best part is, it is genuine.
