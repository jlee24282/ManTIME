On <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29TEV">Sunday evening</TIMEX3>, <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-08">Jan. 8</TIMEX3>, my mother and I ate supper at the Saddle Club. While we were eating, the waitress told us that our bill had been taken care of. Happy new year to whoever you are. We will pay it forward.
