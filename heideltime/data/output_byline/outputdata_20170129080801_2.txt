At <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="TIME" value="2017-01-15T17:45" mod="APPROX">approximately 5:45pm</TIMEX3>, the State Police were dispatched to a one-vehicle property damage automobile accident at the intersection of Maple Avenue and Hagaman Avenue in the Village of Hagaman.

The vehicle had significant front-end damage with air bag deployment. It became apparent to the trooper that the operator was unaware that he was involved in an accident. The trooper observed the odor of alcoholic beverage emanating from within the passenger compartment of the vehicle. Mr. Cerny was requested to perform Standardized Field Sobriety Tests, which he did and subsequently failed. He also submitted to a Pre-Breath Test screening which yielded a positive result for the presence of alcohol. 
 
Mr. Cerny was arrested for DWI and transported back to the State Police barracks in Fonda. While at SP Fonda, he submitted to a breath test which yielded a 0.28% BAC. Mr. Cerny was processed without incident and charged with Aggravated DWI due to having a reportable BAC of 0.18% or greater. He was issued tickets returnable to the Town of Amsterdam Court on <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2017-01-26">01/26/17</TIMEX3> and released to a sober third party.
