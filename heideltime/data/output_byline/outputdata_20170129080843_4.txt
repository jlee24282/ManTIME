The most powerful game console to be released. 
 
Only a few details are available for Microsoft’s upcoming Project Scorpio: which was dubbed as the most powerful console to be released. We can save the PC vs console arguments on another article, since the new generation of game consoles released in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2016">the past year</TIMEX3> at <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> (almost) at par with high-end gaming PCs. 
 
First off, the Xbox One and the PlayStation 4 being to the <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> crop of eighth-generation consoles, but years after they were released we were treated to new upgrades in the likes of the PS4 Pro and the upcoming Project Scorpio. These consoles were not made to be replacements to the <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> generation, but cited as alternative options for gamers who want more powerful hardware. 
 
Let’s talk numbers. The <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> released PS4 Pro achieves 4.2 teraflops, enough for some games to be rendered in 4K or depending on how developers make it, improve graphic fidelity and visuals. 
 
Project Scorpio was announced to support up to 6 teraflops – meaning that it will top out all other consoles once it is released. To compared, Nvidia’s latest GTX 1080 graphics card supports 10-11 teraflops. 
 
That would mean games will look better than ever. And with the <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> push for 4K support on games, you can <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> enjoy games on a much higher resolution. But just like the PS4 Pro, you would need a compatible display to be able to appreciate the performance upgrade. 
 
Project Scorpio’s specifications (8-core AMD processor, 320 GB of memory bandwidth, and 6 teraflop GPU) are truly impressive, though we’d only appreciate it more once we see gameplay sampled from the console. 
 
Microsoft only mentioned Project Scorpio’s release date to be this holiday season, and there is a good chance that this high-end gaming console won’t be cheap. The company did say that the console is for gamer who won’t have a high-end Windows 10 PC. 
 
When you look at it, spending money on Project Scorpio would technically be cheaper than upgrading or buying a new gaming PC.
