Shamrocks again top Observerland field

Catholic Central's so-called 'B team' proves too much for Observerland rivals

From <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">one year</TIMEX3> to the next, Novi Detroit Catholic Central seemingly has a headlock on opponents at the Observerland Wrestling Tournament. 

<TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2016">Last year</TIMEX3>, the Shamrocks’ top-flight squad (Blue) prevailed and <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> it was the White team — considered just a notch below the A team — to wreak havoc at Livonia Churchill High School. 

Catholic Central registered 304.5 points, far ahead of runner-up Salem’s 132.5, for another championship trophy. 

“They’re E team is good,” Wayne Memorial co-coach Jason Crothers said. “Every (Catholic Central) team is good, you go there for a reason. Those kids are well-trained, you can’t take anything away from a B team, a C team, it doesn’t matter. They’re all tough.” 

In third place was Plymouth (130), a last-minute addition to the tournament, with Farmington (124.5), Wayne Memorial (124), Canton (120), Livonia Stevenson (113), Novi (112.5), Livonia Churchill and Lutheran Westland (112 each) rounding out the top 10. 

Earning MVP honors for the lower weights was Canton’s Justin Winnie, who won the 135-pound championship. Salem’s Bruce Haslitt took home the prize for upper weights MVP after winning at 145 with his 17th consecutive pin of the season.

Because of fewer teams participating, the tourney was changed from a 16-man bracket to to a round-robin affair. 

“It was a last minute thing once we saw the numbers in the weight classes,” said Livonia Churchill head wrestling coach Marty Altounian, the event organizer. “Instead of having someone getting two matches most of them got four or five doing it this way. 

“It was a little confusing, yes, but it paid off for the quality of wrestling they got.” 

Livonia Stevenson head coach Dan Vaughan said the format change took some getting used to, but for the most part the overall tournament quality remained good. 

“I think there were some weight classes that were really packed full of good kids, 125 pops out in my mind, 140 was not bad,” Vaughan said. “Heavyweight seemed pretty deep.”

On the podium 

Of course, Catholic Central wrestlers were often in the mix for medals and points (the top six per weight class reached the podium). 

“I’m just really pleased with the way our guys wrestled,” Ianni said. “They practiced, they worked their butts off day in and day out. They have for <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="PXM">the last few months</TIMEX3>, so it’s good they get to come here and show it in front of everybody.” 

Capturing first place in their weights for the Shamrocks were Dan Rehfeldt (103 pounds), Davis Rastigue (125), Brody Burke (152), Brendin Yatooma (160) and Dane Flynn (189). 

Another four lost in the “spotlight finals,” when Churchill gymnasium lights were dimmed so fans could focus on the one bout taking place. 

Earlier in the tourney, as many as four matches took place simultaneously. 

For Ianni, a Catholic Central alum who wrestled his senior year at Observerland, it always is a plus to bring a contingent to the tourney. 

“It’s just kind of a tradition for us,” Ianni said. “I graduated in <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2007">2007</TIMEX3> and this was a huge tournament for us then and we still like to come back and have a presence here. We’re happy coming back.” 

Ianni, meanwhile, said there is a “pretty good difference” between the Blue and White teams, but that didn’t provide much solace for the 13 other high schools there (another team, Salem’s B squad, also competed). 

“We got a few guys on the White team who even though they’re teammates they like to get after the guys ahead of them,” he continued. “They like to push them pretty hard, that’s what makes the whole program better. 

“... Brendin Yatooma’s had time on the Blue team, Dane Flynn. It’s really next man up, so whenever somebody needs to fill in, we’re happy putting anybody out there.” 

Rock solid 

Earning second-place honors in the team standings was Salem, spearheaded by senior Haslitt’s pin in 1:59 against CC’s Robert Walston. It gave Haslitt 98 career pins and plenty of momentum as he takes a run at the school mark of 104 set in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="1986">1986</TIMEX3> by state champion Dave Dameron. 

“This tournament’s come down a little bit,” said Salem head coach Jeremy Henderson, a former Observerland and state champion. “But to be able to pin your way all the way through the finals at this thing is still something to be proud of. 

“Bruce has turned it on at the right time of the season, he’s going to be tough to beat the next couple weeks.” 

Canton’s Winnie, a senior, won 11-6 in the 135 final against Northville freshman Nick Gattoni. 

“I knew I just had to keep my pace high,” Winnie said. “I knew he was a freshman, I just had to go out and wrestle my match.” 

Haslitt, Winnie and Farmington’s Jake Justice (who won at 130 with a pin over the Shamrocks’ Kale Kazyak) all said they were pumped up to wrestle in the spotlight finals. 

“You never get to feel the same type of experience as this,” said Haslitt, adding with a laugh that “I feel like I’m about to have a heart attack every match.” 

Justice said the success he and teammates had <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> (also winning was heavyweight Donovan King, with Anthony Averiette reaching the finals at 103) will help the Falcons’ overall team confidence moving forward into state tournament time. 

“I feel a lot of the guys are going to want to keep going in the room as hard as they can <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3>, <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> that they know we’ve had some wrestlers that were placing,” Justice continued. 

Full marks 

Plymouth came home with one championship win in <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="0112">112</TIMEX3>-pounder Tyler Campbell. 

“For him to get first <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3> is pretty awesome for him,” Plymouth head coach Josh Leege said. “He’s a junior, so this is definitely the year he’s seeing his hard work pay off.”

Other firsts were turned in by Livonia Churchill’s Ethan Englehart (119), Livonia Stevenson’s Tarik Alcodray (140), Novi’s Corey Grassmeyer (171) and Lutheran Westland’s Nick Glinn (215). 

“Some of the kids didn’t come out on the winning end like they should have,” Churchill’s Altounian said. “Others worked their butts off to get what they got, and it was well noted. They all wrestled really well.” 

Vaughan said Alcodray “did what he was supposed to do and win the tournament and we’re looking forward to districts.” 

Wayne Memorial didn’t win any first-place medals, but the Zebras did have five finalists in Nick Daniels (125), Jalen Adams (152), Kevaughn Henderson (171), Chris Fletcher (215) and Anthony Calloway (285). 

“We took seven <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3> so five of them made the finals,” Crothers said. “So that’s a pretty good day for us.”
