At the golf industry's biggest trade show event of the year, the <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> PGA Merchandise Show, golf cars and low speed electric vehicles occupy a large part of the convention room floor. On <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-26">Thursday</TIMEX3>'s Morning Drive on the Golf Channel, live at the Orange County Convention Center, the  Sirius took center stage along with big industry names like Club Car, E-Z-Go, and Garia. 

Although primarily associated with golf, the golf car industry <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> encompasses a wide range of small vehicles from LSVs (a street legal low-speed vehicle) to utility vehicles to the classic golf course companion.  kept the golf course-to-neighborhood overlap in mind with the ground-up creation of the new Sirius model, which boasts automotive conveniences like an electronic locking trunk, USB port, LED illuminated dashboard, and self-cancelling turn signals. But it is still golf course worthy, with optional golf ball holder inserts, and a large bagwell, or the option of a 2-in-1 Combo Seat (a patented design that turns a rear seat into a golf bag holder without tools). 

STAR EV revealed two prototypes at its PGA show exhibit; a standard Sirius with 2-in-1 Combo Seat, and a "tricked-out" version to show how customizable the Sirius will be. The front trunk gives the golf car the look of a hood that can be painted a different color from the main body, like the sleek matte black trunk on the deep metallic maroon prototype. STAR EV also offers a variety of wheels, with rim finishes in machined aluminum, matte black, dura chrome, black PVD, and special color accents. 

While the models at the show were standard 2 and 4-passenger vehicles, the Sirius line will expand to include 6 and 8 passenger models like the STAR EV Classic. As all STAR's vehicles, the Sirius is 100% electric with a 4 kW AC motor, 350 A Curtis AC controller, and can travel at a top speed of 19.5 mph. (The LSV version peaks at 25 mph.) The line officially launches in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-SU">the summer of 2017</TIMEX3>, available through any of STAR's 250+  nationwide and internationally.
