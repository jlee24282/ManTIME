A Jacksonville family is pleading for information that leads to the arrest of the person who shot and killed a member of a local choir, who's family believes he wasn't the intended target. 
 
Family and loved ones held a vigil in memory of Jerry Brown, 22 on <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TNI">Saturday night</TIMEX3>. While it was a celebration of life, it was also a call to action. 
 
"If anybody out there knows anything, please tell us. Come forth and tell us," Chevie Green, Brown's aunt, said. 
 
Brown was gunned down in a drive by shooting on Henrietta Street on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2016-01-28">January 28, 2016</TIMEX3>. In <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3>'s time, no arrests have been made. 
 
Brown's mother died of cancer shortly after his death. Loved ones say they'll fight for justice on behalf of Brown's mother. 
 
"He worked, he went to church, he took care of his mom," Green said. "How can you live and fight cancer, and your son is gone?" 
 
Brown's aunt also has a message for young people. 
 
"You have a purpose in this life. You have your whole life ahead of you. You can be anything. You literally can be the President," Green said. "You don't have to be a murderer. You don't have to destroy families." 
 
The reward money for information leading to an arrest has grown to $10,000. The family has raised some of the award money itself.
