You’ll also learn about <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> Sam’s Club deals that you can take advantage of <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3>. Before heading out to any discount shopping store, you need to first understand what is a good price for everyday items.  Buying in bulk can often be confusing based on the quantity.  By first knowing the prices of a staple pantry item then you can determine if the bulk price is a good deal or not.

4. Kids’ Snacks 
From Goldfish to Granola Bars – there are great deals all the way down this aisle. For instance, Mott’s Medleys are $7.73 for 90 pouches (like 9 regular boxes). That’s like paying 85¢ per box, and a 4 lb box of Pepperidge Farm Goldfish is only $7.87 <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-01">this month</TIMEX3>. 
 
5. Juice Boxes 
If you pack school lunches, juice boxes  are a must-have. Normally a 10-ct box of Capri Suns is $2.50 – but the Sam’s price is – 40-pk for $5.58 <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">right now</TIMEX3>. 
 
6. Eggs 
Sams has ywo 18-ct eggs for $3.71 – that breaks down to $1.23 a dozen and lower than most grocery stores.
