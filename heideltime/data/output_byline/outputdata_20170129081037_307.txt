Authentic... Genuine... Sincere... This guy is the real deal. He loves God. He loves his wife Rebecca and his 3 daughters. He loves people. He loves his job. He loves Texas BBQ. He loves an occasional round of golf. And he loves the Dallas Cowboys (but don’t hold that against him!). 

Richard grew up as a missionary kid in Brazil, coming back to the states to ﬁnish his education. He graduated from Baylor University in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="1982">1982</TIMEX3> with a BA in Oral Communications, and earned his MDIV in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="1985">1985</TIMEX3> from Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, making him the sixth generation of pastors in his family. His early days of ministry included serving for <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P3Y">three years</TIMEX3> as the Single Adults Pastor at the First Baptist Church of Dallas. 

Then in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="1997">1997</TIMEX3>, Richard Ellis founded Reunion Church, a multi-cultural, multi-ethnic, non-denominational church in the heart of Dallas,Texas. Dallas needed a church like it. And it would need a pastor like Richard. So Reunion Church was born. And <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> the radio show and the website (www.RichardEllisTalks.com) join the Reunion Church community under the leadership of this guy. And we’re all the better for it!
