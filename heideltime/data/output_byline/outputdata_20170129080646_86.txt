RUGBY SEVENS: Kenya has managed to end its 15-match drought against Australia.

And time could almost be up too for the World Sevens being hosted by Wellington.

An inexperienced Australian men's side was forced to settle for 10th place at the World Sevens round at Westpac Stadium after being upset by the Kenyans.

The minnows made all the early running, leading at one stage in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-H1">the first half</TIMEX3> 14-0, before Henry Hutchison got the Aussies back into the match with a try.

Mick Adams touched down in the corner right on the final siren to get his team back to 19-17, but fill-in skipper James Stannard narrowly missed the conversion, the ball just drifting right with the breeze.

The all-time leading try-scorer for Kenya, Collins Injera was rapt with his team's performance in securing a rare win over the Aussies.

"We just wanted to keep our focus, stick to the basics,” he said. "Australia are a quality side ... (but) the boys stood up.”

All Blacks Sevens coach Scott Waldrom, whose side lost the playoff for fifth spot against Argentina 17-12, was less than impressed with attendances over <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-W03-WE">the weekend</TIMEX3>.

Less than 10,000 fans showed up over both <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">yesterday</TIMEX3>, leaving Westpac Stadium bare and Waldrom seething.

"The danger could be you lose it for <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P2Y">two years</TIMEX3> and someone else picks it up,” he told New Zealand radio.

"World Rugby will say, 'this tournament is going so well, why could we risk going back to there'.”

South Africa and Fiji clashed in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="TIME" value="2017-01-27TNI">last night</TIMEX3>'s final.

The World Sevens heads to Sydney <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-W05-WE">next weekend</TIMEX3>. Update your news preferences and get the latest news delivered to your inbox.
