NEW DELHI: Investors wealth surged by over Rs 3.64 lakh crore on Dalal Street in the week gone by, with the benchmark BSE Sensex climbing over 848 points on strong global cues, Budget expectations and quarterly earnings by early birds that have beat consensus estimates and eased concerns over cash ban impact on the economy. A slowdown in the pace of selling by foreign institutional investors also supported the domestic equity market during the week. The Nifty50 index climbed 291.90 points, or 3.50 per cent, to close at 8,641 on <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">January 27</TIMEX3> compared with 8,349 on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-01-20">January 20</TIMEX3>. The domestic market was closed on <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-01-26">January 26</TIMEX3> on account of Republic Day. Dipen Shah, Senior Vice-President for PCG Research at Kotak Securities, said: “The market ended the week with over 3 per cent gain with several midcaps performing much better. Better-than-expected quarterly results from domestically-oriented companies, slight weakening of the dollar and Budget expectations improved sentiments for the market. Quarterly results have so far reflected muted impact of demonetisation.” Market capitalisation of the BSE-listed companies jumped from Rs 110.23 lakh crore on <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2017-01-20">January 20</TIMEX3> to Rs 113.87 lakh crore on <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">January 27</TIMEX3>. Smallcap and midcap stocks notched up decent gains. The BSE Midcap index surged 3.14 per cent for the week, while the BSE Smallcap index gained 2.75 per cent. All the sectoral indices on BSE settled the week in the green, with the BSE Metal index climbing the most at 5.93 per cent, followed by the Consumer Durables index (up 5.55 per cent), PSU index (up 5.46 per cent) and Oil & Gas index (up 4.86 per cent). Other sectoral indices such as Auto, Power, Capital Goods and Telecom rose 4.47 per cent, 3.72 per cent, 2.37 per cent and 2.22 per cent, respectively. Firm metal prices in international markets continued to support the metal stocks. In the Nifty 50 pack, Hindalco surged the most at 11.13 per cent to Rs 190.75 as of <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">January 27</TIMEX3> from Rs 171.65 on <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2017-01-20">January 20</TIMEX3>. Other stocks such as HDFC (up 11.02 per cent), Idea Cellular (up 9.09 per cent), Bank of Baroda (up 8.65 per cent) and Kotak Mahindra Bank (up 8.57 per cent) were among the other major gainers in the 50-share pack. On the other hand, shares of Wipro, Infosys, Hindustan Unilever (HUL), Tech Mahindra, Sun Pharma and RIL declined 2.58 per cent, 0.69 per cent, 0.52 per cent, 0.33 per cent, 0.16 per cent and 0.07 per cent, respectively, during the week. Overall, 45 stocks from the Nifty50 pack ended in the green, while six settled the week in the red. Foreign portfolio investors have sold equities worth Rs 2,139 crore so far <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2017-01">this month</TIMEX3>. This has been far better than Rs 8,176 crore outflow seen in <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2016-12">December</TIMEX3> and Rs 18,224 crore outflow in <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2016-11">November</TIMEX3>. Inflows from domestic institutional investors continued to outpace and compensate for foreign outflows during the period. Domestic institutional investors have pumped Rs 4,471.56 crore into domestic equities, in addition to Rs 9,136 crore of inflows in <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2016-12">December</TIMEX3> and Rs 18,227 crore in <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2016-11">November</TIMEX3>. Equity investors are eyeing government announcements in the Budget to accelerate growth, especially after the impact of the demonetisation drive and in view of the goods and services tax (GST) to be implemented during the financial year, which again may put the economic growth back on track. Going into <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2017-W05">next week</TIMEX3>, investors will be eyeing the outcome of the US Federal Market Open Committee (FOMC) meeting scheduled for <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2017-01-31">January 31</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2017-02-01">February 1</TIMEX3> for any hint of the next rate hike. Market outlook Short covering coupled with buying on investor optimism have led to a sharp rise in the benchmark equity indices. Market indicators have signalled an overbought condition, calling for caution in the immediate term. Jimeet Modi, Chief Executive Officer, SAMCO Securities, said: “The prices have touched the upper end of the channel, which will most likely attract profit booking. Traders should be cautious in times of high volatility and take a reactive view once the Budget gets over. Long positional trades should be trailed with stop losses below 8,300, while short-term traders may partially book profit and trail the balance below the 8,450 mark. Traders should buy on dips while investors should hold on to their portfolios.”
