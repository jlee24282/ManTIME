If the Monrovia boys basketball teams’ <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="TIME" value="2017-01-27TAF">Friday afternoon</TIMEX3> practice indicated anything about what the Bulldogs would bring to <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TNI">Saturday night</TIMEX3>'s contest it was this: energy. Led by seniors Luke Seber and Luke Smith, Monrovia charged out of the gate and didn't look back claiming a 67-53 victory over the visiting Edgewood Mustangs.

<TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3>, for the first time in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> memory, the team sits above the .500 mark going into <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-02">February</TIMEX3> action.

A big part of that accomplishment comes from the efforts of Coach Kyle Swafford in his first year.

Swafford was elated with his team's effort after the game saying, “At this time of year, I couldn't be happier with our effort. We played 10 kids and every single one of them goes in and competes”

Of those 10, Luke Seber had the most dominant performance against a worthy Edgewood frontcourt. Despite fouling out midway through the fourth period, Seber notched 22 points, including a pair of 3’s. Trailing Seber was his counterpart in Luke Smith who recorded 21 points. The two combined to shoot 15-18 from the free throw stripe, 11 of which came from Smith alone.

The sophomore Max Newman got into the action with 11 points, but it was his protection at the rim that paid dividends for his teammates on the other end of the floor. Senior Sam Whitaker accounted for four and guards Zach Cottrell, Brock Stader, and Jaylen Sprague rounded out the scoring with a basket each.

The Bulldogs got off to a hot start as forwards Luke Seber and Sam Whitaker went work in the paint offensively. The duo combined for all 15 <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-Q1">first quarter</TIMEX3> points.

But it was Monrovia’s relentless perimeter defense that stood out in the early going. The Bulldogs were able to hold Edgewood without a field goal until the 2:30 mark of <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2017-Q1">the 1st quarter</TIMEX3>. After Monrovia jumped out to a 13-1 lead, the Mustangs responded with a seven point run cutting the Bulldogs lead to 15-8 after <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017-Q1">the first quarter</TIMEX3>.

The Bulldogs continued to look to the paint for offense in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2018-Q2">the second quarter</TIMEX3>. Sophomore Max Newman took the feed from Zach Cottrell to the square for quick bucket. On the ensuing possession the Edgewood Capitalized on a defensive lapse by the Bulldogs to claim a basket of their own. With Seber on the bench in foul trouble, Edgewood continued to chip away at Monrovia’s lead. On the final possession of the half the Mustangs’ Joe Kido took the inbounds pass from basket to basket beating the buzzer to cut Monrovia’s lead to just three.

The Bulldogs came out of the break with the same tenacity with which they began the game. Luke Smith stayed active on defense creating problems for Edgewood’s offense. Smith recorded 19 of his 21 points in <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2016-H2">the second half</TIMEX3> alone, including 7 straight to start the final period.

The Bulldogs defense had some letdowns in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2016-H2">the second half</TIMEX3>, but their “bend not break” approach allowed them to maintain control from start to finish. Edgewood struggled to find open looks and when they did the out stretched arms of Max Newman and Luke Seber were constantly closing in.

“They rally around each other. If one guy slips up he knows he'll have help behind him. And that's exactly what we look for. I trust all 10 of them, and this time of year is when it means the most.”, Swafford said in closing.

The Bulldogs play again <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2017-02-02">next Thursday</TIMEX3> against Greencastle at Branch McCracken Memorial Gymnasium with tip off at 7
