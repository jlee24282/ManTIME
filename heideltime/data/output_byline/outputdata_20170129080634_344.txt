The former world No 1 missed the cut at the Farmers Insurance Open on <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3> – his first PGA Tour appearance in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P17M">17 months</TIMEX3>. The American golfer’s next stop? Dubai.

Comeback kid 

Woods, a 14-time major champion, was looking forward to his return to Torrey Pines, a venue in which he had won on eight times previously. But an opening-day 76 left him on four-over par and struggling to make the cut, before Friday’s second-round 72 meant he missed out on <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-W03-WE">the weekend</TIMEX3> by four strokes. Finally fully recovered from back surgery, he tees it up <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-W04">this week</TIMEX3> at the Omega Dubai Desert Classic.

Classic credentials 

Woods, 41, has a very favourable record at the Dubai event, winning in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2006">2006</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3>. In fact, in his seven appearances, he has also finished runner-up, tied third and tied fifth, although he did struggle on his last visit to Emirates Golf Club, coming home tied 41st in <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2014">2014</TIMEX3>. On how his body would hold up with the <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="PT17H">17-hour</TIMEX3> flight to Dubai, Woods said: "Flying out here was something I hadn’t done in a while. So <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> we’ve got a pretty good jaunt."

Comfort factor 

On whether his familiarity with the Dubai tournament gives him some reassurance, Woods said: "I know the golf course, I know the greens, I know the putts, I know how it’s going to play. And I’ve played it under so many different conditions over the years, whether we’ve had a lot of rough, no rough. We’ve had shamals, no shamals. It’s nice going to a golf course that I know."

Augusta build-up 

Beginning in Dubai, Woods is playing three times in <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DURATION" value="P4W">the next four weeks</TIMEX3> as he steps up preparation for the Masters on <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2017-04-06">April 6</TIMEX3> – the year’s first major. A four-time winner at Augusta, he was generally pleased with his progress at Torrey Pines, saying: "I felt I made some nice strides, just wish I could be playing <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2017-W03-WE">the weekend</TIMEX3> because I really love this course. I need to get more rounds under my belt. Just like everybody, I’m trying to get ready for that first week in <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2017-04">April</TIMEX3>."
