about football and <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3> after quitting the international scene, she is <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> a part of All India's Football Federation's inaugural Indian Women's League. She is the player-cum-captain of Manipur side Eastern Sporting Union. The league kicked off here <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">yesterday</TIMEX3>. 
 
"My life is all about football. I breath, eat and live football," said Bembem. 
 
"I wanted to be a part of history and after serving Indian football for <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P20Y" mod="MORE_THAN">more than 20 years</TIMEX3> as a player I wanted to be part of history by taking part in this league which is an ambitious project for women's football in the country. I congratulate the AIFF for starting this league," said Bembem, who's not charged a single penny for doubling up as player-cum-coach of the Manipur outfit. 
 
Asked about the future of the league, she said, "I hope from <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2018">next year</TIMEX3> onwards, this league will be played in home and away format. I am thinking that more women's teams from the Indian Super League and I-League clubs will take part <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2018">next year</TIMEX3> onwards and the profile of the women's game will improve. 
 
"That, I hope, will lead to women players also earning salaries just like their male counterparts and they can also earn a living. It's in future but I hope these things happen and that will be a turning point in Indian women's football," said the Imphal-based 5-foot-2-inch-tall midfielder. 
 
Talking further about women's football, she said, "When I played in Maldives, I realised that women's football is so popular even in a country like Maldives. Players from different countries play in the Maldives league. They have good infrastructure and the stadium was full in every league match. Their stadiums were not big but still they were full. 
 
"Then I released that we are lagging behind in women's football because it is more popular in a small country like Maldives. But we have to make a beginning and I feel that this Indian Women's League is a new beginning," she said. 
 
Bembem has prepared herself to be associated with football in future as she is <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> an AFC 'B' License holder and she has started coaching a local football side in Imphal. 
 
"In <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2010">2010</TIMEX3>, while I was playing for the country, I also started preparing for my future role as coach and got this AFC 'B' license. <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3>, I will get AFC 'A' license and I will be fully qualified. 
 
"I am <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> coaching a local club in Imphal (United Pioneers Club). Apart from any other role, the AIFF may give me, which I don't know as of <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3>, I will be occupied as a coach and train youngsters in Manipur and other parts of the country. This is how I want to give back to the sport," said Bembem, who is employed with Manipur Police and is with ESU in the Indian Women's League on loan.
