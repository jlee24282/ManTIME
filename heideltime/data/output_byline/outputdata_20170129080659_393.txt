India cricketer Ravindra Jadeja and his wife Reeva Solanki were involved in a road accident on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3> in Jamnagar, according to reports. 
 
Reportedly, Jadeja's car hit a two-wheeler. A girl named Preeti Sharma, studying at Jamnagar's Vidyasagar Institute, was riding the vehicle. 
 
Television reports said that Sharma sustained minor injuries. However, it wasn't clear if the accident was due to the cricketer's fault. 
 
It was also reported that Jadeja took the girl to a nearby hospital for treatment. 
 The Saurashtra all-rounder, who has been rested for the ongoing T20I series against England along with Ravichandran Ashwin, has been in great form this home season. Jadeja bagged 26 wickets against England in the five-Test series that India won 4-0.
