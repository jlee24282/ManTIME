Barbara Hale, 94, a wavy-haired model and Hollywood leading lady of <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="194">the 1940s</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="195">1950s</TIMEX3> who warbled with Frank Sinatra in his first big film role and had a long television career as the devoted secretary Della Street to Raymond Burr's tireless defense lawyer Perry Mason, died <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-26">Thursday</TIMEX3> at her home in Sherman Oaks, Calif. 

Ms. Hale was the matriarch of a show-business family that included her late husband, Bill Williams, who starred in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="195">the 1950s</TIMEX3> western series The Adventures of Kit Carson, and son William Katt, who played the title role in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="198" mod="START">the early 1980s</TIMEX3> TV series The Greatest American Hero. 

Katt confirmed the death and said the cause was complications from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 

Although Ms. Hale had a flourishing career in movies - often in wholesome roles opposite stars such as James Stewart, James Cagney, and Robert Mitchum - she found her big-screen career overshadowed by her work on CBS's Perry Mason . 

The series aired from <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="1957">1957</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="1966">1966</TIMEX3>, making it one of the longest-airing courtroom shows in history, and Ms. Hale won an Emmy for her role as Street. <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="198">Two decades later</TIMEX3>, she reprised her role in more than two dozen made-for-TV movies for NBC. 

Later films included the original Airport, playing the husband of Dean Martin's pilot character , and Big <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2017-01-25">Wednesday</TIMEX3>, in which she appeared with her son. - From Wire Reports
