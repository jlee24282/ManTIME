A taxi driver miraculously escaped serious injury when her cab flipped over after barreling into a minivan that then ricocheted into an ambulance in Hell’s Kitchen <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TMO">Saturday morning</TIMEX3>. 
 
The chain-reaction crash occurred at West 53rd Street and Eighth Avenue at <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28T08:30" mod="APPROX">about 8:30 a.m.</TIMEX3>, the FDNY said. 
 
First responders righted the overturned taxi and “clawed off” the driver’s-side door to reach the injured hack, who was fitted with a neck brace and placed on a stretcher, witnesses said. 
 
“I’m just glad nobody got killed,” said witness Ruben Santiago, 59, of Brooklyn, who “heard the bang” then saw the mangled, overturned cab in the street. 
 
One person was taken to New York-Presbyterian Hospital with minor injuries, the FDNY said.
