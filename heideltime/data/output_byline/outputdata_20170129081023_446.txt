Santa Rosa City Schools, the largest school district in Sonoma County, is marching toward insolvency.

Structural budget deficits are growing by about $1 million <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3> and, barring big changes, reserve funds will be exhausted within <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P3Y">three years</TIMEX3>.

It is, in short, a budget crisis.

And district officials, beginning with the Board of Education, deserve an F on their report cards for failing in their obligation to share this information with the public in a clear and timely fashion.

Not a word was mentioned during the <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> concluded school board election.

Nor is there a member of the school board, a parent or any other representative of the public on a committee of principals, administrators and union representatives that was quietly appointed <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2016-SU">last summer</TIMEX3> to study the district’s options.

The most thorough update came at the end of a <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="PT4H">four-hour</TIMEX3> board meeting in <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2016-12" mod="MID">mid-December</TIMEX3> — the first for three new members elected in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2016-11">November</TIMEX3>.

It’s unlikely, at best, that anyone perusing the meeting agenda would have identified "First Interim Report for Fiscal Year <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3>-<TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2017">17</TIMEX3>" as the late-night blockbuster that it proved to be.

Here’s a brief summary:

The deficit for <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3>-<TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2017">17</TIMEX3> is $10.7 million in a budget of $180 million, followed by projected deficits of $7.9 million in <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3>-<TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2018">2018</TIMEX3> and $11 million in <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2018">2018</TIMEX3>-<TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2019">19</TIMEX3>. 

District enrollment is basically flat, but a decline in elementary school enrollment is masked by increased enrollment in charter schools, which are funded separately.

Santa Rosa City Schools will experience "staggering" increases in retirement costs for teaching and non-teaching employees <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DURATION" value="PXY" mod="MORE_THAN">over the next several years</TIMEX3>, according to a financial consultant hired by the district. By <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2020">2020</TIMEX3>-<TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2021">21</TIMEX3>, payments to the California Public Employees Retirement System and the California State Teachers Retirement System will eat up 20 percent of payroll dollars — about double the level in <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2014">2014</TIMEX3>-<TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2015">15</TIMEX3>.

To remain solvent, and to comply with a state law requiring school districts to maintain a reserve equal to 3 percent of general fund spending, Santa Rosa schools must make budget adjustments — that’s a euphemism for spending cuts and/or tax increases — totaling $4 million for <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3>-<TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2018">18</TIMEX3> and $2 million more for <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2018">2018</TIMEX3>-<TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2019">19</TIMEX3>.

At that point, consultant Terry Ryland told the school board, "we’re still deficit spending, but it gets us down to where we meet our 3 percent reserve."

The district’s financial situation was exacerbated by million-dollar accounting mistakes that apparently resulted in the departure of two top administrators in <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent weeks</TIMEX3>.

It appears that the bookkeeping mistakes have been rectified, but the district hasn’t credibly addressed its systemic problems.

After listening to Ryland’s <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DATE" value="2016-12-14">Dec. 14</TIMEX3> report, without comment on questions, and receiving a vague report from the special budget committee, which made suggestions including attracting more students and seeking a parcel tax, the board unanimously declared that it had met its legal obligation to adopt a sustainable spending plan.

Sonoma County school Superintendent Steve Herrington, whose responsibilities include oversight of school district budgets, grudgingly accepted that conclusion but warned Santa Rosa school officials that they need to be much more specific about their plans for erasing the deficit.

In <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DATE" value="2014">2014</TIMEX3>, Santa Rosa voters taxed themselves to pay for $229 million in capital improvements to local schools — money that cannot be used for day-to-day operations. At least one school board member is on record advocating a parcel tax to help balance the books. But the district’s elected and appointed leaders will need to be far more forthcoming, and establish a more transparent process, if they expect voters to bail them out.
