Pic: Mega A tiger caused mass panic <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3> after it escaped from a travelling circus – and wandered into the busy streets of Sicily in Italy. 
 
Locals couldn’t believed their eyes as the white feline, called Oscar, perched outside of a block of flats in a town near Palermo. 
 
Even Mayor Piero Capizzi said he thought someone was joking when he was told a tiger was on the loose in Monreale. 
 
But, sure enough, the enough predator managed to give its captors the slip and enter a town, home to 38,000 people. 
 
Oscar was eventually recaptured – and nobody was hurt.

Traffic was blocked for <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="PTXH">a few hours</TIMEX3> along the nearby highway as authorities struggled to contain the enormous tiger. 
 
But eventually he was re-captured after being coaxed to go inside a series of increasingly smaller cages. 
 
He was then taken back to the circus – where he will be made to perform on <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-23">Monday</TIMEX3>. 
 
The mayor said it is not known how the tiger escaped from the circus, which is <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> performing in the Monreale area.
