It is Roger Federer vs Rafael Nadal again ! The two greats of the game, who share possibly the greatest rivalry in the history of the game, will take on each other once again, this time in the men's singles final of the <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> Australian Open on <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3>. Nadal has struggled with injuries, especially his wrist which made him miss Wimbledon <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3>, and last reached the final of a Grand Slam event in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2014">2014</TIMEX3>. On <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3> though, he can win his second Australian Open title and become the first man in the Open era -- and only the third man in history -- to win each of the four Grand Slam titles twice.

13:30 IST: Hello and welcome to the live blog of the <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> Australian Open men's singles final between Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. 
 
Swiss maestro Federer, on the other hand, himself stated that he was on "one leg" as he missed the latter half of the <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3> season due to his knee surgery, not to mention his back which also bothered him. 
 
But there they are. The two greats will once again take on each other in what will be their first Major final since the <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2011">2011</TIMEX3> French Open when Nadal won in four sets. 
 
With Federer and Nadal both returning from injuries, and neither having won a Major since <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2014" mod="MID">mid-2014</TIMEX3>, a ninth Grand Slam final between two of the most dominant men in the sport was considered an extreme long shot at Melbourne Park. Nadal leads Federer leads 6-2 in Major finals.
