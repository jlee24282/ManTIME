Photo: A system of executive government should be looked at in Guernsey, according to a Deputy for St Peter Port South.

Deputy Dawn Tindall was speaking at a meeting on the 'State of Democracy' in Guernsey <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-W04">this week</TIMEX3>. 

The comments came after a suggestion from Jersey Deputy Sam Mézec that Guernsey should go down the route of forming political parties, before moving ahead with islandwide voting. I quite like the idea of executive government. The answer that was given to me at the time [the new system of government was discussed] was that it would promote political parties, and from my perspective I don't see that as a problem. 

I think, if you have political parties, you have the ability to present policies and ideas before the election. 

– Deputy Dawn Tindall
