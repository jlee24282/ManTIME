The Windsor-Essex County Health Unit will be losing its medical officer of health and CEO <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017" mod="END">later this year</TIMEX3>. 
 
Dr. Gary Kirk announced <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3> he’ll be resigning in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2016-06">June</TIMEX3> because of the ailing health of his father, who lives in Illinois. 
 
“Most <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3>, <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="PXY" mod="MORE_THAN">over the last couple of years</TIMEX3>, he has had some unexpected hospitalizations,” he said. “I spoke with my family and we decided that it was important that I be closer to him.” 
 
Kirk will continue his duties <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="PXM" mod="MORE_THAN">over the next several months</TIMEX3> and help the health unit’s senior management and board work on a transition. 
 
“It’s been an absolute pleasure,” he said. “I’m not going right away. As the Monty Python movie said, ‘I’m not dead yet,’ so I’m happy to be able to help in the transition.” 
 
During his <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="P5Y">five years</TIMEX3> as the medical officer of health, Kirk said he was proud to work on the unit’s strategic planning, which led him to meet “virtually everyone in the health unit” and assemble “a strong senior management team.” 
 
He also said collaborations with external partners were a big part of his job. 
 
Kirk worked closely with Tecumseh Mayor Gary McNamara, the chair of the Board of Health. 
 
McNamara said Kirk came in at a “tough time for the unit” when it was often ranked at either the second-lowest or first-lowest funded health unit in Ontario. 
 
“There had to be some real juggling. It’s no different when you try to manage a budget and you’re making ends, stretching everything to make it work,” he said. “I used to call him the magician at times. He was able to do a lot of things.” 
 
McNamara said it won’t be easy to find a replacement, but Kirk will leave behind “really strong foundational pieces” to help ease the transition. 
 
Further details of the transition process will be released to the public at a later date.
