Historian Timothy B. Tyson told The Associated Press on <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> that Carolyn Donham broke her long public silence in an interview with him in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3>. His book, “The Blood of Emmett Till,” comes out <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-W05">next week</TIMEX3>.

“She told me that ‘Nothing that boy did could ever justify what happened to him,’ ” said Tyson, a Duke University research scholar whose previous books include “Blood Done Sign My Name” and “Radio Free Dixie.”

Emmett Till was a 14-year-old black tortured and killed in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="1955">1955</TIMEX3> in Mississippi after allegedly whistling at a white woman, then known as Carolyn Bryant.

His murder became national news, was a galvanizing event in the civil rights movement and has been the subject of numerous books and movies.

During the trial, Bryant said that he had grabbed her, and, in profane terms, bragged about his history with white women. The jury was not present when she testified.

Donham’s then-husband, Roy Bryant, and his half-brother, J.W. Milam, were acquitted by the all-white jury. Both men, who later told Look magazine they did murder Till, have since died. Milam’s widow, Juanita Milam, would later tell the FBI she believed that Carolyn Bryant had fabricated her story. Juanita Milam died in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2014">2014</TIMEX3>. The Justice Department re-examined the case <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="200X">a decade ago</TIMEX3>, but no one was indicted as a murderer or an accomplice.

On <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>, the maker of a documentary on Till said he had long been sure that Bryant’s story was false.

“His mother had mentioned that Emmett had a speech impediment and that the things Bryant claimed he was saying, he could not have said easily,” said Keith Beauchamp, whose book “The Untold Story of Emmett Till” was released in <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2005">2005</TIMEX3>.

Tyson said that he spoke with Donham after her daughter-in-law, Marsha Bryant, contacted him. Bryant had read “Blood Done Sign My Name,” about a racist murder during the author’s childhood in Oxford, North Carolina, and invited Tyson to meet with her and Donham.

Tyson said he and Donham had two conversations, both lasting <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION" value="PT2H">2</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="PT3H">3 hours</TIMEX3>, and that he planned at the time to place the material in the archives at the University of North Carolina. Asked why he waited so long to publicize his findings, he responded that historians think in different terms than do journalists.

“I’m more interested in what speaks to the ages than in what is the latest media thing,” he said.

He added that he wasn’t sure whether Donham knew about the book. He said he had fallen out of touch with the family and that when he last spoke with Bryant, <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">a few years ago</TIMEX3>, she said Donham was in poor health.

Till was a fun-loving teenager from Chicago visiting the Mississippi Delta and helping out on his great-uncle Mose Wright’s farm.

On <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="1955-08-24">Aug. 24, 1955</TIMEX3>, Till and some other kids drove to a local store, Bryant’s, for refreshments. At Bryant’s, some of the kids stayed on the porch, watching a game of checkers, while the others filed inside to buy bubble gum and sodas. Carolyn Bryant, the 21-year-old wife of proprietor Roy Bryant, was behind the counter. Mrs. Bryant claimed Emmett bragged about dating white women up north. She said he grabbed her and asked her, “How about a date, baby?” Simeon Wright, his cousin, heard none of this. But there is no doubt about what he heard when they left the store, he told the AP in <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2005">2005</TIMEX3>.

Standing on the front porch, Emmett let out a wolf whistle.

Carolyn Donham’s whereabouts have long been a mystery, but North Carolina voter rolls list a Carolyn Holloway Donham. Holloway is her maiden name.

The address is for a green, split-level home in Raleigh at the mouth of a neat cul-de-sac just two turns off a busy four-lane thoroughfare. The well-tended house has burnt-orange shutters and a front-facing brick chimney decorated with a large metal sunburst. Orange flags emblazoned with the word “Google” dot the lawn.

A woman, who appeared to be of late middle age, and a small barking dog appeared at the front door. When a reporter asked if this was the Bryant family home, the woman replied, “Yes.”

When asked if Carolyn Donham was at home, the woman replied, “She’s not available.”
