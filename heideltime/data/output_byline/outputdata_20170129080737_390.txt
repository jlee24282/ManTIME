There are many problems in this world that need attention.

But there are also only a set few people prepared to get out and attempt to fix them.

Craig Machen is one of those inspirational few.

Watching the swell come in on <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TAF">Saturday afternoon</TIMEX3>, Craig’s arms moved quicker and he caught the wave on to Burnie beach.

That feeling of sand touching the bottom of his ski signaled the end of a <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P25D">25-day</TIMEX3> circumnavigation of Tasmania.

A headwind harboured his progress most days and the weather made life tough.

But thinking of his friend and Motor Neurone Disease sufferer Kirk Dicker, Craig pushed on.

His goal was to raise $20,000 for MND but on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> a giant cheque for $43,785 was presented to Mr Dicker. 

Craig identified a cause that needed funding and did something about it.

The admiration of his feat is only matched by the admiration for the people living with MND.

MND is a progressive, terminal neurological disease that can strike anyone.

There is no known cure and no effective treatment. 

<TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EACH">Each day</TIMEX3> in Australia two people die from MND and two more are diagnosed.

People with MND progressively lose the use of their limbs and ability to speak, swallow and breathe, whilst their mind and senses usually remain intact.

Mr Dicker is aware of all this – he knows what is coming and cherishes each moment.

Craig’s paddle and the significant contribution of almost $50,000 by people across the state and probably the nation will go a long way to finding a cure for the debilitating disease. 

With society’s races and faiths seemingly becoming more divisive it is good to know there are still community-minded people ready to pick up the paddle and jump in.

To often in this world people stand on the sidelines but it takes someone courageous and strong to get out and do something about it. 

Well done Craig on behalf of the entire North-West Coast for your initiative and completing that significant achievement in such a short space of time.

And good on the region for getting behind him.

It is what makes us great. 

Remember, you can still donate to Craig’s Circumnavigating Tasmania for MND.
