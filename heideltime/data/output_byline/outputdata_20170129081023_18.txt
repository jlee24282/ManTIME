With an 18-point lead in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2016-Q2">the second quarter</TIMEX3> against Dubuque Wahlert on <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TNI">Saturday night</TIMEX3>, Western Dubuque’s Lindsey Eimers went crashing into the scorer’s table to save a loose ball. 
 
The freshman guard poked the ball ahead to teammate Karlie Fagan, who scored a basket plus the foul to push the lead to 21. The play truly encapsulates everything about the Bobcats’ program this season. 
 
“It really does represent this team,” WD coach Amy Ostwinkle said. “We tell them that every loose ball is ours and that it’s all about heart and how bad you want it. You have to want it more than the other team and that was a perfect example of it. Lindsey sacrificing her body and making a great pass in the transition for a layup. That was just a heads-up play.” 
 
While Western Dubuque may have firepower on offense, it begins with its scrappiness and defense. That was on full display against Wahlert, as the Iowa Class 4A No. 7-ranked Bobcats forced 15 turnovers and held the Golden Eagles to 21 percent shooting from the field in a 66-28 victory at Wahlert High School. 
 
“Each and <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EVERY">every day</TIMEX3> we come to practice and we work hard on defense,” said WD senior guard Morgan Pitz, who scored a game-high 21 points behind four 3-pointers. “We really get down, rotate and help each other. That’s what gets it done.” 
 
Western Dubuque (15-1) won its eighth straight game by executing on the defensive end. The Bobcats are allowing just 33.5 points per game this season and are winning games by an average of 24 points. Their total points allowed on the season (530) ranks in the top 10 in the state for all classes. 
 
“We have really talked to them about getting up in the passing lanes and doing the little things,” Ostwinkle said. “Having weak side rotation and they’re believing in it. Any team would rather play offense but it has to start with defense. They understand that and that’s what’s making the difference <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">right now</TIMEX3>.” 
 
The game got away from Wahlert (4-13) early. Pitz scored in transition, then Peyton Koerperich canned a baseline 3-pointer. Ireland Hill made a basket inside and Pitz grabbed an offensive rebound and scored to give the Bobcats a 16-5 lead at the 2:06 mark of <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2017-Q1">the first quarter</TIMEX3>. 
 
The Bobcats put the game out of reach to open the second with a 12-0 run. Pitz hit a 3, Hill made a bucket in the paint, then Fagan scored off an offensive rebound. Eimers followed with the hustle play and it was smooth sailing for the Bobcats from there. 
 
Krystal Tranel scored six points to lead Wahlert, which shot just 9-for-42 from the field. 
 
“Each and every practice we work,” Pitz said. “We come ready to play and strive to get better <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EACH">each day</TIMEX3>.” 
 
The Bobcats improved to 2-0 against Dubuque teams this season, with an upcoming showdown against Hempstead looming on <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2016-02-11">Feb. 11</TIMEX3> in the regular-season finale. The Mustangs (11-6) upset 5A No. 4 Davenport North on <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>. 
 
“They have a lot of talent and Justin (Smith) does a great job with that program,” Ostwinkle said. “With Megan (Gronau) inside, she’s a force to be reckoned with. We’re going to have to work hard and it’s going to be a great test for us going into regionals. That’s what we need.”
