Justin Wilson scored two power-play goals and Carson Bolduc’s empty-netter ended hopes of a late-game comeback for the Prince George Spruce Kings <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TNI">Saturday night</TIMEX3> in Salmon Arm. 
 
Despite a sparking 36-save performance from goalie Tavin Grant, the Kings fell 3-1 to the Silverbacks and in the process fell further behind the Langley Rivermen in the B.C. Hockey League standings. 
 
The teams were scoreless <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="PT15M">15 minutes</TIMEX3> into the second period when Wilson cashed in a Silverbacks’ power-play chance with Kings defenceman Adam Burnett off for cross-checking. 
 
The Kings evened the count 17:59 into the second, an even-strength goal from captain Brett Mennear, his team-leading 22 nd of the season. But with 7:56 gone in the third period Wilson hooked up with Josh Latta for the gamewinner. 
 
Grant got to the bench with <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="PT70S">70 seconds</TIMEX3> left but Bolduc, the former Prince George Cougar, ended the suspense at 19:17 with his 14 th goal of the season. 
 
The Silverbacks outshot the Kings 38-20. Nic Tallarico improved his record to 7-4-2-0 in goal for Salmon Arm.
