The loss of three major sponsors who donated a combined $50,000 in the past has put the Southern Oregon Music Festival’s future into question. 
 
A fundraising initiative will be launched in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DURATION" value="P2W" mod="APPROX">about two weeks</TIMEX3> to help the festival survive, said Dennis Ramsden, festival board president and executive director. The festival needs money to sign contracts with musicians for the event, which is scheduled to run from <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-09-29">Sept. 29</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-10-01">Oct. 1</TIMEX3> in downtown Medford. 
 
“We need to reach that goal of $50,000 by <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-03-01">March 1</TIMEX3> to continue this festival,” said Ramsden. “It’s got to be sustained. We are looking for new, sustaining sponsors, businesses or individuals.” 
 
Two individuals who died had contributed the bulk of the money, while Providence Medford Medical Center had contributed $10,000. Ramsden declined to identify the individuals. 
 
“These were all loyal donors. They have been with us for years,” said Ramsden. “We were going along fine, and all of a sudden you just get whacked. If anything, we are one of the outstanding festivals in the country.” 
 
Musicians including Tom Rigney and Flambeau, Gator Nation and Bob Draga with Friends have appeared at the event several times. 
 
“The bands are basically on hold <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">right now</TIMEX3>. They are doing everything they can to accommodate us,” said Ramsden. “I can’t get them contracts <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3>. There is a time element.” 
 
Ramsden plans to mail postcards to 5,000 people in the festival’s database as part of the fundraising effort, and a professional fundraiser has volunteered her expertise, he said. 
 
Ramsden said he is optimistic the effort will succeed. 
 
“I’ve been here long enough to know when something happens, the community gets involved,” said Ramsden. 
 
Musician Larry Bernard and others started the event as the Medford Jazz Jubilee in <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="1989-10">October 1989</TIMEX3>, and it has been held <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="SET" value="XXXX">annually</TIMEX3> since. Originally a Dixieland festival, the event <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> encompasses a broad range of music. It was renamed the Medford Jazz Festival in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2009">2009</TIMEX3> and became the Southern Oregon Music Festival in <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2014">2014</TIMEX3>. 
 
<TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2016">Last year</TIMEX3>, the festival sold 1,800 passes for events at five venues <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DURATION" value="P3D" mod="MORE_THAN">over three days</TIMEX3>, offering <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DURATION" value="PT100H">100 hours</TIMEX3> of music from 15 bands. Passes range from single events to the entire festival, and sales were up from <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2016">the previous year</TIMEX3>, Ramsden said, adding that about 60 percent of attendees come from out of town. 
 
About half the festival’s budget comes from pass sales, while donations comprise the other half, said Ramsden. A portion of proceeds is used for educational programs. 
 
Providence has been aligning fulfillment of sponsorship requests more closely with groups that support the organization’s mission of health care, said Gary Walker, director of communications for Providence in Oregon. 
 
Based on a community assessment, groups that prioritize food and meals, access to care and homeless services have been funded. Providence’s decision on funding was made locally, Walker said. 
 
National Public Radio’s eTown <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> gave the festival an eChievement Award for its Leave a Legacy program, which makes used instruments available to students in Jackson and Josephine counties. The program was launched <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2013">four years ago</TIMEX3> and has supplied 200 instruments. 
 
Since its start, the festival has contracted two bands to arrive <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DURATION" value="P1W">a week</TIMEX3> early and give performances in primary and middle schools. <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2016">Last year</TIMEX3>, 15,000 students heard the bands in 30 performances.
