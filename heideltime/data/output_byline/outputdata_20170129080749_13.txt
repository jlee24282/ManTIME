"Her father, Muhammad Firdaus Sazali, 24, on realising that his only child was not around asked his neighbours to assist in the search outside the house, which was inundated about one-metre deep. 
 
"His wife, father, mother-in-law and brother-in-law were at home at the time of the incident," he told reporters here <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3>. 
 
Amran said the girl was reported missing at 7.22pm. 
 
Muhammad Firdaus said his brother-in-law had forgotten to close the house door when he went out to move a boat and that this might have caused the toddler to go out and be swept by the <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3>. 
 
The victim was pronounced dead at the Pekan Hospital at 9.17pm.
