A woman who stole almost £450 worth of beauty products from Debenhams said she did it because she couldn't live on £60 a fortnight in benefits.

Lincoln Magistrates' Court heard Sherree Conlon, of Coleridge Green, Lincoln, went into the Lincoln city centre department store on <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-06">January 6, 2017</TIMEX3> and stole £445 worth of goods

Prosecuting, Jim Clare, said: "She entered the Debenhams store and selected numerous bottles of fragrances concealing them in a bag she had with her.

"She then goes upstairs to the ladies section and conceals more items.

"It appears she's confronted by security and the items are recovered.

"In police interview she said she only gets £60 a fortnight on benefits and doesn't know how she's expected to live on that." In mitigation Mark McNeil said: "I've represented her for <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P8Y" mod="APPROX">about the last eight years</TIMEX3>.

"She's had a lot of difficulties, particularly in the last eight to <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">12 months</TIMEX3>.

"Her children were taken away from her and placed elsewhere.

"She used to be in receipt of an income when she had the children.

He said the 30-year-old found it very difficult to manage her finances and support herself on the £60. He added: "<TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> she seems to be managing her finances better.

"It wasn't linked to drugs or drinking and the issue behind the offending has <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> resolved."

Conlon appeared at Lincoln Magistrates' Court on <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday, January 27</TIMEX3>.

She was given a <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">12 month</TIMEX3> conditional discharge and ordered to pay £1
