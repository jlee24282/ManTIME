Non-league Lincoln City came from behind to knock out Championship leaders, reach the fifth round of the FA Cup for the first time since <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="18">the 19th century</TIMEX3> and ignite celebrations that will be remembered for generations. 
 
Richie Towell seemed to have quashed any chance of such an outcome when he shot Brighton into the lead in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-H1">the first half</TIMEX3> but, as it turned out, that served merely to make Lincoln’s feat more sensational. Alan Power equalised from a penalty in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2016-H2">the second half</TIMEX3> before Fikayo Tomori knocked a cross by Nathan Arnold into his own goal. Theo Robinson crowned a thrilling and deserved victory by scoring a third <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="PT5M">five minutes</TIMEX3> from time.

Many Lincoln fans queued through the night in sub-zero temperatures <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-W04">this week</TIMEX3> to get tickets for their club’s first fourth-round tie for <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P41Y">41 years</TIMEX3>. They and most of the other members of a crowd of 9,469 gathered at Sincil Bank in the hope of bearing witness to something close to a miracle in the ground overlooked by Lincoln Cathedral. The atmosphere at kickoff was rapturous. 
 
Yet once the contest started it became clear that referring to an upset here as a miracle would have been unfair, as there was nothing freakish or lucky about it. Lincoln, 73 places below Brighton in the football pyramid, showed that they had reached this stage because they are a diligent team benefiting from the expert tuition of Danny Cowley, the former PE teacher who gave up his day job <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2016-SU">last summer</TIMEX3> to manage the club full-time. 
 
Cowley’s counterpart, Chris Hughton, may have fielded a weakened team but his reserves have high pedigree and did not play as if they disrespected their lowly but dynamic opponents. Brighton knew from the off that they would have to be on their guard to avoid becoming Lincoln’s latest victim in this, the non-league side’s seventh match of a Cup run that has captivated the city. 
 
Brighton’s plan was to prick the underdog’s enthusiasm <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="FUTURE_REF">as soon as possible</TIMEX3> and Glenn Murray nearly deflated the crowd in the second minute with a close-range header but Paul Farman parried the shot. Lincoln settled quickly after that and began to ruffle their esteemed visitors with sharp, tidy play. Sam Habergham and Terry Hawkridge were particularly menacing when they combined down the left, while the hulking Matt Rhead was a menace in the air and Lincoln’s set-pieces regularly caused problems. Theo Robinson even triggered an explosion of joy when he rifled the ball into the net in the eighth minute but only because the giddy home fans had not noticed that the referee had already blown for offside. 
 
Brighton’s winger Solly <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2016-03">March</TIMEX3> nearly brought more groans – and gasps – from the home fans when he let fly with a swirling shot from 25 yards but it bounced back off the crossbar. There was no reprieve for the hosts in the 23rd minute, when Towell put Brighton in front with a delicious finish, flipping the ball into the net with the outside of his foot after running onto a flick-on from Murray. That went contrary to the script of one fairytale but was, nonetheless, a special moment for a player who, because of injury, has had to endure a long hard luck story since joining Brighton from Dundalk in <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3>. The former Irish young player of the year had not yet featured in the Championship this season so this was a significant goal for him.

Lincoln tried to nullify it immediately and nearly did so thanks to a superb effort by Nathan Arnold. The Brighton goalkeeper Niki Maeneppa had to fling himself across his goal to push the midfielder’s curling shot from 30 yards around the post. 
 
That, however, was as close as Lincoln got to an equaliser in <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2017-H1">the first half</TIMEX3>. They might have fallen further behind before the break if Murray had been able to direct a header on target from six yards. Murray’s travails soon worsened, as <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DURATION" value="PT10M">10 minutes</TIMEX3> into <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2016-H2">the second half</TIMEX3> he gifted Lincoln a chance to equalise: the referee, Andy Madley, penalised the striker for a perceived foul on Theo Robinson. Worse, before play stopped Robinson was outjumped by Maeneppa, who injured himself as he fell to the ground. Brighton had to resort to their substitute goalkeeper, Casper Ankergen, who was sent the wrong way as Power rolled the ball into the net from the spot. Cue joyous songs of praise from the Sincil Bank congregation. 
 
Lincoln’s players, meanwhile, were not satisfied. They pursued glory with a tenacity that unhinged the visitors. Critical evidence of that came within <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DURATION" value="PT5M">five minutes</TIMEX3>, Tomori was so flustered that he turned a wicked cross by Arnold into his own goal from six yards. <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> “We’re going to Wembley” became the home crowd’s hymn. Preposterous, of course. But maybe not completely impossible for Cowley’s admirable team. 
 
Robinson reinforced that thought here by making it 3-1 before the end, finishing smartly from the edge of the box after Brighton had been pestered into losing possession.
