SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. >> The Freihofer’s Saratoga Jazz Festival will celebrate its 40th anniversary <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-06-24">June 24</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-06-25">25</TIMEX3> at the Saratoga Performance Arts Center, headlined by an artist scheduled to perform <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3>. 
 
Chaka Khan will headline the festival, fifth longest-consecutive-running jazz festival in North America. She was originally scheduled to headline last year’s festival but had to pull out due to an illness. 
 
Initially founded as “the Newport Jazz Festival at Saratoga” <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-W03-WE">the weekend</TIMEX3> event was renamed Freihofer’s Saratoga Jazz Festival in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="1998">1998</TIMEX3>. 
 
The <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> Freihofer’s Saratoga Jazz Festival features a major lineup of musicians, ranging from emerging artists making their festival debuts, to the return of two legendary musicians who performed on the inaugural <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="1978">1978</TIMEX3> festival, Dee Dee Bridgewater and Jean Luc-Ponty. 
 
 
<TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2017">This year</TIMEX3> also marks the centennial of the first recorded jazz album and the first commercial use of the word “jazz,” when the Original Dixieland Jazz Band recorded their New Orleans rooted music at Victor Talking Machine. The recording was an instantaneous success, ushering in a new era of popular music, the “Jazz Age.” 
 
“The <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> 40th anniversary Freihofer’s Saratoga Jazz Festival will be an extraordinary tribute to the history of our festival and to the future of jazz music,” said SPAC President and CEO Elizabeth Sobol. “For <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="P4DE">four decades</TIMEX3> our festival has played a critical role as an incubator of the up-and-coming stars of <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2017-01-30">tomorrow</TIMEX3>. Artists like Dee Dee Bridgewater, Jean-Luc Ponty and Jack DeJohnette established Saratoga’s premier place amongst the great American jazz festivals. Likewise, today’s young artists Cory Henry, Jacob Collier, and Cécile McLorin Salvant are the future of jazz. <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION" value="P40Y">Forty years</TIMEX3> from <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3>, we will look back with a sense of the great fortune we have to experience their <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> work on the magnificent SPAC stage.” 
 
Danny Melnick, the festival producer and president of Absolutely Live Entertainment, said the festival “continues to be in a powerful position to honor the musicians who’ve given us the rich legacy of jazz heritage, and to present a new and diverse generation of artists and visionaries who embody a community that’s both a life force for new ideas and social change.”
