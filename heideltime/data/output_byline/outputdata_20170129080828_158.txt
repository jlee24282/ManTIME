As a student at Frostproof High School in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="199">the 1990s</TIMEX3>, Cheryl Flood ventured to the Florida State Fair to show a polled Hereford heifer. 
 
She came home with a ribbon designating her as a champion in showmanship. 
 
When the 113th annual State Fair begins <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-02-09">Feb. 9</TIMEX3> in Tampa, Flood will again be there and will subject herself to a judgment of sorts. 
 
As the event’s executive director, Flood is the person most responsible for providing a satisfying experience for the 400,000 or so expected to attend the <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P11D">11-day</TIMEX3> event. 
 
Flood, 40, was appointed as interim leader of the Florida State Fair <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2016-SP">last spring</TIMEX3> and officially became executive director in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2016-09">September</TIMEX3>. She is the first woman to hold the position, according to State Fair officials. 
 
“It’s exciting,” said Flood, a fifth-generation Floridian. “I think everybody brings different skills and different attributes to the job. I think I may be the youngest (director). I think it’s something I can certainly contribute maybe in taking the fair in a direction it hasn’t been before.” 
 
Flood’s family moved to Frostproof when she was in sixth grade. Her father, the late Alec Fulford, operated a cattle ranch, and the family still owns ranches in Polk and Okeechobee counties. 
 
Flood helped out on the ranch from a young age, and she joined the FFA (formerly known as Future Farmers of America) in seventh grade. She raised and showed steers at the Polk County Youth Fair throughout high school. She also served on committees judging livestock and citrus at the fair. 
 
Flood said her faculty adviser at Frostproof High, Jimmy Smith, encouraged her to exhibit her steers at the State Fair as well. She said she recalls rising at <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="TIME" value="2017-02-09T05:00">5 a.m.</TIMEX3> to groom her animals before going to Tampa and parading her heifer around the ring in the Charlie Lykes Arena. 
 
“It taught me responsibility at a young age,” Flood said. “I had to budget what the costs were for feeding that animal. When it got close to the State Fair, I had to go out and find a buyer.” 
 
Flood said the proceeds from her sale of steers helped her pay her way through the University of Florida, where she earned a degree from the agricultural leadership education program. 
 
Political roles 
 
She soon moved into the realm of politics. In <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="1999">1999</TIMEX3>, Flood became a legislative aide to Paula Dockery, then a state representative from Lakeland. She later worked as an assistant director of legislative affairs at the Florida Department of Agriculture under Commissioner Charles Bronson. 
 
A family crisis prompted Flood to interrupt her career. Her father was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease, and in <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2006">2006</TIMEX3> Flood returned to Polk County to help care for him. 
 
Adam Putnam, then a Congressman, learned of Flood’s situation and hired her to work as district director in his Polk County office. Putnam, a Bartow native, appointed Flood as his director of external affairs when he became Florida’s Commissioner of Agriculture and Consumer Services in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2011">2011</TIMEX3>, <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2011">the same year</TIMEX3> her father died. 
 
In the new role, Flood became involved with overseeing the fair. The Florida State Fair Authority is a quasi-governmental entity that receives no taxpayer money. 
 
The combination of her agriculture background and her connection to Putnam made Flood a natural choice when the position of leader of the State Fair Authority came open. 
 
“She brings a lot of good qualities,” said Doyle Carlton III, chairman of the State Fair Authority’s board of directors. “She’s got high character –— that’s probably the main thing — and she’s got a tremendous work ethic. Cheryl is a very detailed, thorough person, very hard working. I think the staff sees these qualities in her and responds favorably to her leadership style.” 
 
Flood, who is married with a 4-year-old daughter, heads an organization with about 50 full-time employees and many seasonal workers. She <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> lives in Bartow and commutes to her job at the fairgrounds, which cover 300 acres near the junction of Interstate 4 and U.S. 301. 
 
The State Fair Authority stages 200 events throughout the year in addition to the main event. 
 
“It’s a <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DURATION" value="P1D">24-hour</TIMEX3>-<TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="SET" value="P1D" freq="1">a-day</TIMEX3> job,” Flood said. 
 
Expanding on tradition 
 
The State Fair maintains its tradition as a showcase for agricultural displays. The Midway beckons visitors with dozens of rides, such as the Arctic Plunge, Jungle Twist Coaster and Tilt-A-Whirl. 
 
The fair also presents concerts and other entertainment daily. This year’s musical lineup features such country stalwarts as Bobby Bare and Johnny Lee. 
 
Flood said she has worked to diversify the entertainment lineup. Beyond the expected country acts, the free entertainment options include Shalyah Fearing, an R&B singer who competed on the TV show “The Voice,” and Mighty Mongo, a five-piece rock band from St. Petersburg. 
 
In an effort to blend tradition with innovation, Flood has added an emphasis on social media opportunities to the State Fair using the theme “Picture Yourself at the Fair.” The event offers photo snap opportunities, such as decorated hay bales as backdrops, and encourages guests to share their photos on social media. 
 
Among other offbeat additions, this year’s fair offers an interactive, candy-themed exhibit called “Sweets: A Tasty Journey,” that includes a replica of the Mona Lisa created with jellybeans. 
 
“Like any organization, as the years roll by we have to adjust to make sure we are keeping up with the times,” Flood said. “I felt like it’s important to bring something like that (candy exhibit) because it appeals to young kids and appeals to ages all the way up to senior citizens.” 
 
Flood has been bringing her daughter, Alexa, to the fair since the girl was a baby, and she is mindful of presenting a lineup full of attractions for all ages. She said Alexa particularly enjoys the petting zoo and animal displays, and she always insists on a ride down the Dragstrip Fun Slide with Flood’s husband, Edward Flood, an assistant state attorney for the 10th Judicial Circuit in Bartow. 
 
Flood said she expects <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DURATION" value="P1D">one day</TIMEX3> to sit in the Charlie Lykes Arena and watch Alexa show livestock she has raised. 
 
“I hope she’ll be able to <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DURATION" value="P1D">one day</TIMEX3> grow up and show cattle and do the things I enjoyed as a child,” Flood said.
