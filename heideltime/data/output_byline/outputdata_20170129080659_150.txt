I am a retired educator and appreciate and thank you for the <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> articles on District 51 and their students. However, I think it is quite shameful for our local newspaper to give the education articles more precedence than the inauguration of the 45th president of the United States, Donald J. Trump, on <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3>. I looked for an article on the inaugural proceedings in Friday’s paper and found it almost on the bottom of the front page with a headline in much smaller type than the school news. I thought, OK, maybe they are waiting until <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> when they will show a larger picture and include a more impressive article. But I was disappointed again <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29TMO">this morning</TIMEX3>. Same spot, same size photo and a small article. Guess I should have been thankful it was on the front page and not on Page 9A, which had a large photo, a small photo and a big article on the protesters. 
 
While various elected officials have often had big crowds for town hall meetings, the Grand Junction Women’s <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2016-03">March</TIMEX3> crowd of thousands publicly venting multiple issue opinions to an elected official is unprecedented — and entirely worthy as a front page newspaper story. 
 
It was wonderful to see the strong images of the Women’s <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2017-03">March</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2017-W03-WE">last weekend</TIMEX3> in downtown Grand Junction. If I knew there was a planned march, I would have driven in from Montrose to join. Count me in next time. 
 
Thank so much for your coverage of the Women’s <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2017-03">March</TIMEX3>. Not only did it happen here but all over the world. Perfect example of our First Amendment rights. 
 
I’m a little confused. I did not vote for President Trump, but yet he is my president. I did not yell vulgarities, I did not burn a limousine, and I did not march in protest over an imagined loss of rights wearing a “##### hat.” That in itself seems ignorant and self-degrading and has put the women’s movement back to square one. I don’t see how meaningless violence and uninformed protests will bring our country back together. But those are the things The Sentinel chose to give top billing in last Sunday’s paper. Somebody help me. 
 
Thank you, Daily Sentinel, for your great coverage of our local Women’s <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2017-03">March</TIMEX3>. How wonderful to see so many folks, of all ages, gather and walk together to promote tolerance, peace, unity and respect. 
 
Front page photograph from anti-president march mentions Japanese internment camp with no mention that those U.S. citizens were locked up by a Democratic Party president. 
 
Thanks to The Daily Sentinel for its in-depth reporting regarding the Women’s <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2017-03">March</TIMEX3>. I was there to witness the event from the sidelines, and am pleased to say the newspaper article simply reported the facts (not “alternative facts”). During this time when the media is being heavily criticized, it is increasingly important to protect this independent source of information as guaranteed by our Constitution. 
 
Mesa County Commissioner John Justman says “Mesa County voters are conservative” and thinks that’s the only thing that should guide whatever he does in office. But the huge anti-Trump protest <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2017-W03">last week</TIMEX3> showed Mesa County in <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> is far from being monolithic in its political views. There are lots of liberal and progressive residents in Mesa County, and our views count as well. We are tired of local elected representatives completely ignoring our views, as Mr. Justman does. Commissioner Justman needs to start respecting and representing our views as well. 
 
A tax increase is the way to get projects financed. I would be happy to approve an increase for a rec center. We have event centers — the fairgrounds, Avalon, Two Rivers, Las Colonias Park, the Botanical Gardens, James M. Robb Colorado River State Parks. How many do we need? We need a rec center. 
 
We have a hockey rink and an events center. What we need is a rec center. It is a great place for children, youth, adults and senior citizens. I will never vote for anything but a rec center. 
 
If the “city fathers” think a $62 million investment is a great idea, how about spending it on an activities center that every citizen could use and enjoy? 
 
To the jerk who almost killed us <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TNI">last night</TIMEX3>, <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2017-01-20">Jan. 20</TIMEX3>: We were coming home and ready to turn left at 32 Road and  C 1/2. My husband put on the left turn signal, happened to look in the mirror and saw you coming on the left at a very excessive speed, running from a sheriff’s car. A few more seconds and you would have T-boned us and we would probably be dead <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3>. In the future, be a decent human being and face up to whatever you did wrong instead of running away and endangering innocent people. 
 
Oh, my goodness, Steve Beauregard! You have outdone yourself with your “taking turns for the worse” column! Every time I read it, I see something else that just makes me laugh out loud. You know the Grand Valley, you live here and enjoy the valley. Keep up the witty writing. We all need a good laugh <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> and then, eh? 
 
It is unfortunate to read about the dog killing on Orchard Mesa, but not a surprise, assuming the dog owner and Mesa County Animal Services had been made aware of the problem. It is unfortunate people being disturbed by a nuisance dog have to take the law into their own hands. A no-win situation for both parties. 
 
If you call Xcel and give them the location of the burned out streetlight they will replace it. The one on the corner of Pitkin and Fifth strobes at night, which is dangerous for epileptics.
