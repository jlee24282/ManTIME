Abigail Spears played her part at the Australian Open "30-fun" party by winning the mixed doubles title. 
 
The 35-year-old Spears teamed with Colombia's Juan Sebastian Cabal to beat second-seeded Sania Mirza and Ivan Dodig 6-2 6-4 in the final <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3> on Rod Laver Arena. 
 
Spears was striving to win her first Grand Slam title in her farewell year. She plans to retire at the end of this season after a career in which she was twice runner-up in mixed doubles finals with Mexican Santiago Gonzalez at the U.S. Open in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2013">2013</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2014">2014</TIMEX3>. 
 
The triumph by Spears and the 30-year-old Cabal continued the veteran's theme of the championships with all players in the men's and women's singles finals aged 30 or older. Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal were playing for the men's championship <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29TNI">Sunday night</TIMEX3>. 
 
The 35-year-old Serena Williams coined the term "30-fun" after beating her 36-year-old old sister, Venus, in the oldest women's final — in terms of combined ages — in the Open era. 
 
This was only the second Grand Slam event at a team for Spears and Cabal, who lost in the first-round at the French Open <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3>. 
 
Cabal also celebrated his Grand Slam breakthrough, having been runner-up with Argentine Eduardo Schwank in the <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2011">2011</TIMEX3> French Open men's doubles. 
 
He had never advanced beyond the quarterfinals in previous mixed doubles at Melbourne Park. 
 
Spears and Cabal built on a brilliant 4-0 start to grab the opening set and continued to apply pressure with their consistency through the second. 
 
At 4-4 Dodig double-faulted to lose his serve and Cabal stepped up to close out the victory. 
 
It was the fifth Grand Slam event for Mirza and Dodig and their second final as a team. 
 
They were runner-up in the French Open mixed doubles <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3> and Dodig won the men's doubles title with Brazil's Marcelo Melo in Paris in <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3>. 
 
Mirza has three mixed doubles majors, including the <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2009">2009</TIMEX3> Australian Open and <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2012">2012</TIMEX3> French Open with fellow Indian Mahesh Bhupathi and the <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2014">2014</TIMEX3> U.S. Open mixed title with Brazil's Bruno Soares. She also has won three Grand Slam women's doubles titles, including Wimbledon and the U.S. Open in <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3>'s Australian Open with Martina Hingis.
