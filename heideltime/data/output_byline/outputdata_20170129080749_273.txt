Professionals living and working in the city will have the opportunity to earn a master’s degree in social work from Westfield State University at the YWCA Central Massachusetts, 1 Salem Square, Worcester. 
 
The university will begin offering its master’s program in social work at this location in the fall. This represents the only public, accredited MSW program offered in downtown Worcester. 
 
Westfield State chose Worcester because of the strong demand for an affordable, well-established MSW program to be offered in that city. Developing an affordable and accessible MSW option with a community-focused partner provides a valuable resource for the city, the surrounding area and the commonwealth, according to Tricia M. Oliver, director of campus communication at Westfield State. 
 
Classes are held online or in person at the YWCA, Ms. Oliver said. 
 
Applications for the hybrid program are <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> being accepted for fall enrollment. 
 
College Town asked Ms. Oliver if there is a limit for the number of students. 
 
“Enrollment begins in <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2017-FA">fall 2017</TIMEX3> with an anticipated 16 students. We expect the program to develop <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION" value="P3Y" mod="MORE_THAN">over three years</TIMEX3> to a full capacity of 64 students, graduating 24 <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="SET" value="XXXX">annually</TIMEX3> starting <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2020-05">May 2020</TIMEX3>,” she said. 
 
Based on <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3>-<TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2017">17</TIMEX3> tuition and fees, the total cost to complete Westfield State’s traditional, <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DURATION" value="P3Y">three-year</TIMEX3> MSW program is $27,984 and the part-time, <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DURATION" value="P2Y">two-year</TIMEX3> advanced standing program costs $15,688, according to Shelley Tinkham. Westfield State dean of the division of graduate and continuing education.  
 
Among the advantages to the partnership with the YWCA is its connections with area social services and heath care organizations and agencies, which will be helpful to enhance students’ learning, Ms. Tinkham said. 
 
There are some other options in the Worcester area for Central Massachusetts residents pursuing master’s degrees in social work.
