Carlisle Interconnect Technologies (CarlisleIT), in partnership with Associated Air Center, is pleased to announce FAA STC issuance for the first configurable ARINC 791 compliant installation for A320 aircraft with the choice of Ka, Ku or Ka/Ku Tri-Band radomes for SATCOM installations. This flexibility is made possible by using the Sheergardâ„¢ family of universal radomes developed by Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics. CarlisleIT developed the universal installation provisions and executed simultaneous FAA and EASA STC applications, testing, and certification approvals. 
 
The CarlisleIT SATCOM system design and installation kit minimizes time required for installation, provides maximum system configuration flexibility, and helps future proof aircraft for next generation SATCOM system applications.
