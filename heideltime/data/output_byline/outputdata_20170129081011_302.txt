A joint poster with the slogan 'UP ko yeh  saath  pasand  hai' having the pictures of both Rahul and Akhilesh and their respective party symbols will also be released on the occasion. 
 
The alliance is believed to counter the rivals Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) making the contest across the state triangular. 
 
Soon after the alliance was struck, BSP supremo Mayawati got the support of mafia-turned MLA Mukhtar Ansari` party Quami Ekta Dal (QED) to consolidate its Muslim vote bank in some constituencies of eastern districts where the Ansari brothers have their strong influence.
