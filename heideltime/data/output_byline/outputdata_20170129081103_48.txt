WA Nationals leader Brendon Grylls is preparing for a new battle — fighting for cheaper airfares to WA’s far north. 
 
Ahead of Friday’s Nationals State election campaign launch in Bunbury, Mr Grylls said the State Government needed to look seriously at why it cost so much to fly from Perth to northern WA. 
 
Mr Grylls <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">yesterday</TIMEX3> committed $100 million “to a suite of policies aimed at making airfares affordable”. 
 
He said it was time to “throw out the rule book” and investigate new measures, such as putting air routes out to tender or even subsidising air travel to the north.

“There are a whole suite of measures that people talk about, but no one really (wants to do),” he said. 
 
“I think governments just don’t want to go there. 
 
“They stick to talking about trains and buses because people know that. 
 
“The options which have been talked about are either re-regulation, where you regulate all the routes and that gives you greater control over pricing because you take the competition out of it, or chartering planes. 
 
“When people hear the subsidy word they put up the cross. 
 
“But I’m not ruling that out. 
 
“No one bats an eyelid when we subsidise train and bus fares massively in the metropolitan area. 
 
“But when you talk about aviation, which is critical to the north, and the south people say ‘You can’t go down that path’.”

Mr Grylls said he would bring the aviation companies to the table and ask: “What is it going to take?” 
 
“We want to put the options on the table and explore them, with a plan to get an outcome rather than shrug our shoulders and say, ‘That’s how it is, and that’s how it always will be’,” he said. 
 
The move for better access to the north comes after Mr Grylls <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3> began his fight for a controversial $5-a-tonne mining tax. 
 
He said the Nationals, who hold seven Legislative Assembly seats, were targeting Albany, Collie and Bunbury as seats to win.
