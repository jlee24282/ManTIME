German sprinter Nikias Arndt timed his finish perfectly to deny Australian Cameron Meyer a win at the Cadel Evans Great Ocean Road race on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3>. 

Meyer launched an attack with 600 meters left in the 174-kilometer (107-mile) race at Geelong, but he was overtaken on the line. The German Sunweb rider was too quick for Australian Simon Gerrans (Orica-Scott), who finished second, and third-place Meyer. 

On <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>, Dutch Olympian Annamiek van Vleuten sprinted clear of four other lead riders to win the women's event. 

The Orica-Scott rider was leading the Rio de Janeiro Olympics road race in the last 10 kilometers in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2016-08">August</TIMEX3> when she crashed on a descent. Van Vleuten suffered back injuries and a severe concussion, but she soon returned to racing. 

The race <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> had 87 starters from 15 teams and covered 113 kilometers (70 miles). American Ruth Winder was second and Mayuko Hagiwara of Japan third.
