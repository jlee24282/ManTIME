The Medical and Dental Council has closed down Obengfo Hospital at Weija for operating illegally. 
 
According to council, the move is to apply the law to ensure that the hospital, which is a body sculpting centre, stops operating until its CEO, Dr Dominic Obeng-Andoh acquires the necessary license. 
 
The closure on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-01-26">Thursday</TIMEX3> [<TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">January 27</TIMEX3>] is the second in legal action against the facility after the council revoked the license of its CEO, Dr. Obeng-Andoh in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2013">2013</TIMEX3> for operating illegally. 
 
Speaking to Citi News , the Registrar of the Medical and Dental Council, Dr. Eli Atikpui also said his outfit will coordinate with the security agencies in addressing the issue. 
 
“As we speak <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3>, Dr Obeng-Andoh does not hold a valid registration to enable him practice as doctor. The law states that the permanent register expires at the end of the year in which it was issued, and the practitioner is supposed to renew the registration <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="SET" value="P1Y" quant="EACH">each year</TIMEX3> before it expires.” 
 
“The last time he renewed his registration was in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2013">2013</TIMEX3> and he was supposed to renew his registration <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="SET" value="P1Y" quant="EACH">each year</TIMEX3> after it expired by 21 st <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2012-12">December 2012</TIMEX3>. We have made our presentations to the appropriate institutions and we expect the appropriate actions to the taken.” 
 
‘Dr Obeng-Andoh arrested’ 
 
Dr Obeng Andoh was in <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2016-12">December 2016</TIMEX3> arrested over the same issue after the Dental and Medical Council said it had received several complains of medical complications from some persons who had patronized Dr Obeng-Andoh’s body sculpting and plastic surgery services. 
 
According to the council, Dr Obeng-Andoh’s practice was dangerous to the lives of his patients hence moved in to stop his operations. 
 
Following threats by the council to lock up his hospital, the doctor, who had been granted police bail headed to court seeking an injunction on the council’s action but the case was thrown out of court after the judge discovered that his [Dr Obeng-Andoh’s] lawyer was not qualified to initiate the legal process at the time of filing the application.
