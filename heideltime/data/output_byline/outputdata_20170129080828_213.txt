You wouldn't consider it to be world class rugby, and it definitely showed after Kenya Sevens veteran Andrew Amonde had an amateur moment on the tryline.

Amonde busted through Australian youngster Henry Hutchison and was in for all money, until his greediness got the best of him. 
 
Conversions in Sevens are vital, so Amonde attempted to centre the positioning of the try by popping the ball to a teammate. 
 
It was that bad of a pass that the 173m Australian James Stannard was able to stand tall to grab it from the air. 
 
Amonde was lucky he didn't cost them the game.
