The Jefferson County Board of Developmental Disabilities is celebrating the golden anniversary of similar county boards across the state.

STEUBENVILLE –The Jefferson County Board of Developmental Disabilities is joining similar panels across the state in celebrating a special milestone during <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3>. 
  
<TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017">This year</TIMEX3> marks the 50th anniversary of the creation of county boards of developmental disabilities, which were implemented under state law to better serve people with special needs. Plans are under way to recognize the achievement following the theme “Always There,” and JCBDD Superintendent Michael Mehalik said the board has been committed to ensuring that people with developmental disabilities have received quality services and care. 
 
“The primary function of the board is to ensure that residents of the county with developmental disabilities are receiving appropriate services, including early intervention services, preschool and school programs, adult services, residential services and assistance through service and support administration to assist individuals and families make needed connections to other community services,” Mehalik explained. 
 
Known as the 169 board, which is derived from the number of the legislation that established the county panels, the group is charged with overseeing operations of developmental disabilities programs in their respective counties. 
 
Under the Ohio Revised Code, each board is comprised of seven members, five of which are appointed by county commissioners and two which are named by the county probate judge. Qualifications include being a county resident and an American citizen; an individual interested and knowledgeable in the field of developmental disabilities; someone with experience in business management, finance, law, health care, personnel administration or government service; and a person who reflects the composition of the county. 
 
Each member volunteers to serve <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P4Y">four-year</TIMEX3> terms and can participate for a maximum of three terms, while the board meets <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="SET" value="P1Y" freq="10">10 times per year</TIMEX3>. Members are Jim Padden, Lorie Sullivan, Bill Kerr, Jim Morgan, Chris Irvin, Dick Allen and Ed Florak, who <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> replaced longtime member and two-time board president Charles Joyce. 
 
The board <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> reorganized and named Padden as president for <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3>, and approved general plans to operate services for an estimated 350 county residents with special needs. 
 
Mehalik said since its inception, the JCBDD has helped expand services to fulfill the needs of both children and adults, be it through the School of Bright Promise to adult services at the Jeffco Production and Training centers or Shaffer Plaza, or by working with local school districts and community organizations. 
 
“The members of the <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> BDD board are truly committed to the well-being of individuals with disabilities. A number of members have served multiple terms and do an invaluable job in giving direction to the management staff. It is a super board that works hard to benefit the people of the community,” Mehalik said.
