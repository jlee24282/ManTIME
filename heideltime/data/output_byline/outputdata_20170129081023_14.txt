MELBOURNE, Australia — Serena Williams held up a Grand Slam winner’s trophy for the 23rd time, celebrating her unrivalled place in history, and received a congratulatory letter and a pair of custom-made shoes from Michael Jordan, the name most synonymous with No. 23. 
 
Venus Williams got to watch from close range again, and shed tears more of joy than regret after being beaten in a major final for the seventh time by her record-breaking younger sister. 
 
Serena won the all-Williams final, the ninth in Grand Slam history and the second in Australia, 6-4, 6-4, on <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TNI">Saturday night</TIMEX3>. 
 
With her record seventh Australian Open title, Serena moved ahead of Steffi Graf for the most major titles in the Open era. 
 
The Williams sisters are close. They started out playing together in Compton, California, hardly a hotbed for tennis, with their father Richard and mother Oracene as coach and mentor. And they still practice and travel together around the world. 
 
They met for the first time at a major at Melbourne Park in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="1998">1998</TIMEX3> — Venus won that one. In <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2003">2003</TIMEX3>, when the younger of the Williams siblings completed her “Serena Slam” of four consecutive titles, Venus was on the other side of the net. She didn’t reach another Australian final for <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P14Y">14 years</TIMEX3>. 
 
When Serena sat on the court, holding both arms up to celebrate on <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>, Venus walked over to her sister’s side of the net for a hug. 
 
“This was a tough one,” Serena said. “I really would like to take this moment to congratulate Venus, she’s an amazing person — she’s my inspiration. 
 
“There’s no way I would be at 23 without her — there’s no way I would be at one without her. Thank you Venus for inspiring me to be the best player I can be and inspiring me to work hard.” 
 
Asked if it felt awkward to be on the receiving end of so many losses to her sister, the 36-year-old Venus didn’t flinch. 
 
“No, because I guess I’ve been here before,” she said. “I really enjoy seeing the name Williams on the trophy. This is a beautiful thing.” 
 
Venus won the last of her seven majors in <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3> at Wimbledon. She didn’t make the second week of a major for <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="PXY">a few years</TIMEX3> as she came to terms with an energy-sapping illness after being diagnosed with Sjogren’s syndrome in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2011">2011</TIMEX3>. And she only made it back to the semifinals <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3> at Wimbledon. 
 
Another shot at a first Australian Open title was a sign of progress, she said. 
 
“That’s exactly where I want to be standing during these Grand Slams, is on finals day, having an opportunity,” she said. “That’s the highlight of all this, is to be in that moment.” 
 
Serena Williams, meanwhile, enjoyed the fact she made history in Melbourne. Only Margaret Court, with 24, is in front of her in terms of overall Grand Slam singles titles, although the Australian great won 13 of her Grand Slams before the Open era began in <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="1968">1968</TIMEX3>. 
 
“My first Grand Slam started here, and getting to 23 here, but playing Venus, it’s stuff that legends are made of,” Serena said. “I couldn’t have written a better story.” 
 
The match didn’t live up to its classic billing, with nerves and tension causing uncharacteristic mistakes and unforced errors, with four consecutive service breaks before Venus finally held for a 3-2 lead in the first set. That included a game when Serena had game point but served back-to-back double-faults and three in all to give up the break. 
 
There were six service breaks in total. Both players were relatively subdued, except when Serena smashed her racket in the third game. 
 
After the fourth game, however, Serena Williams didn’t face another break point in the <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION" value="PT1H">1-hour</TIMEX3>, <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DURATION" value="PT22M">22-minute</TIMEX3> match. 
 
“Serena Williams, that’s my little sister,” Venus said. “I have been right there with you. Some of them I have lost right there against you. It’s been an awesome thing, your win has always been my win.” 
 
In terms of total years, it was the oldest Grand Slam women’s final in the Open era —the Williams sisters combining for <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DURATION" value="P71Y">71 years</TIMEX3>, <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DURATION" value="P11M">11 months</TIMEX3>.
