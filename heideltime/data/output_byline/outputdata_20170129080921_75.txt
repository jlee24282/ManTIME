SAN FRANCISCO: In <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P1Y" mod="LESS_THAN">less than a year</TIMEX3>, Amazon's combination of the Echo speaker system and the Alexa voice-controlled digital assistant has come close to delivering on the elusive promise of easy-to-use technology that can control gadgets in the home with a few spoken words.Yet Amazon.com Inc's surprise success sets up a long-term battle with Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc's Google for primacy in the connected household. And the contours of that competition are following a classic tech industry dynamic. 
 
Amazon is pursuing an open-systems approach that allows quick development of many features, while Apple is taking a slower route, asserting more control over the technology in order to assure security and ease-of-use. 
 
The strategic importance of the "connected home" niche looms large: Amazon wants a way to own its customer interactions -mainly shopping online - without an Apple phone or a Google Web browser as an intermediary. 
 
Apple needs to keep the iPhone at the center of customers’ lives, and has built a whole home automation architecture, called Homekit, into its smartphone. Google, for its part, is investing heavily in both intelligent assistant software and home-automation devices like the Nest thermostats and, more <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3>, the Google Home speaker. But Google is behind in the race, with its speaker only hitting the market in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-11">November</TIMEX3> and compatible with a handful of gadgets beyond Nest and Dropcam, which the company also owns.
