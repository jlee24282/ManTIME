Colorado Mesa’s women’s basketball team desperately needed a spark <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TEV">Saturday evening</TIMEX3>. 
 
With about 2½ minutes to play in <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2018-Q3">the third quarter</TIMEX3> and the Mavericks trailing South Dakota School of Mines 42-36, Taylor Wagner called on a pair of high-energy players who don’t get a lot of playing time. 
 
Sophomore guard Carson Pipher and freshman post Tori Catlett helped spark CMU’s come-from-behind 59-58 RMAC road victory. 
 
“At that point we were so tired, so tired,” Wagner said. “We needed a lift, a spark. They came in and did that and it was fun to see everything we’ve been teaching, they’ve been paying attention and watching and made plays. I’m so happy for them.” 
 
After Bryanna Adams hit a driving layup in the opening minute of <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2016-Q4">the fourth quarter</TIMEX3> to pull CMU within one point, Catlett tipped a South Dakota Mines pass into Pipher’s hands and after Adams missed a jumper, Catlett grabbed the offensive rebound and scored for a 45-44 lead with 8:41 to play. 
 
“Instant energy. Tori deflected a pass and Carson stole it … they got their opportunity, and we preach it all year long, and they were the epitome of that. They gave us another life out there and we needed it,” Wagner said. 
 
<TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="PT4M">The four-minute</TIMEX3> stretch allowed some starters to get a much-needed breather, and down six, Adams (14 points) and Erin Reichle (6 points) hit back-to-back jumpers and Ma’ata Epenisa went inside for a layup. A pair of free throws by Adams made it a one-point game, and the Mavs ran two straight plays for Epenisa, who leads the RMAC in field goal percentage. 
 
The junior post, who finished with 20 points, scored on both, giving the Mavericks a 59-58 lead with 1:38 to play. 
 
The final seconds were an adventure. 
 
On a CMU inbounds pass at midcourt, a South Dakota Mines player tipped the ball to Taylor Molstad with <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="PT14S">14 seconds</TIMEX3> left. Rohrer missed a 3-pointer, but the rebound went out of bounds off CMU. 
 
Steffeck missed a long jumper with <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DURATION" value="PT2S">2 seconds</TIMEX3> left, giving the Mavericks <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2017-W03-WE">the weekend</TIMEX3> split before Tuesday’s home game against Western State, which was also on the South Dakota swing. 
 
“The good thing is we’re at home the next couple of games,” Wagner said. “That should give us a little more confidence.” 
 
Men 
 
Eimer Lopez followed his own miss for a go-ahead layup with <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DURATION" value="PT43S">43 seconds</TIMEX3> remaining, and CJ Davis made one free throw with <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DURATION" value="PT4S">4 seconds</TIMEX3> to play in the Mavericks’ 63-60 win over the Hardrockers. 
 
“The kids really played hard. A long road trip, obviously, and we’re coming off a tough loss,” CMU coach Andy Shantz said. “Man, they came out with a good attitude like they have all year, more focused on the task at hand.” 
 
Davis, who hit a pair of 3-pointers to break Colorado Mesa’s career record for made 3-pointers with 156, broke the mark with 7:59 to go on a deep 3 for a 47-46 lead. As he was backpedaling down the floor celebrating, he was assessed a technical foul, and South Dakota reclaimed the lead with two free throws. 
 
The Mavericks, who went long stretches in <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2016-H2">the second half</TIMEX3> without scoring, made some tough shots in the final minutes. Tanner Riley (10 points) muscled in a baseline jumper in traffic to cut the Hardrockers’ lead to four, 57-54 and the Mavericks clamped down on defense. 
 
“Our defense <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DURATION" value="PT5M">the last five minutes</TIMEX3> was really good,” Shantz said. “Our kids were aware of who was on the floor and were doubling their post and did a good job on their all-conference post (Konor Kulas, who scored 6 points).” 
 
After a miss on the other end, the Mavericks cleared out the lane for Lopez, who scored on a driving layup and was fouled. 
 
His free throw pulled Mesa (6-15, 5-10 RMAC) within one with 2:49 remaining. 
 
“We wanted to attack off the dribble all night,” Shantz said. “We shot 23 free throws (making 16) to their 10 and that helped quite a bit. 
 
Davis, who led Mesa with 12 points, hit a jumper in the lane and made the bonus for a 59-57 lead, but Jack Fiddler’s 3 gave the ‘Rockers a one-point lead with 1:44 to play. 
 
Davis made one of two free throws with <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DURATION" value="PT4S">four seconds</TIMEX3> left for a 63-60 lead, but Marco Pascolo’s 3 at the buzzer was off the mark. 
 
“We did a good job (defending) and they still got it to the rim,” Shantz said. “The way things have been going, I’m glad it banked off.”
