Hassan Martin's 20 points leads URI past St. Bonaventure

Hassan Martin had his best game since returning from injury, pouring in 20 points, grabbing eight rebounds and blocking four shots to help URI to a 71-59 win over St. Bonaventure on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TAF">Saturday afternoon</TIMEX3>. 

"This was a great win for us <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29TAF">this afternoon</TIMEX3> against a really good, tough-minded, gritty team. We looked hungry <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3>. We looked like a desperate team. If we continue to show up with this type of defensive effort, weâ€™ve got a chance to be very successful down the stretch in these last 10 games," said URI head coach Dan Hurley after the game. 

The win improves the Rams to 5-3 in the A-10 and 13-7 overall, while St. Bonaventure drops to 5-3 in the A-10 and 13-7 overall.
