Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe meets with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump (R) at Trump Tower in Manhattan, New York, U.S., <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2016-11-17">November 17, 2016</TIMEX3>. (Xinhua/Reuters) Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and U.S. President Donald Trump on <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> agreed to hold their first summit meeting in Washington on Feb.10, said Abe here after telephone talks with Trump on <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>. The two leaders made the agreement during their <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="PT42M">42-minute</TIMEX3> long telephone conversation starting from <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28T23:05">11:05 p.m.</TIMEX3> (<TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28T14:05">1405 GMT</TIMEX3>) on <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>, the first such talks since Trump sworn in as 45th U.S. president <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017-W03">last week</TIMEX3>.

Both sides affirmed the importance of Japan-U.S. alliance and exchanged views in economic and security fields, Abe told reporters here after the call.

As for the two leaders' summit talks <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2017-02">next month</TIMEX3>, Abe said he hoped to meaningfully and frankly exchange views with Trump in the fields including bilateral economic and security ties.

The Japanese Prime Minister also said he hope Japan will play its due role as U.S. alliance.

Japan's Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Hagiuda Koichi said after the call that Abe, in <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>'s telephone talk, also explained contribution of Japan's automobile industry to the United States.

The leaders think that the Japan-U.S. economic relationship is important, said Koichi.

However, the two leaders didn't get into any detailed conversations on issues such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and Free Trade Agreement (FTA), said the deputy chief cabinet secretary.

During the telephone talk, Trump stressed that Japan-U.S. alliance is important and Japan is important partner for the United States, said Koichi.

Japan has been eager to repair relations with Trump, as the nation has largely bet its support on Hillary Clinton in the U.S. Presidential election and Trump's win has caught it off guard.

Soon after Trump's victory in the U.S. presidential election, Abe held unofficial talks with the U.S. president-elect in New York in <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2016-11">November last year</TIMEX3>.

Trump on <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2017-01-23">Monday</TIMEX3> signed an executive order to officially withdraw U.S. from the TPP trade deal as part of his efforts to protect American jobs.

The TPP, which Abe has backed enthusiastically, is a free trade pact between 12 Asia-Pacific countries and was formally signed by ministers from these 12 countries in <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2016-02">last February</TIMEX3> after <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DURATION" value="P5Y" mod="MORE_THAN">more than five years</TIMEX3>' negotiation.
