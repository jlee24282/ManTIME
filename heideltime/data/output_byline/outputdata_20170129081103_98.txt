Few victories have come easy for Idaho State this season, so stop wondering why the Bengals are taking wins any way they can get them. 
 
Idaho State grinded out a 57-52 victory <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> against rival Weber State to split the season series at Reed Gym. 
 
“This was a really big game for our morale to win that one,” said Bengals coach Seton Sobolewski, whose team was riding a two-game losing streak. “A lot of different people stepped up and made huge contributions.”

ISU freshman Bianca Thacker was far from perfect – just like her team – but she collected a critical rebound and crucial points down the stretch to cap the close win. 
 
The guard received the ball beyond the arc and used a fast flick of the wrist to guide the ball into the hoop with <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="PT3M" mod="APPROX">about three minutes</TIMEX3> left in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2018-Q4">the fourth quarter</TIMEX3>, giving her team a two-possession lead at 51-47. 
 
But it wase the sole Idaho State field goal in the final period, so Weber State tried to tak advantage, with an opportunity to tie the game at the free-throw line with <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="PT5S">five seconds</TIMEX3> left. When the potential game-tying free throw was missed, Thacker corralled the rebound. Her teammate Saylair Grandon, who had a double-double, chuckled because Thacker inadvertently nudged over Bengal Freya Newton to get the board. 
 
“If it’s in the air, it’s a loose ball,” said Grandon, who had 14 points and 10 rebounds. “So you’ve got to go get it. 
 
Even if it’s against your own teammate,” added a joking Grandon. 
 
After Thacker secured the defensive rebound, the Australia native made two free throws at the other end, increasing Idaho State’s lead to 55-52, which turned out to be enough as Weber State (8-11, 2-6 Big Sky Conference) could not get a clean look at a 3. 
 
The Bengals were 22 of 27 from the free-throw line, a noteworthy stat considering they had a 65.3 free-throw percentage in conference play, ranked 11th in the Big Sky. 
 
To improve that area, the Bengals increased their repetitions at the charity stripe. ISU, which normally shoots free throws <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="PT5M">five minutes</TIMEX3> per day, took them before, during and following each practice for 55 total minutes <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-W04">this week</TIMEX3>. 
 
The Bengals (10-9, 4-4 Big Sky), who play <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-01-26">Thursday</TIMEX3> at Northern Arizona, needed every point they earned in yet another close home game. Reed Gym has been host to four basketball games decided by fewer than six points this season, three of which ISU has won. 
 
The Bengals had to climb into the game to have a shot at defeating the Wildcats, trailing for nearly the first <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="PT13M">13 minutes</TIMEX3> of the matchup and down by as many as seven points. Freshman Estefania Ors triggered a run to put the Bengals ahead, contributing seven points in a 9-0 run to put her team ahead 20-18. 
 
Idaho State created separation in <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2016-Q3">the third quarter</TIMEX3>, outscoring Weber State 14-6 and holding its rival to 12 percent shooting. While the Wildcats tried to charge back, it was behind for the final 15:14 of the game.
