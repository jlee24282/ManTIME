A section of Rajshahi University of Engineering and Technology (RUET) students have been demonstrating by boycotting their classes and examinations for the second consecutive day <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3> demanding cancellation of the “33 credit system” . 

Around 200 students of <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2014">2014</TIMEX3>-<TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2015">15</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3>-<TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2016">16</TIMEX3> sessions resumed their sit-in programme in front of the administrative building <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29T09:00" mod="APPROX">around 9:00am</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3>. 

“The university authorities did not take any step to solve the issue till <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29T12:00">this noon</TIMEX3> as the demand of the students is illogical,” said Md Kamruzzaman, welfare adviser to the RUET students.   

The students went on an indefinite strike <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">yesterday</TIMEX3> and also submitted a memorandum to the university vice-chancellor. 

Earlier on <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2015-08">August 2015</TIMEX3>, students besieged the vice-chancellor's office and organaised a demonstration programme demanding cancellation of the system. 

According to the university sources, a student has to achieve minimum 33 credits out of 40 in the “33 credit system”. If the student fails to do so, he or she will not be allowed to move up to next session and has to retake the whole year. 

Whereas previously, students were allowed to attend classes and examinations of the next session even if they got less than 33 credits. They could obtain the credits by taking examinations later. But the RUET authorities cancelled the system in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2013">2013</TIMEX3>-<TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2014">14</TIMEX3> academic year. 

According to the university sources each course represents three to five credits.
