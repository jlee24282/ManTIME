PARKERSBURG — With reverence for the past, the Wood County Historical and Preservation Society is converting the Phelps-Tavenner House, the oldest residence in the county on an original site, into a research and educational center. 
 
“We have a lot to do,” said Paul Bibbee, a director of the historical society. 
 
Built in <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="1810">1810</TIMEX3>, when the region was the American frontier, the Phelps-Tavenner House was acquired by the historical society in <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3>. Since its construction and up until <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2014">2014</TIMEX3>, the last owners being the Life family, the house at present-day <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2401">2401</TIMEX3> Camden Ave., was used as a residence.  The home is <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> called the Phelps-Tavenner Research Center. 
 
The National Register lists the house as being built circa <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="1810">1810</TIMEX3>, but through lore and other documents “we feel it was probably built prior to <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="1799">1799</TIMEX3> and is the actual place where Wood County was formed,” said Bob Enoch, president of the historical society. 
 
The house had probably been remodeled to some extent over the years and the newspaper ran a story about a major renovation in the <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="1950">1950</TIMEX3>.

The society has been restoring parts of the house, which was the oldest continual residence in use on an original site in Wood County. 
 
The renovations included a <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="195">1950s</TIMEX3>-style kitchen that is part of the history, too, said Dottie Bibbee, Paul Bibbee’s wife and a vice president of the society. 
 
“This is part of the house, too,” she said. 
 
Rooms of the house have been named after its historical residents, including Hugh Phelps and his wife, Hannah, Thomas Tavenner, and sisters Hattie and Lydia. The kitchen is named Hannah’s Kitchen. 
 
The project, with the various aspects being done as it becomes financially feasible, has not been without its exciting moments, Enoch said. 
 
Upon purchase of the home, the society had been told that there was once a spiral, or twisting staircase accessing the second floor, Enoch said.

As Enoch and John Huffman, another director with the historical society, were removing paneling from the main living room, they discovered the original steps were visible against the plastered wall. The area of the wall has been framed to show the original construction, Enoch said. 
 
“You could actually see where the staircase was,” Bibbee said. 
 
Hugh Phelps built the home with the original front facing the Little Kanawha River. Though it was customary for houses to face the river, this perhaps also gave Phelps a better view of the ferry he or his slaves operated to cross the river, Enoch said. 
 
It was a meeting place for the county court and influential residents. Among others who would meet at the home was John Stokely, the first county clerk, who laid out the original settlement preceding the creation of Parkersburg by the daughter and son-in-law of Alexander Parker. 
 
Phelps, a contemporary of Harman Blennerhassett, was a colonel in the 113th Regiment of the Virginia Militia as West Virginia in this period was in Virginia. Phelps was a sheriff and a justice in the county.

His father-in-law was Capt. James Neal, who established Neal’s Station in <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="1785">1785</TIMEX3>, the first permanent settlement in what was to become Wood County in <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="1799">1799</TIMEX3>. 
 
The house also was the first “ordinary” in the county, Bibbee said. An ordinary was the term used <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="18">two centuries ago</TIMEX3> for a bar and the prices charged were set by statute, he said. 
 
The renovation in the home includes a glass-encased portion of an entrance from the kitchen into Thomas’ Room that shows the original brick and the charring of a timber from a fire occurring around the time of the Civil War, Enoch said. The fire stopped at the partition, he said. 
 
“It didn’t go any further into the main portion of the house,” Enoch said. 
 
Much is planned for the home, including a children’s area on the upper floors. In addition to restoring portions of the interior, the society hopes to amass a collection of early children’s items for educational uses and redo the roof, possibly using a composite material that will mimic the original wood shingles, Bibbee said.

Plans also are to landscape the exterior and make it look like a garden from Williamsburg, he said. 
 
The timeline depends on money, he said. The roof will be a major cost, Bibbee said. 
 
“We’re dedicated to getting it done as quick as we can,” he said. 
 
Bibbee believes the house was designed after the home built by Albert Gallatin near Pt. Marion, Pa., a community north of Morgantown. Gallatin was an early American politician and statesman. 
 
The primary function of the house will be as a research center, Diana Hill, secretary of the society, said. A computer is located in Hattie’s Room and research materials are stored in an adjacent area. 
 
The society encourages local residents to provide histories of their families before they are forever lost or forgotten, Dottie Bibbee said. 
 
While the facility is too small for the society’s <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="SET" value="XXXX-XX">monthly</TIMEX3> meetings, it will be available for small groups of up to 25 people, Enoch said.
