U.S. Rep. Rod Blum, R-Iowa, <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-W03">last week</TIMEX3> spoke with the Telegraph Herald about actions taken by new U.S. President Donald J. Trump during his first few days in office. 
 
Blum said the U.S. would see “immediate payback” from a wall separating the U.S. and Mexico, a campaign promise Trump supported through an executive order <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01">this month</TIMEX3>. 
 
Savings would come in the form of decreased spending on law enforcement, welfare, social service and education dollars spent on the estimated 11 million to 12 million unauthorized immigrants living in the U.S., Blum said. 
 
However, undocumented immigrants contribute more in payroll taxes than they will consume in public benefits, according to several state and federal studies. 
 
According to the Social Security Administration, unauthorized immigrants — who are not eligible to receive Social Security benefits — paid $13 billion in payroll taxes in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010">2010</TIMEX3>. They received only about $1 billion in benefit payments, attributable to unauthorized work. 
 
The principal category of unauthorized immigrants who draw Social Security benefits include those who have overstayed visas or obtained Social Security numbers illegally. 
 
Undocumented immigrants also are not eligible for federal benefits such as Social Security, Supplemental Security Income, Medicaid, Medicare and food stamps. Most of these programs require proof of legal immigration status under the <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="1996">1996</TIMEX3> federal welfare law. Even legal immigrants cannot receive these benefits until they have been in the U.S. <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P5Y" mod="MORE_THAN">more than five years</TIMEX3>. 
 
However, undocumented immigrants are eligible for schooling and emergency medical care. Native-born, U.S.-citizen children of immigrants are eligible for public benefits programs. 
 
A <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2013">2013</TIMEX3> Heritage Foundation report found that, on average, households headed by undocumented immigrants in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2010">2010</TIMEX3> received about $24,721 in government services, such as public education, police and fire protection. 
 
But in its <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2013">2013</TIMEX3> “Immigration Myths and Facts” report, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said most economists see providing these benefits as an investment in the future, when these children will become workers and taxpayers. 
 
A <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2013">2013</TIMEX3> Congressional Budget Office analysis of a failed bipartisan immigration reform bill found increasing legal immigration would generate more income and payroll tax revenue than would be spent on Medicaid, health insurance subsidies and other federal benefits. 
 
The CBO estimated the <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2013">2013</TIMEX3> bill would decrease the budget deficit by $180 billion <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="P10Y" mod="MORE_THAN">over 10 years</TIMEX3> and by $990 billion <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="P20Y" mod="MORE_THAN">over 20 years</TIMEX3>. 
 
Yet, Blum argued, “what we’re going to save on welfare program and social services programs and law enforcement will more than pay for” the estimated $12 billion to $15 billion needed to build the wall.
