George Harrison's 'What Is Life' Finally Gets a Music Video (Week in Review)  
 

. 
  
George Harrison's 'What Is Life' Finally Gets a Music Video was a Top 3 story on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-25">Wednesday</TIMEX3>: (Radio.com) When George Harrison released 'What Is Life" from his first solo album post-Beatles -- All Things Must Pass -- in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="1971">1971</TIMEX3>, it went without an accompanying music video because they still weren't a thing musicians normally did at the time. 
 
It's <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017">46 years later</TIMEX3> and the song finally has one to coincide with the comprehensive George Harrison vinyl collection arriving in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-02">February</TIMEX3> to commemorate what would have been his 74th birthday. 
 
'What Is Life" is already and upbeat, feel good song and the new music video is a wonderfully whimsical addition with a dancer moving her way out of her home, through the streets, past a cemetery (frolicking around tombstones never looked so carefree), and finally in the woods where she meets her equally playful dance partner. Watch the delightfully choreographed video - here.
