The raids launched in North Sinai and central Sinai also wounded seven militants, arrested 36 suspected terrorists, detonated five explosive devices and destroyed 28 hiding houses, eight vehicles, four warehouses of explosives and ammunition and two relevant workshops, military spokesman Tamer al-Refaay said in a statement.
