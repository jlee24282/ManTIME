A new route by China Eastern Airlines has been launched on the Eve of Chinese lunar New Year between Australia's Sydney and China's Wuhan. 
 
It will see 21,500 additional passengers per year travelling from China to Australia. 
 
The Wuhan to Sydney route will operate tri-weekly and boost the Australian economy by an expected 86 million Australian dollars (65 million U.S. dollars) per year. 
 
Sydney Airport managing director Kerrie Mather was excited to announce the new route during the Chinese Lunar New Year celebrations, saying it will provide "additional capacity during this peak period for Chinese travelers." 
 
"This new route provides direct access to the most populous city in central China and a major business and transportation hub," Mather said.
