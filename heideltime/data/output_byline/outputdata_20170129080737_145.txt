A Glasgow-based vet says she been left stranded in Costa Rica following US President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown on refugees and visa-holders from seven Muslim-majority countries. 
 
Mr Trump indefinitely blocked all those fleeing Syria and imposed a <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DURATION" value="P90D">90-day</TIMEX3> ban on entry to the US from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. 
 
Hamaseh Tayari, who holds an Iranian passport, was due to fly back to Glasgow, where she works as a vet on <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> following a holiday in Costa Rica, The Guardian reported. 
 
However her flight went via New York and she was not allowed to board because she would need a transit visa and this was revoked. 
 
She told the newspaper: ``This has really shocked me. We just discovered (what Trump did) at the airport when we went to check in. I want people to know that this is not just happening to refugees. I am a graduate and I have a PhD. It has happened to a person who is working and who pays tax.'' 
 
Ms Tayari grew up in Italy and she and her boyfriend are trying to find another way to get home to Glasgow. 
 
One option is to fly to Madrid however this would cost Â£2000 and they would still then have to travel onwards to Scotland. 
 
She said: ``We had been saving for months for this holiday and it will cost me <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P1M">a month</TIMEX3>'s salary just to get home,'' she said. 
 
``I am destroyed. I did not know that I could cry for so long. It feels like the beginning of the end. How this is possible? I am really afraid about what is going on.'' 
 
Mr Trump's order barred all refugees from entering the US for <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P4M">four months</TIMEX3>, and indefinitely halted any from Syria. He said the ban was needed to keep out ''radical Islamic terrorists''. 
 
The president's order immediately suspended a programme that <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3> resettled in the US about 85,000 people displaced by war, political oppression, hunger and religious prejudice. 
 
Scottish politicians have taken to Twitter to express their views on the issue. 
 
Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson tweeted: ``Back from Copeland to read the news of the US ban on migrants from Muslim countries. Both wrong in itself and very worrying for the future.'' 
 
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted: ``Scotland & US have deep friendship built on values. We must all speak up for those values - tolerance, equality & refuge for those in need.'' 
 
She later wrote: ``#WelcometoScotland too'' after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeted: ``To those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada''
