MORRISTOWN - Morristown Medical Center and Overlook Medical Center in Summit, both part of Atlantic Health System, have been recognized with the <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> Distinguished Hospital Award for Clinical Excellence from Healthgrades , a consumer resource for health information. The distinction places each medical center in the top five percent for clinical excellence among more than 4,500 hospitals nationwide. 
   
This is Morristown Medical Center’s seventh consecutive time and Overlook Medical Center’s fourth consecutive time receiving the award. 
   
“Choosing a hospital is one of the most important decisions a family can make, and the Distinguished Hospital Award for Clinical Excellence recognition from Healthgrades is additional confirmation that Atlantic Health System is committed to excellence in quality and safety,” said Trish O’Keefe, president, Morristown Medical Center. 
   
“We are honored to be recognized among this elite group of health care providers,” said Alan Lieber, president of Overlook Medical Center. “Clinical excellence, combined with patient-centered care, is key to the positive experience that Atlantic Health System provides to patients and caregivers.” 
   
“Consumers are doing their research when it comes to selecting the hospital where they receive their care, and high-marks in quality are a valuable differentiator that can set organizations apart,” said Brad Bowman, MD, Chief Medical Officer, Healthgrades. “We commend hospitals that have achieved Healthgrades <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> Distinguished Hospital Award for Clinical Excellence for demonstrating an unwavering commitment to high quality care for their patients.” 
   
From <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2013">2013</TIMEX3> through <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3>, patients treated in hospitals receiving Healthgrades Distinguished Hospital Award for Clinical Excellence had a lower risk of dying (across 19 procedures and conditions where mortality is the clinical outcome), than if they were treated in hospitals that did not achieve this distinction. 
   
During this same period, if all other hospitals performed at the level of Distinguished Hospitals for Clinical Excellence across these 19 procedures and conditions, 160,322 lives could potentially have been saved. 
   
The 258 recipients of the Distinguished Hospital Award for Clinical Excellence™ stand out among the rest for overall clinical excellence across a broad spectrum of care. During the <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> study period covering the years <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2013">2013</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3>, these hospitals showed superior performance in clinical outcomes for patients in the Medicare population across at least 21 of 32 of the most common inpatient conditions and procedures as measured by objective clinical outcomes performance data.
