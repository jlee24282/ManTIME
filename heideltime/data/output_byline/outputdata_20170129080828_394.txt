<TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P9D">Nine days</TIMEX3> into Trump's administration and everyone's losing their sh*t...how much more the whole <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P4Y">four years</TIMEX3> (IF he would still be around in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P4Y">four years</TIMEX3>...)
