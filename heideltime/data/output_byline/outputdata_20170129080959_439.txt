PANAMA CITY BEACH, Fla 
 
In the game of golf some of the most important things are hitting a good drive off the tee. 
 
"I hit it really really far," said 5-year-old, James Anderson. 
 
And putting the ball in the hole. 
 
"Putting the ball in the hole especially when you have a low score," said 11-year-old, Ridah <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2016-09">September</TIMEX3>. 
 
Thanks to avid golfer, Lee Anderson, children all over Bay county are learning the game of golf at an early age with the Break Even Golf Tour. 
 
"I think the youth golf around bay county and maybe the whole united states is really declined. They are on computers and they are sitting on the couch watching TV. So this is a good way for kids who dont like to run and jump to have fun," said Founder of Break Even Golf Tour, Lee Anderson. 
 
This nine hole tournament gives young golfers the chance to grow their game. 
 
"Always stay focused and don't worry about the other person," said Ridah. 
 
And of course have some fun. 
 
"Very happy and excited that oh yes I am doing good," said Ridah. 
 
But at the end of the day, the most important thing is the memories made. 
 
"Going with my papa," said James. 
 
The next Break Even Golf Tour is set for <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2016-02-25">February 25th</TIMEX3> at Holiday Golf Course.
