Be ready to make choices if the standoff between Cable One and KAYU FOX has you considering cutting your cable service. 
 
KAYU FOX, the network carrying <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017">this year</TIMEX3>'s Super Bowl, hasn't aired through Cable One in the Lewiston-Clarkston Valley since <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-01">Jan. 1</TIMEX3> because of a disagreement over retransmission fees. 
 
The following Q&A provides some of the alternatives for receiving network channels, sports, movies and shows. 
 
Q: How can I get network affiliates such as FOX, CBS, ABC, NBC and PBS if I don't have cable? 
 
A: Cable One is distributing free antennas that allow you to capture those channels. They can also be purchased at places like Deranleau's, Walgreens, Shopko, Rite Aid and Walmart, sometimes appearing in the "As Seen On TV" displays. The cost ranges from $12 to $30, but finding one might be tough. Deranleau's has struggled to keep them in stock <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01">this month</TIMEX3>. The down side to antennas is that bad weather can interfere with reception, said Dan Jimenez, sales manager at Deranleau's in Lewiston. 
 
Q: What if I want to watch more than the major networks? 
 
A: First get high-speed internet. Cable One has options starting at about $50 <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P1M">a month</TIMEX3> for the service, but the price can vary depending on how much speed and data you want. Other providers that serve this market include Century Link, Rodeo Internet and First Step Internet. 
 
Subscribe to a service such as Sling TV, Hulu, Netflix or Amazon Prime. Look at the offerings first to find a good match for your tastes. Sling has a 30-plus channel package with ESPN, ESPN2, ESPN3, CNN, Newsy and Bloomberg Television for $20 per month. 
 
Hulu, Netflix and Amazon Prime carry a variety of television shows and movies. Hulu starts at $8 per month for an option that has commercials. It offers <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> season shows from major U.S. networks the day after they run. Netflix is as little as $8 per month and doesn't have commercials. Amazon Prime runs $11 per month and includes other services such as free expedited shipping on Amazon orders. 
 
These services include other features. They have multiple seasons of shows, so you can binge watch something you missed. You may or may not save money depending on which options you pick. One of Cable One's most popular cable packages costs $80 per month. 
 
You could also skip the subscriptions entirely and instead budget for an amount <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="SET" value="P1M" quant="EACH">each month</TIMEX3> to buy movies or shows on digital video discs. 
 
Q: What do I need to get content I purchase from one of those services to appear on my television? 
 
A: First, check the streaming media player in your television. <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DURATION" value="P7Y" mod="APPROX">About seven</TIMEX3> or <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2009">eight years ago</TIMEX3>, most televisions began to be sold with the technology that connects the televisions to the internet, said Bill Steiner, an owner of Steiner Electronics in Lewiston. Gaming devices such as Sony PlayStation, Microsoft Xbox and Nintendo Wii have similar capabilities. 
 
If what you already own doesn't have the applications for the content you have selected, look into a stand alone streaming media player, which can be connected to your television, Steiner said. Some examples are the Amazon Fire TV Stick ($40), Apple TV (about $150) or a Roku (about $100). 
 
Q: What about satellite television? 
 
A: Offerings such as DISH and DIRECTV can cost as little as $40 per month and provide content similar to cable. Keep in mind that weather conditions can occasionally interfere with reception and just like cable, satellite television customers sometimes are cut off from networks. Cable companies and satellite providers both negotiate deals to air major networks and other content.
