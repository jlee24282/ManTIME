Cairo – In Somalia, people are reacting with dismay and warnings that countries could retaliate against the United States’ new immigration and visa policies with restrictive policies of their own. 
 
“I am shocked beyond words. This will mean that my new husband will never be able to join me in the US,” said Fatima Ashkir, a Somali-American woman from Florida who came to Mogadishu to marry her Somali boyfriend. 
 
Others say they are not surprised at President Donald Trump’s executive order imposing a <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DURATION" value="P3M">three-month</TIMEX3> ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Somalia. 
 
“His intentions of hurting rather than to help were clear from the very beginning,” said Ahmed Abdullahi, a university student in Mogadishu. “But you have to know that this will have a serious effect on relations between Americans and the Muslim world. A tit-for-tat response by Muslim countries, in which Americans could be barred from entering countries affected, is likely to be seen.” 
 
In Egypt, Cairo airport officials say five US-bound Iraqi migrants from one family who have been prevented from boarding an EgyptAir flight to New York’s JKF airport would return to Iraq. 
 
They said the five will spend <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TNI">Saturday night</TIMEX3> at Cairo airport and leave for Irbil, capital of Iraq’s Kurdish region, <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29TMO">Sunday morning</TIMEX3>. 
 
They added that the sixth US-bound migrant, a Yemeni national, left the airport to return to Cairo, where he resides. 
 
The officials said Saturday’s action by the airport was the first since President Donald Trump imposed a <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P3M">three-month</TIMEX3> ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. 
 
The officials said the six migrants, escorted by officials from the UN refugee agency, were stopped from boarding the plane after authorities at Cairo airport contacted their counterparts in JFK airport. 
 
The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media.
