     46th NFL Pro Bowl  
When: <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="TIME" value="2017-01-27T19:50">7:50 p.m.</TIMEX3> 
 
Where: Orlando Citrus Bowl, Orlando, Fla. 
 
TV: ESPN. 
 
Radio: WXYT-FM (97.1). 
 
Game notes: No more pair of football legends drafting from a pool of All-Stars. Back to the classic Pro Bowl format we were all used to: the NFC vs.  the AFC. But it's not in Honolulu this time around. The best of the NFL -- or at least those who wanted to play except for players from the Super Bowl teams -- will play <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3> in Orlando. That will including Lions kicker Matt Prater, who tweeted out a video of himself booming a 76-yard field goal in practice on <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>.
