They would eventually call it <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-WI">the winter</TIMEX3> storm of the century. 
 
For those who lived through the nightmarish experience that frigid weekend <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="1977">40 years ago</TIMEX3>, it's small consolation that National Weather Service was initially reluctant to rank it as a blizzard because its high winds had not been sufficiently sustained over an extended period to be listed in that category. 
 
Tell that to those who stayed overnight that <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="1977-01-28">Friday, Jan. 28, 1977</TIMEX3>, at hotels, and motels, on makeshift sofas in their offices, in the sprawling lobby of the Niagara Falls Convention & Civic Center (<TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> the Seneca Niagara Casino), in department stores and at the Salvation Army citadels in the Falls and Lockport, among many other buildings quickly converted to refuge centers for the stranded. 
 
Those impacted by the fierce storm, the heavy drifts that paralyzed all of Niagara County — as well as most Western New York communities — and the freezing temperatures that made it virtually impossible for them to walk or drive anywhere — dealt with the crippling weather in different ways. An elderly man in the convention center lobby, watching a television set provided by the staff, was grumbling that the TV was black-and-whiite and and he preferred color.  
 
The National Weather Service noted the blizzard occurred in <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2017-01-01">the first January</TIMEX3> in <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DURATION" value="P107Y">107 years</TIMEX3> that the temperature was recorded as below freezing <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EVERY">every day</TIMEX3> of the month. The average temperature was 13.8 degrees, the coldest ever. The 38 inches of snow on the ground in <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DURATION" value="P3D">the last three days</TIMEX3> of <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2017-01">January</TIMEX3> broke by four inches the old mark set in <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="1966">1966</TIMEX3>. 
 
The two local radio stations, WJJL and WHLD, with licenses limited to daytime programming, secured permission from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to extend their broadcasting hours as needed.  
 
Radio talk show host Tom Darro of WJJL, called the blizzard the second biggest story of his news career, next to Love Canal. In recalling the storm, he said he had covered a carpet store explosion until the early hours of <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Jan. 27</TIMEX3>, the day the storm began. He had gone straight to the station  to prepare the morning news and the storm hit later that afternoon. He didn't know then that his station would be on the air straight through to the following <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2017-02-01">Wednesday</TIMEX3>.  
 
Both local stations devoted their air-time solely to providing updates on conditions throughout the city and county and helping to coordinate a fleet of four-wheel drive vehicles and volunteer drivers to deliver medicines, food supplies and other essential items to those stranded.  
 
"It was amazing actually," Darro said this <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2017-W03">past week</TIMEX3>. "<TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DURATION" value="PT20M">Twenty minutes</TIMEX3> after we announced we were staying on the air, we had a fleet of four-wheel drive vehicles and snowmobiles."  
 
The volunteers were used mostly to rescue people who were stranded in their cars or to pick up and deliver medications. Darro remembered that a doctor was taken by one of the volunteers to the Grand Island bridge where he delivered a baby. 
 
Amidst the hectic pace to assist those in need, a North End woman called one of the stations to complain that she had asked for large eggs and they had brought her medium. Most listeners, however, were indebted to the broadcast teams for their outstanding public service. 
 
Darro said that Niagara Falls residents had an easier time of it than those in Buffalo, because Mayor Michael C. O'Laughlin had declared a state of emergency in the early afternoon. Buffalo's mayor, Stan Makowski, waited until much later in the day and the newscaster said he believes that late declaration created additional problems for drivers and residents there. 
 
The rule of thumb that day for Niagara residents was if you hadn't headed home by <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="TIME" value="2017-02-01T13:00" mod="APPROX">around 1 p.m.</TIMEX3>, you probably should have decided where you'd spend the night. 
 
Harry Coppock of Lewiston, then a guidance counselor, decided he would drive over to Kenmore-West High School to pick up his paycheck. "On the way back I realized it might be impossible to get across Grand Island, so near the south bridge approach I got off the I-190 and took River Road home," he said, "It took me 1 1/<TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DURATION" value="PT2H">2 hours</TIMEX3>!" 
 
At John's Motor Inn on Main Street, near the entrance to the Rainbow Bridge, one of the storm refuges kept leaving his fourth floor room to ride the hotel elevator to the basement garage. Other guests figured he was trying to start his car, but that didn't make sense in light of the driving ban throughout Niagara and Erie counties. Later, it was revealed the the frequent elevator rider was Chester Hardt, then chairman of the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority, who was using a mobile unit in his car to communicate with the Buffalo Niagara International Airport which the NFTA operates.
