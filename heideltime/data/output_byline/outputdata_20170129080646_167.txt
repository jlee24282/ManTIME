Editor, Casa Grande Dispatch: 
 
Kudos to the personnel at the Arizona City Fire Department. They are well trained, competent and compassionate. 
 
<TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2016-SP">Last spring</TIMEX3> I called 911. Because of their fast response and quick assessment of his condition, they saved my husband's life. 
 
They were also concerned with my driving to the hospital. Our resident go-to guy, Bill Mahan, gave me a ride, called our son in Phoenix and waited until our son arrived. 
 
"Thank you" can't ever be enough for all the help.
