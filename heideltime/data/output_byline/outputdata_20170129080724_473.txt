Fredo and Keef duet on an experimental R&B ballad.  
When Fredo shared his new mixtape Plugged In , he shrugged off the closing track, "Tell Nobody," as an R&B record the two made for kicks while they were high. Apparently, it was never supposed to see the light of day, but upon listening, it's clear that Fredo undersold the record, which is a glossy, fully formed, auto-tune belter that makes for one of the tape's strongest tracks.Â  

A synthesized guitar loop plays over some heavily filtered synths, creating some dreamy textures for Keef and Fredo to add their slippery auto-tuned vocals to. They're certainly holding nothing back as far as their performance is concerned, but their experiments lead to some unconventionally catchy melodies. 

Quotable Lyrics: 

You ain't gotta tell nobody 
What's going on 
Between me and you 
Baby girl I fuck with you 
But I can not fuck with you 
Meet me at the airport 
Baby, I'mma fly you out
