The Swiss says he’s very excited about facing rival Rafael Nadal in a throwback Aussie Open final. Federer said he watched all of Rafa’s semifinal on <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="TIME" value="2017-01-27TNI">Friday night</TIMEX3>, and he felt that it was a beautiful match. “It was an incredible feat by Rafa, and also Grigor—I’d like to point out how great he was, he left everything out there on the court, he showed incredible heart—it was a beautiful match to watch. I didn’t expect myself to sit there for <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="PT5H">five hours</TIMEX3>, but I did and I didn’t miss a beat, and I think it puts me in the right mindset come <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3>.”
