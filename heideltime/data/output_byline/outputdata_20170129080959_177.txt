So much for that shooting slump.

Seven different players connected on 3-pointers and the Boise State men’s basketball team finished with 12 made shots from beyond the arc in an impressive 80-65 road win at Wyoming on <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TEV">Saturday evening</TIMEX3>.

The Broncos had lost three of their past four games entering <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> but bounced back in a big way on the road. Wyoming had been 11-1 at home entering <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>.

Boise State made just 6 of 24 from 3-point range in a loss to Nevada on <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-01-25">Wednesday</TIMEX3> — including just 1 of 12 in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2016-H2">the second half</TIMEX3> — but surpassed that total in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-H1">the first half</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> in Laramie.

The Broncos (13-7, 6-3 Mountain West) finished 12 of 27 from 3-point range for the game. The 12 made 3-pointers was their most in the last four games.

“We need to make 3s to be a good offensive team and when we do we’re a great offensive team,” Boise State coach Leon Rice said during his postgame radio interview on The Bronco Radio Network. “We scored 80 points <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29TNI">tonight</TIMEX3> on the road in a Mountain West game. That’s pretty impressive.”

Wyoming led 14-13 early in <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017-H1">the first half</TIMEX3> before Boise State ripped off a 22-4 run to take a 35-18 lead. The Broncos led by at least 10 points the rest of the game.

James Reid led the Broncos with 16 points while making his first start since <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2016-11">November</TIMEX3>. He was 3 for 4 from 3-point range.

Paris Austin, who came off the bench, had 13 points in <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2017-H1">the first half</TIMEX3> and finished with 15 points on 6 of 8 shooting. Justinian Jessup had nine points on 3 of 5 shooting from downtown and tied a career high with seven rebounds.

All 10 players that saw the floor scored for Boise State on <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> and each of them had at least two rebounds.

“We’ve got a lot of guys that can play <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3>,” Rice said. “I looked out there one time and I had three freshmen out there in a road game in the Mountain West and that defies logic for me.

“That was a team win. That was a team that was connected and played the right way.”

Wyoming was just 3 of 21 from 3-point range after entering the game averaging 8.9 made 3-pointers per game. The Cowboys didn’t hit their first 3 of the game until <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DURATION" value="PT6M" mod="LESS_THAN">less than six minutes</TIMEX3> remained in <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2016-H2">the second half</TIMEX3>.

“We take pride in that,” Rice said. “It shut out a big part of their offense.”

Boise State improved to 4-1 on the road in Mountain West play. It’s the third straight season that the Broncos have won at least four road games in Mountain West play. The Broncos will remain on the road for a <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2017-01-24">Tuesday</TIMEX3> game at Colorado State, which won at San Diego State on <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>. The Rams have won three in a row and nearly beat Boise State in Boise <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2016-12">last month</TIMEX3> before a buzzer-beating 3-pointer from Chandler Hutchison won it for the Broncos.

Boise State and Colorado State are tied for second place in Mountain West at 6-3, one game behind 7-2 Nevada.

Tip off on <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="TIME" value="2017-01-24TNI">Tuesday night</TIMEX3> is scheduled for <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="TIME" value="2017-01-24T19:00">7 p.m.</TIMEX3> and the game will be streamed on ESPN3.
