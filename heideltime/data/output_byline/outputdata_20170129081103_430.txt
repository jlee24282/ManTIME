Antioxidants play an important role as Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) chelating agents and, therefore, the screening for potent antioxidants from natural sources as potential protective agents is of great relevance. The main aim of this study was to obtain antioxidant-enriched fractions from the common seaweed Fucus spiralis and evaluate their activity and efficiency in protecting human cells (MCF-7 cells) on an oxidative stress condition induced by H 2 O 2 . Five fractions, F1–F5, were obtained by reversed-phase vacuum liquid chromatography. F3, F4 and F5 revealed the highest phlorotannin content, also showing the strongest antioxidant effects. The cell death induced by H 2 O 2 was reduced by all fractions following the potency order F4 > F2 > F3 > F5 > F1. Only fraction F4 completely inhibited the H 2 O 2 effect. To understand the possible mechanisms of action of these fractions, the cellular production of H 2 O 2 , the mitochondrial membrane potential and the caspase 9 activity were studied. Fractions F3 and F4 presented the highest reduction on H 2 O 2 cell production. All fractions decreased both caspase-9 activity and cell membrane depolarization (except F1). Taken all together, the edible F. spiralis reveal that they provide protection against oxidative stress induced by H 2 O 2 on the human MCF-7 cellular model, probably acting as upstream blockers of apoptosis.
