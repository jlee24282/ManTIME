George Ezra stayed in a cabin without electricity to work on his new album.

The 'Budapest' hitmaker famously went inter-railing around Europe to seek inspiration for his debut LP 'Wanted On Voyage' and has been on a variety of other adventures in order to shape his next LP, even though his original ideas were quashed.

He said: ''I spent <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2016-01">last January</TIMEX3> in a cottage in Cornwall, writing.

''My first plan had been to travel alone on industrial shipping between London and New York but I was talked out of it - 'The Atlantic, in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01">January</TIMEX3>' - so I went to Cornwall instead.

''Then I did <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P1M">a month</TIMEX3> in Barcelona. I did Airbnb and deliberately stayed with the owner, who I didn't know.

''It was a risk, but she showed me the city.

''Then I did <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P10D">10 days</TIMEX3> in a cabin in Norfolk without any electricity.

''Everyone went, 'No, think about what runs on electricity', but I booked it.

''The shower was outside. You had to wake up at <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="TIME" value="XXXX-XX-XXT06:00">6am</TIMEX3> to get the fire going but there was something amazing about showering in a field.''

And George believes his experiences cut off from friends and family helped to focus his mind more.

He explained: ''I think something happens to your mind when you're away for a prolonged amount of time by yourself.

''You start to see things a little differently. Everything is more intense.''

As a result of his travels, ''turning off'' became a big talking point in the 23-year-old star's new songs.

He told Q magazine: ''One of the main topics on the record is how to get away from everything.

2I know everyone has said it, but <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3> was a really weird year, so I've written songs about turning off.

''I know as part of my job I have to go on to Twitter, it's a free way of connecting but... I know full well if it wasn't part of my job I wouldn't do it. It's suffocating.''
