One of Launceston's most loved and oldest shops is due to close in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-03">March</TIMEX3> having provided generations with school uniforms and residents are sad to see it go. 
 
Opening in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="1993">1993</TIMEX3> as WhizKidz, noe called hazard, it has overcome all the struggles an independent shop might face, two recessions and a spate of foot and mouth disease hitting rural economies, surviving as one of the town's only clothes shops. 
 
Sue and David Issleib have provided students with school uniform for <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P24Y">24 years</TIMEX3> and also hosted charity fashion shows at Launceston College for <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P1DE" mod="MORE_THAN">more than a decade</TIMEX3>, which Sue said acted as a "trial by fire" for new teachers.

Despite looking forward to retirement, Sue said she will miss the shop and watching families grow. 
 
She added: "I've decided to retire after <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P24Y">24 years</TIMEX3> in the shop and <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P30Y">30 years</TIMEX3> in retail. All the time I've been open I've sold Launceston College school uniform. There are people I've dressed in school uniform and <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> their children have started coming in.

"There have been an awful lot of people coming in asking what we are going to do. People are concerned about the future of the shop but are also wishing me well."

Once running four shops - two in Launceston and two in nearby Tavistock - which were trading for <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION" value="P16Y">16 years</TIMEX3>, Sue and Dave have slowly scaled back the business to extend the original shop. Sue has also been involved in organising events and fundraising in the town as a member of the chamber of commerce.

She added: "I will also be resigning from Launceston Chamber of Commerce. I've done a lot for Launceston over the years like raising money and light switch-ons. 
 
"I'm bound to miss all of that but I will still attend events. I'm not planning on going anywhere but I might have some nice holidays.

"I've taken on loads of <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> staff over the years, 57 staff in total and helped them on their way - I could write a book about all the of experiences I've had in the shop.

"I've just been helping people as they have been helping me. A shop is only as good as its customers." 
 
Sue also held fashion shows to raise money for various charities in Launceston College for <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DURATION" value="P13Y">13 years</TIMEX3>, which featured everyone from students to the head teacher. 
 
She added: "It was always held in <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2016-11">November</TIMEX3> and I raised a lot of money for the college – it was sort of like trial by fire for new teachers at the school.

"We had everyone from the lowliest PE student to the head teacher. It was some time ago <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> but we stopped them because it was getting to the stage when my kids had moved on from the school and the fashion shows were getting out of touch." 
 
Sue said that despite having great successes in the shop, she thinks it needs to change to thrive in <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3>'s retail industry. 
 
She added: "I think to make the most of the business someone who comes in would need to keep up with online trends to take it forward.

"I wouldn't be able to do that. I think you can't teach an old dog new tricks. Perhaps someone younger could take it on, not more enthusiastic but with technical know how. We had good times and bad times but we constantly had the support from the local people – we wouldn't be here without them. 
 
"We survived two recessions and foot and mouth which is quite an achievement. I have always said it ebbs and flows in Launceston." 
 
Sue said she hoped an independent clothing retailer would take over the shop when she has left.

She added: "End of <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2016-03">March</TIMEX3> we will be closing. Hopefully we can let people know what will be happening to the shop when I leave soon. It will be sold as a going concern so will hopefully carry on as a clothes shop. The shop has to be independent and it's just about searching for the right person at the moment. We have had some interest but it would be nice to say goodbye and let people know what will happen. 
 
"I made the decision quite quickly and have had to stick with it. I am looking forward to retirement but I will miss watching families grow from two to three to older."
