Over half a million pounds will be used to promote walking and cycling in the East Riding.

It comes as the East Riding of Yorkshire Council has secured a £700,000 fund from the Department For Transport (DFT) following a successful bid.

Funding launched by the DFT in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2016-07">July</TIMEX3> of <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3> made £60 million available to councils in England and Wales to bid for. 

The funding will support the council's 'Get Active East Riding' project, which will run <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P3Y" mod="MORE_THAN">over the next three years</TIMEX3> and will be based in a number of towns in the region, including Bridlington. 

The total cost of the project will cost £1.4 million, with the remaining funding coming from local public and private sector partners.

The aim of the project is to work with schools to increase the number of pupils walking and cycling, thus cutting car journeys from the school run. 

It will also include things like the creation of new bike libraries, providing free or low cost cycle loans in schools and businesses, cycle maintenance events and training to provide a community resource.

Funding will also target road safety initiatives to reduce the number of injuries to vulnerable road users and to help repair and maintain existing footways and cycle routes in busy areas to encourage greater use. 

Councillor Andy Burton is the cabinet portfolio holder for planning, highways and transportation. He said:

“The council’s continued success in winning additional funding for projects has allowed for the improvement of the transport network in spite of the challenging financial times. 

This latest bid will support activities designed to increase the proportion of journeys made on foot or by bike and to improve the safety of those most vulnerable on our roads.”

Speaking in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2016-07">July last year</TIMEX3> when the DFT made the announcement that £60 million of funding would be available for councils to bid for, MP for Scarborough and Whitby Robert Goodwill, who was then the Minister of State for Transport, said:

"Green sustainable transport schemes cut congestion, improve air quality and can make it easier for people to get around more efficiently and effectively.

We are investing over £300 million to support cycling and walking schemes in this parliament, and this new scheme is aimed at kick-starting innovative and sustainable council projects."
