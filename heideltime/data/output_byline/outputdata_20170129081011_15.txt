The Issue: State of the City Addresses 
 
We say: Get involved 
 
On <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-24">Tuesday</TIMEX3>, El Centro will have its State of the City Address held by Mayor Alex Cardenas. He will talk about the accomplishments the city had in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3> and what it hopes to accomplish <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017">this year</TIMEX3>. 
 
Brawley will hold its address in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-02">February</TIMEX3>, then Imperial in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-03">March</TIMEX3> and the rest of the cities in the Imperial Valley will soon follow. 
 
We encourage you to participate in the events. If you look in page A4 of today’s newspaper, you’ll see them listed, so that you can add them to your calendar. 
 
Things are changing in our community, our state and our country and it’s in all of our best interests to get involved in what our elected leaders are doing. 
 
Listen to them first hand as they speak about what they envision for our city and believe us, there’s plenty going on in our community. 
 
In El Centro, the former Brunswick Zone XL bowling alley is reopening soon. In Brawley, the One World Beef processing plant is open and looking to be environmentally conservative. 
 
Calexico just passed a resolution that could bring them marijuana dispensaries and generate the city much-needed revenue. 
 
Every city has something in the works and it’s up to its residents to be involved in the decisions our leaders make. 
 
Attending the State of the City Addresses isn’t enough. You also need to be involved in council meetings as well as the events each city hosts. 
 
The state of California <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-W03">last week</TIMEX3> had its State of the State Address and whether you agree or not with what Gov. Jerry Brown, we need to be up to date on what he intends to do for the state. 
 
When the people stop paying attention to the issues affecting our cities is when our city starts to lose its communication with its residents.
