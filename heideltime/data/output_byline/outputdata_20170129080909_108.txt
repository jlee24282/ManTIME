Ten members were present, with the club welcoming Rita Joyner as a member, bringing a total of 11 in attendance. One member displayed a floral arrangement and four members participated in the plant exchange. 
 
Member Marty Reed presented the program; her topic, “Bloom Where You Are Planted”, "was very interesting". She used garden principles to show how we can facilitate our goals for self growth. She spoke on how we can “weed out” things that can sabotage our growth, such as unproductive worry or guilt or need for control or whatever you feel might not let you reach blooming potential. She used a watering can to show how we should nurture ourselves with truth and goodness and beauty. "It was a very positive program." 
 
After the presentation, refreshments were served and old and new business discussed. 
 
A club outing was planned for members to go the “Blue Willow Tea Room.
