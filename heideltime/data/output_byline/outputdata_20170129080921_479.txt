Even as India's population gets younger, the world is getting greyer and by <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2020">2020</TIMEX3>, the number of people aged <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P60Y">60 years</TIMEX3> and older will outnumber children younger than <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P5Y">five years</TIMEX3>. As people worldwide are living longer, <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3>, for the first time in history, most people can expect to live into their <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="196">sixties</TIMEX3> and beyond. By <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2050">2050</TIMEX3>, the world's population aged <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P60Y">60 years</TIMEX3> and older is expected to total 2 billion, up from 900 million in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3>. Against 125 million people aged <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="P80Y">80 years</TIMEX3> or older at present by <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2050">2050</TIMEX3>, there will be almost this many (120 million) living in China alone, and 434 million people in this age group worldwide, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). By <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2050">2050</TIMEX3>, 80 per cent of all older people will live in low- and middle-income countries. Already, 30 per cent of Japan's population are over 60 years old -- a shift in distribution of a country's population towards older ages â€“ known as population ageing - which has started in high-income countries, it is <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> low- and middle-income countries that are experiencing the greatest change. By the middle of the century many countries for e.g. Chile, China, the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Russian Federation will have a similar proportion of older people to Japan. A longer life brings with it opportunities, not only for older people and their families, but also for societies as a whole. Additional years provide the chance to pursue new activities such as further education, a new career or pursuing a long neglected passion. Older people also contribute in many ways to their families and communities. Yet the extent of these opportunities and contributions depends heavily on one factor: health. According to WHO figures, between <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2050">2050</TIMEX3>, the proportion of the world's population <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DURATION" value="P60Y" mod="MORE_THAN">over 60 years</TIMEX3> will nearly double from 12 per cent to 22 per cent.
