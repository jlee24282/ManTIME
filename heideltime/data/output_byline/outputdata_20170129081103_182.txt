Police Commissioner, Mr. Zanna Ibrahim 
  
The Commissioner of Police, Delta State Command, Ibrahim Zanna, <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">yesterday</TIMEX3>, said many youths in the state are unemployed because non-indigenes have hijacked the available job slots in the state. 
 
The Commissioner, who hosted the new executive of the National Youth Council of Nigeria (NYCN), led by the State Chairman, Comrade Kenneth Okorie at the Police Headquarters, alleged that citizens of other states often claim Delta State origin during recruitment exercise, thereby usurping the few slots allocated to the state.
