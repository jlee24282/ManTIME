It has been reported that Gold Rock is in bad shape and I just wanted to remind Nash County commissioners that Nash County covers 543 square miles. 
 
It has also been reported that they are having meetings <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="SET" value="P1M" freq="2">twice per month</TIMEX3> and even reported they are getting people <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> to come in and generate new businesses to get more money in the area. 
 
The thing I would like to say is they need to stop just letting things go for so long without attention before they actually do what we have elected them to do. 
 
So, Nash County commissioners, you need to remember that Nash County is 543 square miles, and it is not just the comfortable meeting room that you all hold your meetings in. 
 
I think that is the biggest problem. 
 
It is not about Gold Rock being in bad shape because of Rocky Mount. 
 
Gold Rock is in bad shape because of elected people from this area and the Nash County commissioners have neglected it. 
 
They need to do more than just meet.
