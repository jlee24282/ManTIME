A source close to Chaitanya said: "It's going to a very private affair and only the families of the couple and very close friends will be present. Even the venue has been kept a secret as they don't want public to come hoping to catch a glimpse of the couple." 
 
The event will take place at a plush hotel. 
 
Samantha's parents and her close friends from Chennai, where she grew up and studied, will be present. 
 
"Samantha will be wearing a specially designed outfit by Kresha Bajaj. She's really excited about it," the source said. 
 
Chaitanya and Samantha first met on the sets of Gautham Vasudev Menon's Telugu romantic-drama Ye Maaya Chesave  and went on to work together in films such as Autonagar Surya  and Manam .
