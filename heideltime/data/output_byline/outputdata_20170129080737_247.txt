Highlighting the unfair advantages enjoyed by unregulated players and aggregators from the unorganized sector like Airbnb, Bed & Breakfast and Homestays, the Hotel and Restaurant Association of Western India (HRAWI) has announced that it will petition the Governments of its western region, to create a level playing field and bring uniformity in regulations for all hospitality players in the market. 
It has pointed out that while five star hotels pay a substantial amount 38% of the room revenue as direct and indirect taxes, some of the lavish bungalows listed in sites of these illicit hotel aggregators do not pay a single rupee as taxes. Further, over 42 licenses are needed to start and operate an organized sector hotel, while the unregulated sector operates without undergoing any such process. 

“We welcome competition in any and every form, but this kind of disparity is unhealthy for the industry. It is almost as if we are doing our businesses with our hands tied,” says Dilip Datwani, President, HRAWI. “Disruptions are healthy, as it allows customers to enjoy best services at the cheapest rates. But the disruptors cannot be allowed to disrupt and proliferate simply on the basis of avoiding regulations and taxes. <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Today</TIMEX3> a hotel, let’s say charges INR 1500/- for a room, then it has to pay 10% as luxury tax beside other taxes, but a bungalow listed in Airbnb, for over INR 10,000/- <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3>, ends up paying nothing. If nothing else, this is a loss of revenue to the exchequer also.” 

“Clearly the big ticket concerns are the security issues and the loss of revenue to the exchequer. HRAWI <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> compiled a document on how other major cities in the world have dealt with this issue. Some of the findings were revealing. After licenses were made mandatory in Germany, 40% of Berlin’s Airbnb listings disappeared. Amsterdam, meanwhile, banned apartments rented out for <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="P60D" mod="MORE_THAN">more than 60 days</TIMEX3> per year, or to more than four people at a time. It has also allocated $1.1 million to identify apartments that are being offered for short term rentals or don’t have landlords living in them. Barcelona has slapped Airbnb and Homestay $65,000 each for listing apartment without permit,” says Sanjay Sethi, CEO & Managing Director, Chalet Hotels Pvt Ltd (Chalet Hotels owns several Marriott properties in India). 

“In a country like India where tourism is at a nascent stage the unorganized, illicit accommodation could spell doom. The primary problem is that there are no standardisations or categorisations. There have been multiple cases of exaggerated promises, misrepresentations, disagreements and conflicts with guests, hygiene issues and intimidations among others. Because the stays are unregulated, there are no redressal systems in place,” says Datwani. “Hotels are required by law to send details of foreign guests to the police station by submission of a C Form. This is a security requirement from the Ministry of Home Affairs. Homestays are not required to be compliant and the industry fears that this will become the de facto accommodation for those foreigners that seek anonymity from the Police,” he adds. 

HRAWI also questioned the relevance of subjecting hotels to administrative clearances, liquor permits and other licenses while these unorganized accommodations, providing the very same services are exempted. Homestays, functioning just like hotels do, are prevalent even <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3> in a lot of States of India. 

“The hospitality industry without these illicit accommodations in Maharashtra <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3>, can generate almost INR 600 crores per extra night that a foreign tourist stays back, to the Government as foreign exchange earnings, besides being the highest employment generator. Almost all tourist towns across the world have grown on the back of strong hospitality infrastructure and not unregulated homestays. The Government will have to consider, either allowing hotels to operate with the same relaxations as would be given to these aggregators and such unregulated homestays as they are not treated equally, there can’t be a first among equals,” concludes Kamlesh Barot, Past President, Federation of Hotel and Restaurant Associations of India (FHRAI).
