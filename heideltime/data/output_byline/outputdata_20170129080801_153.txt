Mumbai: Shah Rukh Khan and Hrithik Roshan had been headed for the biggest clash in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent years</TIMEX3>, eclipsing the 'Rustom'-'Mohenjo Daro' and 'Ae Dil Hai Mushkil'-'Shivaay' clashes from <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3>. 
 
'Raees' and 'Kaabil' have been in the news for most parts of <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P2M">the last two months</TIMEX3>, owing to the clash, that most trade pundits believed was avoidable, and an eleventh hour flip from the exhibitor's side to give the SRK starrer a 60:40 advantage over 'Kaabil,' allegedly owing to industrial monopoly and bullying. 
 
'Raees,' expectedly had taken a bumper opening at the box-office, grossing approximately 21 crores, as against Kaabil's 8 crore approximate gross. 
 
The graph has been steady for the Rahul Dholakia directorial, despite of a high-profile clash. 'Kaabil' itself has seen a steady escalation in collections courtesy excellent word of mouth and critical reviews, 'Raees' has clearly been the winner. 
 
And the 4th day collections of the two films has only established this fact. 
 
According to boxofficeindia.com, while 'Raees,' earned a commendable 15.50 crore rupees (approx.), Kaabil manged a decent 10.75 crore rupees (approx.). This has taken the tally of 'Raaes' to a mammoth 75 crore nett., as against 'Kaabil's 41.75 crore nett., thereby giving the former a near 34 crore rupees lead. 
 
While industry was expecting a surprise overture from 'Kaabil,' as had been seen during the 'Bajirao Mastani'-'Dilwale' clash when the former gradually overtook the latter's gargantuan domestic opening domestically, it hasn't been the case. 
 
'Kaabil' needs to stay extremely steady in the <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="FUTURE_REF">coming week</TIMEX3> on working days to recover its cost, but the clash by <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> has its sure-shot winner.
