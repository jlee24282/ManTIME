Can you guess what the largest minority group is composed of in America? 
 
Is the country’s largest minority a race? 
 
No. It is the disabled. 
 
The reason it’s so big is the disability club is all-inclusive, allowing anyone to join and at any given time. 
 
As the country’s largest minority, comprising about 56.7 million people, the disabled population is highly underrepresented and underserved. 
 
Greeley is the hub in all of Weld County for aging populations and peoples with disability. 
 
In fact, the United States Census taken in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2010">2010</TIMEX3> found 8.2 percent of people in Greeley’s catchment area younger than age 65 identified as being disabled while 10.7 percent of people older than age 65 identified that way. 
 
This totals up to 18.9 percent of the entire population of Greeley in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010">2010</TIMEX3>. Roughly one in five people represent this minority. 
 
Being aging and disabled — even after some great laws have been passed — still segregates us. Many members of this club, including me, saw the disparity and deprivation of our population, and we sought for better understanding. Thus, we created the Weld Advocacy Network on Disability. 
 
WAND seeks answers for affordable and accessible housing and needs our help. 
 
WAND has been serving the disabled population for <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P14Y">14 years</TIMEX3> and has always been a place for anyone who’s interested in helping the disabled or has a disability themselves. 
 
WAND was created for many purposes.  First off, it was made to create interaction among all community members and to have a place for all community members to voice public concern. 
 
In the past, WAND has taken on some tough issues. One such instance is when it dealt with the public transit system. Working with a few key members who foresee safety, accessibility and efficiency, a panel was created and it continues these efforts. 
 
<TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> a new direction arises. 
 
WAND is well aware our housing situation is in despair. Many consumers show up in hopes of finding housing, yet they are dismayed to find a lack of resources or outrageous prices. 
 
We seek answers, understanding, data and input from others. 
 
If you know someone or are someone who has a disability, or even if you’re simply just interested in helping the cause, please come to our <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="SET" value="XXXX-XX">monthly</TIMEX3> WAND meeting. Your input is highly valuable in making changes. 
 
The meeting Takes Place the fourth <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-01-26">Thursday</TIMEX3> of <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="SET" value="P1M" quant="EACH">each month</TIMEX3> from noon to <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="TIME" value="2017-01-26T13:30">1:30 p.m.</TIMEX3> at Connections for Independent Living, <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="1331">1331</TIMEX3> 8th Ave. in Greeley. Snacks are provided. 
 
Receiving help from the people at connections for independent living 
 
The reason Connections for Independent Living exists is to help those with disabilities in Northern Colorado. 
 
It is located at <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="1331">1331</TIMEX3> 8th Ave. in Greeley. 
 
It not only helps Weld County residents, but residents of Morgan, Logan, Washington, Sedgwick, Yuma and Phillips counties, as well. 
 
One of the magical and inspiring promises it brings is a consumer-driven philosophy led by executive director Patricia Ziegler and all of the employees at Connections. 
 
This nonprofit strives to bring equal access and opportunities for disabled in housing, healthcare, transportation and education along with its core services of independent living skills training, information and referral, peer support, and self/system advocacy.
