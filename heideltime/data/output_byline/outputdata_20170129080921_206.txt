In a new interview [while promoting the fourth season of Pretty Little Liars], Shay discusses her transition into the limelight, explaining, "It's still really crazy. I walk down the street in Yorkville [in Toronto] and the restaurant/bar where I used to do bottle service -- I remember it, I see myself hustling on that little patio. It's really cool to then come back here and see my cover [of Elle Canada]. It's just really cool and it's been such a blessing from the show to get to do all these things that I'm doing and have all these experiences. It's really fun."
