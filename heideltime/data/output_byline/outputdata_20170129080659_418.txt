Dozens of curry lovers are to share a £400,000 payout after horrific food poisoning . 
 
They were among 400 people hit by diarrhoea, abdominal pain, vomiting and other problems following a charity spice festival. 
 
About 50 who took part in a group action against the organisers are to receive settlements ranging from £1,200 to £29,000. Raw curry leaves used in chutney were contaminated by several bacteria which led to 29 confirmed cases of salmonella , an investigation by Public Health England and Newcastle City Council found. 
 
Kerry Smith, 36, still has ­problems <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P3Y" mod="MORE_THAN">more than three years</TIMEX3> after attending Newcastle Street Festival in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2013">2013</TIMEX3>. Kelly, from Wallsend, Tyne and Wear, has received a five-figure sum. She said: “I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy. The first few days were­ ­horrendous and I was off work for <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P2W">two weeks</TIMEX3>. You don’t expect it from curry leaves.” 

 
Amandeep Dhillon of lawyers Irwin Mitchell, who led the action, said: “It is very concerning that some attendees are still suffering.” 

 
Festival organisers Bob and Neeta Arora said: “We are pleased that the matter has <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> been settled with our insurers and that they themselves are pursuing a claim against the suppliers of the curry leaves.”
