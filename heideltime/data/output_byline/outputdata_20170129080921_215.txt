The future of the Wellington Sevens could be known within <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-02">the next month</TIMEX3>, after <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P1WE">a weekend</TIMEX3> of disappointment at Westpac Stadium. 
 
The host team, and defending champions, were beaten into sixth place on <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3>, as only about 10,000 people <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EACH">each day</TIMEX3> turned up for what used to be Wellington's biggest party. 
 
Sevens general manager Steve Dunbar admitted the crowd numbers were "disappointing", and believed a decision over the tournament's future would be made soon. 
   
Sevens general manager Steve Dunbar believes the future of the Wellington event could become clear within the next <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="P3W">three</TIMEX3> or <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="P4W">four weeks</TIMEX3>. 
   
"I think we would have a pretty good sense within the next <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P3W">three</TIMEX3> or <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P4W">four weeks</TIMEX3>, I would've thought." 
 
  
   
   
   
   
   
   
    
   
 
Westpac Stadium chief executive Shane Harmon said the tournament was successful at an operational level, but "the elephant in the room [was] that there [were] not enough people. 
   
A crying shame: Sevens fans at the Westpac Stadium on <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3> could be the last to see the event held in Wellington. 
   
"There's going to be no knee-jerk reactions made and New Zealand Rugby has already said they'll do a review <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="PXW" mod="MORE_THAN">over the next couple of weeks</TIMEX3>, but it is fairly clear that, if what we see out there <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3> is going to be the future, well, it does clearly call the event into question. 
 
"I'm pretty pragmatic about it. You know, it's the time of the year, where we look at it purely as a business, there's a lot of events around.  
 
"But it's been such an iconic Wellington event, we still want to hold it and, if we can turn it around, we'd like to be part of that." 
   
Westpac Stadium chief executive Shane Harmon said the tournament went well from an operational perspective, but poor crowd numbers were a worry for organisers. 
   
New Zealand Rugby executive member Nigel Cass will host a conference call with media on <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="TIME" value="2017-01-23TMO">Monday morning</TIMEX3> to outline the parameters of its looming review of the tournament. 
   
However, Dunbar insisted the process was "standard practice". "We go through a review with all the Wellington stakeholders, the council, with the economic development agency, with the stadium, with Wellington Rugby, who are our partner in the tournament. 
 
"We'll look at the things that went well, we'll look at the things that we could be improving on and go from there." 
 
TWO MORE YEARS? 
 
New Zealand Rugby still has <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DURATION" value="P2Y">two years</TIMEX3> left of a <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DURATION" value="P3Y">three-year</TIMEX3> licence with World Rugby to host the sevens, but Dunbar said it was possible the tournament could be moved to another New Zealand centre. 
 
"World Rugby own the series, they give hosting rights to New Zealand Rugby. New Zealand Rugby, then, make recommendations about what city their tournament is held in. 
 
"At the end of the day, it's [World Rugby's] decision. They will decide, but things need to work well for them, and their measures are broadcast viewership and sponsorship. 
 
"It needs to work well for New Zealand Rugby. We have different financial risks, and it needs to work well for the city as well. 
 
ROOM FOR OPTIMISM? 
 
"We will get together with the key Wellington stakeholders within <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DURATION" value="P2W">the next two weeks</TIMEX3>. We'll have to have a chat to World Rugby, we'll have to start to mop up the numbers, and that can take a while, as you'd imagine for a tournament of this size." 
 
Comment was sought from World Rugby, but Stuff was told nobody was available. 
 
Harmon, however, remained an optimist. "I still think there's a future for sevens in Wellington. 
 
"The question is, is there enough interest in sevens rugby in New Zealand? That's the one [thing] we have got to explore."
