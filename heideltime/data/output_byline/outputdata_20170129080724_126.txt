The results of numerical and experimental investigation of trapezoidal cantilevers with irregular cross-sections are presented in this paper. Modifications of the cross-section were made in order to increase strain and improve its distribution in the piezo ceramic layer of a cantilever. The proposed modifications allowed improving the energy conversion coefficient and increasing the power density. The numerical investigation revealed that modifications have a positive influence on strain and its distribution characteristics. Moreover, the electrical characteristics of piezoelectric cantilevers were investigated by employing a numerical model. The analysis of the results revealed that modifications of the cross-section have positively affected the electrical outputs of the cantilevers. The results of the numerical investigation were validated by experimental investigation. Experimental investigation showed that output voltage density was increased by 9.9%, output <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> density by 6.9% and power density by more than three-times compared with a conventional cantilever.
