The Republican victory in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2016-11">November</TIMEX3> has changed the rules for getting things done in Washington, D.C. 
 
Perhaps surprising to some, this could work to the benefit of both Republicans and Democrats on one issue of importance to the Midland Empire. 
 
The four-state region is heavily dependent on Kansas City International Airport. This is why both the flying public and many civic leaders have challenged a proposed massive overhaul of the airport that would make needed improvements but also potentially jeopardize the airport’s prized convenience to air travelers. 
 
This $1.2 billion project stalled <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3> after surveys showed a strong majority of Kansas City voters opposed a plan for demolishing the existing terminals and building a larger, single-terminal hub. That plan would require voter approval, new investments from airlines and new user fees from KCI customers from the region. 
 
<TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> word comes that proponents of an airport overhaul have wised up to political realities. The Kansas City Star reports backers realize they need to do more to win the support of Republican U.S. Rep. Sam Graves, an ardent critic, who has <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P16Y">16 years</TIMEX3> of seniority in the House and holds seats on important transportation infrastructure and aviation committees. 
 
Graves hails from Tarkio, in far Northwest Missouri, but his district encompasses much of Kansas City. The Star news report suggests boosters of an airport overhaul made a strategic error: 
 
“Graves was cast by airport supporters as a pest rather than someone whose support could help swing public opinion and federal influence in the airport’s favor.” 
 
Apparently a new view has taken hold <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="PXM" mod="MORE_THAN">over the last several months</TIMEX3>. It was affirmed after the election and when it became known KCI could be a candidate for federal funding under President Trump’s proposals for a massive program to replace aging infrastructure. 
 
You would have to think that money would be welcomed — and heavily dependent on Graves’ recommendation. 
 
This is where the tide may turn in favor of the public. Graves’ spokesman told The Star he “isn’t against reasonable renovations at KCI, but in his mind, he needs there to be public buy-in for that to happen.” 
 
The spokesman adds: “The way to do that is for the city to start the process over, be more transparent with the public from the get-go, and consider every option.” 
 
Graves is in sync with his constituents on this important issue. It remains to be seen whether boosters of a big airport overhaul are prepared to take a step back, invite the public fully into the process and consider a wider range of options.
