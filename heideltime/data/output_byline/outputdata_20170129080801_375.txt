Paths to Mesa Verde public meeting: <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-01-31">Jan. 31</TIMEX3>, from <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="TIME" value="2017-01-31T18:00">6 p.m.</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="TIME" value="2017-01-31T20:00">8 p.m.</TIMEX3> at the Cortez Recreation Center. Community input is sought on a proposed multi-use pathway between Mancos and Cortez. The trail would provide a safe, alternative transportation route along the U.S. 160 corridor to connect Mesa Verde National Park, the BLM Phil’s World trails system, the Southwest Colorado Community College, and the Montezuma County Fairgrounds. 

There will be an opportunity to view a short presentation, ask questions, and give input on possible trail routes through hands on mapping. This is your best opportunity to provide input on the proposed trail in order to help steer its direction.
