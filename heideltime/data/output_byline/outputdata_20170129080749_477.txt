FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
 
PHILADELPHIA –  <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Jan. 27, 2017</TIMEX3> –   Penny Arcade , host to one of the internet’s largest gaming communities, and ReedPOP , the world’s leading producer of pop culture events, announced PAX Unplugged, its first tabletop gaming focused event, in front of tens of thousands of attendees <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3> at PAX South .

PAX Unplugged will take all the elements that have drawn millions of gamers to PAX – the chance to play and see the reveal of highly-anticipated upcoming games, attend game-inspired music concerts, participate in tournaments and watch panels with industry leaders – but with a renewed focus on fostering the best event for the burgeoning tabletop gaming community. 
 
PAX Unplugged will be a destination for attendees to share their common passions and socialize over board, card and other tabletop games, which have experienced a renaissance in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent years</TIMEX3>. Penny Arcade and ReedPOP are happy to embrace the thriving tabletop scene and provide those around it with a welcoming atmosphere to take this resurgence to even greater heights. 
 
"With the rise of popularity of board games, we wanted to provide a dedicated space where fans can come together,” said Jerry Holkins, co-founder, Penny Arcade. “We will continue to have tabletop games at every PAX, but Unplugged will focus on stepping away from the TV, monitor and phone to foster face-to-face multiplayer experiences.” 
 
Badges for PAX Unplugged will go on sale <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2017-SP">this Spring</TIMEX3>. 
 
Working journalists as well as YouTube and Twitch content creators who are interested in attending PAX Unplugged to create coverage of the event and its exhibitors can register for a media pass in <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2017-SP">the Spring</TIMEX3>.
