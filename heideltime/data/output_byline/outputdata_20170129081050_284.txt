Four Cameron University freshmen will vie for the title of Miss Black CU during the <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> Dr. Valree Wynn Miss Black CU pageant. 
 
The contestants will compete in five public segmentsÂ  fitness wear, talent, ambassadorial wear, evening gown and on-stage question. The pageant will also feature multiple live entertainers. 
 
According to Jalyn Yarbrough, pageant director, this is the first year that she knows of for the pageant to have all freshmen contestants. 
 
"I think it's exciting," Yarbrough said. "It gives them an opportunity to really get the feel of what Cameron is. I definitely feel like the Miss Black CU pageant is a part of Cameron's social life and their experience." 
 
This is the first year for Yarbrough to direct the Miss Black CU pageant. She competed in the pageant in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2014">2014</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3> before graduating from the university in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3>. 
 
"I'm just so blessed that I got this opportunity to be the director," Yarbrough said, "so that I can carry on that legacy of <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P38Y">38 years</TIMEX3> and just keep it going." 
 
The winner will be chosen by a combined score of the five public segments and a private interview with the five judges. <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017">This year</TIMEX3>'s winner will succeed <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3> Miss Black CU Sarae Simpson and will receive roughly $1,200 worth of financial assistance from the university's Black Student Association. Yarbrough said Miss Black CU is a face and public figure of the university and the Black Student Association. 
 
The duties of Miss Black CU also include being involved in the community, on campus and off, and supporting her platform and educating the public on her platform. Platforms explored by <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2017">this year</TIMEX3>'s contestants are "Raising Breast Cancer Awareness"; "Raising Awareness of Single Parent Stereotypes"; "Suicide Prevention"; and "Beautifully Different with a Loud Voice." 
 
The talent portion will consist of singing, praise dancing, lyrical dance and painting. Yarbrough believes the talent portion allows the judges and audience to see a more personal side of the contestants. 
 
"Because they're coming from their heart and their mind and their creativity and just kind of being raw with you and showing what they can do and what they're passionate for," Yarbrough said. 
 
New <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017">this year</TIMEX3> for Miss Black CU is that the winning contestant will have the chance to compete in Miss Black America Coed.
