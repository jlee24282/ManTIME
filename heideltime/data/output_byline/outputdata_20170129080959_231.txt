Mired in another of their oddly ineffective starts, Davis’ boys did what all offensively potent teams do. 
   
They shot their way out of it. 
   
The Pirates not only trailed after <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-Q1">the first quarter</TIMEX3> for the third straight game, but they committed 10 turnovers in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-H1">the first half</TIMEX3> of Saturday’s CBBN clash with West Valley and found themselves sputtering to a 23-19 deficit at halftime on their home floor. 
   
“I guess you might call it our little glitch in the system,” said Davis coach Eli Juarez. “We told the kids, ‘Look, if you want to be an elite team you can’t wait. We had some energy at the start <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29TNI">tonight</TIMEX3> but we didn’t hold it, then we started turning the ball over. At halftime we got back to the plan — go inside out.” 
   
And that did the trick. 
   
The seventh-ranked Pirates erupted for 27 points in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2016-Q3">the third quarter</TIMEX3>, hitting 11 of 16 shots with four 3-pointers, and built a 16-point lead in the final period en route to a 60-51 victory. 
   
With leading scorers Collin Kelley and Alexzander Delgado limited to single digits, a pair of sophomores came forward to supply the offense. 
   
Ivory Kimble came off the bench to score 13 points on 6-for-6 shooting to go with his seven rebounds — both team highs — and Brock Williams hit two of his four 3-pointers in the big <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2016-Q3">third quarter</TIMEX3> for a season-high 12 points. 
   
In the first meeting at West Valley <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-W01">three weeks ago</TIMEX3>, Davis dominated inside with its height advantage as 6-foot-5 Aaron Meza broke out for a career-best 22 points. But Meza was slowed some by a sore back on <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> and he and interior teammate Michael Gordon picked up some early fouls, limiting what the Pirates wanted to do inside. 
   
Enter Kimble. 
   
Known mostly for his rebounding, the 6-1 sophomore typically spells either of the senior bigs and he made the most of his chances <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>. 
   
“I’m mostly a rebounding guy. The coaches always tell me there’s more to being productive than just points,” Kimble said. “But <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29TNI">tonight</TIMEX3> we needed some scoring and it was my time to step up. We had a lot more energy in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2016-H2">the second half</TIMEX3>. We were just a lot better as a team.” 
   
After managing just eight field goals in <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2017-H1">the first half</TIMEX3>, the Pirates doubled that in the first 5:45 of <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2016-Q3">the third quarter</TIMEX3>. They made six of their first seven shots with three treys and then added a 12-2 run later in the period. 
   
“We went back to working inside out and we passed much better,” Juarez said of the third-period burst. “We got the ball inside, we kicked it out, hit some shots and penetrated better. It was nice to see Ivory and Brock play well and that’s what we tell them — contributions can come from anyone. Those kids really held their own <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29TNI">tonight</TIMEX3>.” 
   
West Valley also held its own, too, considering the Rams were without injured senior David Lindgren and his 16-point scoring average. 
   
Justin Van De Brake scored a game-high 22 points, taking his career total to 996, Dallin Cluff had 13 points and five rebounds, and Spencer Bailey netted 10 points. 
   
Davis (8-1, 14-3) owns a one-game lead over Moses Lake with three games left. The Pirates’ only game <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2017-W05">next week</TIMEX3> is a visit to Eisenhower on <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3>. 
   
West Valley (5-5, 12-6) has just two games left and both are at home — Moses Lake on <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3> and Eisenhower on <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2017-02-07">Feb. 7</TIMEX3>.
