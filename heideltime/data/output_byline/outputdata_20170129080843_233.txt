LOS ANGELES – The heavy lifting was done in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2016-12">December</TIMEX3> when the Dodgers were able to re-sign in-house free agents Kenley Jansen, Justin Turner and Rich Hill. Just this <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-W03">past week</TIMEX3>, the Dodgers front office concluded their <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-WI">winter</TIMEX3>-long search for a second baseman when they traded for Logan Forsythe.

That leaves just one thing to worry about – and it’s the same thing Dodgers president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman says always worries him.

“I don’t think you ever get to a place with the bullpen where you feel like you’re done,” Friedman said <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> at Dodger Stadium. “It’s something that <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="SET" value="P1Y" quant="EVERY">every year</TIMEX3>, heading into the season, it scares me. … It’s obviously a very tricky part of roster construction.”

Friedman joked that the seasons when he was most worried about the bullpen usually turned out to be the years when his bullpen performed best – and vice versa.

Even if an ‘under construction’ sign remains permanently fixed to any bullpen in Friedman’s mind, the Dodgers’ <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> relief corps looks to be largely settled with <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-SP">spring</TIMEX3> training just <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="P2W" mod="MORE_THAN">more than two weeks</TIMEX3> away.

GM Farhan Zaidi offered that there are “some interesting guys still out there” on the free-agent market. But the relievers in that group – veterans such as Joe Smith, Fernando Salas and Sergio Romo – appear to hold little interest for the Dodgers. Veteran Joe Blanton, who surprisingly emerged as the Dodgers’ most reliable setup man last season, remains unsigned as well and “it’s not lost on us what a significant part of our bullpen he was last season,” Friedman said.

But that successful <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3> (a 2.48 ERA and 1.01 WHIP in a team-high 75 appearances) might have pushed the 36-year-old Blanton’s market beyond what the Dodgers are willing to pay after extending themselves farther than expected (a combined $192 million) to re-sign Jansen, Turner and Hill. The same financial restraint has probably kept the Dodgers from bidding aggressively for other bullpen options.

“Obviously we committed significant resources (to re-signing in-house free agents),” Friedman said. “I think it impacts everywhere, just how you allocate. It obviously has trickle-down effects.”

Zaidi pointed out that the Dodgers bullpen performed “at the top of baseball” <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3> and can look forward to full seasons from players such as Josh Fields and Grant Dayton, who emerged as key pieces late in the year. The only additions to last year’s group figure to be of the type already signed – former Tampa Bay Ray Steve Geltz and former San Diego Padre Brandon Morrow, both of whom signed minor-league contracts with non-roster invitations to <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2017-SP">spring</TIMEX3> training.

“I think the arms are there,” said Dodgers manager Dave Roberts, who made a major-league record 606 pitching changes in <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3>. “It’s more of a situation where somebody’s gotta emerge, sort of what Joe Blanton did for us <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3>.

“We’ve got a lot of options. It’s more about who’s going to step up and pitch those innings.”

WEIGHTY MATTERS 

Outfielder Yasiel Puig lifted his shirt onstage to show the crowd at Dodger Stadium for Saturday’s FanFest how well he is doing in satisfying the Dodgers’ request for him to get leaner in <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3>. Puig has hired a nutritionist and a chef, Roberts said – though they didn’t appear to be part of the entourage throwing “YP” logo hats to the crowd as Puig made his FanFest appearance.

Catcher Yasmani Grandal, meanwhile, has cut meat from his diet <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2017-WI">this winter</TIMEX3> and expects to report to <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2017-SP">spring</TIMEX3> training 10 pounds below his usual playing weight and 20 pounds lower than he normally starts <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2017-SP">spring</TIMEX3> training. Grandal said he is “a little worried” about being too light and will probably add meat back into his diet <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2017-SP">this spring</TIMEX3>.

Fitness and diet aren’t the only issues for Puig this season as he tries to bounce back from a disappointing <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3> that included <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DURATION" value="P1M">a month</TIMEX3>-long demotion to Triple-A and attempts by the Dodgers to trade him.

“It was not a good experience going to Triple-A,” Puig said, conducting his interview in English. “But that was my fault – coming in late, not going to meetings on time with my teammates and coaches. That was the reason.”

Roberts said he has spoken with Puig multiple times during <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2017-WI">the winter</TIMEX3> and “he’s in a great state of mind <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">right now</TIMEX3>.”

ALSO 

Utilityman Kiké Hernandez plans to play for Puerto Rico in the World Baseball Classic. Outfielder Joc Pederson, however, said he turned down an invitation to play for Team Israel. As a minor leaguer <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2013">four years ago</TIMEX3>, Pederson was the youngest player on Team Israel during the qualifying rounds for the WBC. … Roberts said 20-year-old left-hander Julio Urias will definitely have an innings limit in <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> – “he is still a young man.” Roberts has mentioned the possibility that Urias will stay behind in Arizona for extended <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DATE" value="2017-SP">spring</TIMEX3> training after the Dodgers break camp as a way to save those innings for later in the year. “It’s a team decision,” Urias said through an interpreter. “I’m just going to get ready and wait for their decision. I’ll respect it whatever it is.” … Friedman said he is “cautiously optimistic” about reports that Hyun-Jin Ryu has already been throwing off a mound. If Ryu can make a comeback from shoulder and elbow surgeries that limited him to one start in <TIMEX3 tid="t35" type="DURATION" value="P2Y">the past two years</TIMEX3> “it would be a real boon to us,” Friedman said.
