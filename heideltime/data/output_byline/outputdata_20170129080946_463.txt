<TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DURATION" value="P6M">six months</TIMEX3> back after giving up the vice president post of state Trinamool Congress unit, said he was lured by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ideology and principles. 
 
"But when you see the pattern of ticket allotments, when deserving Muslim candidates are denied tickets you do realise that the BJP isn't for the minority community," Khan alleged. 
 
<TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> having decided to contest from Keirao constituency on NCP ticket, he said, "We will expose the fact that BJP doesn't stand for the minority. There are 18 constituencies in Manipur where Muslim votes do play a key factor and we will ensure that the community doesn't endorse the communal party." Likewise, Md Habibur Rahman, who was the Vice President of Minority Morcha BJP Manipur, has joined JD(U) to contest from Wagbai after failing to get BJP ticket. 
 
"Initially we believed in Narendra Modi's 'sabka saath sabka vikas' slogan but when tickets are distributed there's a question mark raised on the intent of BJP. Its actions are showing to be Hindu-oriented," he said of the party for which he was a member for <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P2Y">two years</TIMEX3>. 
 
Calls and messages to BJP Manipur spokesperson O Joy remained unanswered.
