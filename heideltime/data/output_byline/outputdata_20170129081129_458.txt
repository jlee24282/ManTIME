Rio Ferdinand in the <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3> Times 

Man United old boy Rio Ferdinand has penned an interesting article in the <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3> Times looking at the problems at Liverpool and assessing the Premier League title race at large

 

Even before this week’s match at Anfield between Chelsea and Liverpool Ferdinand believes the Reds have blown it

 

Moreover the talking-head believes the only two clubs capable over catching Chelsea this season are Tottenham and Arsenal

 Picking on Daniel Sturridge 

When looking at Liverpool Ferdinand took aim at striker Daniel Sturridge

 

Sturridge was called out for not producing enough for Jurgen Klopp while the England forward was advised to look at his old club Chelsea for inspiration about how to rediscover his best form

 

Sturridge needs look no further than across the tunnel at the Chelsea side to see an example he should follow Pedro

 

The way he has stood up to be counted at Chelsea is what Liverpool need not just from Sturridge but several other players in Mane’s absence

 Chelsea’s only challengers 

As for the title race in general Rio talked about the chances the title ends up at White Hart Lane or the Emirates Stadium

 

If Liverpool don’t win they’re out of the title race — though in reality I see Arsenal and Tottenham as the only clubs capable of overhauling Chelsea

 

Liverpool Manchester United and Manchester City are fighting it out below them The title race is a matter for London Fourth place is a battle for the northwest
