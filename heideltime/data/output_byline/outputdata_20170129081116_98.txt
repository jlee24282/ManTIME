Listen up, nature lovers, you don’t have to give up the outdoors just because the weather turns less seasonable. Instead, get creative and bring the natural world inside with some simple natural DIY projects to create nature-themed interior spaces. 

9 Natural DIY Projects to Bring the Outside Inside istock/deveritt 

1. Driftwood Sconces – Turn a piece of driftwood into a candle holder by attaching votive candle holders to a piece of driftwood and hang on the wall. You can affix hardware clamps to the driftwood to hold the candle holders.

2. Twig Centerpiece – The next time you have to go out to collect branches from the yard after a windy day, bring some inside to create a natural DIY centerpiece. Add twigs to a vase along with greenery for a lovely seasonal centerpiece.

5. Painted Pinecones – If you or your neighbors have any pine trees, then you have a ready supply of pine cones to collect and use for DIY projects. They can be spray painted and hung from hooks with ribbon in lonely corners in your home. Or collect them in a burl bowl on the coffee table.

8. Found Object Collection – Collect nature’s treasures like tiny pine cones, river stones, found feathers, and more and display your collection like they are priceless collectibles. Use a typesetter’s tray to display your collection on the wall or display them under a glass cloche on the coffee table.
