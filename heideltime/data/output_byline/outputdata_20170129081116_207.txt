WHAT: Keep Tampa Bay Beautiful, Tampa Bay Dive Against Debris, North 
American Marine Environment Protection Association (NAMEPA), and the 
City of Tampa’s Department of Solid Waste and Environmental Program 
Management (COT-Solid Waste) will sponsor the 7th Annual Day-After 
Gasparilla Cleanup along Bayshore Boulevard the day after the Gasparilla 
Parade on <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday, January 29th, 2017</TIMEX3> . 
 
BACKGROUND: This event, which started as a grass roots cleanup event in 
<TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2010">2010</TIMEX3> coordinated by Christine Fisher of Tampa Bay Dive Against Debris 
with 8 participants, has grown to a large-scale annual litter removal 
event that has grown in both sponsors and volunteers. Volunteers will be 
responsible for cleaning the areas and side streets throughout Bayshore 
Blvd that will be used as both the float staging area and parade route, 
focusing on both trash and recyclable items.  Of Note – Both Dan and 
Christine Fisher, founders of both Tampa Bay Dive Against Debris and the 
Day After Gasparilla Cleanup, will be flying in from Germany to attend 
this cleanup.  Dan is <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> working overseas supporting United 
States European Command. 
 
WHEN: <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday, January 29</TIMEX3>, <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29T09:30">9:30am</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29T24:30">12:30pm</TIMEX3> . 
 
WHERE: Volunteers will meet at the signup tent located at the Tampa 
Woman’s Club, <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2901">2901</TIMEX3> Bayshore Blvd, 
at <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29T09:00">9:00am</TIMEX3> for a brief orientation. 
 
WHY: Much of the debris that makes its way in the waters along Bayshore 
Boulevard during Gasparilla season comes directly from Gasparilla 
activities, such as the parades. Day After Gasparilla cleanup conducts a 
cleanup along Bayshore Boulevard and the associated side streets the day 
after the Gasparilla Adult Parade of Pirates. Volunteers clean the areas 
and side streets throughout Bayshore Blvd which were used as both the 
float staging area and parade route, focusing on both trash and recyclable 
items. This will support the reduction of waste and the impact of the 
waste along the parade route while continuing the traditional celebration 
of Gasparilla.
