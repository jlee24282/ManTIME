<TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="18">The 19th Century</TIMEX3> belonged to the British while <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="19">the 20th Century</TIMEX3> belonged to the United States. What I wonder is if <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="20">the 21st Century</TIMEX3> will belong to the Chinese. <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> that Trump and Congress chucked our stake in the Trans-Pacific Partnership out the door, will China pick up the pieces? 
  
Consider this for a moment. Britain has left the European Union and we are turning in on ourselves with the hope that Trump can make great deals. All the while, China and their 1.3 billion citizens have the largest GDP in Asia and continue to rise economically. They have the ability to offer a carrot in the form of trade and expansion or a large stick of a 2.3 million-man army. 
 
So if you are the Philippines, Korea, Japan or even Australia, who would you trade with when the U.S. pulls out of the region?
