President Trump's executive order banning entry into the United States for people travelling from seven different Muslim-majority countries may impact Canadians with dual citizenship. 
 
"To those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith", Trudeau said on his Twitter account on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>. 
 
Trudeau also tweeted a picture of himself welcoming a refugee family. 
 
Mr. Trump's executive order is not only at odds with Mr. Trudeau's policies, but it also does not reflect the general sentiment in Canada, where the Syrian refugee program enjoys widespread support. 
 
Trudeau said they are in contact with the United States Department of Homeland Security and the United States Department of Transportation to "get more clarity on the impacts of the restrictions on travels". A Canadian Trump fan disagreed, telling  Trudeau: "Sharia law will be our downfall". 
 
The countries are Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. 
 
Bijan Ahmadi, president of the Iranian  Canadian Congress, said he's outraged by the new policy. 
 
That means that a longtime USA resident who had left the country to go on vacation or visit family would not be able to get back to their home. "We stand ready to assist fed gov't re: anyone stranded by the United States ban". 
 
In a statement, Air Canada said the company is "monitoring the situation and expect this would affect only a small handful of our passengers". 
 
WestJet and Air Canada said they were waiving cancellation fees for people who hold passports from the affected countries.
