There had been anxiety over his health in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P3D">the past three days</TIMEX3> after he disappeared from public view. 
 
Personal assistant to the nonagerian, Alhaji Mutairu Salawudeen Bello, confirmed the death in a telephone interview with our correspondent. 
 
“With gratitude to Allah (SWT), we announce the death of Alhaji Mohammed Abubakar Bello <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29TAF">this afternoon</TIMEX3>. He was aged <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="P93Y">93 years</TIMEX3>. He died after a brief illness.

Bello said that the late Islamic preacher fore-told his death and was prepared for it. 
 
“Baba had told us that his time was up. He told me personally during his last moment that he has completed his divine assignment and was ready to meet his creator. 
 
“He told us to remain dedicated to the cause of Islam and urged us all not to deviate from all his teachings on righteousness, piety and total submission to the will of Allah. He warned us to shun adultery but that we are free to marry as many women as possible instead of piling up cuncubines because it is ‘Hallal’ before Allah.”
