Richardson started painting <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2013" mod="APPROX">about four years ago</TIMEX3>. He started experimenting with leftover art supplies from one of his wife’s hobbies. Amazed at what artists could do with paint and paper, he decided to try. He continued until he was pleased with the results. 
 
Being an enthusiastic lover of nature, it was only natural for him to prefer painting landscapes. His medium of choice is acrylic. He has great admiration for the work of other artists but is determined to continue his course in his style with no training.
