Alaska Aces defenseman Nolan Descoteaux, whose turnover delivered Idaho's late equalizer, scored in overtime <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TNI">Saturday night</TIMEX3> to give the Aces a 3-2 ECHL victory over the Steelheads at Sullivan Arena. 
   
The victory gave the Aces three straight wins in the series. 
   
Descoteaux's turnover late in regulation led to Kyle Jean's game-tying goal. 
   
His goal came seconds after Travis Walsh hit the post for Idaho. 
   
Kevin Carr stopped 32 shots for the Aces and Branden Komm made 31 saves for the Steelheads. 
   
With Aces sixth-year coach Rob Murray out of town for his induction <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-23">Monday</TIMEX3> into the American Hockey League Hall of Fame, goaltending coach Gerald Coleman served as bench boss. He was assisted by winger Tyler Ruegsegger. 
   
After falling behind 2-0 in the first period both <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-01-25">Wednesday</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3>, the Aces turned the tables <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>, when they used first-period goals <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="PT90S">90 seconds</TIMEX3> apart from Tim Wallace and Tim Coffman to seize a 2-0 lead. 
   
Wallace was left with a virtual tap-in when Stephen Perfetto beat Jefferson Dahl on a left-wing face-off, tapping the puck through Dahl's legs and back-handing a pass to Wallace at the net. 
   
Coffman struck when he took a breakout pass from defenseman Dax Lauwers in neutral ice, blew into Idaho's zone on left wing, cut to the middle, faked a shot and then unloaded a slot wrister past Komm. 
   
The Aces outshot the Steelheads 18-7 in the opening <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="PT20M">20 minutes</TIMEX3>. 
   
The Steelheads, who because of injuries and a call-up to the American Hockey League played with 14 skaters, two shy of the maximum allowed, did not remotely take the night off. They played hard and physical in the second period and trimmed Alaska's lead to 2-1, in part because the Aces furnished the Steelheads three consecutive power plays in a span of <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="PT5M" mod="APPROX">about five minutes</TIMEX3>. 
   
Idaho, which entered the evening with the circuit's third-best power play, cashed in on the final of those chances. Will Merchant's bid from the slot was a high tumbler that was blocked back to him. On his second whack at a bouncing puck in the low slot, he rifled a shot through traffic and past Carr. 
   
The Aces next play a three-game series at Colorado that opens <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2017-01-25">Wednesday</TIMEX3>. Murray will rejoin the club in Colorado.
