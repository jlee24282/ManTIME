A top Ghanaian journalist, Charles Ayittey, has been struck with fear and confusion after receiving a scary revelation that Jesus Christ will be returning soon.

Charles, a journalist with YEN, told close friends that he woke from a terrible dream on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3> dawn, panting helplessly, with his heart beating rapidly. Fear, he said, also gripped his soul.

In the dream, Charles said the rapture had taken place and Jesus had come for his people.

He said the world was filled with darkness and sorrow.

"It was dark and the world was in a timeless space. People were crying on radio. I was left behind. I remember I walked out of my house seeing a gaping hole in the sky," he said.

Charles, who attends the International Central Gospel Church (ICGC), said there was confusion everywhere and soldiers had been deployed to the streets to maintain order.

"The clock stopped. Telephone lines were not working. People were running helter skelter and corpses scattered around," he said.

The journalist stressed that the dream was a clear sign that Jesus would return soon.

"It was horrible and scary," he said of the dream, adding: "Let's strengthen our personal walks with God."

Charles vowed to continue to preach the word of Jesus' second coming, so that people would not be caught by surprise when the day finally comes.
