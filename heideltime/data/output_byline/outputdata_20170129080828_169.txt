Patrons at Century Square's Food Junction were left outraged after having to pay surcharges for their food and drinks -- on top of what the items originally cost. 
 
Stomper Celine and Eugene sent in separate accounts of how much their meals there <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3> (<TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Jan 29</TIMEX3>) amounted to. 
 
Photos they sent in also show signs put up at the food court, stating that there would be an additional $1 surcharge for every food item ordered and an extra $0.50 surcharge for every beverage ordered "due to the festive season". 
 
Celine, who paid $23.70 for eight pieces of roti prata, told Stomp: 
 
"It didn't occur to me that when the official notice displayed at the cashier said '$1 surcharge per item', it really meant $1 more for every prata. 
 
"My order was six egg pratas and two plain pratas, 
 
"What I paid for was for eight pieces of pratas, a surcharge of $8 ($1 x 8) and 30 cents for it being a takeaway. 
 
"Might as well go for fast food, where even delivery costs $4 only. 
 
"What a rip-off!" 
 
Eugene, on the other hand, chalked up a $19.60 bill at the same prata stall, but paid $17.64 after a 10% discount. 
 
He also patronised another stall where he bought a breakfast set that consisted of bee hoon and coffee for $4.90. 
 
However, despite it being a set, the items were broken up and had separate surcharges imposed on them: $1 for the bee hoon and $0.50 for the coffee. 
 
After adding in this additional $1.50 surcharge, his meal amounted to $6.40.
