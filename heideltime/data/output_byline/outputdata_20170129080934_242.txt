hello nairalanders I'm in a dilemma <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">right now</TIMEX3> and I need real advice. I do hope I get a very wise one because I haven't enough time on my clock. the mods can also help me to push this to FP because its my future at stake.I'm in a position where I don't know whether to continue schooling - MSc, or accept a job offer.after my BSc, I didn't want to continue on with my course of study because I realised I hadn't much passion for it, I went in to study mathematics because it came my way and at the time I couldn't say no to an admission. so after nysc, I went in to do a PGD in geography and environmental management. i already had love for the geosciences. came out with a good result that qualified me for a MSc in any of the related discipline. I applied for environmental hazard management and got the admission.at this point things became more difficult with the recession and it is clear to me that I won't be having any support. school fees has increased and the cost of running the MSc has gone high. on the other side, I've been applying for jobs as a HSE officer/manager which I have <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="PXY">some years</TIMEX3> of experience working during the break within my programs. I just missed a job in nestoil because my guy in there didn't act fast to recommend me when there was emergency vacancy. however, because of the disappointment they have offered me a job as a HSE officer in a seismic company. they have asked me to come on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-01-23">Monday</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-01-30">30th January</TIMEX3>.by calendar I'm suppose to start MSc lectures on the same date. I have drained my brain thinking of what to do....whether to take the job and differ my admission perhaps, or to go on with the MSc and ignore the job for <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3>...I know that a lot of you folks out there have been in a similar situation or you know someone who was. please your advice is needed, I don't want to make a mistake that I will regret...and I just have <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P2D" mod="LESS_THAN">less than 2 days</TIMEX3> before the interviews on <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="TIME" value="2017-01-23TMO">Monday morning</TIMEX3>.please mods help me get this to front page. I'm depending on their advice. this is my last resort. thanks
