Bengluru: Former external affairs minister and former Karnataka chief minster S.M. Krishna <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3> said that he is quitting Congress. 
 
“With pain & anguish, I have decided to quit Congress and told the central leaders that I stand by my decision,” Krishna told reporters here. He added that he is yet to decide on the next step. 
 
However, he said that he has no plans to meet prime minister Narendra Modi. Reports have been doing rounds that Krishna will join BJP. 
 
The 84-year-old Krishna had reportedly called on party President Sonia Gandhi in New Delhi <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> and requested her to relieve him from all posts and duties on age-related health grounds. 
 
Krishna's loyalists and supporters, however, said their veteran leader was leaving the Congress, as he was miffed for being sidelined since the party returned to power in the southern state in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2013-05">May 2013</TIMEX3>. 
 
"The party's state unit leaders, especially chief minister Siddaramaiah had ignored Krishna and never consulted him on party affairs or policy issues," said a loyalist. 
 
Krishna was the country's external affairs minister in the second UPA government from <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2009">2009</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2012">2012</TIMEX3> after his stints as Maharashtra Governor from <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2005">2005</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3> and the state's Chief Minister from <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="1999">1999</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2004">2004</TIMEX3>. 
 
Krishna is also the party's lawmaker in the Rajya Sabha.
