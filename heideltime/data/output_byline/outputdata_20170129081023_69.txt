In <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3>, Savage took the rimfire world by storm by releasing a semi-automatic production rifle that could reliably cycle the .17 HMR cartridge. Because of the pressure the cartridge generates, it was long deemed “too hot” to ever reliably function in the straight blowback actions common in semi-autos. Savage cracked that code with its A17, which is a big part of why it won the <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3> American Hunter Golden Bullseye Award for Rifle of the Year. Why’s that important? Because the A22 Magnum is essentially the same rifle just, as you’ve probably guessed, chambered in .22 Mag. Learn more about it in the video embedded above, hosted by our own Rose Bier.
