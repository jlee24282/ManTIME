FUKUSHIMA (Kyodo) -- Only 13 percent of the evacuees from the <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2011">2011</TIMEX3> Fukushima nuclear disaster in five municipalities in Fukushima Prefecture have returned home after evacuation orders were lifted, local authorities said <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>. 
 
Some residents who used to live in the cities of Tamura and Minamisoma, villages of Kawauchi and Katsurao, and the town of Naraha may be reluctant to return to their homes due to fear of exposing children to radiation, the authorities said. 
 
The evacuation orders to residents in those municipalities were lifted partly or entirely from <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2014-04">April 2014</TIMEX3> through <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2016-07">July 2016</TIMEX3>. As of <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2017-01">January</TIMEX3>, about 2,500 people out of a combined population of around 19,460 registered as residents of those areas were living there. 
 
Evacuation orders for four more towns and villages in Fukushima Prefecture are scheduled to be lifted <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2017-SP">this spring</TIMEX3>, but it is uncertain how many residents will return to those areas as well. 
 
In the prefecture, eight municipalities are still subject to evacuation orders around the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant due to high radiation levels. Three nuclear reactors at the plant melted down and the structures housing them were severely damaged by hydrogen gas explosions days after a massive earthquake and ensuing tsunami on <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2011-03-11">March 11, 2011</TIMEX3> knocked out electric power needed to run critical reactor cooling equipment.
