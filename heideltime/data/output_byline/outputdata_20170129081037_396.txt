WASHINGTON -- A split runs through the heart of the American presidency. 

Looked at one way, it's a large, centralized bureaucracy designed to translate ideas into policy. From another angle, it's a man -- so far, always a man -- sitting behind a desk as the world's knottiest problems play on his quirks and insecurities. 

Seldom has the dual nature of the office been more on display than in the first week of the presidency of Donald John Trump. 

All week, the White House rolled out executive orders and presidential memorandums, most of which were strikingly normal -- a word Trump's opponents hate to hear applied to him. 

The rhetoric may have been sweeping, the scheduling startlingly ad hoc and the pace unusually hectic. But few of the actions, with the major exception of the ban on refugees and restrictions on immigration announced <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-02-03">Friday</TIMEX3>, would have surprised anyone had they been taken by other Republicans, from Jeb Bush to Ted Cruz. 

Then there was the rest of it -- the displays of presidential id, unfiltered by retainers. 

In speeches, interviews and off-the-cuff remarks, Trump obsessed about the size of his inauguration crowds, nakedly declared that he favors "torture" -- dispensing with George W. Bush-style euphemisms about "enhanced interrogation" -- and sought to explain away his loss of the popular vote to Hillary Clinton by insisting on the falsehood that 3 million to 5 million illegal votes had been cast. 

Republican elected officials spent the week trying to adjust to the new reality, hoping to focus attention on the normal parts, only to repeatedly be upstaged by an insistently non-normal president. 

"This is going to be an unconventional presidency," House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, R-Wis., told reporters <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-01-26">Thursday</TIMEX3> in Philadelphia, where Trump spoke at a GOP legislative retreat. "That's something we're just all going to have to get used to." 

What voters ultimately will make of all this remains unknown, although Trump's early standing in polls has been consistently poor. For all the attention the first week of a presidency gets, it's "seldom determinative," said veteran pollster Peter Hart.
