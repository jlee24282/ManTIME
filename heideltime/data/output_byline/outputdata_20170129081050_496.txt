<TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Today</TIMEX3>'s consumers deal with a world in which some costs go up far faster than their incomes. As interest rates rise, the cost of existing debt on credit cards and other variable-rate loans will go up too. 

Before shopping for a new car, SUV or truck, it's becoming more important than ever to start out asking: What exactly can I afford? What's a reasonable <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="SET" value="XXXX-XX">monthly</TIMEX3> payment? What other costs do I need to consider? And, really, how long do I expect to hold onto that new vehicle? 

"A lot of cars here <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3> are 50 grand or more. Most people can't afford that," Ryan Fortenbacher, 35, said as he visited the North American International Auto Show in Detroit <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-01" mod="START">earlier this month</TIMEX3>. "What you used to be able to get for $20,000 is <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> $30,000." 

Fortenbacher, a real estate agent from Columbus, Ohio, said he and partner Mark Fischer pay $260 <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="P1M">a month</TIMEX3> for a Volkswagen Jetta and $360 <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P1M">a month</TIMEX3> for a Toyota 4Runner. 

The Toyota is a <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="P3Y">three-year</TIMEX3> lease, he said, because it would have cost nearly $700 <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="P1M">a month</TIMEX3> on a <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="P5Y">five-year</TIMEX3> car loan for the $38,000 SUV. The Jetta has a <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION" value="P6Y">72-month</TIMEX3> loan at zero percent. 

"If you asked me <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2007">10 years ago</TIMEX3>, I would never have done that," he said of <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DURATION" value="P6Y">the six-year</TIMEX3> car loan. 

One risk of a lengthy loan is you can owe far more than the car is worth if you want to unload it before you pay it off. 

On average, consumers are paying $495 <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DURATION" value="P1M">a month</TIMEX3> for new-car loans, based on data for <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2016-Q3">third quarter 2016</TIMEX3>, according to credit-reporting service Experian. That's up from $447 in <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3>. By contrast, the average interest rate on a new-car loan was 6.14 percent in <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3>, compared with 4.69 percent in <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3>. 

"We've seen a pretty sizable increase in <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="SET" value="XXXX-XX">monthly</TIMEX3> payments in <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DURATION" value="P8Y">the last eight years</TIMEX3>," said Melinda Zabritski, senior director for automotive finance for Experian. 

On average, consumers financed $24,060 for a new car in <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3>, compared with $30,022 in <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DATE" value="2016-Q3">third quarter 2016</TIMEX3>, according to Experian's data. 

Some of the higher debt can be explained by higher sticker prices. Added technology drives up costs, too. The popularity of pickups and crossover utility vehicles also factors into bigger average payments. 

In <TIMEX3 tid="t35" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3>, the No. 1 spot for new-car sales was small economy cars, Experian's Zabritski said. <TIMEX3 tid="t36" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3>, the No. 1 spot is a more expensive, entry-level cross-over utility vehicle such as a Toyota RAV4, Honda CR-V or Ford Escape, she said, followed by the pickup truck, then the economy car. 

The average loan on an entry-level CUV was $25,966 from <TIMEX3 tid="t38" type="DATE" value="2017-01">January</TIMEX3> through <TIMEX3 tid="t40" type="DATE" value="2016-11">November 2016</TIMEX3> - roughly $5,128 more than for a small economy car. The average loan on a full-sized pickup: $39,039. 

Zabritski noted that the average new-car loan rate for a small economy car was 7.39 percent <TIMEX3 tid="t42" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3> through <TIMEX3 tid="t41" type="DATE" value="2016-11">November</TIMEX3>, reflecting a price point that attracts more subprime borrowers, who face higher interest rates due to bad credit. The average payment: $363 <TIMEX3 tid="t44" type="DURATION" value="P1M">a month</TIMEX3>. 

Though many observers say the auto industry can keep selling at high levels or a slightly lower pace, some wonder if a roadblock is just ahead. 

"We believe car affordability is holding new-car sales back," said Michelle Krebs, senior analyst for Autotrader. 

U.S. consumers bought a record 17.55 million new cars and trucks in <TIMEX3 tid="t45" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3> - up from 17.47 million in <TIMEX3 tid="t46" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3>. But those sales are not that far off the old record level of 17.35 million sales hit in <TIMEX3 tid="t47" type="DATE" value="2000">2000</TIMEX3>. 

If you look at the growth of the adult population, Krebs said, it's theoretically possible another 3 million units could have been sold in <TIMEX3 tid="t48" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent years</TIMEX3>. 

In <TIMEX3 tid="t51" type="DATE" value="2000">2000</TIMEX3>, the U.S. had 210 million people over age 18. By <TIMEX3 tid="t52" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3>, the country had 248 million people over 18, she said. So, essentially it took 38 million more people to reach something close to 2000 levels. 

"Why aren't we selling 20.5 million new vehicles?" she asked. "Affordability. In our <TIMEX3 tid="t56" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> survey of consumers, we asked: 'Why do you think you may not own or lease a new vehicle in the future?' Fifty-seven percent said they couldn't afford it." 

Many consumers stretch out loans or lease cars to keep a lower <TIMEX3 tid="t59" type="SET" value="XXXX-XX">monthly</TIMEX3> payment. About 30 percent of new cars sold are leased, according to Experian. 

About 30.7 percent of new-car loans are for <TIMEX3 tid="t64" type="DURATION" value="P73M">73</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t62" type="DURATION" value="P7Y">84 months</TIMEX3>, it says, with about 40.7 percent for <TIMEX3 tid="t65" type="DURATION" value="P61M">61</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t63" type="DURATION" value="P6Y">72 months</TIMEX3>. 

Often, consumers don't bring much money to the table to buy a new car, financing 90 percent of their vehicles on average, said Paul Traub, senior business economist for the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago's Detroit branch.
