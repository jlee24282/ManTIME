The Milwaukee Bucks ran into a one-man wrecking crew <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TNI">Saturday night</TIMEX3>. 

Isaiah Thomas had 37 points and eight assists to lead the Boston Celtics to a 112-108 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TNI">Saturday night</TIMEX3> at the BMO Harris Bradley Center. 

Jae Crowder scored four of his 20 points on free throws in the final <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="PT28S">28 seconds</TIMEX3> of overtime to put the Bucks away. 

Boston won its third straight after squandering a 16-point <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2016-H2">second half</TIMEX3> lead and a 42-point <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-Q1">first quarter</TIMEX3>, its best of the season. 

Giannis Antetokounmpo led Milwaukee with 21 points, and Greg Monroe had 14 points and 13 rebounds. The Bucks have lost three in a row and eight of nine. 

Boston built a six-point lead in overtime, but Tony Snell hit consecutive 3-pointers to tie it at 108. Crowder made two free throws on the ensuing possession with <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="PT28S">28 seconds</TIMEX3> to go and two more to seal it with <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="PT10S">10 seconds</TIMEX3> left after Antetokounmpo missed a contested shot in the lane. 

The Celtics got out to a double-digit lead quickly and never gave it up. Crowder scored eight of the Celtics' first 11 points to help Boston get out to a nine-point lead in the first 21/<TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="PT2M">2 minutes</TIMEX3>. 

That was just the beginning of what ended up as a 42-point <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2017-Q1">first quarter</TIMEX3> for the Celtics. With Crowder leading the way with 11 points and Thomas chipping in <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2010">10</TIMEX3>, the Celtics picked apart the Bucks' defense on the way to 63.2 percent shooting from the field in the period in addition to 11-of-11 shooting from the free-throw line. Gerald Green put the exclamation point on <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2017-Q1">the quarter</TIMEX3> by making a 25-footer before the buzzer that gave the Celtics a 42-27 lead after <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DURATION" value="PT12M">12 minutes</TIMEX3>. 

In that opening stanza, the Bucks got nothing from Antetokounmpo and Jabari Parker. Milwaukee's leading scorers combined to go 0-of-8 from the field as Michael Beasley shouldered the scoring load off the bench with 11 points. 

Antetokounmpo made his first three shots of <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2016-Q2">the second quarter</TIMEX3>, including a pair of dunks, to highlight an 8-0 run that brought the Bucks within eight, but that was as close as they would get. That's because Thomas subbed back in and went on a tear. He got fouled shooting a 3-pointer and made all three free throws, made a 26-footer and a 30-footer and hooked a left-handed layup over Snell on the way to scoring 13 points in the final <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DURATION" value="PT6M">six minutes</TIMEX3> of <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2016-Q2">the second quarter</TIMEX3>, putting him at 23 at the half.
