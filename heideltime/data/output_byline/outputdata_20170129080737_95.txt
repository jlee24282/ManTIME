HAMILTON – officials are going to walk a fine line in developing a management plan for the area’s most popular public recreation site.

That’s what officials heard <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-W03">last week</TIMEX3> after finishing three public meetings in Darby and Hamilton on the future of Lake Como.

“In general, they want to see the quality of the facilities already in place maintained,” said Darby District Ranger Eric Winthers. “There is a lot of interest developing trails for various uses around the lake, but people also don’t want to see the area become overdeveloped.”

Lake Como is the most heavily used recreation area in the Forest Service’s Northern Region. It attracts nearly 200,000 people to its shores and surrounding campgrounds <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="SET" value="XXXX">annually</TIMEX3>.

While most come in the summertime to boat, hike and enjoy the sandy beach, use at the recreation area has been growing during the other three seasons, as well.

Winthers said there is a good deal of interest by mountain bikers and horseback riders in developing trail systems to both the north and south of the lake.

The management plan will take that interest into account by expanding its reach beyond the immediate shoreline of the lake to include the area south to Lost Horse Creek and north to Tin Cup Creek.

“There was a lot of talk about the need for more parking at trailheads,” Winthers said. “People are also interested in making some of the roads more accessible for horse trailer traffic and the potential of a new horse camp. We also heard from people interested in mountain bike trails.”

The plan <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> calls for compiling all the information officials gathered from the public meetings and other comments submitted to the national forest.

“We do want to emphasize that we are still taking comment for a little bit longer,” Winthers said. “The deadline is <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-02-28">Feb. 28</TIMEX3>. We have been getting quite a few comments that way.”

Comment forms are available on the Bitterroot Forest’s website at www.fs.usda.gov/bitterroot 

Once all that information is put together, Winthers said an overall plan will be developed <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="PXM" mod="MORE_THAN">over the next few months</TIMEX3>.

When the plan is in place, Winthers said the forest officials will begin looking for potential projects. While some will require an environmental analysis, others could get started rather quickly.

“I think the earliest that we’ll be able to get going on anything is <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2018-FA">next fall</TIMEX3>,” Winthers said.
