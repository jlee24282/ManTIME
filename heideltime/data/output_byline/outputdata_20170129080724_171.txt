MARIETTA — Slappy, Fanny, TJ, Grandpa, Friendly, Tripper and Pudge are just a few of the names that local residents have given to the stray cats making a home at the Washington County Fairgrounds and along the River Trail in Marietta. 
 
The strays have been reproducing at rapid amounts but thanks to Save a Kitty Feral Cat Program based out of Parkersburg, 47 of the cats have been spayed or neutered in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DURATION" value="PXM">the last few months</TIMEX3> and also given proper vaccinations needed to survive. 
 
“People just don’t realize how many cats there are without homes,” said Kandi Habeb, president and founder of Save a Kitty. “Over 90 percent of cats that enter humane societies end up being euthanized and it’s because of rapid breeding.” 
 
Save a Kitty Feral Cat Program is a nonprofit, TNR (Trap, Neuter, Return) program for feral and free-roaming cats. They also offer sterilization and vaccines for cats who have no owner. The program was founded in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2004-07">July 2004</TIMEX3> and through <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2016-09">September</TIMEX3> of <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3>, 5,626 cats had successfully been trapped, fixed and returned. 
 
According to pets.com, a female cat can become pregnant again essentially right after giving birth to a litter. Mature queen cats go in and out of heat seemingly non-stop, generally once every <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="P2W">two</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P3W">three weeks</TIMEX3> or so. The heat cycle typically lasts a little <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P1W" mod="MORE_THAN">more than a week</TIMEX3>. 
 
“Reproducing cats are the problem for overpopulation,” said Habeb. “It’s so important to spay and neuter your animals.” 
 
In <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2016-08">August 2016</TIMEX3>, Habeb along with Dawn Wheeler, trap and release expert, began catching the stray cats near the barns of the fairgrounds after local residents reported the colony to them. 
 
“I went down there and realized how many cats there were and immediately wanted to get started,” said Wheeler. “There were kittens, stray cats and some obvious cats that had been dumped by their owners there.” 
 
Save a Kitty also trapped and released many cats that used to make their home behind Dairy Queen in Marietta and have seen a significant decrease in the population there since. 
 
“There used to be over 20 cats behind Dairy Queen and <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2023">seven years later</TIMEX3>, there’s only about four,” said Habeb. “Hopefully the same impact will be made at the fairgrounds.” 
 
Wheeler said that even with fixing all the cats there, people are going to continue to dump their unwanted cats at the fairgrounds. 
 
“People just think it’s a better life there but it is absolutely not,” she said. “I’ve brought cats to the vet with me and nursed them back to health. It’s just very sad.” 
 
Wheeler has also been working with the Humane Society of the Ohio Valley (HSOV) in hopes of starting a trap and release clinic in Marietta. According to Wheeler, the HSOV took a workshop <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2016-11">last November</TIMEX3> learning how to successfully trap, neuter and release the cats in the county. 
 
Local residents that walk the River Trail near the fairgrounds said they are hopeful that this will help the population decrease. Several community members have helped feed and care for the cats there over <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="200">the last decade</TIMEX3>. 
 
“It’s been a long process since <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2016-FA">last fall</TIMEX3> to catch all these cats and fix them,” said Judy Adamson of Marietta, who walks the trail. “Save a Kitty is an amazing group of people doing what they’ve done and continue to do in the area.” 
 
Walker Ann Corbett of Marietta said she is optimistic that this will help the cats find homes. 
 
“All the cats have been fixed and have all their shots,” she said. 
 
“I am ever grateful for everything Save a Kitty has done.” 
 
Corbett said she believes many of the cats are adoptable. 
 
“Friendly is a really nice cat and several of them are beautiful and would make wonderful pets,” she said.
