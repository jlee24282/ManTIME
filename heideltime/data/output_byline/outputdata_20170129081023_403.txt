Point Guards 
 
Austin Rivers Clippers 57 percent owned in Yahoo! leagues – Rivers has been much better than Raymond Felton since Chris Paul went down and should keep rolling for about another month. While his dad, Doc Rivers , says he’s open to trading his son, I still find it hard to believe that he would actually do it. But if it happens, his value would most likely take a hit, depending on where he lands. But as long as he’s with the Clippers, he should continue to rack up points and 3-pointers. He was quiet in Saturday’s ugly blowout loss to the Clippers with 10 points and six assists on 3-of-11 shooting, but played <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="PT38M">38 minutes</TIMEX3> and was averaging 19.8 points, 4.4 assists and 3.0 3-pointers over his previous five games. 
 
T.J. McConnell Sixers 41% - McConnell’s not a big scorer, but has been racking up assists at an alarming rate lately. He hit double digits in assists in three straight games before scoring 13 points with eight dimes on <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3>. He’s starting for the Sixers and averaging 9.0 points, 2.8 rebounds, 9.4 assists and 1.6 steals on 53 percent shooting over his last five games. I wish he was a 3-point shooter, but he’s not. 
 
Matthew Dellavedova Bucks 30% - Delly took over the starting job from Malcolm Brogdon five games ago and is averaging 13.0 points, 5.4 assists, 0.8 steals and 1.8 3-pointers in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="PT29M">29 minutes</TIMEX3> a game over that stretch. Brogdon has more upside and talent, but Delly’s putting up better numbers <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">right now</TIMEX3>. He’s also had at least 14 points and six dimes in three of his last five games. 
 
Raymond Felton Clippers 24% - Felton has bounced in and out of the starting lineup since Chris Paul went down and played just <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="PT17M">17 minutes</TIMEX3> for two points and three assists on 1-of-3 shooting in Tuesday’s loss to the Sixers. He bounced back on <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> with 10 points, seven rebounds, five assists, a block and two 3-pointers on <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>, and even played garbage time in a blowout loss because the Clippers simply don’t have healthy points guards <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">right now</TIMEX3>. Over his last five he’s averaging 10 points, 4.0 rebounds, 4.4 assists, 0.6 steals and 1.2 3-pointers on 38 percent shooting. His shooting took a hit on <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> when he hit just 3-of-12 shots, but he’s getting enough minutes (27.8 in his last five) to make a fantasy dent, and his shooting should be better than this going forward.  
 
Malcolm Brogdon Bucks 55% - Brogdon lost his job to Dellavedova and had scored six or fewer points in three of his last four games before bouncing back with 11 points and five assists on <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>, although he hit just 4-of-12 shots. He’s averaging just 7.0 points, 2.0 rebounds, 5.2 assists, 1.4 steals and just 0.2 3-pointers in his five games since being moved to the bench. Brogdon has plenty of time to reclaim the job or make a comeback, but as long as Delly’s starting, things aren’t looking great for Brogdon. 
 
Editor’s Note : Golf is coming soon to FanDuel! And they’ve created the Tee Off Classic to celebrate, offering you an opportunity to win a VIP trip for 3 to play a round of golf with Jerome Bettis! Play <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> . 
 
Shooting Guards 
 
Dion Waiters Heat 58% - Waiters was at it again on <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> with 17 points and seven assists, but hit just 1-of-9 3-pointers, or his line would have been a lot bigger. Waiters is averaging 25.2 points, 4.2 rebounds, 4.6 assists and 3.4 3-pointers over his last five games, knocking down 52 percent of his shots. He’ll take a bit of a hit once Tyler Johnson is back from his shoulder injury, which should happen any day. He’ll also get stung again by the return of Josh Richardson , but even with those guys lurking, Waiters is hot enough <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">right now</TIMEX3> to be owned in all leagues. Just know that if you pick him up for the upcoming week, you probably missed the best five-game streak of his season. 
 
Seth Curry Mavericks 49% - Curry looks like a full-time starter the rest of the way for the struggling Mavericks, has scored in double figures in six straight games, and is averaging 15 points, three rebounds, 1.4 assists, 1.2 steals and 2.4 3-pointers in 31.4 minutes per game over his last five. If he continues to start the rest of the season, Curry should be owned in a lot more leagues. 
 
Iman Shumpert Cavaliers 28% - Shumpert had scored in double figures in six straight games before hitting just 2-of-8 shots for six points and three steals in Friday’s win over the Nets. He was 0-for-5 from downtown in that one, but had hit at least two 3-pointers in each of his previous six games. Forget about Friday’s dud and consider Shumpert a favorite to average around 15 points, 2.0 steals and close to 3.0 3-pointers going forward. 
 
Gary Harris Nuggets 63% - Harris came through on <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> with 15 points, eight rebounds, four assists, two steals and a 3-pointers, but the Suns typically give it up to opposing guards. He’s averaging 11 points, 3.2 rebounds, 2.0 assists, 0.8 steals and 1.2 3-pointers on 45 percent shooting over his last five games, but he’d have a lot more fantasy appeal if Will Barton wasn’t getting <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DURATION" value="PT20M" mod="EQUAL_OR_MORE">at least 20 minutes</TIMEX3> night. 
 
Garrett Temple Kings 25% (and Arron Afflalo ) - I’m not a big Temple guy and there’s really no one from the Kings that I love filling in for Rudy Gay , who’s out for the season with a blown Achilles. But Temple appears to be the best of the bunch, getting <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DURATION" value="PT32M">32 minutes</TIMEX3> with 8.0 points, 2.2 rebounds, 2.6 assists, 2.0 steals and 0.8 3-points on 34 percent shooting over his last five games. Teammate Arron Afflalo might be a better flier, as he’s coming on and averaging 14 points, 1.3 rebounds, 2.3 assists and 3.0 3-pointers over his last three games, knocking down 9-of-15 shots in <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DURATION" value="PT34M">34 minutes</TIMEX3> a night in the process.

He bounced back on <TIMEX3 tid="t39" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> with 10 points, seven rebounds, five assists, a block and two 3-pointers on <TIMEX3 tid="t40" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>, and even played garbage time in a blowout loss because the Clippers simply don’t have healthy points guards <TIMEX3 tid="t38" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">right now</TIMEX3>. Over his last five he’s averaging 10 points, 4.0 rebounds, 4.4 assists, 0.6 steals and 1.2 3-pointers on 38 percent shooting. His shooting took a hit on <TIMEX3 tid="t41" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> when he hit just 3-of-12 shots, but he’s getting enough minutes (27.8 in his last five) to make a fantasy dent, and his shooting should be better than this going forward.  
 
Malcolm Brogdon Bucks 55% - Brogdon lost his job to Dellavedova and had scored six or fewer points in three of his last four games before bouncing back with 11 points and five assists on <TIMEX3 tid="t42" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>, although he hit just 4-of-12 shots. He’s averaging just 7.0 points, 2.0 rebounds, 5.2 assists, 1.4 steals and just 0.2 3-pointers in his five games since being moved to the bench. Brogdon has plenty of time to reclaim the job or make a comeback, but as long as Delly’s starting, things aren’t looking great for Brogdon.

Shooting Guards 
 
Dion Waiters Heat 58% - Waiters was at it again on <TIMEX3 tid="t44" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> with 17 points and seven assists, but hit just 1-of-9 3-pointers, or his line would have been a lot bigger.

He’ll take a bit of a hit once Tyler Johnson is back from his shoulder injury, which should happen any day. He’ll also get stung again by the return of Josh Richardson , but even with those guys lurking, Waiters is hot enough <TIMEX3 tid="t45" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">right now</TIMEX3> to be owned in all leagues. Just know that if you pick him up for the upcoming week, you probably missed the best five-game streak of his season.

He was 0-for-5 from downtown in that one, but had hit at least two 3-pointers in each of his previous six games. Forget about Friday’s dud and consider Shumpert a favorite to average around 15 points, 2.0 steals and close to 3.0 3-pointers going forward. 
 
Gary Harris Nuggets 63% - Harris came through on <TIMEX3 tid="t46" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> with 15 points, eight rebounds, four assists, two steals and a 3-pointers, but the Suns typically give it up to opposing guards. He’s averaging 11 points, 3.2 rebounds, 2.0 assists, 0.8 steals and 1.2 3-pointers on 45 percent shooting over his last five games, but he’d have a lot more fantasy appeal if Will Barton wasn’t getting <TIMEX3 tid="t48" type="DURATION" value="PT20M" mod="EQUAL_OR_MORE">at least 20 minutes</TIMEX3> night. 
 
Garrett Temple Kings 25% (and Arron Afflalo ) - I’m not a big Temple guy and there’s really no one from the Kings that I love filling in for Rudy Gay , who’s out for the season with a blown Achilles. But Temple appears to be the best of the bunch, getting <TIMEX3 tid="t50" type="DURATION" value="PT32M">32 minutes</TIMEX3> with 8.0 points, 2.2 rebounds, 2.6 assists, 2.0 steals and 0.8 3-points on 34 percent shooting over his last five games. Teammate Arron Afflalo might be a better flier, as he’s coming on and averaging 14 points, 1.3 rebounds, 2.3 assists and 3.0 3-pointers over his last three games, knocking down 9-of-15 shots in <TIMEX3 tid="t54" type="DURATION" value="PT34M">34 minutes</TIMEX3> a night in the process. 
 
Small Forwards 
 
Caris LeVert Nets 18% - LeVert has sat out two of his last four games for “rest,” but still has a ton of upside and could play heavy minutes the rest of the way for the dead-end Nets. He played <TIMEX3 tid="t57" type="DURATION" value="PT27M">27 minutes</TIMEX3> on <TIMEX3 tid="t55" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> and hit 4-of-8 shots for 11 points, four rebounds, two steals, a block and a 3-pointer. He played <TIMEX3 tid="t60" type="DURATION" value="PT26M">26 minutes</TIMEX3> on <TIMEX3 tid="t58" type="DATE" value="2017-01-25">Wednesday</TIMEX3> and had 12 points, four assists and a 3-pointer, and while he’s not yet a must-own player, he’s getting pretty close. Hopefully his days of getting random nights off are over. 
 
Marvin Williams Hornets 67% - Williams has quietly scored in double figures in four straight games and is averaging 13.2 points, 4.8 rebounds, 1.6 assists, 1.0 steals, 0.6 blocks and 2.2 3-pointers on 43 percent shooting in <TIMEX3 tid="t64" type="DURATION" value="PT29M">29 minutes</TIMEX3> over his last five games. He’s not nearly as fun to own as he was last season, but is coming on a bit for the Hornets. 
 
Michael Kidd-Gilchrist Hornets 57% - MKG only played <TIMEX3 tid="t67" type="DURATION" value="PT19M">19 minutes</TIMEX3> on <TIMEX3 tid="t65" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> but there are no reports of an injury. He had four fouls, so I’m going to say that’s the reason for his low minutes in a tough loss to the Kings. Despite the bench time, he had nine points, six rebounds and tied his season high with four blocks in that one. He’s averaging 12.2 points, 8.4 rebounds, 1.8 blocks and is shooting 58 percent over his last five games. He doesn’t hit 3-pointers and won’t get a ton of steals, but is still worth a look in all leagues <TIMEX3 tid="t68" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">right now</TIMEX3>. 
 
Khris Middleton Bucks 39% - Middleton is nearing a return and while we don’t know how long it will take him to get into basketball shape, he’s hard to ignore after averaging 18.2 points, 3.8 rebounds, 4.2 assists, 1.7 steals and 1.8 3-pointers last season. He’s targeting a return near the All-Star break and I like him better as a stash than Ben Simmons , simply because we still don’t have any idea when Simmons will make his debut with the Sixers. 
 
Jaylen Brown Celtics 4% - Brown has started in two straight games as Al Horford sits with a groin injury. Brown blew up for a career-high 20 points, eight rebounds and two 3-pointers in <TIMEX3 tid="t73" type="DURATION" value="PT30M">30 minutes</TIMEX3> on <TIMEX3 tid="t71" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3>. He then started again on <TIMEX3 tid="t76" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> and had nine points, eight rebounds, two steals, a block and a 3-pointer in <TIMEX3 tid="t78" type="DURATION" value="PT28M">28 minutes</TIMEX3>, hitting 3-of-9 shots. He’s far from a must-own player, but if Horford’s injury lingers, or if Brad Stevens decides he’s ready to roll with Brown, he’s at least worth a spot on your watch list. 
 
Power Forwards 
 
  
 
Terrence Jones Pelicans 59% - Jones bounces in and out of the starting lineup like nobody’s business, but is getting solid minutes, regardless. And with Anthony Davis constantly getting banged up and visiting the locker room during games, TJ is the ultimate handcuff for the Brow. And even with Brown playing on most nights, Jones is averaging 17.8 points, 7.0 rebounds, 1.0 steals, 1.4 blocks and 1.0 3-pointers on 51 percent shooting in <TIMEX3 tid="t82" type="DURATION" value="PT25M">25 minutes</TIMEX3> per game over his last five. He should be owned across the board. 
 
David Lee Spurs 43% - Lee has played in nine straight games, so he’s due to get Popped any day <TIMEX3 tid="t83" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> with a DNP. But with Pau Gasol out indefinitely, Lee is suddenly very relevant, scoring in double figures in five straight games with double-doubles in three of those. He’s averaging 12.6 points and 9.8 rebounds on 62 percent shooting in <TIMEX3 tid="t87" type="DURATION" value="PT29M">29 minutes</TIMEX3> over his last five games, but he doesn’t do much besides make shots and crash the boards. 
 
P.J. Tucker Suns 20% - Tucker had another nice line on <TIMEX3 tid="t90" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> with 12 points, six boards, five assists, a steal and two 3-pointers in <TIMEX3 tid="t92" type="DURATION" value="PT36M">36 minutes</TIMEX3>. He’s averaging 11.4 points, 5.8 rebounds, 2.6 assists, 2.0 steals and 1.4 3-pointers on 49 percent shooting in a whopping <TIMEX3 tid="t94" type="DURATION" value="PT35M">35 minutes</TIMEX3> per game off the bench over his last five. 
 
Jon Leuer Pistons 43% - Leuer was a dud with just eight points and one rebound in <TIMEX3 tid="t99" type="DURATION" value="PT24M">24 minutes</TIMEX3> on <TIMEX3 tid="t97" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>, but hit 4-of-5 shots. He scored 15 and 10 points in each of his previous two games and has hit 14-of-22 shots in his three games since returning from a knee injury. He should be a decent source of points, rebounds and 3-pointers while shooting it well and getting the occasional steals and blocks. He’s not a must-own player, but that could change as he rounds back into form. 
 
Spencer Hawes Hornets 1% - Hawes came off the bench for 12 points, seven rebounds and a block in <TIMEX3 tid="t104" type="DURATION" value="PT28M">28 minutes</TIMEX3> on <TIMEX3 tid="t102" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> and is averaging 9.3 points, 8.3 rebounds, 2.3 assists and 1.3 blocks on 39 percent shooting over his last three games. Cody Zeller is out with a quad injury <TIMEX3 tid="t105" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">right now</TIMEX3> and Hawes will certainly take a hit when he’s back, but as of this second, he’s at least worth a look in some leagues. And if Zeller continues to miss time, Hawes is a decent flier, especially as a cheap, DFS center. 
 
Bonus:  Anthony Tolliver and Willie Cauley-Stein both played well for the Kings on <TIMEX3 tid="t107" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>, and while they didn’t officially make this list, they’re worth keeping an eye on <TIMEX3 tid="t106" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">right now</TIMEX3> and should be available in most leagues. Tolliver finally had a good game with 14 points, seven boards, three assists, two steals, a block and four 3-pointers in <TIMEX3 tid="t111" type="DURATION" value="PT30M">30 minutes</TIMEX3>. He had scored six or fewer points in three of his previous four games, but Saturday’s line was more in line with what most of us were expecting when Gay went down. 
 
WCS played just <TIMEX3 tid="t114" type="DURATION" value="PT14M">14 minutes</TIMEX3> but hit 6-of-7 shots for 13 points and three rebounds, but if you’re going to take a flier on a big King, Tolliver’s the guy I’d aim for <TIMEX3 tid="t112" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">right now</TIMEX3>, but the bottom line is that I don’t trust him. 
 
Centers 
 
Ivica Zubac Lakers 19% - The 19-year-old phenom has double-doubled in two straight games and three of his last five, and the Lakers want to keep giving him minutes. The fact that Zubac is on the Lakers’ roster and so talented makes <TIMEX3 tid="t117" type="DATE" value="2017-SU">the summer</TIMEX3> signing of Timofey Mozgov that much more perplexing. The Zupacalypse is averaging 9.0 points, 7.6 rebounds and 1.4 blocks on 46 percent shooting over his last five games, but the poor shooting is a result of a 5-of-15 night against the Blazers <TIMEX3 tid="t118" type="DATE" value="2017-01-25">last Wednesday</TIMEX3>. He’s my favorite center to pick up <TIMEX3 tid="t120" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">right now</TIMEX3>. 
 
Willy Hernangomez Knicks 21% - Willy H has played well in three straight games and might be getting ready to be turned loose by the Knicks. He’s averaging 8.0 points, 10.3 rebounds, 1.0 steals and 0.5 blocks on 50 percent shooting over his last four. He’s likely to be a bit hit-or-miss going forward, but his arrow is pointing up. 
 
Jusuf Nurkic Nuggets 41% - I thought we might have a Nurk Alert, as Nikola Jokic was out on <TIMEX3 tid="t121" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> and will miss at least one more game with his weird hip injury, but Nurkic didn’t come through. He started, but played just <TIMEX3 tid="t123" type="DURATION" value="PT15M">15 minutes</TIMEX3> and finished with five points, four rebounds and nothing else. While that’s a lot better than the DNP he had on <TIMEX3 tid="t124" type="DATE" value="2017-01-26">Thursday</TIMEX3>, Nurkic continues to sit in the shadows in Denver. I would not be at all surprised to see him start again on <TIMEX3 tid="t125" type="DATE" value="2017-01-24">Tuesday</TIMEX3> against the Lakers, and have a big game against them, but using him in that one is a complete roll of the dice. The Nuggets basically rolled without a center for most of the night on <TIMEX3 tid="t126" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> and Tyson Chandler had a big night because of it. But if Jokic is going to miss more than just one more game, Nurkic should at least still be on watch lists until we see how this plays out. 
 
Willie Reed Heat 7% - Hassan Whiteside played through his sprained ankle on <TIMEX3 tid="t127" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>, but wasn’t great against a tough Pistons’ defense. Reed, who started for an injured Whiteside on <TIMEX3 tid="t128" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3>, played <TIMEX3 tid="t130" type="DURATION" value="PT19M">19 minutes</TIMEX3> and had just two points, five rebounds and three blocks in that one. In Saturday’s start, he went off for 20 points and five rebounds on 9-of-11 shooting. Reed is not a must-own player, by any stretch, but with constant chatter about Whiteside being a shutdown candidate, Reed does have some fantasy appeal <TIMEX3 tid="t131" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">right now</TIMEX3>. Any time Whiteside is out Reed looks like a must-start player, and if Whitey ever goes down for an extended period of time, Reed would quickly become one of the hotter pickups in the league. But for <TIMEX3 tid="t132" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> you can probably leave him on the waiver wire, unless you have a deep bench and want Whiteside insurance. 
 
Dewayne Dedmon Spurs 4% - Dedmon’s minutes have been all over the place since Pau Gasol went down. He’s played 19, 10, 29, <TIMEX3 tid="t135" type="DURATION" value="PT19M">19</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t134" type="DURATION" value="PT8M">8 minutes</TIMEX3> in each of his last five games, so it’s tough to rely on him, obviously. He’s averaging just 5.2 points, 5.0 rebounds, 0.6 steals and 0.2 blocks on 63 percent shooting over his last five games. He could turn it on at any time if Gregg Popovich commits to him for <TIMEX3 tid="t138" type="DURATION" value="PT20M" mod="EQUAL_OR_MORE">at least 20 minutes</TIMEX3> per night, but for <TIMEX3 tid="t136" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3>, he’s probably more deserving of a spot on your watch list than he is a spot in your lineup.
