Typically produced using an old-school technique[1], block prints (like the one featured in this elegant gold paisley canopy) often come in soft paisleys, small-scale repeats, and graphic, modern patterns. The beauty of block printing is that though it often has a delicate, faded look, it can work wonders in even the most modern room.References^ old-school technique (www.southernliving.com)
