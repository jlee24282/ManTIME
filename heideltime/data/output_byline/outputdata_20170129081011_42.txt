Â MORNING EVERYONE! 

And what are you up to this fine morning?? I'll tell you what, don't bother with whatever it is - put the kettle on, grab a slice of toast and put your feet up because have we got an Australian Open final. 

Roger Federer meets Rafael Nadal in a Grand Slam final for the first time since the French Open in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2011">2011</TIMEX3>. 

One last rodeo for two of the greats or a rivalry renewed for the rest of the <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> season - we are about to find out!
