JOLIET – Joliet Junior College officials plan to discuss the college’s budget, tuition and course fees at Tuesday’s board workshop meeting.  
   
The JJC Board of Trustees will review a <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P3Y">three-year</TIMEX3> financial plan and give input on the college’s <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> budget projections.  
 
The board will also review a presentation on tuition and course fees that will include a recommendation from the administration on those items for <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P2018Y">the 2018 fiscal year</TIMEX3>, Kelly Rohder, the college’s spokeswoman, stated in an email. 
 
No formal action will take place at the meeting.  
 
Departments and divisions across the college are finalizing their budget sheets, which will go toward building and determining what the final budget will be for <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2018">fiscal 2018</TIMEX3>, which begins <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2017-07-01">July 1</TIMEX3>, Rohder stated.  
 
JJC, like many colleges and universities statewide , has been struggling with uncertainty in state funding. The college is looking into ways to control costs, such as scheduling efficiency and tuition increases.  
 
The state has been in a budget crisis for <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P2Y">two years</TIMEX3> because of a stalemate between Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner and a Democrat-controlled Legislature.  
 
While Rauner and lawmakers enacted appropriations for all levels of education – including higher education – in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2016">fiscal 2016</TIMEX3>, colleges and universities sustained <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3>-to-year cut of about $1.3 billion from <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2015">fiscal 2015</TIMEX3> levels, according to the Center for Tax and Budget Accountability , a bipartisan research and advocacy organization. 
 
The stopgap budget for <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2017">fiscal 2017</TIMEX3>, which has since expired, appropriated $700 million to higher education – a $73 million increase over <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2016">fiscal 2016</TIMEX3> levels – but it is $1.25 billion less than <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2015">fiscal 2015</TIMEX3>, according to the CTBA. 
 
In response to unreliable state funding, JJC has identified contingency items in its budget, closed its Small Business Development Center and approved a tax levy that does not rebate back to taxpayers the interest earned on bonds for major projects.  
 
<TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2016">Last year</TIMEX3>, the board approved a tuition increase in a 5-2 vote that college officials said was needed to cover projected budget deficits, funding priorities for a federal grant, the City Center Campus and marketing costs.  
 
Trustee Maureen Broderick, one of the supporters of the increase, said at the time the college was caught in a “political war of funding” and needed to be prepared if it didn’t receive state money.  
 
At the <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2017-01-10">Jan. 10</TIMEX3> board meeting, some residents asked college officials to keep tuition affordable.
