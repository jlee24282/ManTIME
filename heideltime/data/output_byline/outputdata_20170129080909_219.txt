Nick Lindner looked at the scoreboard and saw numbers he could not accept. 
 
Lafayette's senior leader never left the floor as he tried to lead his team back from a 28-point deficit. He and his teammates couldn't overcome their dreadful start despite the effort they delivered in the final <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="PT26M">26 minutes</TIMEX3>. 
 
The Leopards clawed as close as one point in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2018-H2">the second half</TIMEX3>, forcing Loyola University Maryland coach G.G. Smith to call a timeout with <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="PT10M">10 minutes</TIMEX3>, <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="PT1S">1 second</TIMEX3> to play. The Greyhounds steadied themselves with a 10-0 spurt and held on for a 70-62 win in a Patriot League men's basketball game <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TAF">Saturday afternoon</TIMEX3> at Kirby Sports Center. 
 
"We knew they were going to come out and just really pressure us," Lafayette coach Fran O'Hanlon said. "I thought we did a terrific job after the first <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="PT10M">10 minutes</TIMEX3> of just starting to defend and playing with some energy that we needed. 
 
"You expend so much energy trying to get back into that game. At the end, they made the plays when we had cut it. You've got to give them credit. We had some momentum." 
 
Lafayette (6-15 overall, 2-8 Patriot League) looked like it might get blown off its home floor for a third straight game early. The Leopards trailed by 10 points just <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="PT5M" mod="MORE_THAN">over 5 minutes</TIMEX3> into the game. They were down 37-9 when Cam Gregory dropped in a layup with 6:30 to play in the opening half. 
  
Lindner led Lafayette's rally. He scored a team-high 21 points and handed out seven assists while playing all <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION" value="PT40M">40 minutes</TIMEX3>. Eighteen of his points and all his assists came in the final 26:30. 
 
"To be honest, I think we started to play a little bit angry," Lindner said. "We're on our home floor, and we go down that fast that much, it was a little bit embarrassing. I think every single one of us just dug down and played harder because that's just not how we want to go out in any game. 
 
"I think our team showed great resiliency and some maturity for a young team." 
  
Loyola Maryland's top three players made sure it wouldn't squander its huge lead. Jarred Jones, Gregory and Andre Walker combined for all 10 points during the 10-0 run the Greyhounds' produced after Lafayette closed within 48-47. Lafayette never got closer than two possessions again. 
 
Gregory led Loyola Maryland (11-10, 5-5) with 21 points and 14 rebounds. His size and strength inside helped the Greyhounds amass a 42-20 edge in points in the paint. 
 
Jones added 18 points, going over 1,000 for his career. Walker, a 6-0 junior, scuffled through a 1-for-<TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DURATION" value="P13D">13 day</TIMEX3> from the field but grabbed seven rebounds. 
 
Matt Klinewski scored 10 points and had five rebounds to join Lindner in double figures for Lafayette. Parkland High School graduate Kyle Stout chipped in with eight points and four boards. 
 
Lafayette couldn't produce enough offense to avoid a seventh straight loss since its 2-1 start to Patriot League play. The Leopards' schedule grows tougher when the calendar flips to <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2017-02">February</TIMEX3>. Five of their final eight Patriot League games come on the road, including trips to Boston University and Bucknell. 
 
"You come out of this game wanting to win the next one, just hungrier to win the next one, because it doesn't get easier in this league," Lindner said. "The balance in this league is unbelievable, so if we can string together a winning streak, you never know where we could end up."
