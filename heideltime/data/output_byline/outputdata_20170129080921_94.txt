<TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="TIME" value="XXXX-XX-XXT20:55">8:55pm</TIMEX3>: That wraps up the Wellington Sevens for another year. A fantastic tournament for the likes of Scotland and Canada but a poor finish for the All Blacks Sevens after showing such promise <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">yesterday</TIMEX3>. The series <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> heads to Sydney <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-W05-WE">next weekend</TIMEX3> with South Africa well and truly sitting top of the table after a commanding weekend. 
   
<TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28T20:50">8:50pm</TIMEX3>: South Africa 26 v Fiji 5 - Cup FINAL 
   
It's a glorious gold for South Africa as Seabelo Senatla achieves his own personal milestone in become the top try scorer of all time for the Blitzboks with 180. They're Champions in Wellington for the first time since <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2002">2002</TIMEX3>, and they stretch their lead at the top of the HSBC <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3>-<TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017">17</TIMEX3> Sevens Series standings. 
   
<TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28T20:40">8:40pm</TIMEX3>: Halftime: South Africa 7 v Fiji 5 - Cup FINAL 
   
Two points and a Fiji yellow card is all that separates the two teams. Both giving it their all so far! 
   
<TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28T20:18">8:18pm</TIMEX3>: Scotland 28 v Canada 22 - 3rd Place 
   
Scotland the Brave!  Canada held the lead with <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="193">30s</TIMEX3> to go but James Fleming seals the day with his third try of the game and carries Scotland to bronze. They are already celebrating on the pitch and can you really blame them? The hat-trick hero says it was a full squad effort that produced <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2017-W04-WE">this weekend</TIMEX3>'s result. "It was an enjoyable game, it was a whole squad effort. We have been building for <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="P2Y">the last two years</TIMEX3>, new coach, consistent squad, and Twickenham gave us belief. We’re looking forward to the next one. We are hitting quarters and semis consistently <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> and it is awesome to have the squad we do." 
   
<TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28T19:48">7:48pm</TIMEX3>: NZL 12-17 ARG 
   
TRY! Pumas win it at the death as NZL choke up the ball with pass to who knows inside their own half. The ball goes to ground and Argentina grubber it on and they're in as the hooter goes. That's that then. Two more games to go - Scotland v Canada for 3rd and South Africa v Fiji for the cup! 
   
<TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28T19:46">7:46pm</TIMEX3>: NZL 12-12 ARG 
   
TRY! All Blacks Sevens with a costly turnover i ntheir own 22 after they are penalised for not releasing the pill. Argentina jump on it and score far right corner. Game on with <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DURATION" value="PT1M">a minute</TIMEX3> to go! 
   
<TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28T19:42">7:42pm</TIMEX3>: NZL 12-7 ARG 
   
TRY! Curry's in after the ABs Sevens get a penalty inside Argentina's 22 for offside. The setpiece is a double cut and Curry comes onto the second change of direction at pace and there's no stopping him 5m out. NZ back in front! 
   
<TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28T19:39">7:39pm</TIMEX3>: NZL 5-7 ARG 
   
Koroi shows another piece of magic to get into open field before delivering a no-look flick pass to Curry. Curry is brought down on Argentina's forty and he knocks it on! Halftime. 
   
<TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28T19:37">7:37pm</TIMEX3>: NZL 5-7 ARG

<TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28T19:30">7:30pm</TIMEX3>: NZL 0-0 ARG  
   
We're underway in the fifth place final. Argentina to kick off.Mikkelson is injured early and it looks like a finger or thumb dislocation. He's on the side getting addressed to. 
   
<TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28T19:20">7:20pm</TIMEX3>: Kenya 19 v Australia 17 - Trophy FINAL 
   
WHAT A FINISH! Kenya was up 19-12 with seconds to go before a costly turnover gives Australia the ball in Kenya's half. Australia apply pressure and get a penalty close to the line. They take it quickly and dot down right in the left corner for a tough conversion. The drop kick goes up and it's beautiful, it's got the length but it curls away from the right post and it's just wide! Kenya claim the trophy in another stunning final! More of this to come please! 
   
<TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28T18:46">6:46pm</TIMEX3>: Russia 12 v Samoa 19 - 13th Place FINAL 
   
Tietjens' men finish on a high note in another physical match. Samoa had nearly double the tackles than their European opponents but they didn't budge in the final moments. Samoan captain Tila Mealoi wrapped up their weekend saying they are still developing under the Kiwi coach. "I'm proud of my team, it's quite young and there are a few new guys in the team. We are really happy and really proud. We have given a springboard to the new guys, and we are <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> working on some structure with Sir Gordon. There is a big improvement in our fitness, which is the first thing we are looking at." 
   
<TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28T18:03">6:03pm</TIMEX3>: Canada 5 v South Africa 21 - Cup SF 
   
The Blitzboks were just too fast. Ans when Canada realised that and went physical, the South Africans beat them at the breakdowns too. Clinical performance from South Africa as it has been all tournament. We are in for two thrilling matches to close the tournament. The final will be at <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28T20:30">8:30pm.</TIMEX3> 
   
<TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28T17:43">5:43pm</TIMEX3>: Scotland 12 v Fiji 19 - Cup SF 
   
Heartbreaking for the Scots. They held a five point lead with <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DURATION" value="PT2M">two minutes</TIMEX3> to go but the Flying Fijians find the line twice. You can't help but feel for the Scots. They were playing brilliant rugby but their opponents find a second gear and took the lead with <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DATE" value="193">30s</TIMEX3> to go before a penalty on the hooter saw them tap and gap for another try to secure it with a statement. Brilliant match regardless. Up next is Canada and South Africa. Can the Canadians do the unthinkable? 
   
<TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28T17:13">5:13pm</TIMEX3>: Argentina 19 v France 14 - 5th Place SF 
   
So it'll be Argentina that takes on the All Blacks Sevens in the 5th place final. The Los Pumas Sevens made twice as many tackles as France but never let that defence fall in crucial times.  
   
<TIMEX3 tid="t36" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28T16:50">4:50pm</TIMEX3>: NZL 24-0 ENG 
   
TRY! Stowers goes in in the far right corner on the fulltime hooter and that's a performance much more like <TIMEX3 tid="t37" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">yesterday</TIMEX3>'s dominance. All Blacks Sevens looked the better team the entire match and discipline let England down big time. Easily man of the match has to go tou youngster Koroi. His first ever Sevens Series and he is proving to be quite the playmaker. NZL <TIMEX3 tid="t38" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> wait on the winner of Argentina v France to find their opponent for the 5th place final. 
   
<TIMEX3 tid="t39" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28T16:42">4:42pm</TIMEX3>: NZL 17-0 ENG 
   
TRY! That might just be the nail in the coffin! Beautiful skip pass again from Koroi and it's Iopu-Aso is over the chalk in the left corner.  
   
<TIMEX3 tid="t40" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28T16:38">4:38pm</TIMEX3>: NZL 12-0 ENG 
   
TRY! Set piece inside the 22 off a penalty tap and Ware is the benefactor this time from another great pass by Koroi. The youngster is playing superb! That takes us to halftime.

TRY! The captain's in under the posts! Brilliant hands on a play that started in their own 22! Koroi breaks away and gets a flashy pass off to his skipper to score. Great start! 
   
<TIMEX3 tid="t43" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28T16:30">4:30pm</TIMEX3>: NZL 0-0 ENG - 5th Place SF

<TIMEX3 tid="t44" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29T15:42">3:42pm</TIMEX3>: Australia 24 v Wales 10 - Trophy SF 
   
McDermott and Taylor have led a fiery performance by the Australians to book a Trophy final with Kenya after seeing off Wales. Both youngsters were aggressive from the first whistle and happy to take risks to break the line to claim the win - it worked. 
   
<TIMEX3 tid="t45" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29T15:18">3:18pm</TIMEX3>: Kenya 19 v USA 12 - Trophy SF 
   
Kenya have held on against the USA in a thrilling, flying trophy semi-final. Both teams making impressive breaks but chsed down by some of the fastest in the game.

<TIMEX3 tid="t48" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29T14:36">2:36pm</TIMEX3>:  Russia come out ahead of Japan in a physical 15-5 clash.
