On the heels of Mayweather and UFC President Dana White throwing out offers through the media, McGregor has confirmed that Mayweather is the opponent he wants to face next. Bottom line, there will be more than sufficent interest in the event, as a spectacle, as much as anything to see the lead up with McGregor talking mad shit on Floyd. In particular, he noted that girlfriend Dee Devlin gets nervous when he fights - but that likely wouldn't happen at a pro wrestling appearance. 
 
" Dana White: I've always shown  #Conor nothing but respect & if he wants to go down that road with us". 
 
"I believe the next time I step into a combat arena will be through the ropes". 
 
"I believe this is the first billion fight, so people have to pay for a billion dollar fight", said McGregor, who added that Mayweather needs special rules to protect him. 
 
'I believe the fight can happen. It's smoother if we get everybody involved. Of course, money is the biggest obstacle and one that won't be hurdled unless UFC is completely on board. 
 
"I'm going to go to Las Vegas, get my boxing license and then we see where the f*** Floyd's at". 
 
The first American female wrestler who took the gold at the Rio Olympics got a tip or two from "The Notorious", sparking belief that the 25-year-old young lady may be on her way to the UFC soon. 
 
Floyd Mayweather might have rejected the offer, but another legendary boxer is willing to take the challenge. And there have been rumors that WWE has been in talks with the UFC and McGregor. The two have been going at it in public for some time <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> and fight fans have been starting to question whether the two are ever going to actually come to blows in the end. I've got the youth. You can't prepare for a style like me. 
 
Conor McGregor and WWE have had a rather complicated relationship. "Let me tell you, it'll be an epic fall." .
