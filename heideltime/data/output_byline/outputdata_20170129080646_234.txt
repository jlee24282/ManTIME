WEST LAFAYETTE — College football pundits and analysts have largely praised Purdue’s decision to hire coach Jeff Brohm from Western Kentucky. But for Jeffersonville quarterback Cameron Northern, it was “the perfect move.” 
 
Northern announced on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> that he has accepted a spot as a preferred walk-on at Purdue. His early connection with Brohm when the coach was at Western Kentucky helped set the stage. 
 
“Before that I was going to go to play NAIA or Division II,” Northern said. “I got a hold of them and asked them about being a preferred walk-on. They said they’d love to have me and would be excited to have me and possibly earn a scholarship eventually." 
 
The 6-foot-1 quarterback started to develop a relationship with Brohm, his brothers and running backs coach Chris Barkley when the coaches were at Western Kentucky. The quarterback attended several camp and felt he was on the cusp of making his decision when Brohm and much of his staff replaced Darrell Hazell at Purdue. 
 
The coaching staff stayed in contact with Northern, and on <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3> Brohm visited Northern’s high school. Northern said the move is ideal in a lot of ways because he’ll be able to get in-state tuition and be just 180 miles from home on I-65. 
 
"It was the perfect move once they moved there," Northern said. "It just set things up.” 
 
Purdue <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> has five quarterback on its <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-SP">spring</TIMEX3> football roster. The group is led by rising junior David Blough, who started every game last season and led the Big Ten with nearly 280 passing yards per game. 
 
The Boilers are also expected to sign a pair of quarterbacks on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-01-25">Wednesday</TIMEX3>'s signing day: Nicholas Sipe, a pro-style QB from California, and Griffin Alstott, a dual-threat QB who is the son of former Boilermaker great Mike Alstott.  
 
Northern said he's looking forward to joining the team and working toward playing time.  
 
“I’ve always dreamed of playing Division I football,” Northern said. “I was never give the opportunity of a full-ride. But once the preferred walk-on opportunity came along, I thought I should follow my dreams and try to pursue it and maybe <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P1D">one day</TIMEX3> play.”
