FAIRBANKS — In this first historical romance by local author Laurie G. Robertson, a young pioneer woman named Kallie sets out for a new life with her husband’s family along the Oregon Trail, only for all her plans to be pulled out from under her when their caravan is attacked and her husband murdered. 
   
Taken captive by an Indian warrior, Kallie must rely on her stubborn inner strength and knowledge of healing to survive in a strange world of war bands, buffalo hunting and hidden dangers. Her struggle for survival and eventual surrender to passion for her captor, Brave Eagle, drives the adventure of “Crossing at Sweet Grass.” 
   
First, the elephant in the room: yes, this entire premise can generously be called dated. Less generously: racist. There’s a small sub-genre of romances with basically this same plot, following the archaic “captivity narrative” of <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="16">the 17th</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="18">19th centuries</TIMEX3>, and even the best of them toe some very uncomfortable lines of cultural fetishism, imperialist grandstanding and stereotypes. 
   
“Crossing at Sweet Grass” is not among the best. Its depiction of Brave Eagle’s generically tribal band is not malicious, but it does fall into several stereotypical tropes ranging from “noble savage” to “savage monster” that are uncomfortable to find in a novel from <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3>. That all the Native characters have names like Flaming Arrow, Pretty Shield and Weasel Tail is the least of it. 
   
And, to be fair, the white characters aside from Kallie herself don’t fare much better. Most are flat at best, save Kallie’s shrewish sister-in-law, who is captured alongside her and often exemplifies the worst of the decidedly non-civilized civilization they’ve left behind. However, she also seems to have been included in the story just to spare Kallie the worst of the captivity narrative (including multiple rapes) and the narrative spares her little sympathy in that regard. 
   
It’s also a self-published book, Robertson’s first, and this is unfortunately obvious from certain weaknesses in pacing and style. The first 15 pages alone contain enough plot points for <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-H1">the first half</TIMEX3> of a novel, including the aforementioned massacre, three escape attempts, two bathing voyeurism scenes, at least one rape and a lot of backstory. Each of these are addressed in a single paragraph at most, leaving no room for “show,” only tell. Hardly the most engaging. 
   
On the positive side, the style gets much better as the story goes on. By about the halfway point, the scenes are allowed to be scenes with pacing and subtly and emotional impact, to the point that a reader can come to genuinely care for the main leads despite their rather flat and/or stereotypical personalities. 
   
Also, unlike a lot of romances, there’s enough going on that the story feels active and even somewhat dense for a 240-page run. The result is ultimately a more satisfying read than, say, your average Nicholas Sparks novel. It’s just a shame that so much of the good is lost in unfortunate implications and a very under-developed <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-H1">first half</TIMEX3>. 
   
“Crossing at Sweet Grass” is available online or at Gulliver’s Books in Fairbanks.
