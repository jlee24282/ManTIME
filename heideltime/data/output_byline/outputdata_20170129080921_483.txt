A close contest between the Congress and the Aam Aadmi party seems to be on the cards in Punjab with the entry of firebrand leader and former Rajya Sabha MP Navjot Singh Sidhu providing a much needed boost to the Congress party in the run up to the state Assembly polls, scheduled to be held on <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-02-04">February 4</TIMEX3>. Mr Sidhu's entry on the campaign trail for the Conrgess has acted as a morale booster for the party, which <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> senses an opportunity of regaining power in the state after a <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P10Y">10 years</TIMEX3> of the rule of the BJP-Akali Dal government. He may have made a late entry in the Conrgess- his joining the Congress came <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="P2M" mod="LESS_THAN">almost two months</TIMEX3> after the entry of his wife Navjot Kaur Sidhu- but party sources say that his whirlwind campaign has provided sails to the campaign of the Congress , which has been facing a tough challenge to the party in the state. Political analysts say Sidhu's speeches, made in his characteristic style, replete with one liners, couplets and quotes, his conversing with the people of the state in their local Punjabi language and his fluency in English, Hindi as well as Punjabi, had led his rallies to evoke a rousing receptions among the crowds. While Sidhu has been busy campaigning throughout Punjab, sources said that he has been asked by the Congress to concentrate on 30-35, including seats where the Congress lost by a small margin in the <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2012">2012</TIMEX3> assembly elections. Party leaders feel that with Mr Sidhu leading the campaign, these seats could go in favour of the Congress in these polls. Infact, Mr Sidhu's wife has been indulging in a door-to-door campaign in Amritsar (East), from where she is a sitting MLA and from where Mr Sidhu is contesting this time, to seek votes for her husband. The Congress leaders claim that the party would bag all four Assembly segments in Amritsar city, given the huge popularity enjoyed by Sidhu in the region. They also point out that BJP candidates in the region, as also in other parts of the state have been on the defensive in the issue of demonetisation. BJP's candidate from Amritsar North Anil Joshi, a minister in the Badal government, has been apologising for demonetisation. In his public meetings in his constituency, Mr Joshi has been urging voters not to punish him for what Modiji has done. However, notwithstanding the boost provided by Mr Sidhu's entry into the Congress, a number of political observers say that AAP continues to pose a tough challenge to the party in the state. Though <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="PXM">the last few months</TIMEX3> have witnessed a slight drop in popularity of the Aam Aadmi Party, political analysts say that AAP continues to enjoy a huge popularity among the youth of the state. Infact, AAP's campaign against the drug menace in the state <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="PXM" mod="MORE_THAN">over the past few months</TIMEX3> has struck a chord among the youth of the state which form a sizeable per cent of its population. Infact, the AAP manifesto for the Punjab elections made several promises to alleviate the situation cause by drug addiction in the state. The manifesto outlined a series of steps to tackle the rampant drug use problem among Punjab's youth: government jobs to recovering addicts, free de-addiction centres, life imprisonment for convicted drug dealers and random blood and urine tests for candidates running for office. In its manifesto AAP also promised free laptops for students ahead of their board exams, meals costing just Rs5 at subsidized canteens, cheaper electricity and the abolition of property tax , all of which are likely to draw a sizeable section of the voters to Arvind Kejriwal's Party . Political observers say that given the huge anger and resentment among the people of Punjab for the BJP Akali Dal regime, the Akali Dal-BJP Governmet in the state is headed for a rout. In this sense, they say that the real fight for the anti-Badal votes is between AAP and the Congress. Both the Congress and AAP are hoping that the voters disgruntled with the ruling party would vote for them in the elections. Though it is a neck and neck battle between Congress and AAP, analysts say that despite the setbacks suffered by AAP in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent months</TIMEX3>, including the desertion from its ranks, it has a slight edge in the contest in Punjab between the Congress and the Arvind Kejriwal led party. Political observers say that while Congress has an edge over AAP in Majha region, in areas like Malwa, which accounts for a number of seats, AAP continues to have a strong presence. This, coupled with the fact that AAP has a strong following among youth makes it a formidable opponent to the Congress. It is a battle that is sure to "go down to the wire". UNI AR SHS ADG 1229
