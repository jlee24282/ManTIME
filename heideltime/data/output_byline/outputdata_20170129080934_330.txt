Screen Actors Guild Awards

TBS and TNT, 8 ET/5 PT

By all rights, the Screen Actors Guild Awards should be a bigger deal, seeing as they’re given to actors by actors — who should know a thing or two about acting. Yet it has always existed deep in the shadow of the Oscars, Emmys and, Lord help us, the completely preposterous Golden Globes. Sunday’s edition may be worth watching for the Life Achievement Award recipient alone: Lily Tomlin, who will collect her prize from 9 to 5 co-stars Jane Fonda and Dolly Parton.

Elementary

CBS, 10 ET/PT

The trouble with working with a great detective is you inevitably get kidnapped. (Just ask poor Peggy from Mannix). That’s Joan’s fate <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-W04">this week</TIMEX3>, as she’s one of a group of hostages seized by a man who threatens to kill them unless Sherlock finds the person who killed his son. Tony winner Shuler Hensley is among the guest stars.

The Affair/Conviction

Showtime/ABC, 10 ET/PT

Both shows air their season finales <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3>, facing very different futures. The Affair has already been renewed for a fourth season, while Conviction — which had its first-season episode order capped at 13 — waits to hear if it will return. Odds are good it won’t, but in an era when dead shows routinely <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-SP">spring</TIMEX3> back to life, you never know.
