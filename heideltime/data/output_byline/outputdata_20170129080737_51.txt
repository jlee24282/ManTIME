A wave of Palestinian attacks that erupted in <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2015-10">October 2015</TIMEX3> has resulted in the deaths of 252 Palestinians, 40 Israelis, two Americans, a Jordanian, an Eritrean and a Sudanese. 
 
Most of the Palestinians killed were carrying out knife, gun or car-ramming attacks, according to Israeli authorities, with others killed during protests, in clashes or air raids on Gaza.
