The Lawton-Fort Sill Art Council will kick off its Free Children's Workshops for <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> with a <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-02-14">Valentine's Day</TIMEX3> Bash <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> at The Art Center, <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="1701">1701</TIMEX3> NW Ferris. 
 
The council did not host a workshop in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-01">January</TIMEX3> in order to get its bearings, according to President D'esirae Schneider. It will bring back the <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="SET" value="XXXX-XX">monthly</TIMEX3> workshops starting <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>, and children will be able to create homemade <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-02-14">Valentine's Day</TIMEX3> cards and gifts along with <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-02-14">Valentine's Day</TIMEX3> themed crafts. 
 
The workshops are for those who are old enough to hold a paintbrush, according to Schneider. Parents are asked to stay with their children for the duration of the workshop, which lasts from <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="TIME" value="2017-02-14T10:00">10 a.m.</TIMEX3> to noon the first <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> of <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="SET" value="P1M" quant="EACH">each month</TIMEX3>. Schneider believes the workshop is a good time for parents to take a break from their busy lives, slow down and spend time with their children. 
 
"It's <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="PT2H">two hours</TIMEX3>  come in, away from the hustle and bustle," Schneider said. "Forget you have laundry. Forget you have to go grocery shopping or work on the car. Lose yourself in your kids and their imagination. It's so cool to watch their little minds work." 
 
She also believes the workshops are a moment for children to get back to using their imaginations. 
 
"They're kind of told what to do everyday, and it's nice for them to come and paint a tree blue and the sky purple," Schneider said. "The workshop lets them use their creativity and imagination, and I think that's so important; it lets them go back to their roots and get dirty and get clay and paint on them. There's something kind of primal about it." 
 
Schneider does need volunteers for the <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="SET" value="XXXX-XX">monthly</TIMEX3> children's workshop. She asks volunteers to come <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DURATION" value="PT30M">30 minutes</TIMEX3> before each workshop to help set up and to stay afterwards to help clean up. She also asks parents attending the workshop with their children to help clean around their children during the workshop.  
 
Schneider, Treasurer <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2016-04">April</TIMEX3> Weber and the council have hosted the event for <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DURATION" value="P4Y">four years</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3>, and they're happy to be able to provide an outlet for children and a way for families to spend quality time together. 
 
"I've watched these kids grow up," Schneider said. "They walked in when they were 1 and <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> they're turning 4. It's really cool to see moms pregnant with babies and <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> their babies are coming in. It's a lot of fun. Sometimes the parents can't afford the supplies that we have, so it's nice to be able to provide that for them."
