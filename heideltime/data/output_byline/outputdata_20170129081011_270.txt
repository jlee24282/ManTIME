CYPRESS — They applauded when he entered the track and shouted his name as he paraded past. 
 
Some even waved in his direction, what normally would be a bizarre reaction to a horse not at all unusual when the horse is California Chrome. 
 
It also mattered little that these folks, at the moment, were gathered nearly 3,000 miles away, watching the final race of his transcendent career on television. 
 
But then, distance never has been terribly relevant with Chrome, a horse to which the public always will feel close. 
 
So I joined them <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>, at Los Alamitos Race Course, where Chrome had been stabled since <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2014-01">January of 2014</TIMEX3>, to witness the $12-million Pegasus World Cup at Gulfstream Park near Miami. 
 
The result was a staggering disappointment, Chrome being eased up down the stretch, his anticipated rematch duel with Arrogate lost somewhere along the dirt oval. 
 
It wasn’t a storybook ending, just an ending, one that saw Chrome finish ninth out of 12 horses and nearly 30 lengths behind his rival. 
 
“There wasn’t enough gas in there,” jockey Victor Espinoza told reporters in Florida. “He was empty.” 
 
Empty at the end, but overflowing so much more often in a racing career that began on <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2013-04-26">April 26, 2013</TIMEX3>. 
 
Overflowing with winnings, Chrome earning $14.7 million to become the richest thoroughbred ever in North America. 
 
Overflowing with success, Chrome winning the Kentucky Derby, Preakness Stakes, Dubai World Cup and two “Horse of the Year” awards. 
 
Overflowing with drama, Chrome coming back from injury in <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3>, rebounding from a time when Espinoza said he looked “almost like he was anorexic.” 
 
Overflowing with feel-good, Chrome captivating hardened horsemen and casual observers alike with his modest pedigree and enormous heart. 
 
Overflowing with love, Chrome the subject of a collection of personal fan remembrances entitled, “How California Chrome Changed My Life.” 
 
“People always have related to this horse,” said Brad McKinzie, the general manager at Los Alamitos. “He represents the everyman. He doesn’t represent the aristocracy.” 
 
And he had fun along the way, inviting all of us to join him. Chrome has his own Facebook page. So do his fans. He also has a Twitter account. He has been sponsored by, among others, Breathe Right and Skechers. 
 
 
This horse is so popular that it’s almost as if people could line up for a turn to ride him, not unlike kids running the bases after an Angels game. 
 
At this track, a ritual developed <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P3Y" mod="MORE_THAN">over the past three years</TIMEX3> that saw fans congregating in the early morning chill and darkness just for the chance to watch Chrome go through the most basic of workouts. 
 
“The world is holding onto Chrome,” said Dr. Don Moore, a San Clemente chiropractor who works on the horse. “He is that Seabiscuit, that Secretariat. Everybody’s just grabbing on. The country is circling around him.” 
 
Chrome made a celebrity out of Art Sherman, the <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> 79-year-old trainer who previously was a journeyman in this game. 
 
Sherman, in fact, had to work part-time as a mutuel clerk during some of his barn’s more desperate times. 
 
<TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3>, everyone knows the trainer and the stories, like the one of how Sherman would rise most mornings at 4:45, drive to his barn here, walk over to Chrome’s stall and feed him a cookie. 
 
On Sherman’s cell phone, he has pictures of his star doing everything from racing to lounging. He also has photos of Chrome awesomely rearing on his hind legs during otherwise simple trips to the track for training. 
 
“He can get wound up,” Sherman explained <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3>. “When he does, he’s a lot of horse. That’s just him feeling good out there. He’s a stallion. He has other things on his mind sometimes.” 
 
Racing, however, apparently never fades too far away for Chrome. Sherman’s son and assistant, Alan, has the “Call to Post” bugle blast on his phone. Every time it’s played, Chrome genuinely comes to attention. 
 
But it’s on to his second career <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3>, Chrome scheduled to ship from Florida to the breeding shed at Taylor Made Farm in Kentucky. 
 
The breeders <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2017-W03">last week</TIMEX3> posted photos on Twitter of the brass plate that will mark Chrome’s new home. 
 
Meanwhile, his double-wide stall at Los Alamitos is <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> being occupied by Grade I winner Dortmund, who lost three times to Chrome in <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2016-12">a month ago</TIMEX3> was transferred to Sherman’s barn. 
 
“Chrome has a big second career coming up,” Sherman said. “He’ll have a lot of good mares to mess around with. I just hope I’m around to train some of his babies.” 
 
Immediately after the race <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>, not much was said among our group at Los Al. Most of the people walked away in silence. One fan, wearing a T-shirt that read, “This Guy Needs a Beer,” just kept shaking his head. 
 
The TV was positioned so that watching it meant facing out onto the track. Right there, maybe 100 yards away, was the finish line that California Chrome crossed first in <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2016-12">December</TIMEX3> at <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2017-WI">the Winter</TIMEX3> Challenge. 
 
It would be the final victory for this greatest of racehorses.
