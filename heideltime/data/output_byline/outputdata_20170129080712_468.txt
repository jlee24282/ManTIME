Summary  Background  
Folliculotropic mycosis fungoides (FMF) is an aggressive variant of mycosis fungoides (MF) and generally less responsive to standard skin-directed therapies (SDTs). <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">Recent</TIMEX3> studies distinguished an indolent (early-stage FMF) and a more aggressive (advanced-stage FMF) subgroup. The optimal treatment for both subgroups needs still to be defined. 
 Objectives  
Evaluation of initial treatment results in patients with early- and advanced-stage FMF. 
 Methods  
203 Patients (84 early-stage, 102 advanced-stage, 17 extracutaneous FMF), included in the Dutch Cutaneous Lymphoma Registry between <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="1985">1985</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2014">2014</TIMEX3> were studied. Type and results of initial treatment were retrieved from the Dutch Registry. Main outcomes were complete remission (CR), sustained complete remission (SCR), partial remission (>50% improvement; PR) and overall response (OR; CR+PR). 
 Results  
Patients with early-stage FMF were treated with non-aggressive SDTs in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="1967">67</TIMEX3> of 84 cases, resulting in CR and OR of 28% and 83% for monotherapy topical steroids, 0% and 83% for UVB and 30% and 88% for PUVA, respectively. In patients with advanced-stage FMF these SDTs were less effective (combined CR and OR: 10% and 52%, respectively). In patients with advanced-stage FMF local radiotherapy (CR 63%; OR: 100%), total skin electron beam irradiation (CR: 59%; OR: 100%) and PUVA combined with local radiotherapy (CR: 5%; OR: 75%) were most effective. 
 Conclusions  
The results of the present study demonstrate that not all patients with FMF should be treated aggressively. Patients with early-stage FMF may benefit very well from standard SDTs also used in early-stage classic MF and have an excellent prognosis.
