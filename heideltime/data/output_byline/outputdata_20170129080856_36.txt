Kokomo's boys basketball team looked out of sync early against Lewis Cass' 2-3 zone and found itself down 17-9 midway through <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2016-Q2">the second quarter</TIMEX3>. 
 
The Kats picked up their defensive pressure to turn the game from a halfcourt grind to Kokomo's preferred uptempo style. Kokomo forced Cass into a rash of turnovers, leading to a 17-2 run over the final 4:00 of <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2016-Q2">the second quarter</TIMEX3> for a 26-19 halftime lead and the Kats went on for a 58-43 win <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TNI">Saturday night</TIMEX3> at Memorial Gym. 
 
Cass coach Jon Kitchel pointed to Kokomo's deep bench as the key to the swing in momentum. 
 
"The combination of their depth and their athleticism ... that's the result you get," Kitchel said. "We had a team like that <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">a few years ago</TIMEX3> that we could bring waves of guys in and pressure. It was a lot more fun being on that side of it than it was on this side." 
 
Kokomo improved to 11-6 following its third straight win. Cass dropped to 9-5. 
 
Kokomo coach Matt Moore looked to his bench for a spark after a sluggish stretch to open the game. He pulled four starters <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="PT3M" mod="LESS_THAN">less than three minutes</TIMEX3> into the game at which point the Kats already had three turnovers. 
 
"I don't think our guys moved on from [<TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3>'s victory over Lafayette Jeff] early enough," Moore said. "When I pulled them, I thought our bench gave us some stability early and then they kind of got refocused. When we inserted some of those lineups back in and brought the press, it kind of broke the game at that point." 
 
In <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2017-Q1">the first quarter</TIMEX3>, Cass jumped to a 7-1 lead and went on to hold an 11-7 advantage at the close of <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017-Q1">the quarter</TIMEX3>. Kokomo had five turnovers and Cass had a 6-0 edge in points off turnovers. 
 
"It's frustrating when you turn the ball over against a team that's not really trying to trap you. That's something all year long, we've stubbed our toe with," Moore said. "But just to have six <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="P3Q">the next three quarters</TIMEX3> was much better for us." 
 
Kokomo's defense completely turned the game in <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2016-Q2">the second quarter</TIMEX3>. Kokomo had a 12-0 edge in points off turnovers in <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2016-Q2">the quarter</TIMEX3>. Ten of those points came in the Kats' 17-2 run over the final 4:00 of <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2016-Q2">the quarter</TIMEX3>. Keenen Wheeler's dunk off a turnover midway through the run put the Kats in the lead for good. 
 
Cass' cause in <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2016-Q2">the quarter</TIMEX3> was hurt by senior guard Evan Ohman heading to the bench with foul trouble and knee pain. 
 
The Kats put the Kings away with another big run in <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2016-Q3">the third quarter</TIMEX3>. Up 36-27 with 3:00 remaining in <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2016-Q3">the quarter</TIMEX3>, the Kats reeled off a 12-2 run that Ty Sparling and Anthony Barnard capped with back-to-back 3-pointers. Barnard's triple, which beat the buzzer, came off a turnover and made it 48-29. 
 
The Kats kept a comfortable lead throughout the final quarter. 
 
Sparling scored 14 points to lead a balanced Kokomo attack. Brevin Beard scored 13 points on perfect shooting, Jeremy Baker had 13 points off the bench and Barnard had 12. 
 
Baker, a freshman forward, <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> moved into a fulltime varsity role. 
 
"He has a natural [offensive] ability that a lot of our guys don't have," Moore said. "He found gaps [<TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>], he can pass the ball, he just has to continue to understand what to do off the ball and defensively how to play at an uncomfortable level and rebound. Once he gets to that point, and he will, it will take his game to a whole other level." 
 
Barnard had nine rebounds, five blocked shots and two steals. Beard and Wheeler had three steals apiece and Trajan Deckard had two steals. 
 
Moore liked how the Kats held the Kings to less than 40 percent shooting. Cass shot 34.1 percent (14 of 41). 
 
Alec Eurit and Kace Kitchel carried the Kings' offensive load. Eurit had 13 points and Kitchel had 11. Eurit had six rebounds and Cohen Nies had six rebounds and three blocks. 
 
"We competed. We played hard," Jon Kitchel said. "I thought Alec Eurit had a big game. He attacked them. I thought Kace's defense on [Barnard] was good and offensively he was aggressive. 
 
"They're just a bad matchup for us. I don't know that we'll see anybody like this in the tournament. Hopefully we won't." 
 
Jon Kitchel said Ohman's knee trouble is a concern going forward. He said the team may ease Ohman's workload in advance of the state tournament.
