SHELDON SPRINGS - First settled by Smith Olmstead and known as “Olmsted Falls,” Sheldon Springs came into existence in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="170" mod="END">the late 1700s</TIMEX3>. 
 
Olmstead was a farmer and the owner of a grist mill at the falls. The Missisquoi River at the north end of the village provided the impetus for the settlement with its source of power. Major Smith built the first sawmill here in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="1792">1792</TIMEX3> capable of cutting 15,000 feet of lumber <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3>. 
 
George Bancroft owned the Lime Kiln and quarry and manufactured lumber, shingles and lathes. Included within the community were one store, a Missisquoi Railroad station, and Congress Hall. A schoolhouse was erected before <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="1800">1800</TIMEX3>. The first postmaster in Sheldon <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2017-SP">Spring</TIMEX3> was William Adams appointed on <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="1871-06-26">June 26, 1871</TIMEX3>. 
 
Mineral water for Champlain 
 
As early as <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="1609">1609</TIMEX3> the mineral water that would transform Olmstead Falls into Sheldon Springs was procured by Samuel D. Champlain when natives took skins of water to his ship to aid his wounded and ailing sailors. 
 
Between <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="1865">1865</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="1870">1870</TIMEX3> Sheldon became the leading water resort of the United States. Six identified mineral springs resulted in the construction of 11 hotels in the Sheldon. 
 
Congress Hall, built in <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="1868">1868</TIMEX3> occupied a prominent place at the intersection of Main Street and Shawville Road in Sheldon Springs. The 123 feet by 96 feet four story structure opened to tourists in <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="1869">1869</TIMEX3>. Water was drawn from “Kimball Springs.” 
 
Included were two bath houses and a large bottling plant. Following the “Boom Years” the hotel was rarely used but the Catholic Church used the dining room for weekly worship. On <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="1908-12-19">Dec. 19, 1908</TIMEX3>, the building burned to the ground at the hands of a disgruntled employee. The land was subsequently deed to the church. St. Anthony’s Church <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> stands on that corner.

The ‘company town’ 
 
In <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="1894">1894</TIMEX3>, J T Shipley arrived in Sheldon and built the beginnings of what would become the Missisquoi Pulp and Paper Mill in <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="1912">1912</TIMEX3>. Paper manufacturing began in <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DATE" value="1914">1914</TIMEX3> with up to 250 men employed by the mill. As a result Sheldon Springs became known as a “company town” with the company owning the store and some of the community buildings and providing water and electricity to the town.

Many of the <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> structures on what is <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> Mill Street changed from Main Street by the “Mill” are nearly identical buildings constructed by the mill for workers. The center hub of Sheldon Springs at Mill Street and Shawville Road included houses and garages for the managers of the mill. 
 
The mill further developed the town by building employee houses along with is <TIMEX3 tid="t34" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> called School Street, Boarding House Road, and High Street. Many of those structures continued to be occupied <TIMEX3 tid="t35" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3>. The mill sold most of its housing units to private citizens in <TIMEX3 tid="t36" type="DATE" value="197">the 1970s</TIMEX3>. 
 
The original “low dam” was replaced by a “high dam” at the head of a deep canyon providing energy originally for powering the mill equipment but converted to a source of hydroelectric power later. Without a doubt the “Mill” shaped the community from <TIMEX3 tid="t38" type="DATE" value="190" mod="START">the early 1900s</TIMEX3> on.

The Missisquoi Railroad also helped shape the town. The first run from St. Albans through Sheldon Springs occurred on <TIMEX3 tid="t42" type="DATE" value="1871-07-04">July 4, 1871</TIMEX3>. The Missisquoi Valley Railroad sold out to the Central Vermont Railroad and ceased to be a significant or profitable line. 
 
Following the abandonment of the line, the citizens sought and secured the rail bed and transformed it into the 18-mile long Missisquoi Rail Trail for recreational purposes. 
 
Since <TIMEX3 tid="t44" type="DATE" value="197">the 1970s</TIMEX3> many of the mill houses, the store, the old school, and other buildings fell to the wrecking ball of innovation and progress. The fire department <TIMEX3 tid="t45" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> occupies the old store location and several of the houses along Boarding House Road were relocated. 
 
Sheldon Springs persists as a largely residential village with the exception of the “Mill,” which continues in operation. Route 105 cuts through the village with residents scattered along Mill Street, Boarding House Road, High Street and School Street. 
 
In order to visit you will need to depart from the main highway or better yet take the rail trail.
