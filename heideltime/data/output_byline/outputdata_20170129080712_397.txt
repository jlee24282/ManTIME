<TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29T17:30">5:30 p.m.</TIMEX3> 

Abigail Spears and Juan Sebastian Cabal have combined to beat second-seeded Sania Mirza and Ivan Dodig 6-2, 6-4 to win the Australian Open mixed doubles title. 

The 35-year-old Spears played her part at the Australian Open golden oldies party with her win. 

Spears was striving to win her first Grand Slam title in her farewell year. She plans to retire at the end of this season after a career in which she was twice runner-up in mixed doubles finals with Mexican Santiago Gonzalez at the US Open in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2013">2013</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2014">2014</TIMEX3>. 

The triumph by Spears and 30-year-old Cabal continued the veteran's theme of the championships with 30-plus players in the men's and women's singles finals, too.

There was a lot of mutual respect going around before the Australian Open final on <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3> between Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. 

"Rafa's definitely presented me with the biggest challenge in the game," Federer said after his semifinal win over U.S. Open champion Stan Wawrinka. "I'm happy we've had some epic, epic battles over the years ..." 

Nadal said neither player could have imagined making the final of the year's first Grand Slam after coming back from their respective injuries in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3> â€” Federer, his left knee; Nadal, his left wrist. Both men took time off last season and had difficult draws in Melbourne because of their lower rankings. 

"For me, it's a privilege," Nadal said. "It's a very, very special thing, I think, for both of us to be in the final of a major again, have another chance to compete against each other after <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="PXY">a couple of years</TIMEX3> having some problems." 

Nadal, who has won 14 Grand Slam singles titles, has dominated Federer, who has a leading 17 men's majors, in their head-to-head matches. Nadal has a 23-11 record overall and has won nine of their 11 Grand Slam matches. 

The match was an early-evening start, expected under clear skies and in temperatures of about 25 Celsius (77 Fahrenheit), allowing the roof on Rod Laver Arena to be open.

A Grand Slam final <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="P6Y" mod="LESS_THAN">nearly six years</TIMEX3> in the making is just hours away at the Australian Open. 

The last time Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal met in a major final was at the French Open in <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2011">2011</TIMEX3>, when Nadal won in four sets. Nadal holds a 23-11 edge, including semifinal wins at the Australian Open in <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2012">2012</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2014">2014</TIMEX3>. 

Federer, with a leading 17 Grand Slam men's singles titles, has gone further in the tournament than he ever expected after being out for <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DURATION" value="P6M">six months</TIMEX3> with a left knee injury. Nadal, too, spent extended injury time on the sidelines in <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3>. 

The mixed doubles final will open the action at Rod Laver, with American Abigail Spears and Juan Sebastian Cabal playing Sania Mirza of India and Ivan Dodig.
