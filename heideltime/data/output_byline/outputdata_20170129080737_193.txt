Cuneiform script is an early form of writing created by the Sumerians <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="-2983" mod="APPROX">around 5000 years ago</TIMEX3>. The script began as pictographs, simple pictures, though over time the symbols became more abstract. To create cuneiform script, a scribe would use a stylus, a blunt reed, to make impressions on wet clay tablets. The stylus left wedge-shaped impressions, leading to the named cuneiform (“wedge shaped”). Cuneiform started with the Sumerians <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="BC3000" mod="APPROX">around 3000 B.C.</TIMEX3> In the following diagram, we can see how pictographs (Stage one, <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="BC3000">3000 B.C.</TIMEX3>) gradually led to Assyrian cuneiform (Stage seven, early first millennium until its extinction <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="0075" mod="APPROX">around 75 A.D.</TIMEX3>). Early pictograms were not wedge-shaped. Beginning <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="BC2900" mod="APPROX">around 2900 B.C.</TIMEX3>, pictographs began to change. The context could change the meaning of a given sign. By the mid-third millennium, writing changed. Writing was done from left to right in horizontal rows, much as we do <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3>. This caused pictograms to rotate 90° counterclockwise, while the new stylus produced true cuneiform script. Symbols were scratched into play. If a permanent record was desired, the cuneiform tablets were fired in kilns. Many of the cuneiform tablets that have survived to the present day owe their survival to marauding armies who burned buildings, baking the … The post appeared first on . is a journalist, speaker and author of “Written In Stone: Decoding The Secret Masonic Religion Hidden In Gothic Cathedrals And World Architecture.” The book uncovers a lost Wisdom Tradition that was practiced globally in antiquity, found memorialized in pyramids, Triptychs, and identical images worldwide. The central tenets of this tradition have been perpetuated in Western Secret Societies. The most visible of these is the so-called “Masonic Fraternity,” an age-old chivalric Order whose ranks have included Europe’s Gothic cathedral builders and America’s Founding Fathers.
