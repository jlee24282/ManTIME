Due to the strong showing in the Year of the Monkey, market capitalization of the local main board rose about NT$4.17 trillion (US$133 billion) or 17.57 percent, from <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2016-01-28">a year earlier</TIMEX3> to NT$27.89 trillion. 

The increase in market cap during the year allowed investors to rake in about NT$424,100 in profit on average in the year, market statistics show. 

Trading of the local main board is scheduled to resume <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2017-02-02">Feb. 2</TIMEX3>, the sixth day of the Year of the Rooster. 

In <TIMEX3 tid="t34" type="DURATION" value="P20Y">the past 20 years</TIMEX3>, the TWSE said, the local main board has risen on the first trading day after the Lunar New Year holiday for <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DURATION" value="P15Y">15 years</TIMEX3> with falls in the other <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DURATION" value="P5Y">five years</TIMEX3>.
