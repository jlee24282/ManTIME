FRUSTRATED Warwick residents have signed a petition calling on more to be done about slow broadband connection speeds in Chase Meadows. 
 
The petition, which has some 150 signatures, was prompted after homes built <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="XXXX">a year ago</TIMEX3> struggle to reach connection speeds of 1Mbps – making the simplest of online tasks a chore. 
 
With the new development surrounded by homes with connection speeds of up to 17Mbps, residents have <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> called on MP Chris White to step in following complaints to BT. 
 
Resident Rachel Hooker told The Observer it was impossible to work from home and youngsters had to spend extra time completing basic homework tasks. 
 
She said: “We moved into our home in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2015-11">November 2015</TIMEX3> and it came to my attention some people living around me had no basic broadband. 
 
“Nothing has been done about the issue at all. Some people want to work from home, but with the speeds we have it’s just not possible. Kids struggle to complete homework tasks and in today’s world we rely on strong internet connection. 
 
“I don’t understand why these new building have been built without basic broadband connection.” 
 
Others have also made their feelings known. 
 
Kim Fitch said: “We have BT and I work from home for a web based software firm. It affects my working day,” while 
 
Sarah Matthews added: “My broadband has been appalling since moving in <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2011">six years ago</TIMEX3>. In <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="XXXX-XX-XX">this day</TIMEX3> and age it’s ridiculous that I pay for a service which fails regularly.” 
 
A BT spokesperson told the Observer the communications giant did not <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> have plans for any upgrade work in the area, but that BT was committed to working with the community and other organisations to try and find a solution.
