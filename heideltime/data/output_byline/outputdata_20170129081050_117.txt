:10am The Protea netballers came within a whisker of claiming their biggest scalp since <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="1995">1995</TIMEX3> as they ended regulation time on level terms with England before going down 60-55 in extra time after a gutsy display in the Quad Series in Durban. 
 
South Africa erased a 10-point deficit after half-time as they steamrolled their way to a one-point lead shortly before the final whistle only to see England level the scores. 
 
England ultimately dealt better with the pressure during the added <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="PT14M">14 minutes</TIMEX3> as they outscored South Africa 12-7. 
 
Playing in front of a vociferous and packed arena, the Proteas made a promising start to their return match against the England Roses but as in the previous game they dropped the intensity to allow the visitors back into the game. 
 
It was a case of deja vu as the Proteas grabbed an initial three-point lead but squandered the advantage thanks to some sloppy play in the middle of the court. 
 
South Africa’s lead lasted all of <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="PT11M">11 minutes</TIMEX3> before the English levelled the scores on 8-8 with the visitors then taking control. 
 
<TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2016-Q2">The second quarter</TIMEX3> belonged to England as they ran into the right spaces and quickly added to their score. 
 
The Proteas on the other hand could not convert their chances into points as goal attack Renske Stoltz and goalkeeper Lenize Potgieter (pictured, with ball) experienced some nervous moments with their shots at goal. 
 
Stoltz, who made her national debut against New Zealand in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3>, succeeded with only 40 percent of her attempts in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-Q1">the first quarter</TIMEX3> while Potgieter’s aim was slightly better with 66 percent. 
 
South Africa only managed to add seven points in <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2018-Q2">the second quarter</TIMEX3> while the English scored 17 times to give them a 10-point lead going into half-time. 
 
Wing attack Izette Lubbe replaced Proteas captain Bongi Msomi in <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2016-Q2">the second quarter</TIMEX3> for what seemed like a tactical move. 
 
At that stage it looked like the Roses would be running away with the game as was the case in the previous match in Melbourne which they won 57-44. 
 
Like a bolt out of the blue, though,South Africa found an extra set of legs as they scored goals in quick succession following the half-time break. 
 
Replacing Stoltz, goal attack Lindie Lombard added a sense of urgency in the frontline as South Africa blitzed to a 8-1 goal advantage in the first <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="PT5M">five minutes</TIMEX3> of <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2016-Q3">the third quarter</TIMEX3>. 
 
Playing with greater confidence and aggression, South Africa looked more organised and more intent than they did in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2017-H1">the first half</TIMEX3>-hour of the match. 
 
Going into the final quarter South Africa were feeling bullish as they trailed England by just four points (38-34) and they continued their resurgence in <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DURATION" value="PT15M">the last 15 minutes</TIMEX3>. 
 
South Africa surged forward as they enforced the stalemate with <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DURATION" value="PT10M">10 minutes</TIMEX3> left in <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2016-Q3">the quarter</TIMEX3> before grabbing the lead for the first time since the opening moments of the match. 
 
Holding on to a slender lead, South Africa had to keep a defiant England at bay as the final minutes of the game turned into a tit-for-tat battle as the lead changed a few times up until the final seconds. 
 
Facing the prospect of only their second victory over England in <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DURATION" value="P22Y">22 years</TIMEX3>, South Africa buckled under the pressure in extra time as they saw the tourists move past them to deny them a piece of history.
