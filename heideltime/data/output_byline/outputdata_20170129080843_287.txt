Academy has blasted President Donald Trump's travel ban branding it "extremely troubling". 
 
Iranian filmmaker Asghar Farhadi, who wrote and directed the <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> Oscar-nominated foreign language film "The Salesman," would not be able to enter the US for the awards under Trump's <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> enacted travel ban, reported Variety. 
 
"The Academy celebrates achievement in the art of filmmaking, which seeks to transcend borders and speak to audiences around the world, regardless of national, ethnic, or religious differences. 
 
"As supporters of filmmakers and the human rights of all people around the globe, we find it extremely troubling that Asghar Farhadi, the director of the Oscar-winning film from Iran 'A Separation,' along with the cast and crew of <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017">this year</TIMEX3> s Oscar-nominated film 'The Salesman,' could be barred from entering the country because of their religion or country of origin," statement released by the Academy's official spokesperson read. 
 
Trump signed the executive order on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3> to suspend entry of refugees to the US for <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P120D">120 days</TIMEX3>, and imposed an indefinite ban on refugees from Syria. A <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P90D">90-day</TIMEX3> ban was also placed on citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. 
 
The <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> Academy Awards will take place on <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017-02-26">February 26</TIMEX3>.
