A court in Italy has ordered a new trial for three-time ex-premier Silvio Berlusconi on corruption charges, creating a new obstacle to his bid to return to office. 
 
Milan Judge Carlo Ottone De Marchi scheduled the new trial for Berlusconi on <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2016-04-05">April 5</TIMEX3>, local media reported on <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>. 
 
The 80-year-old former Italian statesman allegedly paid as much as 10 million euros and gave expensive gifts to young women to “buy” their silence in various other court cases involving him. The new trial is <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> aimed at determining whether the payments amounted to hush money and interfered in the other judicial proceedings. 
 
Berlusconi has denied any wronging. One of his lawyers, Federico Cecconi, has said the new prosecution is “the first trial for the crime of generosity.” 
 
Berlusconi is the leader of Italy’s center-right Forza Italia Party, <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> the opposition party in the parliament. 
 
<TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2016">Last year</TIMEX3>, Berlusconi was tried for a sexual relationship with an underage teenager when he was premier and then using his influence to cover it up. While he was acquitted in that case, several other complaints of sexual misconduct have been filed against him, in addition to the accusations of financial corruption. 
 
A <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2013">2013</TIMEX3> tax fraud conviction forced him out of his Senate seat and barred him from holding public office for <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="PXY">the next few years</TIMEX3>. Berlusconi has challenged the ban, taking his case to the European Court of Human Rights. 
 
Berlusconi eyes participating in Italy’s national elections, due in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2018">2018</TIMEX3>, but his hopes for running for office may be dashed with the newly-scheduled trial.
