WERE you making the news in North Lincolnshire on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-W04">this week</TIMEX3> in the past? 
 
Or if not, can you remember some of the stories which were hitting the headlines in the Scunthorpe Telegraph? 
 
Here, we take a look back at some of the things which were happening in the Scunthorpe area this time <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3>, <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2007">10 years ago</TIMEX3> and in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2003">2003</TIMEX3>. 
 <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2016">One year ago</TIMEX3>  
This time <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3>, plans were announced to transform North Lincolnshire Council's Civic Centre headquarters in Scunthorpe into a hotel or new homes. 
 

 
The proposal was revealed by the council to the Scunthorpe Telegraph as part of plans to relocate its offices to Church Square, in the town centre. 
 
Also in <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2016-01">January 2016</TIMEX3>, plans to turn the A15 between Scunthorpe and Lincoln into a dual carriageway were said to have taken a step forward. 
 
It was announced that a detailed study was to be carried out to assess the economic benefit for the region which could come from a dualling of the major road. 
 
Television viewers in the region were gearing up to watch North Lincolnshire quiz queen Isabelle Heward appear on ITV programme The Chase. 
 

 
Isabelle, who has also been on Mastermind, The Weakest Link, Countdown, Film Buff of the Year and various radio quizzes, spoke to the Telegraph ahead of taking on the chaser in the daytime show. 

 
And there was also a look back at the day Scunthorpe was bombed by a large German Zeppelin airship in the week of the 100th anniversary of the raid. 
 

 
Three people were killed by bombs dropped during the First World War raid, which saw the Zeppelin stay in the skies over the town for eight-and-a-half minutes and drop 20 high-explosive devices. 
 <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2007">10 years ago</TIMEX3>  
On <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2017-W04">this week</TIMEX3> in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2007">2007</TIMEX3>, the Telegraph reported on a spate of car crime where dozens of vehicles were broken into or stolen <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DURATION" value="P4D" mod="MORE_THAN">over four days</TIMEX3>. 
 
The front-page story said around 40 vehicles were targeted, with 30 broken into and attempts made to steal another 10. 
 


 
Also that week, it was reported that plans for the then-empty Baths Hall venue included turning it into a hotel. 
 
Five bids to replace the Doncaster Road venue were shortlisted by North Lincolnshire Council, although The Baths Hall was eventually transformed into a modern venue which opened in <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2011">2011</TIMEX3>. 
 

 
In what was believed to be a first for any local authority in the country, North Lincolnshire Council announced school staff were to give extra advice to combat the rising problem of cyber-bullying. 
 
The approach to the problem came after videos were discovered online showing school pupils from the area fighting. 
 

 
And the Telegraph also reported on a book sale with a difference, as hundreds of books and CDs were sold for as little as 30p each at North Lincolnshire Central Library. 
 
A huge amount of books were on offer at the cut-price sale, which attracted hordes of people. 
 

 <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2003">14 years ago</TIMEX3>  
In <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2003">2003</TIMEX3>, a groundbreaking application was to go before licensing magistrates to extend pub opening hours earlier in the morning. 
 
The JD Wetherspoon chain was set to ask for permission to serve alcohol at its Blue Bell pub in Scunthorpe from <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="TIME" value="XXXX-XX-XXT10:00">10am.</TIMEX3> 
 
And it was reported that the move could allow every pub in North Lincolnshire to start pulling pints <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DURATION" value="PT1H">an hour</TIMEX3> earlier. 
 

 
Also that week, the gauntlet was thrown down to celebrity chef Jamie Oliver by North Lincolnshire Council to sample a school meal. 
 
Jamie branded school dinners "cheap and rubbish" in an interview with the BBC Good Food magazine. 
 
But Councillor Tony Gosling challenged the man known as The Naked Chef to have a meal in one of North Lincolnshire's schools and then see if he stood by his comments. 
 

 
The Telegraph also reported on the story of an epic flight across the North Sea by a balloon released in Scunthorpe. 
 
The balloon was one of 111 let go to mark the opening of the Kingsway Children's Centre. 
 
And amazingly, it travelled all the way to Norway and remained intact until it was caught by two children in the town of Valen. 
 

 
And as Scunthorpe United's Division Three promotion push continued, it was one of their young players who caught the eye in a 4-1 home victory over Southend United. 
 
That man was 19-year-old striker Paul Hayes, who came off the bench to score one of the goals. 
 
Hayes went on to be one of United's key men in two spells with the club, the second of which saw him play a part in the Iron earning promotion to the Championship in <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="2009">2009</TIMEX3>.
