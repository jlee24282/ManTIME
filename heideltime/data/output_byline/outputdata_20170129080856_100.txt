Virginia or Ginny to her family, friends, and neighbors was born Mar. 18, <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="1928">1928</TIMEX3>, in Lewiston, Idaho, to Freda Loree (McProud) Mabbott and Leonard H. Mabbott. Ginny grew up in various locations scattered from Spokane, Washington to Middleton, Idaho just west of Boise. Those years included living in a rural two room school house located southeast of Jordan Valley, Oregon in the middle of the Idaho portion of Jordan Valley. Virginia’s mom, Loree Mabbott, was the school teacher. Ginny, her two brothers,and the handful of ranch children in the valley tallied just enough children for the State of Idaho to keep the school open in the middle of nowhere.

Virginia, who completed her life’s work on earth <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2016-12-29">Dec. 29, 2016</TIMEX3>, was preceded in death by her parents, her husband of <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P60Y" mod="LESS_THAN">nearly 60 years</TIMEX3>, of Corvallis, and a son Bernard (Bernie) J. Smyth. She is survived by her brothers Edward (Ike) (Joy) Mabbott of Boise, Idaho and Dave (Mae) Mabbott of Victor; daughter Connie (Eric) Gunnarson of Ellensburg, Washington; son E. Robin (Janet) Smyth of Gladstone, Oregon, and Deborah aka Debbie (Dave) Kenny, Palmer, Alaska. Grandma Ginny created a lifetime of memories with her grandchildren and they each have their own special memories of grandma. She will be missed dearly by grandchildren Heather (Kevin ) Jones, Covington, Washington; Nathan E (Christina) Smyth, Molalla, Oregon; Heather J (Charlie) Irving, Redmond, Oregon; Ian (Wendy) Kenny, Fairbanks, Alaska; Tristan Kenny, Palmer, Alaska; Tait (Laura) Kenny, Palmer, Alaska; and Heather Kronebusch, Placentia, California. Great Grandma Ginny (GG or GiGi) felt so blessed being able to enjoy her great grandchildren - Ashley (Scott) McFadden and Hailey Jones; Kelsey, Jacob (Andrea), and Emmett Smyth; Garret and Liam Irving; Caleb and Amanda Kenny; Darius and Asher Kenny. To top off her legacy Ginny was fortunate to be a great great grandmother to Hadley Smyth and Madilynn McFadden. Virginia was able to invest many values, lots of love and hundreds of hours of prayer for those previously mentioned children, grandchildren, nieces, nephews, and ‘adopted’ young people whose lives she helped mold.

Virginia became a registered nurse after taking her training in Sheridan, Wyoming and Billings, completing her rotations at St Patrick’s hospital in Missoula. She worked at Marcus Daily Memorial Hospital in Hamilton periodically during her younger adult years. Robert (Bob) Smyth met Ginny when he and other Montana State College students visited Billings for short weekend. Bob always had a twinkle in his eyes when he would tell other how quickly he decided Virginia was the girl for him. They were married <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="1949-05-20">May 20, 1949</TIMEX3> and resided in either the dairy farm house 3-1/2 miles north of Corvallis or in the house they built on a rock bar in the middle of the farm ground just south of town. Virginia’s roles included being a loving wife and mother, a full time farm wife, extended family member and an active member of the Corvallis community. She provided bookkeeping services for Smyth Farms, the Corvallis Garage, Farmers Exchange of Stevensville, Corvallis Community Church and the Corvallis Sewer District. Ginny was an engaged mother who supported her children in school and church activities. She lead Pioneer Clubs, taught <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3> School, directed the children’s choir for <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="PXY">many years</TIMEX3> at Corvallis Community Church, helped with 4-H and many other activities too numerous to mention. In the later years she and Bob were very active in the local and state Gideons Ministry to help provide Bibles to students, military personnel and hotels around the world. Virginia’s family knows there were many events others will remember her by and are desirous of your sharing those memories as we remember Mom’s life transformed by the indwelling Spirit of her Lord.

Virginia’s greatest joy was knowing she had obtained peace with God through the saving power of Jesus Christ. Through her support of missionaries, her joy was expanded being assured many others would hear this life changing message of restoration to fellowship with her Lord.
