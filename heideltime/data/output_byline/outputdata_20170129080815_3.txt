An estimated 15,000 A’s fans were treated to free food and great weather <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> at the team’s annual FanFest, held at Jack London Square for the first time since <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="1999">1999</TIMEX3>, and the good vibes were palpable. 
 
“Best FanFest ever ,” said Debbie Rose , 54, of Castro Valley. “The best accessibility, I got to see all my favorite players. It feels like they put A’s fans first. I’m starting to feel hopeful about things.” 
 
New team president Dave Kaval earned rave reviews from fans for making the event free and for moving the event from the Coliseum to a location near downtown, and the waterfront site had more than a few in attendance thinking about a stadium nearby. 
 
“Just imagining what it could be if there was a ballpark down here,” said Michael Schultz , 32, of Alameda. “Dave Kaval has brought so much life to the team, I think. Very cool.” 
 
“Cautiously optimistic,” said Schultz’s brother, Tom Schultz of Oakland. 
 
Jacqueline Peters , 58, of Watsonville said the first thing she did was head to the food trucks for lunch (chicken) and dessert (vanilla custard). 
 
“The fact it’s all free shows a lot of goodwill toward the fans,” Peters said. “And no rain! They couldn’t have done this <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-W02">two weeks ago</TIMEX3>, so this is great. It’s so nice to be able to walk around here and see friends.” 
 
The A’s players and coaches were just as enthusiastic about the move to Jack London Square, with manager Bob Melvin musing during a Q and A session about how beautiful the waterfront setting might be for the long term. 
 
“I think this is awesome,” reliever Sean Doolittle said. “I think it’s really, really great the team is embracing Oakland and really reaching out to re-energize the fans and make a commitment to Oakland.” 
 
“Being right down here near downtown, in Jack London Square, it’s so fan friendly,” A’s starter Kendall Graveman said. “I like it better, I really do. And no rain — maybe that’s a good sign for the year.” 
 
Kaval told The Chronicle earlier in the week that the team is still evaluating three or four stadium sites, and on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>, he had drones surveying FanFest to get an idea of crowd flow and foot traffic for the potential Howard Terminal location. 
 
“It’s impossible to walk around and see all the energy and enthusiasm and not feel excited,” general manager David Forst said. “Ultimately, what this leads to remains to be see, but this is a great showing of A’s fans and A’s excitement. A huge part of what Dave wants to do is connect to the fans and involve them in the process of what we’re building in Oakland.” 
 
Briefly: There were some humorous moments during the question-and-answer sessions with fans, including one fan pressing Doolittle on when he might propose to his longtime girlfriend, Eireann Dolan (he seemed to have trouble with his microphone just then for some reason) and another asking Doolittle for his favorite “Star Wars” moment. (He liked “Rogue One” a lot). … Forst, asked about the A’s difficulties in keeping top players, said, “Everyone was tired of hearing during the playoffs, ‘Look at all these ex-A’s playing for other teams.’ … The goal is we get a new building and we hold onto all these guys beyond their first few years and create lifelong Oakland A’s.” … Asked about potentially trading right-hander Sonny Gray at midseason if Gray bounces back strong, Forst said, “I want to have Sonny here <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P10Y">10 more years</TIMEX3>. (A’s executive) Billy Beane wants to have Sonny here <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="P10Y">10 more years</TIMEX3>.”
