FARGO, N.D. (<TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">1/28/17</TIMEX3>)— Concordia kicked off its <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> season by hosting St. Scholastica and while the end result won't show the improvement, the overall play of the six Cobbers will. 

Concordia fell 8-1 to the Saints in the season opener at Courts Plus in Fargo but had five of the six singles players earn game wins and sophomore Lisa Neumann earned her first collegiate victory. 

<TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2016">Last year</TIMEX3> the Cobbers went 0-15 and won just one single match all year. Neumann matched that total by recording a decisive 6-1, 6-0 victory at No.2 singles. 

Neumann is the showcase for Concordia's improvement as she continually hit winners and used a new-found power to keep her opponent pinned to the baseline. Neumann went 0-15 <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3> but has stepped up her game for her sophomore season. 

Junior Kendra Stoick stepped into the No.1 singles spot <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017">this year</TIMEX3> and battled to a 6-4, 6-0 loss. 

Breann Adamek , the other returning player on the <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> Cobber team, played one of the closest matches of the night. She dropped a 6-2, 6-3 decision at No.5 singles.   

The other tight bout came at No.6 singles where freshman Talia Dalzell lost 6-2 in the opening set but then got rid of her nerves and narrowly lost 6-4 in the second set. 

Concordia dropped all three doubles matches with Stoick and Neumann falling 8-1 at No.1 doubles. 
          
WHAT'S NEXT: Concordia will stay at home to start the season when they square off against cross-town rival MSU Moorhead on <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2017-02-03">Friday, Feb. 3</TIMEX3> at <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="TIME" value="2017-02-03T18:00">6 p.m.</TIMEX3> The Cobbers will then head to Bemdji to take on Bemidji State and St. Benedict on <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2017-02-05">Sunday, Feb. 5</TIMEX3>.
