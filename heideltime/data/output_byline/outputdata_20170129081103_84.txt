WILMINGTON – <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> afternoon’s clash with Middlesex League rival Burlington will go into the record books as a 3-2 loss for the Wilmington High Boys Hockey team, and for a Wildcats squad that desperately needs as many wins as they can get as they head into <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2018-H2">the second half</TIMEX3> of the season, that is obviously bad news. 
 
But the reality is, Saturday’s game was much more than that, as for two periods, the Wildcats (2-4-4 overall, 1-3-2 in the Middlesex League) stood toe to toe with a Burlington club that qualified for the Super 8 Tournament last season, and is off to another fine start this season, with a 5-1 mark in the Middlesex League after Saturday’s win. 
 
Wilmington coach Steve Scanlon was in no mood for moral victories after Saturday’s game, in which Burlington got the game winning goal with 7:18 left, but he did acknowledge the effort of his team in a game in which they may have looked overmatched on paper. 
 
“A loss is a loss, but (Burlington) is a really good team. They are coming off a 1-1 tie with Malden Catholic, and we were right there with them,” Scanlon said. “We skated really hard. I think we ran out of gas a little in the third period, but for the most part we stayed with them. If we play like this against most teams we will be able to get some wins.” 
 
It looked for a while like the Wildcats were going to get a win in this game as well. Trailing 1-0 at the end of a first period in which Burlington for the most part controlled play, the Wildcats came out strong in the second period, pressing the attack in the early going. 
 
Sophomore forward Ryan Barrett probably had the best early chance for the Wildcats, picking up a loose puck from behind the net and attempting to stuff it in behind the Burlington goalie, but he was denied. Barrett’s efforts behind the net, however, would provide some good foreshadowing for what was to come later in the game. 
 
Junior forward Bobby Lord finally broke the ice for the Wildcats, beating Burlington goalie Paul Barbieri with a power play goal at 9:28 of the period, putting in a rebound off the post to tie the game 1-1, with assists going to junior defensemen Jarred Aucoin and Anthony McKearney, who had executed a perfect D to D pass at the blue line before Aucoin put the shot on net and Lord pounced on the rebound. 
 
The score would remain the same heading into the third period, but it didn’t take Burlington long to retake the lead, with senior captain Patrick O’Halloran putting a seeing eye slap shot past Wilmington goalie Ryan St. Jean just <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="PT24S">24 seconds</TIMEX3> into the period. 
 
Burlington would control play for <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="PTXM">the next several minutes</TIMEX3>, but it was the Wildcats who would be next on the board, with Barrett finally being rewarded for what was a great overall game. Moments after being denied on a breakaway, Barrett once again set up behind the Burlington net. A Burlington defender attempted to steal the puck from Barrett, but instead ended up banking the puck off the back of the Burlington goalie’s leg and into the net to tie the game at 2-2 with 9:06 left in the game. Barrett was given credit for the goal, while senior captain Joshua Buske picked up the assist. 
 
Burlington would once again respond, as <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="UNDEF-REF-minute-PLUS-2" mod="LESS_THAN">less than two minutes later</TIMEX3> senior Drew Metzdorf scored on a great wrist shot from the faceoff circle, through a screen for a 3-2 lead with 7:18 left in the game. 
 
Burlington controlled play for the rest of the game, out shooting the Wildcats 13-3 in the period, but they were unable to extend their lead thanks to several great stops from St. Jean, who was outstanding throughout the game, making 32 saves, but particularly over the final <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="PT15M">15 minutes</TIMEX3> when the game could have gotten out hand. 
 
The performance was nothing new for St. Jean, who has been great all season for the Wildcats. 
 
“Through the first ten games, he has really been our MVP,” Scanlon said. “He makes big saves and plays well when he’s getting peppered. He’s having a good year.” 
 
Offensively, while the Wildcats scored only two goals, and were held very much in check in the third period, they were able to create several offensive opportunities on the day, moving the puck well to create scoring chances. 
 
Offense has been hard to come by this season for the Wildcats, who have scored just 22 goals in ten games this season, including six in a 6-3 win over Medford <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2017-01-25">last Wednesday</TIMEX3>, but with that six goal effort, as well as the improved play against Burlington, Scanlon is hoping his team is on the verge of turning things around. 
 
“We were a little bit better. Goals have been hard to come by for us, but I thought we created some stuff,” Scanlon said. “We had 20 shots on goal, so I think we are getting better in that department. <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="TIME" value="2017-01-25TNI">Wednesday night</TIMEX3> we were able to get things going and build our confidence a little bit. We are hoping that we are starting to get something going. It is about getting timely goals and more goal scoring.” 
 
The Wildcats got plenty of goal scoring <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="TIME" value="2017-01-25TNI">last Wednesday night</TIMEX3> in their 6-3 win over Medford, breaking open what was a 0-0 game after the first period, getting single goals from Connor Benoit, Dan Woods, Ryan Barrett, Bobby Lord, Joey Mirabella and Josh Buske. St. Jean (17 shots, 14 saves) combined with junior goalie Stephen Bowker (5 shots, 5 saves) to pick up the win in net. 
 
“It was a back and forth first period, but we had a little bit of explosion with six goals from six different goal scorers and three of them from kids with their first varsity goals,” Scanlon said. 
 
The Wildcats were back in action on <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="TIME" value="2017-01-25TNI">Wednesday night</TIMEX3>, traveling to Ed Burns Arena in Arlington to take on Arlington High School, and they will continue a tough stretch of games on <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TAF">Saturday afternoon</TIMEX3> against Winchester at O’Brien Arena, before facing Wakefield at Ristuccia <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="TIME" value="2017-01-23TNI">Monday night</TIMEX3> at <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="TIME" value="2017-01-23T20:00">8 pm.</TIMEX3> This is a make-up game where Wilmington will be the visiting team. 
 
After that, the Wildcats will be back on the road again on <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="2017-02-01">Wednesday</TIMEX3> to take on Reading at Burbank Arena. 
 
“It’s a bit of a murderer’s row <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">right now</TIMEX3>,” Scanlon said. “It doesn’t get any easier.”
