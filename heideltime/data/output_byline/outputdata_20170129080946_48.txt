<TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P20Y">Twenty years</TIMEX3> after voters in the Golden State legalized marijuana for medicinal purposes, they approved Proposition 64 on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2016-11-08">Nov. 8</TIMEX3>, opening the door for legal recreational use of the drug as well. 
   
The basic idea behind voter approval of Prop. 64 was fairly simple: A majority of Californians believe adults should be able to consume marijuana without fear of persecution or prosecution, much like sipping a glass of wine after work or drinking a cocktail during happy hour. 
   
Details of the more than 60-page proposition approved by 56 percent of the state's voters on Election Day aren't quite as simple, though. 
   
"It certainly changes the lives for thousands of Californians," said Lynne Lyman, California state director for the Drug Policy Alliance, which helped draft the successful ballot initiative.  
   
She said the biggest tangible change with the passage of Prop. 64 was that when the clock struck <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="TIME" value="2016-11-08T12:01">12:01 a.m.</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2016-11-09">Nov. 9</TIMEX3>, criminal penalties associated with marijuana consumption and sales in the state took effect, with new penalties accompanying the new rules.

California voters approved Proposition 64 in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-11">November</TIMEX3>, which legalizes the recreational use of marijuana. The state has until <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2018-01-01">Jan. 1, 2018</TIMEX3>, to begin issuing licenses for adult-use pot shops.

For example, numerous offenses that were previously felonies <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> are misdemeanors or simple infractions and some offenses, such as possession of an ounce or less of marijuana by an adult 21 or older, are no longer illegal. Possession of an ounce or less by individuals younger than 21 still is illegal and continues to be a $100 infraction. 
   
"Basically, some conduct that was criminal before isn't criminal <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3>," said San Luis Obispo County Assistant District Attorney Lee Cunningham. "There are circumstances where (charges) could be a misdemeanor or a felony. It will definitely change the way law enforcement handles (marijuana-related calls)." 
   
On average, 14,000 people <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3> are arrested in California for marijuana offenses — a half million individuals were arrested in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="200">the last decade</TIMEX3> — but with Prop. 64 <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> on the books, thousands of people no longer will be going to jail for smoking pot, Lyman said.  
   
For example, in all cases, juvenile offenders under 18 won't be subject to criminal punishment (incarceration) but to drug education and community service, which Lyman said is a victory for marijuana reform and criminal justice. 
   
"The No. 1 way kids get into the criminal justice system is through marijuana offenses," Lyman said. "<TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> children can't be arrested or go to jail. That pipeline is closed altogether. Arrest is off the table." 
   
Santa Barbara County Chief Probation Officer Lupe Rabago said the most serious charge among juveniles has shifted over time with a decline in property offenses to an increase in narcotic/drug offenses. 
   
Additionally, teens who committed marijuana-related crimes prior to the passage of Prop. 64 and turned 18 after <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2016-11-08">Nov. 8</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> can apply to have their records sealed. That means the federal government can't turn down those individuals for student loans based on past criminal convictions, Lyman said. 
   
Also, people serving time in jails and prison for marijuana-related offenses can petition the courts for early release or reduced sentences, if the criminal justice changes apply to them. 
   
"It's all retroactive," Lyman said. "The criminal justice pieces (of Prop. 64) were huge."

But if pot smokers, or the public in general, were expecting to see sweeping changes in how the state deals with recreational marijuana soon after <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2017-11-08">Nov. 8</TIMEX3>, they likely will have months to wait, if not the remainder of the year. 
   
"I don't know anybody who has noticed any difference since Prop. 64 has passed," said Dale Gieringer, CalNORML (National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws) director. "There has been no impact on day-to-day activity. The big change will come with the cannabis clubs and lounges." 
   
Presently, there are no adult-use pot shops in California. Only registered medical marijuana patients can walk into a dispensary and buy cannabis. However, under Prop. 64, it's not only legal for adults over 21 to possess marijuana, they can also share their pot without fear of arrest. Public consumption, however, still is illegal.  
   
"I could share with you and it would be completely legal," Lyman said, adding law enforcement could attempt to arrest an individual for sharing their cannabis but that the officer would "be wrong in the eyes of the law." 
   
Both Gieringer and Lyman don't believe the state will begin issuing licenses to establish pot shops any time soon. The state has to sort through how to implement Prop. 64 first, but the deadline for Sacramento to start issuing licenses to those planned cannabis clubs and pot shops is <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2018-01-01">Jan. 1, 2018</TIMEX3>. 
   
Cities and counties have the ability to put different rules in place.  
   
"Prop. 64 laid out the rules, but it didn't implement them," Gieringer said. "There are two parallel licensing systems with slightly different rules. It's going to be whenever local governments start allowing on-site consumption."
