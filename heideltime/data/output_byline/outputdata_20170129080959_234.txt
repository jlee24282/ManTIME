YAKIMA — For Sunnyside’s wrestlers, <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-26">Thursday</TIMEX3> was the emotionally charged home show and <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> was the business trip. 
   
The Grizzlies didn’t impress themselves <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TAF">Saturday afternoon</TIMEX3>, but they got the job done impressively nonetheless. 
   
After Thursday’s thrilling victory over three-time reigning CBBN champion Moses Lake, Sunnyside claimed that title for itself <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> by sweeping Davis and Eisenhower for a 6-0 run through league duals. 
   
“After a big match like the one we had <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-01-26">Thursday</TIMEX3>, I was afraid we might be a little flat <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3> and we were,” said Sunnyside coach George Paulus. “And we had two matches <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3>, which I wasn’t happy about, and that made a flat day even longer. But our goal was a league title and we got that. It was a big week for us.” 
   
The ninth-ranked Grizzlies knocked off No. 6 Moses Lake 32-23 at home on <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2017-01-26">Thursday</TIMEX3>, then dispatched Eisenhower 64-9 and Davis 43-18 in a pair of makeup duals from previous postponements. That sets the stage for the postseason, which begins <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017-W05">next week</TIMEX3> with the district tournament in Wenatchee. 
   
“<TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2017-01-26">Thursday</TIMEX3> was a great win for us, and finishing (6-0) really means something,” said junior Moises Morales, who went 3-0 at 170 pounds in the three duals. “We put a lot of hard work into this. We had to keep our focus coming up here after Moses Lake and we did, that’s part of our training.” 
   
While Davis finished 4-2 in league and is ranked 11th in the state, the Pirates’ ability to compete with Sunnyside was severely compromised by giving away four forfeits and 24 points. The Grizzlies, too, held out three starters. 
   
Sunnyside’s notable wins came from Morales, who bested Chris Huizar 4-2 in overtime at 170, and two-time state medalist Josiah Rodriguez, who earned a hard-fought 7-4 decision over John Sowers at 138. 
   
Davis’ big win — and the match of the day — came at 126 when sophomore Shawn Abeyta stunned state runner-up Elias Romero in overtime. Abeyta conceded a takedown in each of the first two periods and trailed 5-1 with <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="PT10S" mod="LESS_THAN">less than 10 seconds</TIMEX3> left. But he launched into a takedown that led to two near-fall points as time expired, then did the same thing <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DURATION" value="PT30S">30 seconds</TIMEX3> into the OT for a 10-5 victory. 
   
That may or may not be a preview of the district final as Abeyta said he is weighing a move down to 120 or staying at 126. 
   
In addition to Morales, Sam Guerrero (106), Fabian Ortega (113) and Rodriguez (138) all went 3-0 <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2017-W04">this week</TIMEX3> to help Sunnyside earn its first league title since <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2013">2013</TIMEX3>. 
   
Guerrero, a sophomore, sparked Sunnyside’s 17-0 start against Moses Lake and provided a 5-0 decision and pin in Saturday’s matches. Ortega is a freshman with postseason upside who pinned his ML opponent and delivered a 10-1 major decision against Davis. 
   
“We’re excited for district because it feels like we’re peaking,” Morales said. 
   
Sunnyside beat Moses Lake for last year’s district title at Davis. The seeding meeting will take place <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3> in Wenatchee with first-round matches to follow and finals on <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>. 
   
Regional qualifiers from the CBBN will travel to Curtis for the Class 4A Region III tournament on <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2017-02-11">Feb. 11</TIMEX3>.
