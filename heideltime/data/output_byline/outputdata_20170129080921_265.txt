The federal government has approved 1.2 billion US dollars for the construction of the Kano-Kaduna standard gauge railway project. 

Minister of Transport, Rotimi Amechi, disclosed this in Kano <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">yesterday</TIMEX3> when he visited Gov. Abdullahi Ganduje at the Government House, Kano. 

He said that the federal government was negotiating with China EXIM bank to finance the project. 

“We are negotiating with China EXIM bank and we are convinced that this negotiation will end by <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2016-06">June</TIMEX3>,” he said. 

The minister said that the federal government would provide about 100 locomotives for narrow gauge rail that would run through Lagos, Kano, Port Harcourt, Funtua and Gombe to improve the economy. 

“Before <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-06" mod="END">the end of June</TIMEX3> Lagos-Kano narrow gauge rail would have more locomotives that would run through Lagos, Port Harcourt, Funtua, Kano and Gombe states to boost the economy,” he said. 

Ganduje expressed his happiness and commended the president for fulfilling campaign promise. 

He said that Kano-Kaduna standard rail project would save the road from total collapse. 

Ganduje said that the state government <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> signed a $1.8 billion Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with a Chinese firm to construct light rail in the state capital. 

He said that the light rail project would give a mega city outlook similar to other cities across the world.
