Rajesh Sawant, the India Under-19 trainer, was found dead in his hotel room in Mumbai on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3>. According to BCCI sources, the cause of death seemed to be a heart attack. 

Sawant was in Mumbai helping the team prepare for the series against England Under-19, which begins <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-30">tomorrow</TIMEX3>. 

"What I have gathered so far," BCCI joint secretary Amitabh Choudhary was quoted as saying by Sportstar, "is he did not report for team activities in the morning, so people started looking for him and eventually he was found to have passed away in his room. I have asked Prof. Shetty (Ratnakar Shetty, general manager - game development) to visit the site and keep me updated." 

Sawant had been part of the Afghanistan coaching staff in the past and worked with the India A teams that played the England XI in the two List A matches <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-01" mod="START">earlier this month</TIMEX3>.
