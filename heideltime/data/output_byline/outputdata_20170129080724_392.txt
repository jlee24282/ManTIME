analysed various scenarios of his "abrupt departure" from the political scene before <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="1989">1989</TIMEX3>. 
 
"Although we believe assassination is the major near-term threat to Rajiv's tenure, any of several other events could cause his abrupt departure from the political scene before <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="1989">1989</TIMEX3>," it said while listing out several other possibilities including "his death from natural causes or by accident". 
 
It ruled out the possibility of a decision by him "to resign out of frustration", saying "we see no signs of this and believe it would be out of character". 
 
The CIA report also noted: "We suspect, however, that Rajiv would calculate -- as we do -- that he and his kin would be targets for extremist violence even if he left public office." 
 
In a section called "Implications for the United States", the report says "We believe (Rajiv) Gandhi's death would represent a significant blow to US interests, regardless of the circumstances of the succession." 
 
"...We believe Indo-US relations could also suffer as a result of domestic political changes following Rajiv's assassination." 
 
The report assessed Rajiv's policies ranging from dealing with extremists, foreign relations (including Sri Lankan Tamil issue) to promoting acquisition of selected foreign technology" among others, and their outcome. 
 
"Although some of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's policies will continue to encounter serious resistance <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="PXY" mod="MORE_THAN">over the next several years</TIMEX3>, we believe his dominance of the Indian political scene is secure until at least the end of his present term of office in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="1989-12">December 1989</TIMEX3>, barring his incapacitation or death," it said. 
 
The report also dealt with the possibility of a "national government" taking over in case of a sudden exit by Rajiv, while discounting the possibility of a military coup in such a scenario. 
 
Several portions of the 23-page report were deleted before the CIA decided to release it under the Freedom of Information Act.
