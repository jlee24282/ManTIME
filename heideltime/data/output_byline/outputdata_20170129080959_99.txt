Hi everyone. Spare time for reading is not a luxury all folks have, so with that in mind and a desire to accommodate all, I have re-written my book "Reflections Of A Sheep" into a "Series Format" under the new title, "Reflections Of A Sheep - The Series". The original will remain intact and available as usual. With sincere thanks for your support and blessings to all. Bill Taylor.
