Bengaluru (Karnataka) [India], <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Jan. 29</TIMEX3> (ANI): <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P1D">A day</TIMEX3> after resigning from the Congress Party, former external affairs minister and senior leader S.M. Krishna on <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3> said the grand old party doesn't need mass leaders like him and only wants managers, who can handle a situation.

"The party demands only managers. They don't need time-tested leaders and workers like me. With pain and anguish, I have decided to quit the Congress. This is a time to do some introspection," Krishna told the media here.

Expressing pain over his ouster from the grand old party, Krishna alleged that the party had sidelined him citing his old age.

"What pained me was how the Congress sidelined a loyal worker lime me and cited my age for the same. I toured the state during the last elections and nobody thought I was old. Suddenly, they have discovered that I am old and need rest. I felt the Congress did not need me," Krishna said.

Citing that age is mere a state of mind and it shouldn't be perceived as the criteria for deciding what the situation needs, he said: "There are people, who are inactive even when young and the ultimate test is your intent."

In a written letter to Congress president Sonia Gandhi, Krishna <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">yesterday</TIMEX3> tendered his resignation from the party's membership.

"I am herewith tendering my resignation to the primary membership of the Congress Party," it read.

The 84-year-old first became a Member of Parliament (MP) in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="1968">1968</TIMEX3> from Mandya.

Krishna led the Congress to victory in Karnataka in <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="1999">1999</TIMEX3> and served as the chief minister till <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2004">2004</TIMEX3>.
