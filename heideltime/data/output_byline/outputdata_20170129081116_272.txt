As Padmavati I can assure you that there is absolutely no distortion of history. #Padmavati 
 
— Deepika Padukone (@deepikapadukone) <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">January 28, 2017</TIMEX3> 
   
Our only endeavour is & has always been to share with the world the story of this courageous & powerful woman in the purest form there is. 
 
— Deepika Padukone (@deepikapadukone) <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">January 28, 2017</TIMEX3> 
  
Deepika expressed her sadness at what transpired at Padmavati set, and said that claims of twisting Khilji’s story are baseless. She mentioned that the film promotes “courageous and powerful woman in the purest form there is.” 
  
As a team, we are making 'Padmavati' keeping in mind the sensitivities and emotions of the people of Rajasthan and the Rajput community. 
 
— Ranveer Singh (@RanveerOfficial) <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">January 28, 2017</TIMEX3> 
   
Sanjay Sir is one of the most accomplished & authentic filmmakers we have in India, & he wont ever do anything to hurt anyones feelings. 
 
— Ranveer Singh (@RanveerOfficial) <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">January 28, 2017</TIMEX3> 
   
Whats happened is very unfortunate. We hope the people of Rajasthan will understand & empathise with our intentions & give us their support.

Ranveer Singh, who brings emperor Alauddin Khilji to life in the movie, commented that the film’s team has been very understanding of the Rajput community’s emotions, and doesn’t intend to hurt them. He hopes that they will gather more support hereon. 
  
Very very sad. Words do fall short and feel too little to express feelings. Violence is unacceptable. This incident has shocked me. 
 
— Shahid Kapoor (@shahidkapoor) <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">January 28, 2017</TIMEX3> 
   
We need to look deep within as a society, as a country, as a people. Where are we headed. 
 
— Shahid Kapoor (@shahidkapoor) <TIMEX3 tid="t35" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">January 28, 2017</TIMEX3> 
   
Sanjay bhansali is a film maker who the country should be proud of. You will know when u see #padmavati the dignity he brings to it. 
 
— Shahid Kapoor (@shahidkapoor) <TIMEX3 tid="t39" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">January 28, 2017</TIMEX3> 
   
And my only regret is that I wasn't by his side when this happened. 
 
— Shahid Kapoor (@shahidkapoor) <TIMEX3 tid="t43" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">January 28, 2017</TIMEX3> 
  
Shahid Kapoor slammed the <TIMEX3 tid="t45" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> state of affairs, and noted that “violence is unacceptable. This incident has shocked me.” The icon resented his absence from the set at the time when Bhansali was assaulted. 
  
We have hit a curve in history where the film industry has to abandon its politics of silence. Silence <TIMEX3 tid="t46" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> will tantamount to betrayal. 
 
— Mahesh Bhatt (@MaheshNBhatt) <TIMEX3 tid="t49" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">January 28, 2017</TIMEX3> 
   
Shocked appalled saddened !!! #IstandbySLB it's unfair to target us as an industry just because we take a dignified stand n stay quiet... 
 
— Arjun Kapoor (@arjunk26) <TIMEX3 tid="t53" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">January 28, 2017</TIMEX3> 
   
What happened on the sets of Padmavati is ridiculous. 
There is such a thing as creative freedom and cinematic license. 
 
— Alia Bhatt (@aliaa08) <TIMEX3 tid="t57" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">January 27, 2017</TIMEX3> 
   
Did random people enter another persons workplace n raise their hand on him because dey decide dey don't like what he does? I am enraged!!!

Among those who criticised the alarming incident were Mahesh Bhatt, Arjun Kapoor, Alia Bhatt, Hrithik Roshan, Priyanka Chopra, Kabir Khan, Parineeti Chopra, and Sunidhi Chauhan. 
  
My fellow film folk, if we do not unite <TIMEX3 tid="t84" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> against these recurring incidents of bullying, it's going to get much worse. #IstandbySLB 
 
— Farhan Akhtar (@FarOutAkhtar) <TIMEX3 tid="t87" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">January 27, 2017</TIMEX3> 
   
If u don't like what he's making, don't watch his film. What's with the violence?? Apart from a vulgar display of self righteousness.. 
 
— Farhan Akhtar (@FarOutAkhtar) <TIMEX3 tid="t91" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">January 27, 2017</TIMEX3> 
   
I'm waiting to see how many people are punished for what they've done to #SanjayLeelaBhansali & his crew. There's enough evidence. 
 
— Farhan Akhtar (@FarOutAkhtar) <TIMEX3 tid="t95" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">January 27, 2017</TIMEX3> 
   
Here's how it is... don't like or agree with our films? Simple solutions. Don't buy a ticket and watch them. That's it!! 
 
— Abhishek Bachchan (@juniorbachchan) January 28, <TIMEX3 tid="t101" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28T20:17">2017 
   
Am</TIMEX3> appalled at what has happened with Sanjay Bhansali....this is the time  for all us as an industry to stand by our people and fraternity!! 
 
— Karan Johar (@karanjohar) <TIMEX3 tid="t104" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">January 27, 2017</TIMEX3> 
   
Having been through many instances of turmoil during a film shoot or release...i understand Sanjay's emotion at this point...I stand by him. 
 
— Karan Johar (@karanjohar) January 27, <TIMEX3 tid="t110" type="TIME" value="2017-01-27T20:17">2017 
   
Am</TIMEX3> exceptionally happy to see the support coming in from members of the film fraternity.... #IstandbySLB ....this is time we need each other 
 
— Karan Johar (@karanjohar) <TIMEX3 tid="t113" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">January 28, 2017</TIMEX3> 
   
And for all those so called protectors of history!!! Have you read the script of the film??? Do you know facts??? So then just SHUT UP!!!! 
 
— Karan Johar (@karanjohar) <TIMEX3 tid="t117" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">January 28, 2017</TIMEX3> 
  
In addition, Farhan Akhtar, Abhishek Bachchan, and Karan Johar refrained from suppressing their anger, and verbally whipped the assailants. 
   
On the other hand, Sonam Kapoor instead appealed to Prime Minister Modi, underscoring that such incidents are “disheartening” for the artists, and just action should be taken. 
 
Twitter soon started filling up with the hashtag #IstandbySLB, showing support for Sanjay Leela Bhansali, who, according to latest reports in Indian media, has decided to go back to Mumbai and continue shooting elsewhere. 
 
India <TIMEX3 tid="t119" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Today</TIMEX3> stated that Bhansali was “members of a fringe outfit called Karni Sena” beat up the director for misrepresenting Khilji dynasty’s tales. Although rumours on media hinted at a romantic scene between Rani Padmini (Deepika Padukone) and Alauddin Khilji (Ranveer Singh), Padmavati team and top management has declined all such allegations. 
 
In response, Film & Television Producers Guild of India also vehemently condemned the violent attack, saying “the dastardly act of vandalism and assault […] is extremely unfortunate, deplorable, and totally unacceptable to the Indian film industry,” according to Hindustan Times. 
 
Although the director did not file any complaints or register a case, security authorities have arrested some people with regard to this case, local media says. 
 
Earlier, Jodhaa Akbar faced severe disapproval from the Rajput community, and was not allowed to be released in the state.
