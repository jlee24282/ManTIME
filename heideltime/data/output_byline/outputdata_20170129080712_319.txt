Two Interstate-70 interchanges outside of Washington, Pa., are listed among the top 100 bottlenecks for truckers by the Arlington, Va.-based American Transportation Research Institute.

Ranked 61st on ATRI’s <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> list is I-70 heading west at Interstate-79 just north of Washington and just before exits for Tanger Outlets and The Meadows. It jumped 83 notches from ATRI’s ranking <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3>, with trucks averaging 49 m.p.h. in peak hours and 51 m.p.h. in non-peak hours.

Ranked 96th is I-70 eastbound at I-79 east of Washington and west of the exit for Route 519 and Eighty Four jumped 24 notches. Trucks there averaged 52 m.p.h. in peak hours and 53 in non-peak hours.

“ATRI’s analysis allows us to target state and federal resources to keep trucks, and the economy, moving,” Pennsylvania Motor Truck Association President Kevin Stewart said in an ATRI release.

Pennsylvania in turn in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent years</TIMEX3> has been putting resources toward upgrading I-70 between New Stanton and Washington.

“We have long known that our interstates need to be modernized, particularly this area, where two high volume interstates run together for approximately five miles,” said Valerie Petersen, spokeswoman for PennDOT District 12 in Uniontown. “The approximate traffic volume is 60,000 per day with upwards of 25 percent being trucks.”

Petersen said work has been completed on the South Junction flyover and intersection in Washington and will be completed <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017">this year</TIMEX3> on the corridor from Beau Street in Washington to the North Junction. Further west, the state’s first “diverging diamond interchange” will be completed in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-06">June</TIMEX3> on I-70 at U.S. Route 19 (Murtland Avenue) in Washington.

“This will make three lanes in each direction,” Petersen said.

Also, work is scheduled to begin <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-SP">this spring</TIMEX3> on the corridor from Route 519 to Beau Street.

“It will take <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P3Y">three years</TIMEX3> to construct for a contract value of almost $120 million,” the District 12 spokeswoman said.

The I-70/I-79 interchanges are among four in Pennsylvania making that top 100. Others are I-76 (Pennsylvania Turnpike) at I-676 (44th place) and I-76 at I-476 (96th place), both in the Philadelphia area.

“In general, Pennsylvania being the Keystone State has large truck volumes,” Petersen said. “Traffic from New York, New Jersey and New England goes through Pennsylvania to reach the rest of the nation.”

The PennDOT District 12 spokeswoman said her agency offers extensive driver information – including updates where congestion develops – at www.511PA.com.

ATRI said it considered 250 locations, using Global Positioning System data from more than 600,000 heavy duty trucks as part of the Federal Highway Administration’s Freight Performance Measures initiative.

The interchange of I-285 and I-85 heading north at Atlanta, Ga., remained first on the ATRI 100. Swapping positions were I-95 at state Route 4 near Fort Lee, N.J., <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> second, and I-290 at I-90/I-94 near Chicago, <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> third.
