5 ways to be different with your occasion-wear staple 
 
 1. SHEER GENIUS 
Sheer blouses are in. Go for sleeves in tulle, net or organza. Floral motifs and embroidery add a Victorian appeal. 
 
 2. LAYER UP WITH A JACKET 
There are a million ways you can sport a jacket with Indian bridal wear. Replace your choli or crop top with a short, embellished jacket or skip the dupatta and wear a long-slit, full-length jacket. A cape jacket can also make for a great alternative. 
 
3. ADD RUFFLED ROMANCE 
From a ruffled sari pallu to dupattas and lehengas with elaborate ruffles, incorporate this trend into your wedding outfit to add a bit of sophisticated drama. Ruffles in pretty pastel hues are delicate, feminine and trendy. 
TIP: Pick colours like light pink, mint, sky blue and peach.

 OTHER STYLES YOU CAN TRY 
 
 Do the shoulder trick 
Give your traditional choli a fresh twist by adapting the season's popular "shoulder show-off" trend. 
 Embrace black and grey 
Get in touch with your dark side. Reds, maroons, yellows and greens are definitely classic and lovely, but there's something striking about a bride bucking the tradition in hot, goth colours like black, grey, midnight blue and deep violet. 
 
Flaunting a toned collarbone is an express ticket to adding a hint of sex appeal to the bridal look!
