Protests are scheduled <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3> in Washington, Orlando, Boston, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Seattle, and Chicago, mostly at airports. 
Olivia Katbi Smith told CNN affiliate KATU she showed up <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> at Portland International Airport because she believes Trump's immigration policies are cruel. 
"I think it's horrific and terrible and we are basically condemning people to death by not allowing them to come here," she said. 
 
She said the event appeared to be impromptu. She heard about it on Twitter and thinks most people did the same. 
 In New York City, a large crowd massed at John F. Kennedy International Airport to protest the detention of two Iraqis who were later released.  
"Mr. President, look at us," said US Rep. Nydia Velazquez, a New York Democrat. "This is America. What you have done is shameful. It's un-American." 
 
The protesters gathered in Terminal 4 at JFK and carried signs reading, "We are all immigrants!" and "No ban! No wall!" 
 
Several New York officials showed support for the protests. 
 
Gov. Andrew Cuomo ordered the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to reverse an earlier decision to restrict passage aboard the JFK Airport AirTrain to ticketed passengers and airport employees only. 
 
He also instructed state police and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to assist with security and transportation for protesters. 
 
"The people of New York will have their voices heard," Cuomo said. 
 
New York Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted: "What's happening at JFK is shameful. @NYCImmigrants Affairs Commissioner Nisha Agarwal is on the ground <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> working to help." 
 
 Airport arrests  
 
One of the detained Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh, was released <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TAF" mod="START">early Saturday afternoon</TIMEX3>. He worked with the US government for <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="P10Y">10 years</TIMEX3> after the United States invaded Iraq. 
   

  
Protestors rally at John F. Kennedy International Airport. 
  
The other detained Iraqi, Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been granted a visa to join his wife, who worked for a US contractor in Iraq, and son, both of whom already live in the United States as refugees. Alshawi was released <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28" mod="END">later Saturday</TIMEX3>. 
 
The American Civil Liberties Union argued <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TEV">Saturday evening</TIMEX3> in a federal court in New York for a nationwide stay that would block the deportation of all people stranded in US airports under what the group called "President Trump's new Muslim ban." 
 
A federal judge in New York granted an emergency stay <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TNI">Saturday night</TIMEX3> for citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries who have already arrived in the US and those who are in transit, and who hold valid visas, ruling they cannot be removed from the US. 
 
That move limited part of President Trump's executive order barring citizens from those countries from entering the US for <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DURATION" value="P90D">the next 90 days</TIMEX3>. 
 
Rep. Jerrold Nadler, another Democrat from New York, said 10 other travelers were detained, but their status was unclear <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TNI">Saturday night</TIMEX3>. 
 
Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe joined protesters at Dulles International Airport outside Washington. 
 
"This executive order is antithetical to the values that make America great, and it will make our country less safe," he said in a statement. 
 
In Portland, one demonstrator carried a sign that said, "Portland coffee comes from Yemen," one of the seven Muslim-majority nations on the no-travel list. 
 
Lucia Martinez told KATU she used to be a "hashtag activist" but felt compelled to protest at the airport. 
 
"This was the last straw," she said of Trump's policies. "We're all immigrants." 
 
A group of community activists, attorneys and others gathered at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago. 
 
Protests also took place at airports in Boston; San Francisco, Denver, Dallas and Newark, New Jersey.
