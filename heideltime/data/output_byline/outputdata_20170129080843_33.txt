Steven Gerrard has described Liverpool as one of the best teams to watch in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-H1">the first half</TIMEX3> of the Premier League season despite their <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> blip.  
Liverpool finished <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3> on a high note with a 1-0 win against title rivals Manchester City to leave Jurgen Klopp’s side on the coattails of leaders Chelsea. 
 
However, the Reds have struggled to recreate their electric performances in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> so far after a run of one win in seven games in all competitions. 
 
Indeed, Liverpool have dropped to fourth place in the Premier League table after failing to win a game in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> despite facing two clubs in the relegation zone. 
 
Speaking to BT Sport ahead of Liverpool’s clash against Wolverhampton Wanderers in the FA Cup fifth round on <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TAF">Saturday afternoon</TIMEX3>, Gerrard claimed that Jurgen Klopp’s side were one of the best attacking units in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-H1">the first half</TIMEX3> of the campaign. 
 
“Jurgen Klopp has come in and he has done wonders to the football club. They have been brilliant up until <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2017-01">January</TIMEX3>. They’re very attacking. They’re one of the best teams to watch,” Gerrard said.
