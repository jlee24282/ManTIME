<TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2016" mod="END">Late last year</TIMEX3>, Sumiton Church of God welcomed a new couple to lead the church, husband and wife Pastor Victor Massey and Pastor Jamie Massey. 
 
The couple describes themselves as a “team ministry and co-pastors.” 
 
Altough the Masseys only arrived at the church in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2016-11">November 2016</TIMEX3>, Victor says God had been getting he and his wife ready for the move for <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P2Y" mod="MORE_THAN">over two years</TIMEX3>. 
 
“The Lord kind of prepared me for moving us here with a dream and so, <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3>, everything materialized and here we are,” Victor explained. 
 
This wasn’t the first time that Victor had been given a calling in regard to his future. 
 
“I felt the call [to enter the ministry] when I was a junior in high school,” he said. “I got the confirmation on that when I was a senior in high school.” 
 
He gave his first sermon during his senior year of high school and after graduating, attended Lee University. 
 
While there, Victor and Jamie were introduced by her sister and later married in <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="1983-06">June 1983</TIMEX3>. 
 
Their first church as pastor was at Lifeway Church of God in Leeds, where they stayed for five and a half years. 
 
Following this, Victor and Jamie spent <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="PXY">several years</TIMEX3> as state youth directors in Kansas and northern Ohio before Victor “began to feel the pull in my heart to go back to pastoring.” 
 
The couple moved to Atlanta, where they lead Life Church International for the last 18 and a half years before their move to Sumiton. 
 
In addition to assisting with her husband’s pastoring, Jamie has founded her own nonprofit ministry, Jamie Massey Ministries. 
 
“It was launched with a vision of mentoring,” Jamie explained. “Initially, I thought we would be pouring our efforts into the next generation but I’m finding that all generations of women are desiring to be mentored.” 
 
In addition, Jamie has also authored The Call to Mentory, a leader’s guide for her program, as well as another book, Like a Vapor. 
 
Victor and Jamie have two sons, Micah and Caleb, who still live in Georgia with their wives, Shannon and Nubya, and one grandchild, Oliver. 
 
Jamie said they’re adjusting to small town life after having lived in Atlanta — and the city’s traffic — for so long. 
 
“I’ve got to adjust to this world where you don’t have to schedule your life around traffic,” she said with a laugh. “We’re loving that.” 
 
While they’re still searching for a permament house in the area to call home, Victor emphasized that the couple wants to stay local because “when we came here, I strongly felt called to more than just the church. I felt that the Lord called me to this community.” 
 
He added that he also wants to “bridge the gap” between the church and Sumiton Christian School in order to create a more cooperative effort between the two in reaching out to the community. 
 
Victor and Jamie also hope to be able to bring more unity to the communities in the area and are used the Bible verses Matthew 5:14-16 as a basis for their vision and mission for the church. 
 
Jamie explained, “Our heart is for the community, it isn’t just about the church. It’s about building a better community here.” 
 
But the couple have been enjoying their experiences in Walker County so far. 
 
“The people are amazing. They’ve been so friendly and made us feel so welcome,” Jamie said. 
 
Victor added that they’re thrilled to be here.
