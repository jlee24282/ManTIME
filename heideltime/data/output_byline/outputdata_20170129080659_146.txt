Trey Morrill made it tough on Montrose when he was at the top of Fruita Monument’s suffocating 1-3-1 zone defense. 
 
At 6-foot-6, the lanky, long-armed Morrill took away passing lanes and harassed Montrose ball-handlers beyond the top of the key. Then, to start <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2018-Q4">the fourth quarter</TIMEX3>, Morrill snagged a steal near midcourt and took off, the crowd roaring in anticipation. 
 
Morrill didn’t disappoint as the senior soared in high above the rim for a powerful dunk to put the Wildcats up 40-9. 
 
Fruita Monument (9-9, 2-1) used that swarming defense throughout to come away with a 47-13 Southwestern League win over Montrose on <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>. 
 
“We just want to create a lot of havoc up there,” Morrill said about the zone defense. “We want to create steals and get layups and dunks. Our best defense is our greatest offense, and we have a great defense.” 
 
Offensively, the Wildcats started quick with a three-point play from Gunner Rigsby and a 3-pointer from Jake Brizzolara for an 8-0 lead. 
 
The 5-foot-10 Rigsby, who finished with a game-high 21 points, slipped a dunk over the rim later in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2017-Q1">the first quarter</TIMEX3>, and followed that with a highlight-reel underhand scoop for a bucket to put the Wildcats up 20-2. 
 
But it was the Wildcats’ defense that was the real star of the game. The 13 points allowed was a school record for Fruita Monument, breaking the old mark of 16. 
 
“We just kept working and working on defense, and the rim just kept getting tighter and tighter for them,” Fruita coach Billy Dreher said. 
 
Montrose (6-11, 0-3 SWL ), a team of underclassman, was no match for the Wildcats’ size, experience and athleticism. 
 
Morrill finished with eight points and Brizzolara seven for the Wildcats.

Angelique Gall’s solid all-around game led Fruita Monument to a 56-24 Southwestern League win over Montrose. 
 
In <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2017-Q1">the first quarter</TIMEX3> when the Wildcats took a 21-5 lead, Gall did a little everything. 
 
The Wildcats (16-1, 3-0 SWL) pounded the ball inside to the junior, who scored the first 10 points of the game and 12 of her 16 points in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2017-Q1">the first quarter</TIMEX3>. 
 
Gall also scored off an offensive rebound, blocked a shot and forced two steals in the opening quarter. 
 
Rosa Lopez added a 3-pointer and the Wildcats were cruised toward another blowout win. 
 
“They had a smaller lineup and we knew we wanted to get the ball inside,” Gall said. “We knew it was going to work with any of our post (players),” 
 
As usual, the Wildcats’ swarming defense, including a half-court press, was key to the win. 
 
Montrose (11-6, 1-2 SWL) finally crashed in on Gall, who took a pass inside at the post, then kicked it out to a wide-open MacKenzie Wells on the wing who swished a 3-pointer. 
 
“That’s one of my favorite things to do, especially kicking it out to our guards,” Gall said. 
 
Coach Michael Wells shuffled players in and out for the rest of the game, with reserves getting plenty of playing time. 
 
<TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2016-Q2">The second quarter</TIMEX3> was choppy for the Wildcats until Amy Stagg drilled a 3-pointer. Then, with the clock winding down, Alexis Prall swished a 3-pointer at the buzzer to put give the Wildcats a 31-10 lead at halftime.
