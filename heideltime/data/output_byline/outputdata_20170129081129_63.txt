WINONA — A water supply cooperative in Winona is trying to figure out how to satisfy the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA) without going bankrupt.

In addition to facing a potential $25,000 <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> fine for not having a water operator, the Winona Water Supply Cooperative Board is looking at how to fix a low pressure violation.

Fixing the pressure problem can be done in a variety of ways, but all at a price tag the cooperative board said it just can’t handle.

The water system was not in violation of any water quality standards, Board Trustee Alan Gamble said.

The system has supplied water in the small community in Butler Township for <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="PXY">several years</TIMEX3> through a shallow hand-laid brick well that is at least 120 years old. The well pumps to a 10,000-gallon cistern located at the top of a hill.

Due to being privately-run, the company has limited to no access to any public county, state or federal funding to help. By law, public funding cannot be used for private projects.

The OEPA has recommended the board contact the Rural Community Assistance Program (RCAP) for funding assistance options.

The board held a public meeting with residents <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-W04">this week</TIMEX3> to communicate the problem, and Gamble resigned as trustee at the end of the meeting, ending his roughly <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P20Y">20 years</TIMEX3> of service.

Gamble said he made the decision prior to the meeting and is leaving for the same reason David Hull, the company’s water operator of record <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> left.

Gamble said they fear being held personally liable for the problems, like the former operator, Jim Bates.

Bates was serving as operator for Winona while also working as Water Superintendent for Sebring, prior to being fired from Sebring <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3> following OEPA action.

Trustees said rough estimates to make the repairs to the pressure are anywhere from $200,000 to $300,000 – a high price for the cooperative that averages $500 to $600 in its account at billing time <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="SET" value="P1M" quant="EACH">each month</TIMEX3>.

“They (OEPA) know we can’t do it <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2017-01-30">tomorrow</TIMEX3>,” 

Retired water board trustee Homer Althouse said he has been in contact with county engineer and sanitary engineer Bert Dawson.

Dawson told the Journal prior to the meeting that while the county has no responsibility to fix the problem, he has been speaking with residents who reached out to him with their concerns.

“I’ve offered to help them, and I’m sure everyone else would too,” 

His suggestions include having the homes with low pressure directly hook into the line that goes uphill from the well to the cistern, which he believes might result in enough pressure to satisfy the OEPA requirements, or installing a larger above-ground water storage tank, which would also increase water pressure since the lines are gravity fed from the cistern.

However, Gamble is not sure the cooperative can finance those options.

The board has reached out to state Rep. Tim Ginter for help, and Ginter said he has also spoken with Dawson and the OEPA about the matter.

The board was displeased that no one from the OEPA attended the meeting, as they requested.

Alan Gamble’s brother John Gamble Jr., who is the county’s chief assistant prosecuting attorney, was at the meeting and said that while there is a chance the company could walk away and the residents be taken over by another company or public water system, tapping into another system would be expensive.

For example, if they would become part of the Buckeye Water District, their <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="SET" value="XXXX-XX">monthly</TIMEX3> bill could be as high as $70, he said.

The city of Salem is another possible public water source, he added, but cautioned against those options due to the increased cost to customers.

With Alan Gamble out of the picture <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> as water trustee, the two remaining trustees and Althouse, who volunteered to replace Gamble on the board beginning that evening, will be considering the options and updating residents.

Alan Gamble later said he would continue to help the board and the community as he could.
