OREM, Utah - The New Mexico State Aggies simply do not know how to lose.  
 
Utah Valley nearly pulled the upset at home, but the Aggies overcame a seven-point halftime deficit to win their 18th game in a row, 74-69.  
 
The Wolverines held a one-point lead with just <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="PT1M">over a minute</TIMEX3> to play, but Ian Baker was able to find Eli Chuha for the go-ahead layup.  
 
After a defensive stop, NMSU then scored again on the same combination to take a three-point lead with just under <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="PT10S">ten seconds</TIMEX3> to play.  
 
Utah Valley took a timeout to draw up a play, but Baker stole the inbounds pass to effectively seal the win for the Aggies.  
 
NMSU improved to 20-2 on the season and remained unbeaten in WAC play at 7-0.  
 
The Aggies were able to overcome 18 turnovers (compared to Utah Valley's 11) and a poor performance from downtown (just 8-28 from beyond the arc) to get the win.  
 
NMSU <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> has sole possession of the second-longest active winning streak in the country after Oregon lost <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>.  Gonzaga still holds the top spot after winning its 22nd in a row <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TNI">Saturday night</TIMEX3>.  
 
The Aggies next play a non-conference game against Northern New Mexico on <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017-01-23">Monday</TIMEX3> before resuming WAC play at home against Chicago State on <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2017-02-04">Feb. 4</TIMEX3>.
