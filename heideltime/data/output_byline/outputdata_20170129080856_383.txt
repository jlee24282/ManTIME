Geoffrey James "Geoff" Nicholls (<TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="1948-02-28">28 February 1948</TIMEX3> - <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">28 January 2017</TIMEX3>) was a British musician and keyboardist who was a longtime member of the heavy metal band Black Sabbath, until <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2004">2004</TIMEX3>. Nicholls also played in the NWOBHM band Quartz before joining Black Sabbath. In <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="196" mod="END">the late 1960s</TIMEX3>/<TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="197" mod="START">early 1970s</TIMEX3>, Geoff played lead guitar for the Birmingham band Johnny Neal and the Starliners. 

Nicholls was originally brought in as a second guitarist when Black Sabbath doubted whether they would even continue under that name. Nicholls then switched to bass when Geezer Butler left briefly, and then became the band's keyboardist upon Butler's return and the decision to keep the Sabbath name. Nicholls' first appearance on a Black Sabbath album was on <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="198">1980's</TIMEX3> Heaven and Hell, and was credited as keyboardist on every Sabbath release from that time until 13, although he was not an official member until <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="1986">1986</TIMEX3>. He remained an official member until <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="1991">1991</TIMEX3>, then regained member status from <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="1993">1993</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="1996">1996</TIMEX3>. He was an unofficial member once again since the reunion with Ozzy Osbourne in <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="1997">1997</TIMEX3>. Although his main role with Sabbath has been on the keyboard Nicholls also played some rhythm guitar on the reunion tours, e.g. during Iommi's solo in "Snowblind" and a few tracks during the Headless Cross and Forbidden tours. 

In addition to not always being credited as a full member of the band, Nicholls has rarely appeared on stage proper during Sabbath shows, instead usually playing from a side-stage or backstage position. One exception to this was the tour in support of the <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DATE" value="1986">1986</TIMEX3> album Seventh Star, where he played on stage as an equal member of the band. Another is a concert in <TIMEX3 tid="t34" type="DATE" value="1988-05">May 1988</TIMEX3>, where Nicholls played bass for a charity function. 

Nicholls' involvement with the band ended when Adam Wakeman (a member of Ozzy Osbourne's solo band) was chosen to play keyboards during Sabbath's <TIMEX3 tid="t35" type="DATE" value="2004">2004</TIMEX3> and 2005 tours as part of Ozzfest and Scott Warren (Dio) handled keyboard duties on the <TIMEX3 tid="t37" type="DATE" value="2007">2007</TIMEX3> Heaven & Hell tour. 

Until his death, Nicholls played keyboards with former Black Sabbath singer Tony Martin in his band Tony Martin's Headless Cross. Nicholls had previously performed on both of Martin's solo albums and their support tours. 
Nicholls died from lung cancer on <TIMEX3 tid="t41" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">28 January 2017</TIMEX3> at the age of 68 surrounded by his family.
