Long-time readers know this site tracks the the year-over-year growth rate of the forward S&P 500 estimate, which dollar estimate is given weekly by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, “<TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017-W04">This Week</TIMEX3> in Earnings”. 

The year-over-year growth rate is my calculation for readers, and it really represents a kind-of “forward S&P 500 earnings” curve. (That sounds fancy, and rather Wall Street-ish, but the forward <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="P4Q">4-quarter</TIMEX3> estimate simply tracks the dollar changes in the S&P 500 earnings estimate <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION" value="P4Q" mod="MORE_THAN">over the next 4 quarters</TIMEX3>, which is <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> Q1 ’17 – Q4 ’17.) 

Here is the this week’s data: 

Forward <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DURATION" value="P4Q">4-quarter</TIMEX3> S&P 500 earnings estimate: $132.91 down slightly from last week’s $132.93 

P.E ratio: 17.3(x) 

PEG ratio: 2.16(x) 

S&P 500 earnings yield: 5.79% down from last week’s 5.85% 

Year-over-year growth rate of the forward estimate: +8%, up from last week’s +6.75%. 

Here is the trend in the y/y growth rate of the S&P 500 forward estimate, a statistic all but ignored by the mainstream financial media: 

<TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">1/27/17</TIMEX3>: +8% ($132.91) 

<TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2016-12-30">12/30/16</TIMEX3>: +5.03% ($128.57) 

<TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2016-11-25">11/25/16</TIMEX3>: +4.03% ($128.56) 

<TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2016-10-28">10/28/16</TIMEX3>: +3.74% ($128.97) 

<TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2016-09-30">9/30/16</TIMEX3>: -1.18% ($125.09) 

This site has been tracking the forward estimate and its year-over-year growth rate since <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2000">the year 2000</TIMEX3>. We’ve just finished <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DURATION" value="P2Y">a 24-month period</TIMEX3> from <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2014" mod="END">late 2014</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2016" mod="END">late 2016</TIMEX3>, where the y/y growth rate fell from the 9% range, to a low of -3% in <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2016" mod="START">early 2016</TIMEX3>, all due to the Energy sector drag. 

Personally I’d love to see y/t growth rate in the forward estimate of 10% – that will be the highest “expected” growth rate in a very long time. The last time the S&P 500 earnings grew 15%, was <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DATE" value="2011">2011</TIMEX3>, <TIMEX3 tid="t38" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3> when the S&P 500 suffered a 20% correction from <TIMEX3 tid="t34" type="DATE" value="2016-05">May</TIMEX3>, <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DATE" value="2011">2011</TIMEX3> through <TIMEX3 tid="t36" type="DATE" value="2016-10" mod="START">early October</TIMEX3>, <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DATE" value="2011">2011</TIMEX3>. 

What is truly interesting about the data is that – even prior to the US Presidential election – the S&P 500 forward earnings estimate was starting to rise rapidly.
