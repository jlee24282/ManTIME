Two lives were lost on the same stretch of road <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="TIME" value="2017-01-27TNI">Friday night</TIMEX3>, just hours apart. Baltimore County Police are <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> trying to piece together the timelines of two fatal accidents. 
 
A crumpled bicycle is <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> haunting evidence of a crash that killed a boy in Randallstown. The first crash happened just before <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="TIME" value="2017-01-27T21:00">9 p.m.</TIMEX3> near Marriottsville Road. Early investigating revealed that a 19-year-old woman and a 14-year-old boy were riding together on one bicycle west on Liberty Road. They were struck by a <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2002">2002</TIMEX3> Nissan Ultima, also traveling west on Liberty Road.

The young woman he was with was transported to an area hospital with life-threatening injuries. She is in stable condition at last report. 
 
The driver of the Nissan remain at the scene and has been identified as Conrad Oliver Antonio Thorpe, 23, from Randallstown. He has been charged with driving under the influence and is being held at the Baltimore County Detention Center without bail. 
 
“It doesn’t have to happen. This absolutely could have been avoided. If he hadn’t been drunk at the time, you have to ask yourself: would he have seen them? Would he have been paying more attention?” says Officer Jennifer Peach, with Baltimore County Police. 
 
“<TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Right now</TIMEX3> we’re trying to review any video footage that we have from any of the stores along Liberty Road to see if we can get an image of them on the bike,” says Officer Peach. 
 
The second crash happened just before midnight on Liberty Road at Offutt Road when a red <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2012">2012</TIMEX3> Hyundai Tucson traveling east suddenly crossed over the center line and collided head-on with an MTA transport van heading west. 
 
The only passenger in the van was transported to an area hospital for treatment of minor injuries. The driver was also transported to an area hospital as a precaution but has been released from the hospital. 
 
The driver of the Hyundai has been identified as William Thomas Rideout, 44 from Randallstown. He was transported to Northwest Hospital where he was pronounced dead. 
 
“It’s possible he could have had some kind of medical emergency happen. He could have fallen asleep. At this point, we just don’t know,” says Officer Peach. 
 
<TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3>, investigations continue to look into a pair of tragic encounters, that claimed two lives. 
 
The speed limit the area along Liberty Road where the incidents occurred is 40 MPH. That, and the fact that there are no bike lanes may play a part in the investigations.
