ASPEN — Swiss freeskier Luca Schuler was motionless <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TNI">Saturday night</TIMEX3> as he slid down the X Games big air ramp after slamming hard on the landing of his signature triple-cork <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="1080">1080</TIMEX3> jump. 
 
Aspen Skiing Co. ski patrollers were with him before he came to a stop, bundling him in a sled and rushing him into a waiting ambulance. 
 
ESPN spokesman Danny Chi said Schuler’s CT scans were negative. 
 
“He was diagnosed with a concussion and will be discharged <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29TNI">tonight</TIMEX3>,” Chi said in a statement.
