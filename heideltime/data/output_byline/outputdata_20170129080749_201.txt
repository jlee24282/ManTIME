Syrians in the plain of al-Houla in Homs northern countryside are enduring treacherous <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-WI">winter</TIMEX3> conditions amid the snowstorm that is hitting the area. Heating materials are almost not found in the Assad regime-besieged al-Dow town. 
 
“Life conditions are extremely difficult, my son. Al-Houla is witnessing - as you see - subzero temperatures. 2% of the locals have diesel of the worst quality. They use it for heating. Others are breaking the branches of trees. While the majority is using the garbage and plastic sacks to warm themselves, a fifty year old man spoke to SMART.    
 
A man from al-Houla appeared in video footage published by SMART. The man was burning what seemed to be old garbage plastic sacks to set the fire saying, “Thanks God, when we went to the streets against Assad regime, we went for God’s sake. We still believe in dogma.”

“It is a very hard <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-WI">winter</TIMEX3>. There is no diesel. There is no firewood. The litre of diesel soared to reach 600 Syrian Liras. We have been on this condition for <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P5Y" mod="EQUAL_OR_MORE">at least 5 years</TIMEX3>," the man added. 
 
It is worthy to remind that Assad terrorists and the allied Shia militias besiege all cities, towns and villages of Homs northern countryside. These sectarian terrorists prevent any NGO’s convoys from reaching even the outskirts of those areas.
