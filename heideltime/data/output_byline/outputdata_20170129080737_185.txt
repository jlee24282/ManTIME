CHICAGO -- The questions coming from <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>'s kids-only press conference during SoxFest at the Hilton Chicago weren't quite as tough for Todd Frazier as hitting a Chris Sale slider. 

But they were challenging, at times, and always entertaining as delivered by the future of the White Sox fan base. 

"It was good," said a smiling Frazier after the seminar, where he was joined on stage by Lucas Giolito and Carlos Rodon. "I tell the guys all the time, they come up with some crafty questions. And they do their homework. It makes for a fun time answering those questions." 

This seminar featured questions for the trio of White Sox, ranging from favorite cereal to favorite food to what profession they would hold if they weren't baseball players. Frazier went with Cinnamon Toast Crunch, French fries and math teacher. 

There also were more than a few interesting baseball-related inquiries. 

One astute young fan asked Frazier if he would do a bat flip if he ever connected for a home run off Sale, his friend, former teammate and <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> potential opponent with the Red Sox. Frazier played a strong diplomatic role by saying that he might do one because it's not very easy to connect off one of the game's best pitchers, but he hoped Sale would take it in good fun because he didn't want a fastball in the ribs. 

"That was impressive," Frazier said of the Sale question. "I hope I can hit a home run off of him so I get an opportunity to do it." 

Another fan asked Frazier for his career home run total, and he missed by seven when stating 155 (148 actually). That question was followed by a youngster asking Rodon for his career strikeout total, which Rodon didn't know, but another young fan gave him the correct answer of 307. 

A final challenge for Frazier came when asked if he would rather hit a home run in every at-bat or win a World Series as a team but be really bad individually after the championship. Following a good laugh from the panel and throughout the Continental Ballroom, Frazier went with the World Series. 

Connecting with the youngest White Sox supporters was the most important factor during these <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="PT45M">45 minutes</TIMEX3>. But a good time was had by all. 

"We are here basically for the kids," Frazier said. "I'll stop on a dime just to give a kid a smile and an autograph and a picture. This is what a fanfest is about. The kids up and coming to be true White Sox fans and they grow loving this team."
