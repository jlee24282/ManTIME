“The global energy landscape is changing. Traditional centers of demand are being overtaken by fast-growing emerging markets. The energy mix is shifting, driven by technological improvements and environmental concerns. More than ever, our industry needs to adapt to meet those changing energy needs,” said Bob Dudley, BP group chief executive. 
 
According to the <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> edition of the BP Energy Outlook , published <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3>, global demand for energy is expected to increase by around 30% between <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2035">2035</TIMEX3>, an average growth of 1.3% per year. However, this growth in energy demand is significantly lower than the 3.4% per year rise expected in global GDP, reflecting improved energy efficiency driven by technology improvements and environmental concerns. 
 
The Outlook looks at long-term energy trends and develops projections for world energy markets <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION" value="P2DE" mod="MORE_THAN">over the next two decades</TIMEX3>. The <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> edition was launched <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3> in London by Spencer Dale, BP’s group chief economist, and Bob Dudley, group chief executive. 
 
Main energy sources 
 
While non-fossil fuels are expected to account for half of the growth in energy supplies <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DURATION" value="P20Y" mod="MORE_THAN">over the next 20 years</TIMEX3>, the Outlook projects that oil and gas, together with coal, will remain the main source of energy powering the world economy, accounting for more than 75% of total energy supply in <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2035">2035</TIMEX3>, compared with 86% in <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3>. 
 
Oil demand grows at an average rate of 0.7% <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3>, although this is expected to slow gradually over the period. The transport sector continues to consume most of the world’s oil with its share of global demand remaining close to 60% in <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2035">2035</TIMEX3>. However, non-combusted use of oil, particularly in petrochemicals, takes over as the main source of growth for oil demand by <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="203" mod="START">the early 2030s</TIMEX3>. 
 
“The possibility that the most important source of growth in oil demand in <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="203">the 2030s</TIMEX3> won’t be to power cars or trucks or planes, but rather used as an input into other products, such as plastics and fabrics, is quite a change from the past,” said Spencer Dale. 
 
Gas grows more quickly than either oil or coal over the Outlook , with demand growing an average 1.6% <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3>. Its share of primary energy overtakes coal to be the second-largest fuel source by <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DATE" value="2035">2035</TIMEX3>. Shale gas production accounts for two-thirds of the increase in gas supplies, led by growth in the US. LNG growth, driven by increasing supplies in Australia and the US, is expected to lead to a globally integrated gas market anchored by US gas prices. 
 
Coal consumption is projected to peak in <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DATE" value="202" mod="MID">the mid-2020s</TIMEX3>, largely driven by China’s move towards cleaner, lower-carbon fuels. India is the largest growth market for coal, with its share of world coal demand doubling from around 10% in <TIMEX3 tid="t34" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3> to 20%in <TIMEX3 tid="t35" type="DATE" value="2035">2035</TIMEX3>. 
 
Renewables are projected to be the fastest growing fuel source, growing at an average rate of 7.6% per year, quadrupling over the Outlook, driven by increasing competitiveness of both solar and wind . China is the largest source of growth for renewables <TIMEX3 tid="t38" type="DURATION" value="P20Y" mod="MORE_THAN">over the next 20 years</TIMEX3>, adding more renewable power than the EU and US combined.     
 
Emerging themes 
 
The Outlook highlights a number of questions and uncertainties raised by the energy transition that is underway. 
 
Oil: changing dynamics of demand and supply 
 
All of the demand growth for oil in the period to <TIMEX3 tid="t39" type="DATE" value="2035">2035</TIMEX3> comes from emerging markets, with China accounting for half. 
 
The transport sector accounts for around two-thirds of the growth in oil demand.  Within that, oil demand for cars increases by around 4 million barrels per day underpinned by a doubling in the global car fleet.  The number of electric cars is assumed to increase from 1.2 million in <TIMEX3 tid="t40" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3> to around 100 million in <TIMEX3 tid="t41" type="DATE" value="2035">2035</TIMEX3> (around 5% of the global car fleet).  The Energy Outlook constructs two illustrative scenarios to consider the impact of the broader mobility revolution affecting the car market, including autonomous cars, car sharing and ride-pooling. 
 
“The impact of electric cars, together with other aspects of the mobility revolution, such as self-driving cars, car sharing and ride pooling, is one of the key uncertainties surrounding the long-term outlook for oil” said Spencer Dale. 
 
The slowing rate of oil demand growth is contrasted by the abundance of global oil resources.  The Energy Outlook speculates that the abundance of oil may cause low-cost producers, such as Middle East OPEC, Russia and the US, to use their competitive advantage to increase their market share at the expense of higher-cost producers. 
 
Gas: the emergence of a global market 
 
Gas continues to gain share from coal, helped by energy policies that encourage the shift in both industry and power generation. The main growth comes from China, Middle East and the US. 
 
In China, growth in gas consumption outstrips domestic production, so that by <TIMEX3 tid="t45" type="DATE" value="2035">2035</TIMEX3> imported gas comprises nearly 40% of total consumption, up from 30% in <TIMEX3 tid="t46" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3>. In Europe, the share of imports rises from around 50% in <TIMEX3 tid="t47" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3> to over 80% by <TIMEX3 tid="t48" type="DATE" value="2035">2035</TIMEX3>. 
 
The Outlook expects LNG supplies to grow rapidly to account for over half of traded gas by <TIMEX3 tid="t49" type="DATE" value="2035">2035</TIMEX3>.  This increase is led by supplies from the US, Australia and Africa. Around a third of this growth occurs <TIMEX3 tid="t52" type="DURATION" value="P4Y" mod="MORE_THAN">over the next four years</TIMEX3> as series of projects <TIMEX3 tid="t50" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> under development come on-stream. 
 
Carbon emissions: the need for further policy action 
 
Carbon emissions are projected to grow at less than a third of the rate seen in <TIMEX3 tid="t55" type="DURATION" value="P20Y">the past 20 years</TIMEX3>, by an average of 0.6% per year versus 2.1% per year, reflecting gains in energy efficiency and the changing fuel mix. 
 
If achieved, it would be the slowest rate of emissions growth for any <TIMEX3 tid="t58" type="DURATION" value="P20Y">20-year period</TIMEX3> since records began in <TIMEX3 tid="t56" type="DATE" value="1965">1965</TIMEX3>. However, carbon emissions from energy use in the base case are still projected to grow throughout the period, by about 13%. This is far in excess of the IEA’s 450 Scenario, which suggests that carbon emissions need to fall by around 30% by <TIMEX3 tid="t59" type="DATE" value="2035">2035</TIMEX3> to have a good chance of achieving the goals set out in Paris. The Outlook develops two alternative cases to explore the potential implications of a faster transition to a lower carbon environment. 
 
“The timing and form of government policy to encourage and facilitate the energy transition is important,” said Bob Dudley. “In BP, we continue to believe that carbon pricing has an important part to play as it provides incentives for everyone – producers and consumers alike – to play their part.”
