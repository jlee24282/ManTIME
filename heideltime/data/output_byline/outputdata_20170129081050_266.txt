The Collective Dairy Raspberry Pot Set Yoghurt Snack is Natural  
 The Collective Dairy Raspberry Pot Set Yoghurt snack is a new offering from the New Zealand-based dairy brand that has a distinctly old-fashioned recipe and process. While virtually all the yoghurts found on the mainstream market are set and then packaged, this one is placed into the pot and then allowed to set. This makes the yoghurt far more firm and creamy in order to provide a delicious dessert experience with every bite. 
The Collective Dairy Raspberry Pot Set Yoghurt snack is naturally rich in probiotics and is free of gluten and gelatin, and is suitable for consumption by vegetarians. The branding for the yoghurt is kept minimal and focused on the source of the ingredients in order to convey freshness and authenticity to the consumer.
