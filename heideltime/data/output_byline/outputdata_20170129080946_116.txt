One can understand the giddiness Republicans must be feeling <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">right now</TIMEX3>. They have complete control of our federal government. 

But giddiness must not fuel decision-making. Every decision Congress makes will have consequences and unintended outcomes. 

Which brings us to the wall that Donald Trump wants to build. 

The wall is an archaic idea, a non-solution promoted by a man with apparently little knowledge of history or diplomacy. Who builds walls like this? Desperate ancient civilizations built them as military defenses. East Germany built a wall that essentially imprisoned its citizens and became an international symbol of repression. History’s “great walls” have all been vain attempts to control the movement of people — and they all failed. 

The new president originally promised that this wall would be paid for by Mexico. <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> he says Americans will pay and Mexico will reimburse us later. That sounds like a grifter’s plan. And even if Mexico were to pay for it, it’s an unacceptably crude tactic for a remarkably intricate problem. 

Trump is irresponsibly luring Americans into a hostile dispute with a country that is our ally, our friend and our neighbor. The United States may indeed have a problem with Mexicans and Latinos illegally entering the country. One would like to think that our representatives are well paid to think of better, more diplomatic solutions. 

Should this wall be built, it will come to stand as the enduring symbol of a shameful period in American history when the public imagination was enslaved to an emotionally unstable president and the Congress that enabled him.

Unhappy folks  march to polls 

The media have reveled in showing protesters against President Donald Trump breaking laws, damaging property and injuring police. 

Why isn’t the media glorifying the movement where the citizens who are unhappy with the direction of this country have been dealing liberals one loss after another at the polls for <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P6Y">the last six years</TIMEX3>? 

This has been done by following the laws and voting. 

We do not destroy property, we do not injure police, we just take care of our families and obey the law. 

This is a great country with a great Constitution. Working people made this country great and it’s time to move the pendulum back toward the people paying the bills. 

The president is correct about the media.

Goodrich stacks  worth saving 

I read with some sadness in the Beacon Journal about the deteriorating Goodrich twin smokestacks, one of which will be cut down by 100 feet. The article referred to them as ‘‘iconic’’ and a ‘‘landmark.’’ I think they should be saved to keep our skyline as it has been for so <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="PXY">many years</TIMEX3>. 

Aren’t there any civic groups or individuals who could help raise the necessary funds to save the towers? 

I’ll make the first donation.
