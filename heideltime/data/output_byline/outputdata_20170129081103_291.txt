Early civilizations used various types of vessels, made from animal skin or clay, to carry water from its source for consumption in royal palaces, peasant households and war zones. At present, the synonym "bottled water" refers to containers of various sizes that provide drinking water to consumers. The modern water bottling industry was launched in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="196">the 1960s</TIMEX3> when plastic was invented. However, the industry mostly flourished in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="199">the 1990s</TIMEX3> when polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic became available. Packaging and transportation of bottled water became more feasible with PET plastic, because of its light weight and strength. <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Today</TIMEX3> bottled water is a major global commodity, a $22 billion industry that ranges from very small local bottling operations to giant international corporations.
