A FAIRLY ROUTINE session of the House of Representatives ended on a tense note <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-26">Thursday</TIMEX3>, as Rep. Marjorie Porter , D-Hillsborough, the assistant Democratic floor leader, raised an objection to comments made earlier in the session by Rep. Kurt Wuelper, R-Stratham, which she called "offensive not only to me but to many other members of this body, including our naturalized citizens." 

Wuelper was speaking for the majority against HB 206, a bill establishing a special marriage officiant license that would authorize any individual to perform a single, specified marriage. 

"This is something that recognizes people are being more creative in the ways they are getting married," said State Rep. Renny Cushing , D-Hampton, using examples of a "special uncle" or "best buddy from the service" as possible officiants. 

That best buddy or special uncle would have to apply for a one-time license from the Secretary of State to conduct the wedding, and turn that license in to the town clerk along with the marriage license after the ceremony. 

In explaining committee opposition to the measure (which failed 204-158), Wuelper cited the concern of town clerks, who worried about getting the proper paperwork. 

"The question we thought was, well, what if anybody could do it (emphasis on ANYBODY). What if someone from, I don't know, Oregon or Bothwasswana (Botswana) or Zambia could come and perform a ceremony? What's the chances we could have more problems and the marriage not be officially recognized?" 

Porter alluded to "this time of powerful rhetoric" in reacting to Wuelper's presentation. 

"For four terms <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> I have served in this honorable House, and I have always been proud of our decorum," she said. "However, <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3> during one of the floor speeches, I heard words and tone of voice that was offensive not only to me but to many other members of the body, including our naturalized citizens who are here as part of our House." 

Ironically, Wuelper's comments came as "Welcoming New Hampshire" was setting up for its State House Day and luncheon for lawmakers in the State House cafeteria. The event focused around the work the organization is doing for the immigrant community in the state. 

Speaker Shawn Jasper , R-Hudson, said Porter's points were "well taken" and he apologized to the House. He said he missed that portion of Wuelper's remarks because he was being distracted by another House member at the time. 

"We have to be mindful of what we say and how we say it," Jasper said. 

According to Porter, it was not only what Wuelper said but how he said it. You can watch the video of the session on the State House website and come to your own conclusions, but she characterized his tone as uncharacteristically "scornful and arrogant" for the House. 

"The Speaker apologized and I accepted his apology," she said. 

Porter said she was motivated to speak up by <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> events. 

"I think when we're seeing things like the signs that were posted in Manchester <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3>, and the things that have been happening at Jewish community centers around the country, and seeing racial slurs and ethnic slurs tweeted out or said out loud, we have to speak up." 

Wuelper said at first he didn't even know Porter was alluding to his remarks. 

"When I heard her say that, I had no idea what she was talking about," he said. "I was just thinking of places that are far away. It has nothing to do with anyone." 

When asked about the Speaker's apology, Wuelper said, "I'm not sure his apology was for what I said, as much as it was for his not noticing it," which the Speaker's office confirmed. 

Edelblut hearing set 

The Executive Council has set the date for its public hearing on the nomination of Frank Edelblut to be the next commissioner of education. 

Edelblut, the second-place finisher in the GOP primary for governor, is likely to face some tough questioning from Democrats who have already raised concerns about his lack of experience in education administration. 

He has the support of conservative organizations such as Americans for Prosperity and Cornerstone Action. 

The hearing is scheduled for <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29T13:00">1 p.m.</TIMEX3> on <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-01-31">Tuesday, Jan. 31</TIMEX3>, in the Executive Council chambers at the State House. 

More on marijuana 

While most of the debate in the Legislature on marijuana up to this point has focused on expanding the state's therapeutic cannabis law, measures that call for legalization or decriminalization will be up for debate on <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2017-02-01">Wednesday, Feb. 1</TIMEX3>. 

HB 215, creating a study commission to consider legalization and regulation of adult use, will be heard at <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="TIME" value="2017-02-01T10:00">10 a.m.</TIMEX3> by the House Ways and Means Committee. 

HB 640, which calls for decriminalizing possession of one ounce or less and reducing the penalty from a misdemeanor to a violation punishable by fines ranging from $100 to $350, will be heard by the House Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee in Representatives Hall at <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="TIME" value="2017-02-01T13:00">1 p.m.</TIMEX3>, along with HB 656. 

HB 656 also calls for legalization and regulation, but includes home cultivation of six plants, with 70 percent of tax revenues dedicated to property tax relief, and 30 percent to the Alcohol Abuse Prevention and Treatment Fund (which is also used for drug abuse treatment).

Saying 'no' to home rule 
Opponents of high-voltage transmission lines such as the Northern Pass or the Seacoast Reliability Project were dealt a setback in the Legislature on <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2017-01-25">Wednesday</TIMEX3>, as the Committee on Municipal and County Government voted unanimously to kill HB 145, a bill to give cities and towns authority over utility line expansion projects. 

It would have prohibited high voltage transmission lines from being located in any municipality without a vote of approval by the municipality. 

The vote to recommend killing the bill was unanimous, according to Jim Belanger, R-Hollis. 

"It provides one town veto power over what the two towns on either side of it want," he said. "Also, it establishes home rule, and New Hampshire is not a home rule state." 

Cities and towns in New Hampshire have no power other than what is granted by the state Legislature through "enabling" legislation.
