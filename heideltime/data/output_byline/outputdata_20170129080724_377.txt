What do we mean by sustainable development? Should all development be controlled and sustainable? Should only economic considerations be measured? Should a particular development or an area to be developed only be accepted and permitted if it is economically feasible for the owner of the land or the developer thereof, or should other considerations be calculated and given a cost or value? 
 
In my opinion, the local natural and built-up environment has a far superior economic, social and cultural value than any haphazard development. 
 
I speak of ‘haphazard development’ as a style opposed to controlled or planned development. Malta has had different construction- or reconstruction-led periods of development, the first being the different periods of construction from the Iron Age down to the end of Malta’s occupation by the Knights. 
 
These were periods of a miniscule local population, where construction was small-scale, built for a purpose and controlled by the ruling powers. Despite the fact that structures like the three Cities, Valletta, Mdina and the Cittadella as well as the prehistoric temples all tower on hilltops, thus spoiling the natural environment, they have melded with the natural colours and shapes. Using local stone, low heights and squarish shapes, they served their purpose to offer secure protective areas for the small population of the time, but were also built with beauty that has lasted throughout the ages. They <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> serve as a basis for one of the major pillars of our modern economy – tourism. 
  
"Once permits are given, the Maltese nature is to cheat a little, add a little, encroach a little." 
  
The same applies to the numerous village and city churches that brought artists and artisans to our islands and gave us the town and village way of life – with circular expansions of low housing crowding around the dominant church structure. Humans could relate to each other, living close to family, friends and whatever linked them together – the bar, the banda, the church, the ladies circles, the school, etc. This is the Maltese way of life. 
 
The second period, also one of planned construction, was that of the ensuing <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P100Y">100 years</TIMEX3> after the Knights – the British occupation. During this period, our population exploded with growth generated by the war economies. Construction was geared towards defence, military installations, airfields and barracks, but also towards new urban areas such as Sliema and Paola, and the expansion of towns like Birkirkara and Hamrun. 
 
Once again there was control by the authorities, and the terraced houses of the new towns had gardens, regular blocks with good roads and sanitation, but always with local materials and limited heights. Spectacular developments along these lines graced Sliema Seafront, with over 200 jewels of period houses. It would have compared with the best that coastal cities in France and Italy can offer. Quel dommage! 
 
During this period, Malta’s environment was damaged by over-development, and the sprawl of the growing towns, military installations and barracks in many prominent areas like Mtarfa, St Andrews, and Tigné did not improve Malta. However, the height and the building materials remained true to the local colour and texture. Some of these structures later could be re-constructed or restored to be used for other purposes. 
  
What characterised this period, which started to come to an end with the early post-war boom and growth (both in population and wealth), was the control by the ruling authority of the time. It also coincided with the beginning of periods of self-government, and later, Independence. 
 
This is when Malta’s ‘haphazard development’ began, and has continued since. 
 
It may be a coincidence, but it may also be the result of this taking over of control of our destiny by us, the Maltese. Governing ourselves seems, to me, to be the cause of the break of harmony between the environment and development. Unlike our many overseas rulers, we do not seem to have any sense of vision and purpose, except that of economic development. 
 
Of course the economy is and will always remain the main driver, but without a long-term vision and clear definition of what we, the Maltese population, want our island to look like <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3>, in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2010">10</TIMEX3>, 20, 40 or even <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="P100Y">100 years</TIMEX3>’ time, we will continue to live haphazardly. 
 
Many very good and sustainable constructions have taken shape in these last 80 odd years, and many more will see the light of day. Yet there has never been a long-term plan. Whenever a plan is launched, it only lasts one legislature at most. Very soon, exceptions begin to be made, exemptions given, and permits granted or negotiated. 
 
Once permits are given, the Maltese nature is to cheat a little, add a little, encroach a little. 
 
We are unable or unwilling to restrain ourselves and follow the rules. Even when we do follow the rules, our politicians are tempted to change these rules. Our developers and every owner of a house, plot, field or whatever, dream of translating this into a bigger structure. 
 
The destruction of the Sliema Seafront – a pearl of the Mediterranean – to replace it with terrible buildings that are too high and lacking style or collective order is a sin of this generation that our descendants will never forgive us for. 
 
The Maltese were once described to me as being a people endowed with excessive ‘criminal energy’. Looking critically at ourselves, this description fits very well in the area of conflict or contradiction between the environment and the classical way of life of the Maltese, and the development by the construction industry of Malta in these last <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DURATION" value="P80Y">80 years</TIMEX3>. 
 
The terrible growth of all towns has led to one urban sprawl from Zabbar to Paola to Marsa, Zebbug, Qormi, Birkirkara, Mosta, Naxxar, San Gwann, Sliema, Gzira, Msida, Pieta and Valletta, with ugly blocks of pigeonhole flats with terrible shafts and long dark corridors. Older houses lie derelict by the thousands, awaiting destruction to turn from swans to ugly ducklings. 
 
Going forward, it seems that this lurching forward haphazardly from one set of uncontrolled uglification to another is set to continue. 
 
The <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> debate about the need to build upwards even higher and higher on the most cherished and beautiful coastal promontories and even in the dead centre of the island does not fit the Maltese way of life, does not fit the natural environment, and does not use local materials, but will add enormous glass, steel and concrete monsters to the already growing number of glass buildings. They will take light away from neighbours, lower the value of existing housing stock and pander to the needs of a small sliver of foreign investors, business leaders, tax residents and a few wealthy Maltese, and will plunge a stake of social divisiveness into Maltese society. 
  
"Older houses lie derelict by the thousands, awaiting destruction to turn from swans to ugly ducklings." 
  
The prospective customers for this unprecedented race to the skies, amongst our few developers, are in Malta not for the sun, landscape or flats on the 20th or 30th floors of seafront skyscrapers. They are here because of tax, services and other regimes that offer them advantages they do not find in their countries. But similar regimes are also offered in other places. I think of two types of competing locations for regime seekers. The first category are the Dubais and the Singapores of this world, and the second are the Monacos, Genevas, Zurichs and Luxembourgs. 
 
Which do the Maltese want to be like? The first are high-rise skyscraper conglomerations. The second are European low-to-middle height cities retaining local continuity and human size structures. Prices per square metre are probably higher in Monaco and Zurich than in Dubai. Empty blocks are much fewer in Monaco and Geneva than in Dubai. Yet the tax or regime seekers, whether retirees or businessmen, flock to both types of places. 
 
Thus, development does not preclude environmental sustainability. Prices are not set by the type of buildings offered, they are set by the attractiveness of the regimes and the attractiveness of the environment. 
 
Then there is the local population to think of. What do the Maltese, who cannot afford these exceptionally high prices, want? How do they want the island to look for their children and grandchildren? What would happen should the regimes that attract these foreign investors to Malta change? What would happen should there be a slump in the economy, or restrictions imposed by the EU? What would happen should a score or two of these skyscrapers get built, and we face an economic downturn? 
 
There is too much uncertainty to lurch forward haphazardly. We need a long-term plan that is put to the vote of the population, which is endorsed by experts, that is socially, economically and culturally sustainable, and that is outside the powers of any elected government to change without either two thirds majority in Parliament or similar manacles. 
Our ‘criminal energy’ or greed should not be the driver of development, but simple protection of the existing environment is not the answer either. A balance must be struck. 
 
Before finding this balance, before having the population express itself on a couple of alternative long-term plans for Malta and Gozo, I suggest a moratorium on all new construction, allowing only refurbishment and re-construction of the existing stock of buildings and monuments. 
 
This will keep the labour force and cash flow of our construction industry going. This will also ensure that the ever-growing number of tourists who come to Malta for its weather, history and culture will not begin to decline because we are making Malta unrecognisable and unlivable. 
 
For me, development that raises the standards of the existing stock of Maltese housing, whether town houses, social housing, flats built in <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DURATION" value="P50Y">the last 50 years</TIMEX3> or historical buildings, is more economically sound. We should put an end to damp walls, leaking roofs, asbestos, tanks on roofs, crowded families, draughty windows and doors, and no heating systems – issues that are endemic to the living areas of most Maltese. Other countries have managed to improve this <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DURATION" value="P100Y" mod="MORE_THAN">over the last 100 years</TIMEX3> of economic growth. We have not. 
 
It is socially unacceptable. 
  
"We need a long-term plan that is put to the vote of the population, which is endorsed by experts, that is socially, economically and culturally sustainable, and that is outside the powers of any elected government to change without either two thirds majority in Parliament or similar manacles." 
  
Reconstruction and refurbishment retains the look and way of life that will continue to attract mass tourism. It will produce elegant and <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="20">21st century</TIMEX3> interiors with the platinum or BREAM certificate standards that will suit tax and regime hunters who wish to come here and are most welcome. The bread and butter of our businessmen and women and the jobs for the young generations will be found by serving the 450,000 Maltese and the two million tourists who visit us. The small number of wealthy or business folk will be equally attracted, whether we offer them skyscrapers or palazzi. 
Lack of a long-term vision that is signed up to by all citizens and all parties so that the <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DURATION" value="P50Y">50</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DURATION" value="P100Y">100 year</TIMEX3> plan remains intact throughout the entire period will only promote a continuation of the haphazard development period of our history. Add to this our own national erratic decision-making powers and our criminal energy characteristic, and we are doomed to fail. 
 
Allowing only economic factors, profit and maximization of land space to rule the decision-making is wrong and unsustainable. 
 
The question to ask is whether we want to continue haphazardly and unsustainably, moving away from our natural building materials to glass, steel and concrete, and rising upwards under the argument that one limits the use of space by going upwards must be first measured against the yardstick of what constitutes planned urban areas, healthy living, and Maltese way of life and sustainability, not just profitability. 
 
Rushing <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3>, especially with the results of the US election and the uncertainty it will produce in the world, is foolish. Overinvesting may be damaging to our economy. We should use the time until the dust settles and see how the EU will react. Will the EU regroup and strengthen its common institutions, and act much more in integrated fashion, or will it also fall apart into populism? 
 
Both scenarios can damage our regimes and attractiveness. If it becomes more unified, we can expect harmonisation of taxation and common rules for provision of services. If it falls apart, the result can be chaotic and investors will be more cautious. Both scenarios would temporarily slow down our present economic growth. 
 
When foreign investors come to Malta, they do not come because we present them with elegant, prestigious office spaces or living spaces. They come because the regimes in place allow them to do their business on the fringes but within the EU more profitably then elsewhere. They are more than welcome. 
 
I contend that since they come for the regime, like they go to Dubai, Singapore, Monaco and Geneva for their regimes, then they are neutral to what there is on offer. Prices in Monaco at €30,000 per square meter are equal to those in Dubai. Malta can still choose to go low-rise or high-rise. Dubai should not be our model. 
  
"Malta can still choose to go low-rise or high-rise. Dubai should not be our model." 
  
Our model should be the Malta that the Maltese want – the Malta that will still attract the normal tourist, our bread and butter, and not a Malta that attracts more of the inward investors who may be only as sustainable as the tax, legal and other regimes that keep them here. 
 
The same applies to so-called modern retirees who buy flats they do not live in for <TIMEX3 tid="t38" type="DURATION" value="PXW" mod="MORE_THAN">more than a couple of weeks</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t39" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3>, bringing little value-added to the local economy apart from their initial investment. They come for the tax benefit we offer, out of reach of their tax collectors. They also like what they see of the weather and cultural heritage. 
 
As we all know, both the tax regime and the gaming regime are under scrutiny and potential attack by the EU. Whether we can keep them intact, tweak them or have to leave the EU to retain them will only be known in the next <TIMEX3 tid="t41" type="DURATION" value="P5Y">five</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t40" type="DURATION" value="P10Y">ten years</TIMEX3>. They are being challenged, as are the regimes of Ireland, Luxembourg and <TIMEX3 tid="t42" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> even Dubai and the Emirates – our colleagues and competitors. 
 
Were these to change, the investors would leave in the blink of an eyelid – as quickly as they came. Hopefully, we could replace them with healthcare wealthy tourists, passport buyers and wealthy tax planning retirees, but that is neither secured nor certain. Thus we live in a pretty uncertain economic situation. 
 
For this reason, I suggest that we take a time out – some breathing room to take a long look at ourselves as Maltese EU citizens who wish to continue to enjoy living on these God blessed islands of ours. 
 
A final consideration is pure sustainability. With 700,000 people crowding this island <TIMEX3 tid="t43" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EVERY">every day</TIMEX3> of the year, making us over 2,500 per sq km with too many cars, too few roads and a very low standard of building stock in the towns, villages and residential centres of Malta, we have a very wealthy country but a very badly distributed quality of life. 
 
We cannot build a silver or golden set of cages for the wealthy investor, his employees and a few wealthier Maltese, leaving the rest to live miserably. We must raise the quality of life of all Maltese so that we do not create a social divide that is already with us. For our businesses who import, provide services, build and sell, the local and tourist population is their bread and butter. Therefore, high-value clientele is the icing on the cake. We need to raise the buying power and living conditions of our base home market and base touristic market that provides the major part of our revenues before we cater for the elite niche. 
 
We need to plan and have a vision <TIMEX3 tid="t44" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3>. We need to stop all but restoration and upgrading work until then.
