President Uhuru Kenyatta shows a jubilee membership smart card that was launched at kasarani on 13/1/17 [Phot:BEVERLYNE MUSILI/Standard]

The Jubilee Party is eyeing to capture all elective seats in Marsabit but it is having a hard time bringing together two rival sides. One side that belongs to the defunct URP led by National Hospital Insurance Fund Chairman Muhamud Ali, Saku MP Ali Rasso (URP) is fighting to gain hold on JP to ward off entrance of ODM leaders led by Governor Ukur Yattani. The URP side had lost all seats except that of Saku and ODM's Raila Odinga polled 54 per cent of the presidential votes in the last elections.

<TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> on Mr Ali's side is Senator Abubakar Harugura (ODM), who was a key ally of Yattani in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2013">2013</TIMEX3>, while the governor is backed by MPs Joseph Lekuton (Laisamis, ODM), Chachu Ganya (North Horr, ODM) and Roba Duba (Moyale, UDF). President Uhuru Kenyatta who visited Marsabit town on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-01-26">Thursday</TIMEX3> and met local elders, appealed to the leaders to unite and asked residents to vote for him and JP candidates in the <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-08-08">August 8</TIMEX3> polls. However, sources from both sides that attended a closed-door meeting with the President, said the leaders argued openly on which side could deliver more votes . Addressing residents near Shell Petrol Station, Uhuru did not allow any leader to speak. He, however, dwelt on local politics and cautioned the leaders against inciting residents to violence.

''You have had relative peace since the last time you had problems (<TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2013">2013</TIMEX3>-<TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2014">2014</TIMEX3> Moyale clashes) and I commend leaders for preaching peace',' said the President. The Head of State asked residents not to be misused by politicians who incite them against each other, adding that Marsabit is home to Borana, Rendille, Gabra and Burji among other tribes.

Noting that majority of residents voted for the Opposition (ODM) in the 2013 polls, the President urged them to vote for him and JP candidates in the <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2017-08">August</TIMEX3> elections. At the same venue where the President held his rally, Harugura said he decided to join Ali's team claiming the governor and his allies had misused county funds. ALSO ''I was in his (governor) team during the <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2013">2013</TIMEX3> election and worked with him for <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="P1Y" mod="APPROX">about a year</TIMEX3> and a half until I lost confidence in him. I want this new team to take over the county's leadership,'' said the senator. ''For example, the county has an annual emergency budget of Sh200 million. We have severe drought and nobody knows what they have done with close to Sh1 billion from the kitty up to <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3>,'' he said.

A source close to JP headquarters revealed that both sides would be invited to Nairobi for a joint meeting to agree on sharing positions to thwart fallouts that would benefit the Opposition. But the two camps ruled out sharing of positions, adding that they may opt to join affiliate JP parties or even move to the Opposition.
