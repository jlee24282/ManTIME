SPANISH skater Javier Fernández has netted his fifth consecutive European Championship title – a feat only achieved by two others on ice in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P125Y">the last 125 years</TIMEX3>. 

Fernández, who will be 26 in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-04">April</TIMEX3> and has been skating competitively for <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P20Y">20 years</TIMEX3>, is universally acknowledged to be the second-best in the world, after his Japanese friend Yuzuru Hanyu, who always proves a tough rival to beat. 

But this has not stopped Fernández from taking the European Championship title <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="SET" value="P1Y" quant="EVERY">every year</TIMEX3> since <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2013">2013</TIMEX3> inclusive. 

After beating his own record with a stunning 

Having started his display with a perfect quadruple toe and a near-perfect second quad, Javier hit the ground during the third and final quadruple salchow, putting his potential victory in jeopardy. 

But the excellent choreography and execution of the rest of his act, to the background music of three Elvis Presley songs, coupled with the absence of any rival of Hanyu's calibre meant he walked away with a 30-point lead over second-placed Maxim Kovtun, from Russia, who scooped up 266.80 points to Fernández's 294.84. 

His next challenge will be to work hard on perfecting his leaps to keep up his glowing trajectory for the rest of the season – having won the Grand Prix in Paris and Moscow on top of yet another European Championship – particularly with the World Championships in Finland imminent. 

Once again, Fernández is expected to be the favourite to win the World Championships, which will take place between <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2017-03-29">March 29</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2017-04-02">April 2</TIMEX3> inclusive. 

If he pulls it off, Javier will have won a third consecutive World title and could end up some way ahead of his friend and arch-rival Hanyu, who has already fallen short of his usual results <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2017">this year</TIMEX3>. 

“An Olympic medal is my great challenge; that's what I get up there fore <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="SET" value="P1Y" quant="EVERY">every year</TIMEX3>,” Hanyu told Spanish reporters in the language of Cervantes. 

As for Fernández, whose début in the European Championships at age 15 saw him finishing 28 

The first skater to hit the history books was Karl Schäfer, who was champion between <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="1929">1929</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="1936">1936</TIMEX3>, then Czechoslovakian Ondrej Nepela did so <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="SET" value="P1Y" quant="EVERY">every year</TIMEX3> from <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="1969">1969</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="1973">1973</TIMEX3>. 

At the time, ice-skating followed much simpler movements, with no quadruple leaps or intricate combinations, meaning Fernández's skills may actually be greater than those of his predecessors. 

Ondrej Nepela's life and career were cut tragically short, however – although he was never able to reveal his homosexuality due to the legal and social repercussions he would have suffered in <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="197" mod="START">the early 1970s</TIMEX3>, his boyfriend Toller Cranston did so on his behalf in his own autobiography – and Nepela was just 38 when he died from AIDS in <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="1989">1989</TIMEX3>.
