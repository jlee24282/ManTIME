The Armed Offenders Squad is swarming a Hamilton street where a man has reportedly run off with a shotgun. 

Police have cordoned the end of Maitland St in Frankton where the man has run down a driveway, resident Brent Halpon told the Herald. 

"There's snipers on every corner. It's pretty intense." 


Six police cars, a number of unmarked police cars, several officers, a large number of armed offenders squad members and police dogs are at the scene, Talpon said.â€‹ 

Another Maitland St resident, Lizzie Pascoe, said she was told by police, the man ran off with a shotgun after being pulled over by police. 

A Maitland St resident then called police saying there was a man with a shotgun in their backyard. 

A Police spokesman confirmed the Armed Offenders Squad was at Maitland St responding to a report of a man having a firearm.
