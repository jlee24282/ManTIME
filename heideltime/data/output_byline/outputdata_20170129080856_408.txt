SANTA CLARA, Calif. – Santa Clara men's basketball was in position for its second upset in as many games, but No. 21/21 Saint Mary's made enough plays down the stretch to hold on for a 72-59 victory on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>. 

Jock Landale tallied a game-high 20 points, Emmitt Naar had 15 and nine assists, and Calvin Hermanson scored 13, including a key 3-pointer with <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="PT3M" mod="LESS_THAN">less than three minutes</TIMEX3> left, for the Gaels (19-2, 9-1), who shot 57 percent from the floor. 

Nate Kratch scored a team-high 19 points and Jared Brownridge tallied 13, though was only 3 of 14 from the field, for the Broncos (12-11, 6-4) who were just 6-for-22 from behind the 3-point line in the game and 36 percent overall in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2016-H2">the second half</TIMEX3>. 

Santa Clara cut a 16-point <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2016-H2">second-half</TIMEX3> deficit to 55-50 on a Brownridge 3-pointer with 6:11 left. But the Gaels responded with 10-2 with Hermanson scoring five points. His 3-pointer with the shot clocking running down off a Naar feed increased the lead to 65-52 and sealed the Gaels' 14th win in their last 15 games. 

The Broncos played without starting guard Matt Hauser who was sidelined with the flu. The team had just eight scholarship players available and four played <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="PT35M" mod="EQUAL_OR_MORE">at least 35 minutes</TIMEX3>. 

Saint Mary's quick start to <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2016-H2">the second half</TIMEX3> proved too much to overcome. The Gaels scored 12 of the first 14 to push a five-point halftime lead to 47-35 with 15:15 left in the game. Naar sandwiched a pair of layups around a Hermanson 3-pointer and the Broncos went 8 of 9 from the field to start <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2018-H2">the second half</TIMEX3>. 

Santa Clara got a spark from Emmanuel Ndumanya who started a 13-2 run with layup and kept it going with a pair of steals. His 3-point play cut the lead into single digits with <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="PT8M" mod="LESS_THAN">less than eight minutes</TIMEX3> left. He matched his career high with nine points. 

KJ Feagin had 11 points and a season-high eight assists, but he and Brownridge combined to hit only 8 of 29 from the floor. 

"They did a good job and he probably didn't bring his 'A' game," Santa Clara head coach Herb Sendek said about Brownridge's accuracy. "But people are trying to stop him every game and he doesn't get to come out of the game. He has terrific mental toughness and we've asked him to do a lot." 

Joe Rahon, who had eight points and five assists, shadowed Brownridge for the majority of the game. 

"We did a pretty good job on him (Jared) <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3>," Saint Mary's head coach Randy Bennett said. "He's a heck of a player—one of the best to play in this conference. I have so much respect for that kid. But, Joe Rahon is one of the best defenders in this conference, so that was key. You have to do a good job on Brownridge and then everybody else starts getting going too." 

In <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2017-01-26">Thursday</TIMEX3>'s win against BYU, Santa Clara connected on a season-high tying 14 3-pointers, but couldn't duplicate that effort against the Gaels who allow opponents to hit only 31 percent from behind the 3-point line.

The Broncos did get the start they needed in an attempt to knock off a deep Gaels squad. 
  
Both teams hit 5 of their first 6 shots, but the Broncos missed their next eight allowing Saint Mary's to sprint to a 26-11 lead. 

Landale, who had a game-high 10 rebounds, was the catalyst with 10 points during a 16-0 run. 

But the Broncos clawed their way back behind Kratch, who connected both inside and from the perimeter. His 3-pointer from the left wing cut the deficit to 30-24 with <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DURATION" value="PT3M" mod="LESS_THAN">less than three minutes</TIMEX3> remaining in the half. He had 14 of the team's 30 <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2017-H1">first-half</TIMEX3> points. 

Evan Wardlow started in place of Hauser and contributed six points and two assists. 

"Evan really battled for us <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29TNI">tonight</TIMEX3> and gave us some good minutes," Sendek said. 

After four straight at home, the Broncos <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> hit the road for four, beginning <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2017-01-26">Thursday</TIMEX3> at Portland. Tipoff is set for <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="TIME" value="2017-01-26T19:00">7 p.m.</TIMEX3>
