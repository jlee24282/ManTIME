ABU DHABI, <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">28th January, 2017</TIMEX3> (WAM) -- Investment in human resources and their development is at the heart of the UAE's national development strategy, declared Sheikh Nahyan bin Mubarak Al Nahyan, Minister of Culture and Knowledge Development. 

''The UAE also gives its citizens the opportunity to be informed of the best training programmes in major public and private companies, and institutions, so that they can get jobs and serve their nation,'' Sheikh Nahyan stated, ahead of the 11th edition of the recruitment show, Tawdheef Abu Dhabi, an event which is one of its kind in the UAE and attracts the best in the nation. 

The event, spread over an area of about 13,000 square metres, will be held between <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2017-01-30">January 30</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-02-01">February 1, 2017</TIMEX3> at Abu Dhabi National Exhibition Centre. It expects to attract more than 90 governmental and private agencies, and institutions. 

The show is a perfect opportunity for organisations seeking to enrich their workforces with competent and qualified Emirati cadres, and meet with talented professionals in search of job opportunities. It helps the public and private agencies find qualified cadres in the fields of health, energy, oil and gas, industrial sector, transportation, logistics, insurance, banks, financial institutions, education, tourism, culture, hospitality, telecommunications and information technology, safety, security, among others. 

Companies attend the show to help familiarise graduates with the nature of work and the jobs available in their organisation, market the Emiratisation programme for the target audience and build a strong database of all the talented Emirati applicants to meet the future recruitment needs. 

Visitors to Tawdheef will have the opportunity to take part in an inspirational and high-energy seminar programme to learn about the important skills needed for landing their dream job, namely how to gain confidence to succeed at the workplace, how to stand out as a candidate, how to plan one's career progression, and a number of self-development tips on attracting recruiters and employers. 

At the Tawdheef seminar programme, visitors will learn how to plan their career by focussing on self-development and transferable skills.
