Mom found 'better place' to go than Trump's America   
Belleville, IL, resident Robin Porch's obituary states: “With Trump as president, Canada wasn’t far enough, so she moved to Heaven.” Her daughters said their grief is softened by the obit humor that their mom, a feminist and Hillary Clinton supporter, would have appreciated. She died on either Inauguration Day or the night after.
