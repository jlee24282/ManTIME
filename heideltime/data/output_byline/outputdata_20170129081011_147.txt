Europe is facing multiple tribulations in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3>, engulfed in uncertainties over terrorism, borders, migration, economics and President Donald Trump’s new America First message booming from across the Atlantic.

“It’s not the first time Europe has been challenged by crisis,” said Anna-Lena Hogenauer, a researcher at the Institute of Political Science at the University of Luxembourg, but “there’s definitely a combination of crises.”

Here are some of the potentially disruptive issues and events looming for the year that could reshape — or at least deepen — the fractures in the European Union, a 28-nation bloc of more than a half-billion people and the world’s largest single free-trade zone.

— Will Brexit cause instability?

Negotiations for Britain’s exit from the European Union, known as Brexit, the outcome of a referendum in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-06">June</TIMEX3>, could officially start by <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-03" mod="END">the end of March</TIMEX3>, a self-imposed deadline set by Prime Minister Theresa <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-05">May</TIMEX3>. But the run-up to those negotiations — further complicated by a Supreme Court ruling that Ms. <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2016-05">May</TIMEX3> needs Parliament’s approval to begin the process — has created enormous uncertainties. They include how European Union citizens residing in Britain — and the British citizens residing in other European Union countries — will work and live if they cannot freely traverse borders as they do <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3>.

Big banks and other multinational companies with operations in London and elsewhere in Britain are not awaiting the outcome of the negotiations, expected to last <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="P2Y">two years</TIMEX3>, that will determine the scope of the country’s changed status. They are making contingency plans to move thousands of jobs elsewhere. Other European Union members are eager to get those jobs. Their leaders also have suggested that Britain must be penalized economically to discourage further defections from the bloc.

Britain’s decision also threatens to alter its geography and possibly stoke political instability. Scotland and Northern Ireland had wanted to stay within the European Union and may <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> move to leave Britain. A new referendum on Scottish independence — reprising a measure that was defeated in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2014">2014</TIMEX3> — is considered likely. Unrest in Northern Ireland could resume if the border with Ireland, a European Union member, is restricted.

Guy Verhofstadt, the European Union’s negotiator for Britain’s exit, wrote in The Guardian on <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2017-01-18">Jan. 18</TIMEX3> that “Brexit will be a sad, surreal and exhausting process.”

— Will Turkey turn away from Europe?

Turkey has been negotiating to become a European Union member for <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DURATION" value="P1DE" mod="MORE_THAN">more than a decade</TIMEX3>, but that prospect has turned more doubtful, partly because of the authoritarian actions of the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, particularly since a failed coup attempt in <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2016-07">July</TIMEX3>.

Increasingly exasperated with the European Union, Mr. Erdogan has suggested that he may hold a referendum in Turkey <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2017">this year</TIMEX3> on whether to withdraw its membership application. Mr. Erdogan has also suggested that he may seek to restore the death penalty in Turkey, a step other European leaders say would disqualify the country from joining the European Union.

Nonetheless, European officials are loath to suspend the negotiations for fear that Mr. Erdogan will scrap an agreement to restrict the flow of migrants and refugees from Turkey into Europe, an exodus that has placed extraordinary strains on the Continent and helped incite nationalist and populist anger.

— Can Greece find relief?

The country that came to symbolize Europe’s economic travails <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">a few years ago</TIMEX3> has receded from the headlines somewhat, obscured by Brexit, fears of terrorist attacks in European cities and coming elections in the Netherlands, France and Germany. But Greece’s economy remains anemic and in need of more debt relief.

Despite three bailouts in <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DURATION" value="P5Y">five years</TIMEX3>, poverty rates are increasing and the unemployment rate is Europe’s highest. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras of the leftist Syriza Party, who rose to power in <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3> on his defiance of Greece’s creditors and threat to leave the European Union’s single-currency zone, is sagging in the polls, raising the possibility of political turbulence and new elections.

Negotiations for further restructuring of Greece’s debts, involving Germany and the International Monetary Fund, also have encountered difficulties. 

— Can Italy’s banks stay afloat?

The chronically troubled economy of Italy, the European Union’s fourth-largest, has aroused growing concern as possibly the next Greek-style debt crisis. The main reason is the weakness of Italy’s big banks, which are carrying hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of bad loans. They are reluctant to lend more money, which is precisely what Italy needs to stimulate its economy.

Italy’s debt levels also have irked Germany, Europe’s strongest economy, where leaders are reluctant to help finance any bailout.

— Will the United States stand with Europe?

The European Union and United States have closely coordinated their regimen of economic sanctions imposed on Russia in <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="2014">2014</TIMEX3>, a response to Russia’s annexation of the Crimean Peninsula and military actions in eastern Ukraine. But Mr. Trump has injected uncertainty into Europe over a unified stand toward Russia, suggesting he wants to ease or terminate the sanctions. Mr. Trump, whose amity toward Russia is a political issue in the United States, also has criticized NATO, asserting that the alliance is obsolete — a description Russian officials have welcomed.

While Trump’s subordinates have sought to reassure European Union leaders that the United States remains a reliable ally, doubts have been planted. 

— Will nationalists triumph elsewhere?

Emboldened by the momentum of Brexit and Mr. Trump, nationalist politicians espousing hostility toward the European Union and Muslim immigrants have made strong gains in campaigns for coming elections in three European countries, including the two largest.

In the Netherlands, where a national vote is set for <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DATE" value="2016-03-15">March 15</TIMEX3>, populist lawmaker Geert Wilders, who wants to slash immigration and follow Britain out of the European Union, is doing well in the polls.

In France, where presidential elections are set for <TIMEX3 tid="t35" type="DATE" value="2016-04-23">April 23</TIMEX3> with a runoff between the two top candidates <TIMEX3 tid="t36" type="DATE" value="2016-05-07">May 7</TIMEX3>, the rise of the extreme right has been a dominant theme. Marine Le Pen, leader of the National Front, has said she hopes to replicate Trump’s success. She supports a referendum on European Union membership and new border controls.

Germany holds federal elections <TIMEX3 tid="t37" type="DATE" value="2017-09-24">Sept. 24</TIMEX3>, which will determine the future of Chancellor Angela Merkel. But her positions on European unity, open borders and generosity toward refugees have seriously weakened her popularity. Mr. Trump mocked and insulted her during his campaign, describing his Democratic adversary, Hillary Clinton, as “America’s Merkel,” and called the German leader’s refugee policy “insane.”

At the same time, Germany’s biggest political story is the rapid ascent of the far-right Alternative for Germany party, which has evoked memories of the Nazis as it campaigns on denunciations of Ms. Merkel, the euro, immigration and Islam.
