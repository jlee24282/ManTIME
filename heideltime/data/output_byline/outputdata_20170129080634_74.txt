A positive attitude towards evolving is the secret to success for Dance Southland. 
 
Celebrating its 50th anniversary on <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3>, life and <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> members gathered at the Ascot Park Hotel to commemorate their journey. 
 
Dance Southland president Melanie Kennard said its ability to make changes was the key to it staying afloat for so long. 
 
"There's so many more things out there for people to do," she said. 
 
During the years, there had been productions with all of the dance schools, seminars, scholarships and several other methods of engaging and encouraging people in dance, which had been instrumental in keeping the organisation going. 
 
Life member and original committee member Joanne Adam said Dance Southland was originally called the Ballet Society of Southland, but as the years passed, the name was changed to reflect the different genres of dance being taught in the region. 
 
"Ballet was the only type of dance taught in Invercargill, then it changed to Dance Southland as jazz and contemporary and Highland, some Irish and tap dancing [were taught]," she said. 
 
"We felt that being a ballet society wasn't quite representing Southland." 
 
Adam, who has <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> retired as a dance teacher at Southland Girls' High School, loved dance because it builds confidence, imagination and requires people to think outside the square. 
 
"It is more than just dancing, it's creating," she said.
