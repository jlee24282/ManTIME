All that is gold does not glitter, Not all those who wander are lost; The old that is strong does not wither, Deep roots are not reached by the frost." JRR Tolkein

Many people won't believe me but I'm going to come out and say it.

I love <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-02">February</TIMEX3>.

There's something about the energy of a fresh start, the invigorating cold air and crisp golden <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-WI">winter</TIMEX3> sun but without all the garden neediness and exertion of <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-SP" mod="END">late spring</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-SU">summer</TIMEX3>.

Of course the RHS and garden shows will come out with a list of tasks you should be doing in the garden at this time of year but actually I think it's a good time to give the garden a break from meddling and just enjoy it.

This is where a little thoughtful laziness in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-FA">autumn</TIMEX3> comes in hand.

By not cutting back the flowering stalks of <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2016-SU">last summer</TIMEX3>'s herbaceous exuberance you get to appreciate the sculptural elements of plants.

Some are better suited to this approach than others and generally it is the later flowering varieties that survive best.

For frost covered outdoor artworks look for plants that have rigid stems, bulky seed cones or a light airiness that can stand up to rain and wind.

Those whose wild origins lie in wind-drenched prairies and grasslands such as coneflower (Echinacea) and sneezewort (Helenium), both from North America, produce large dark cones that show up well against lighter colours or grasses.

The small red, pink or white flowers of the Great Burnets (Sanguisorbas), especially the taller ones, look good as they darken to a mass of tiny suspended black buttons.

Yarrow (Achillea) is another plant of meadow origin whose dried, cloud-shaped umbels in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-WI">winter</TIMEX3> provide a horizontal contrast to the verticals of say foxgloves or Veronicas.

Any sea holly (Eryngium) is sculptural from the word go, but I think many of those with pale blue flowers in <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2017-SU">summer</TIMEX3> actually look better in <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017-WI">winter</TIMEX3>.

But the granddaddy of all hoary floral delights has to be to the delicate spent flower clusters of fennel (Foeniculum vulgare), if only because the crystallised flowers are suspended so high up in the air.

In my front garden I use the feathery foliage and then bright yellow flowers of fennel to form an ideal backdrop to the rich, rust red cones of Helenium Moorheim Beauty.

Ornamental grasses are also one of the highlights of <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2017-WI">the winter</TIMEX3> garden.

Robust grasses that stand up to battering from wind and rain but retain much of their golden hue through <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2017-WI">winter</TIMEX3>, such as Stipa gigantea, Molinia varieties and Calamagrostis, look fabulous when covered in frost in the crisp <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2017-WI">winter</TIMEX3> sun.

To make these golden jewels stand out even more why not contrast them with the bright red and yellow branches of a dogwood (Cornus) or red-leaved evergreen plants such as Berberis, Phormium or Nandina domestica.

To this frosty combination you can add a few evergreens for additional structure.

The strappy leaves of Crocosmia, Phormium or Libertia grandiflora will give further shape.

And there is a certain appeal in the repeated rounded forms of topiarised box, yew or beech â€“ if placed in a pattern on open ground they can look a secret gathering of plants in some parallel world.

Have fun with <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2017-WI">winter</TIMEX3> colour but give your garden a rest in <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2017-02">February</TIMEX3>.

It's sleeping through the bitter cold of <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2017-WI">winter</TIMEX3> .. much like the rest of us would like to.
