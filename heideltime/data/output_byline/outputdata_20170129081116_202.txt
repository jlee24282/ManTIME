Dewey was welcomed into heaven after a courageous 1 1/<TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="P2Y">2 year</TIMEX3> battle against liver cancer. He was born in Springville, Alabama on <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="1948-03-23">March 23, 1948</TIMEX3> to Milton Aubrey Waddell and Mary Imogene Rowe Waddell.

On <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="1968-05-22">May 22, 1968</TIMEX3> Dewey married the love of his life, Laura Margaret Woodward. They eloped to Cairo Georgia after a short courtship and without the consent of their parents. Laura’s father was concerned about how they would make a living being so young. Dewey assured him they would “live on love”! Well, that they did, and it didn’t take long until Dewey had gained his in-laws approval, love and admiration. With the help of Laura’s parents, Dewey and Laura founded M&C Pipe and Supply, Inc in <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="1973">1973</TIMEX3>. Together, Dewey and Laura created a family and circle of friends that were blessed by their endless generosity, joy for life, and immense love. Dewey was an adoring father to his daughter and son-in-law Deann and Tim Coop of St. Petersburg and his son and business partner Dewey “Dal” Waddell and his girlfriend Lisa Gasque Bell. He was affectionately known as “Big Daddy” to his six grandchildren: Brandon, Connor and Carson Coop; Trey and wife Kaitlyn, Tyler and Maggie Waddell; and his great granddaughter Allison Waddell. He was also known as “Uncle Big Dew” to his nieces and nephews, with whom he had very special relationships: Steve Waddell and wife Kathy of Graceville, Chris Waddell of Graceville, Kim Waddell of Leesburg, Dena McKenna and husband Mike of St. Petersburg, Robyn Mitchell and husband Royce of Edgewater, Eric Lackey and wife Natasha of Tampa, Charles and wife Kristin Struth of Destin, and Jessica Struth of St. Petersburg. He is also survived by his sister-in-law and brother-in-law Charlotte and Mike Struth and his loving and faithful companion Barnelia Woodward. He is preceded in death by Laura, his loving wife of <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DURATION" value="P42Y">42 years</TIMEX3>, his parents, and his brother Steven Lynn Waddell. Dewey loved being surrounded by nature. Two of his favorite places to soak it all in were deep in the woods of Steinhatchee at Po’ Boys Hunt Camp and on the beaches of New Smyrna. He was a highly spiritual and peaceful man. People were drawn to his kind, gentle spirit and delighted in his lighthearted sense of humor. He dedicated his life to relationships. Dewey always saw the good in every human being he encountered. Whether it was an old schoolmate, a business acquaintance, or a stranger in a check-out line, he could make a connection. He had a collection of friends from every generation and walk of life and treasured each and every one. As one friend said, “to know him was to love him”. Memorial service will be held on <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2017-02-04">Saturday February 4th</TIMEX3> at <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="TIME" value="2017-02-04T14:00">2pm</TIMEX3> at St. James Episcopal Church, with a Reception immediately following at his son's home (Dal Waddell), 801 south 9th St., Leesburg.
