. 
  
New Incubus Album Is 'Coming Soon' was a Top 3 story on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-26">Thursday</TIMEX3>: (Radio.com) It's been <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P5Y">five years</TIMEX3> since Incubus released their last album, If Not <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3>, When? It's the longest span the band has gone between full-length albums. But with new tweets posted on Wed (<TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-01-25">Jan 25</TIMEX3>), new tunes appear to be on the horizon. 
 
It's no secret that Incubus has been in the studio since <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2016" mod="END">late last year</TIMEX3> cooking up new jams, but what the Malibu band wouldn't say is when this new album would see the light of day. 
 
Well, according to Mike Einziger, they're close, very close. The guitarist posted two messages <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3>, both indicating the album release is immanent. ""Are you guys ready!!?!?!????? #newINCUBUSalbum coming soooooooon. Mwah-hah-hah-hah," he posted.
