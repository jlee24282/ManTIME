FOOTBALL: Melbourne City's bid for back-to-back W-League titles faces its next sudden death clash in Canberra <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-W05">next week</TIMEX3> after the finals make-up was completed on <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29TAF">Sunday afternoon</TIMEX3>.

As a club, City is already hunting its third trophy of the season after the senior men's side won the FFA Cup in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2016-11">November</TIMEX3> and the juniors won a thrilling Youth League final on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>.

City women will enter the playoffs brimming with confidence having <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> won back-to-back games for the first time in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P2M" mod="LESS_THAN">almost two months</TIMEX3>.

After defeating Brisbane Roar in a crucial contest <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-01-22">last Sunday</TIMEX3>, City downed Newcastle 2-0 in Coffs Harbour on <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="TIME" value="2017-01-27TNI">Friday night</TIMEX3> in a game in which a win for the Jets would have sent them through to the finals at City's expense.

Previously City had endured a frustrating six-game winless run, but the evidence from <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="P8D">the past eight days</TIMEX3> suggests the side <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> led by player-coach Jess Fishlock still has what it takes to win its semi-final against Canberra, despite United sealing top spot.

Canberra defeated Melbourne Victory 5-1 on <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> before Sydney women squandered the opportunity to win the premier's plate <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3>, suffering a shock 5-2 loss to Adelaide at Coopers Stadium.

Sydney will <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> play in Perth <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2017-W05">next week</TIMEX3> after the Glory secured second spot with a 1-0 win over Western Sydney, the victory coming courtesy of a 92nd minute goal from Caitlin Doeglas.

No team has won back-to-back W-League championships.

City and Canberra have played twice this season, with the away team recording a 2-1 victory on both occasions.
