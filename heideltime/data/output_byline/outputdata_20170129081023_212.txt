The essays will be carried in a compendium, powered by Concept PR, and released at the Global Conclave on <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-03-03">March 3, 2017</TIMEX3>," said PRCI Chairman-emeritus and chief mentor M.B.

PRCI National President and Executive Director of Concept PR B.N. Kumar explained: "The choice of topics for the drive for Indian communication professionals are: Demonetisation: Pain or Gain; Ecological Crisis -- It's forever?; Swachh Bharat -- Fad or reality?; Financial inclusion - On right track?"

For international communications professionals, the choices are: Disruption -- A global Phenomenon? and India -- Expectations from an emerging Global Super Power.

The essays could be in <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="0600">600</TIMEX3> to 1,200 words and the organisers have asked the writers to avoid slander, abusive language and partisan comments. The editorial decision of the jury will be final and binding on all participants.
