BEDFORD – In a battle of state champions, Max Murin and Brian Courtney each got what they wanted out of the Thomas Chevrolet tournament on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>. 
 
Well, almost. 
 
Central Cambria’s Murin beat Athens’ Courtney 3-1 in the most anticipated match of the tournament – one that they set up via social media – and Chestnut Ridge won three individual titles on the way to a fourth team title in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P5Y">five years</TIMEX3>. 
 
Courtney beat Murin at the Thomas tournament <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3> and again in the state finals. <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017">This year</TIMEX3> Courtney was wrestling 132 pounds while Murin was at 138, with each ranked No. 1 in their respective weights.  
 
Rather than look for an easy path to a title, Courtney contacted the <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3> state champ and asked if Murin would mind if he came up to 138 for another potential match – their fourth in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P1Y" mod="LESS_THAN">less than a year</TIMEX3>. 
 
Murin was happy to oblige. 
 
“I think it definitely makes the sport of wrestling better,” Murin said. “Nowadays, everybody’s running away from competition. Maybe in the state tournament it’s OK to run – I still don’t think it’s OK to run – but in these small tournaments, I think it’s awesome that these high-caliber guys wrestle each other.” 
 
The capacity crowd at Bedford High School seemed to think so, too. The match was held until the very end of the tournament and few fans left early. The crowd was into the bout from the start, which Murin noticed, even his hyper-focused state. 
 
“Every time someone took a shot, the fans went crazy, which is awesome for the sport of wrestling,” he said. “It was an exciting match, and it was nice having that commentary in the back.” 
 
After a scoreless first period, Murin escaped in the second, and after letting one potential takedown slip away, he scored with <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="PT15S" mod="APPROX">about 15 seconds</TIMEX3> remaining for a 3-0 lead. 
 
Murin said he relied on his previous matches – including a <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2017-SU">summer</TIMEX3> victory over Courtney in Orlando, Florida – to know how to score. 
 
“I took him down with a low double twice – I took him down here <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3> and took him down at Disney,” Murin said. “I knew if I hit it nice, it was going to work.” 
 
Courtney escaped in the third, but couldn’t score a tying takedown. Still, he had no regrets about his decision to move up, which resulted in just the sixth loss of his stellar career. 
 
“That was what I wanted,” Courtney said of the match. “Obviously that’s not the result I wanted, but it was definitely an awesome match. <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="PT6M">Six minutes</TIMEX3> of hard, hard wrestling, which is always what we get when we wrestle, and that’s what I love.” 
 
Chestnut Ridge wrestlers were doing what they love as well – scoring points and winning titles. 
 
Justin McCoy (145), Morgan Deremer (160) and Jared McGill (170) each won crowns for Lions. 
 
“They preach to all of our other guys, turn it into a game,” coach Greg Lazor said of his big three.  
 
“Sometimes we lose the fun out of the sport because of the grind. They preach go out there and try to score. If you get taken down, who cares? Get away and get yours then.” 
 
The trio did plenty of that. 
 
McCoy built a 13-2 lead before pinning Gage Cannavino of Athens in the finals. The junior had a fall, a technical fall and a major decision on his way to the finals. 
 
McGill had a pin and two technical falls before reaching the finals, where he beat Athens’ Nate Bradley 10-0. 
 
Deremer, the lone senior among the three, beat Penn Cambria’s Derek Brown 5-0 for his title. 
 
“It was a good tournament,” Deremer said. “It was something I wanted to win, being my senior year and something I hadn’t won yet.” 
 
The Lions easily outdistanced second-place Athens, 212-158. 
 
“It really came down to our guys in the losers’ bracket just working their tails off,” Deremer said. “It may not seem as fun in the losers’ bracket, but that’s where tournaments are won and lost. You can lose a match and be down about it and go out and lose another and you don’t do anything for your team. Or you can battle. That’s what Coach says, ‘When you lose, you become the most important kid on the team, and you’ve go to work and fight for each and every point.’ “ 
 
A good example of that was Austin Crouse. The 195-pounder entered the tournament with a 4-6 record. He went 6-2 on <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2017-W03-WE">the weekend</TIMEX3> with five falls, which resulted in big bonus points for the Lions. 
 
“He had a great tournament,” Lazor said. “He really stepped it up. Started wrestling with a little bit of confidence. He showed a lot of heart. I’m extremely proud of him.” 
 
Somerset’s Austin Hemminger was the only other local wrestler to make the finals. He dropped an 8-6 decision to Kaidon Winters of Athens at 152 pounds. 
 
Other champions include: Mount Union’s Josh Boozel (106) and Jake Ryan (220), Athens’ A.J. Burkhart (113), Burrell’s Trent Bechtold (120), Jefferson-Morgan’s Gavin Teasdale (126), Everett’s Liam Flaherty (132), Beth-Center’s Dominic Fundy (182), North Schuylkill’s Brady Mickatavage (195) and Freedom’s Evan Sweesy (285).
