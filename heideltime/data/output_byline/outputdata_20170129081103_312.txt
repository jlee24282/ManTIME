Lincoln's legendary Burton Road Chippy has been crowned the second best fish and chip shop in the UK after battering the opposition in a top competition.

The shop took second place for the ultimate title - Independent Takeaway Fish and Chip Shop of the Year – during the prestigious National Fish & Chip Awards, organised by Seafish - widely considered as the 'Oscars' of the fish frying industry.

To secure their top spot, Burton Road Chippy had to fry at the top of their game while progressing through a rigorous, multi-stage judging process over <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P7M">a seven month period</TIMEX3>. The test encompassed several mystery shopping assessments and in-depth audits by industry experts, reviewing everything from responsible sourcing policies to menu diversification – and of course, customer service and the quality of the fish and chips being served.

The final stage of judging, held the day before the awards ceremony on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-01-26">January 26</TIMEX3>, put the shop's presentation skills to the test as they faced a 14-strong specialist industry judging panel – battling it out against the nine other regional finalists in a 'Dragons' Den' style pitch.

Commenting on their award win after receiving the famous trophy from awards host, Nigel Barden, voice of food and drink on BBC Radio 2, shop co-owner Lesley Graves said: "Winning the regional award for Eastern England was extremely exciting, but to come in second place and be one of the UK's top two fish and chip shops is an absolutely massive achievement.

"We've been entering the awards since <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2013">2013</TIMEX3> and have been shortlisted for numerous accolades during that time, we were actually crowned the UK's best restaurant for <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3>.

"<TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017">This year</TIMEX3> we really stepped up to the next level, working not only to improve our business but to also positively impact the industry. With portion control high on the agenda we developed our very own 'Chip Scoop' to maximise the consistency of our serving sizes. We've also started working with Visit Lincoln to promote the city as a destination and grow tourism figures.

"It seems all the hard work has paid off and we couldn't be happier. We'd like to say thanks to all of our customers and staff for their unwavering support over the years, without you we wouldn't be where we are <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">today</TIMEX3>."

Marcus Coleman, chief executive at Seafish, added: "The aim of the National Fish & Chip Awards has always been to showcase the very best fish and chip businesses and individuals in the UK while setting incredibly high standards for the industry.

"<TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="SET" value="P1Y" quant="EVERY">Every year</TIMEX3> Seafish sees new and more established talent vie for the top title. The judging process is extremely challenging with shops thoroughly being put through their paces, but Burton Road Chippy excelled across every aspect of running a successful business.

"They stood out for their enthusiasm, skill-set and sheer passion which were evident throughout the entire judging process. They're very worthy runners up and we wish them all the best in their future endeavours."
