GENEVA — Syria’s government and opposition will meet for the first time in an attempt to halt the <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P3Y" mod="LESS_THAN">nearly three-year</TIMEX3>-old civil war that has killed more than 100,000 people, the United Nations said <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-23">Monday</TIMEX3>. Previous attempts to bring the two sides together have failed, mainly because of disputes over who should represent the opposition and the government, Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad’s future role in the country, and whether Iran, Saudi Arabia and other regional powers should be at the table.
