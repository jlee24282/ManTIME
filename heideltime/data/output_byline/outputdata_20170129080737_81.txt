Among the New England states, Rhode Island has the smallest percentage of immigrants who make their living owning a business. Yet in Providence, the number of immigrant business owners increased nearly 50 percent from <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2000">2000</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2013">2013</TIMEX3>, a city whose population is more than one-quarter immigrant. 
 
It is clear that more activity by immigrants would translate into a more vital state economy, but it is not clear that the businesses owned by immigrants are connecting with the main stream community. Have you patronized a business owned by immigrants <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3>?
