Leeds United striker Chris Wood has told The Yorkshire Post that his side are creating more chances than they were doing last season. 
 
The West Yorkshire outfit are doing well in the Championship at the moment and are in the running for the playoffs. 
 
The Whites are <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> fourth in the league table with 51 points from 28 matches and are likely to end up in the top six. 
 
Wood is in great form at the moment and has established himself as the first-choice striker under head coach Garry Monk. 
 
The former West Bromwich Albion and Leicester City striker has scored 17 goals and created 26 chances in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="1927">27</TIMEX3> Championship matches so far this campaign. 
 
The 25-year-old New Zealand international has suggested that Leeds are creating more chances this season than they did during the <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3>-<TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2016">16</TIMEX3> campaign. 
 

 
“It is brilliant to play in a team that attacks like this,” Wood told The Yorkshire Post . “The team has come on leaps and bounds since last season. We are at a whole new level and we are creating chances left, right and centre. That is brilliant to see and to be part of. 
 
“There are so many more chances being created than <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2015">a year ago</TIMEX3> and that is great for us all. Credit to all the boys for that, as everyone is working hard, from the lads at the back to those further forward.” 
 

 
During the <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3>-<TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2016">16</TIMEX3> season, Leeds created 402 chances in 46 matches - an average of 8.7 chances per game - while so far this campaign, the Whites have created 245 chances in 28 games - an average of 8.7 chances per match. The stats are similar, but the difference is that the team are scoring more.
