Milan's Suso believes former Coach Sinisa Mihajlovic 'didn't like him,' but praises Vincenzo Montella's style of play. 
 
The 23-year-old arrived at San Siro from Liverpool in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3> - when Pippo Inzaghi was still in charge of the Diavolo - but was frozen out when the Serbian became boss. He eventually joining Genoa on loan. 
 
However, he has flourished under Montella since his appointment <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2016-SU">last summer</TIMEX3>, cementing a place in the Rossoneri starting eleven. 
 
"With Inzaghi at the end I had found a bit of space. I think that if he had stayed, I would have had even more," Suso told Gazzetta Dello Sport 
 
"Instead, Mihajlovic came in. He uses a trequartista in his teams and I thought that could be a good thing for me. <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> I play as a winger, but originally I was a trequartista. 
 
"But I had been out for virtually <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P6M">six months</TIMEX3>, so during the first days of pre-season I said to the Coach: 'If you think that I won't have chances here, I will go on loan because I need to play to get my form back. 
 
"He said: 'No, stay calm, we will play with a trequartista and I only have you in that role.Â  
 
"He played me against Empoli at home. I was dead, I wasn't fit. My legs were not working, I felt rusty. After <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="PT1H">an hour</TIMEX3>, he took me off and I didn't play anymore from that moment. 
 
"I trained well, maybe better than <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3>, but I didn't play and I didn't understand why. 
 
"There wasn't any argument. He obiously didn't like me, that's it. And given that we <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> played Torino in the League and Coppa Italia in the space of <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="PXD">a few days</TIMEX3>, I said hello to all his staff who were here at Milan, but I didn't see Mihajlovic." 
 
Suso then discussed his relationship with Montella, saying that though he has never had a long conversation with the former Fiorentina boss, he enjoys the style of play being implemented at Milan. 
 
"I will confess one thing. Up until <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3>, I have never had a long conversation with him. He has never said to me, 'I want this and that from you.' 
 
"He explained his idea of play to the team - keep the ball and attack with courage. He wants attacks to start with the goalkeeper. 
 
"Then, he put us onto the pitch and watched us train. We always work with the ball and Montella does not miss anything. 
 
"I like him because his style of play is mine. He doesn't want long balls, he wants us to manouvre the ball. And he isn't scared to play young players."
