Classie Brigade, driven by Blair Orange, on its way to winning the <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> Invercargill Trotting Cup. 
   
The New Zealand 3200m standing start record of 3:53.1, set by Lazarus in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3>'s New Zealand Cup, was seriously threatened on <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> by Classie Brigade when winning the Ascot Park Hotel Invercargill Trotting Cup. 
 
Trained at Weedons by Nigel McGrath, Classie Brigade posted a marginally slower 3:53.5 to continue a theme which began last season. Classie Brigade was one of the country's best <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P3Y">three year</TIMEX3> olds but his attempts to get one up on Lazarus, such as when second to the champion in both the Flying Stakes and the Derby, were always denied. 
 
Classie Brigade was driven by Blair Orange who is making a habit of winning Invercargill Cups. In <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P3Y">the past three years</TIMEX3> he's won on Saveapatrol (<TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2014">2014</TIMEX3>) and Johnny Fox (<TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3>) and in earlier years on Highview Tommy ( <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2011">2011</TIMEX3>) Harnetts Creek (<TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2004">2004</TIMEX3>) and The Tough Nut (<TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2000">2000</TIMEX3>).

"Its good when you get on the right horses," Orange said. 
 
Classie Brigade started from 30m behind and Orange settled him back in the running. He was well aware of the strong pace but said his charge handled it well. About 600 metres from home, Orange asked the four year old to improve and he quickly got up beside the pacemaking Captain Dolmio. He had a fight on his hands though and only got clear close to home. 
 
"When we got out and sprinted he felt good, he began to pull up when he got to the front but kept fighting," Orange said. 
 
Classie Brigade, who finished second in <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3>'s Southland Supremacy Stakes, had half a length to spare at the finish. 
 
The group three win was a fitting reward for McGrath who lined up three in the feature, all of them stallions. Maverick and Matthew Williamson ran home well for third after breaking early. McGrath was sixth on Ears Burning who pulled a flat tyre for most of the race.
