Please, Dont Touch Anything is a cryptic, brain-racking puzzle game about bathroom breaks, screwdrivers and nuclear explosions.\r 
Covering for a colleague taking a bathroom break, you find yourself in front of a mysterious panel which only component is a red button. And since youve clearly been instructed not to touch anything, the only thing you want to do <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> is pushing the damn button.\r 
\r 
Push it and expect to be held liable for any unintended aftermath. And there will be many.\r
