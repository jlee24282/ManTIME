PASADENA, Calif. — On his FX comedy series “Baskets,” Zach Galifianakis — a Wilkesboro native — has to do double duty. 
   
He plays the lead character, troubled clown Chip Baskets, and also Chip’s egomaniacal brother Dale. And that means a lot of switching from one to the other on the set. 
   
“I think we go back and forth sometimes four different times,” he said. “I’ll be Chip for <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DURATION" value="PT2H">two hours</TIMEX3>. I’ll be Dale for <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="PT3H">three hours</TIMEX3>. I’ll be Chip for <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="PT6H">six hours</TIMEX3> and then Dale again for the last three. 
   
“Yeah, we do that on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="XXXX-XX-XX">the same day</TIMEX3>. It’s a lot of changes back and forth.” 
   
In working on the show, which is <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> in its second season (<TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="TIME" value="XXXX-XX-XXT22:00">10 p.m.</TIMEX3> Thursdays on FX), he has developed a good sense of how to differentiate between the two characters. 
   
“Not to sound too actory, but it’s one of those things where you do know that Dale would never say that, or you do know that Chip would never say that,” Galifianakis said. “The denominator in the two of them is that they have the same mother and they look alike, but they are opposite identical twin brothers. So yeah, they are really easy to play.” 
   
He said that the flamboyant Dale is “a lot easier to play because he talks,” as opposed to the more introspective, somber Chip. 
   
“The biggest trick is because we shoot them out of order,” he said. “So we can be doing episode six, and <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="UNDEF-REF-hour-PLUS-2">two hours later</TIMEX3> we go back to episode two. So keeping up with the emotional arc is the trickiest thing, I think.” 
   
Even beyond his work on “Baskets,” Galifianakis has been busy. 
   
His movie “Keeping Up With the Joneses” was just released on DVD and Blu-ray, and another film, “Masterminds” — based on the <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="1997">1997</TIMEX3> Loomis Fargo robbery in Charlotte — will be released on home video <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017-01-31">Tuesday</TIMEX3>. 
   
He also provides the voice of the Joker in the animated “Lego Batman Movie,” a spoof and spinoff being released in theaters <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2017-02-10">Feb. 10</TIMEX3>. 
   
And on a more serious note, his documentary “Democracy For Sale,” about campaign-finance reform and gerrymandering in North Carolina, is being screened around the state, including a showing at <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="TIME" value="2017-02-10T18:00">6 p.m.</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2017-02-06">Feb. 6</TIMEX3> at Green Street United Methodist Church at 639 S. Green St. in Winston-Salem. 
   
On <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2017-01-30">Monday</TIMEX3>, Fox’s “Gotham” will present its “<TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2017-WI">winter</TIMEX3> finale” before going on hiatus for <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DURATION" value="PXM">a few months</TIMEX3>. 
   
The <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> storyline, “Mad City,” appears to be building to the origin of the Joker, Batman’s most famous foe. 
   
Last week’s gruesome episode had deranged cult leader Jerome (Cameron Monaghan) shifting ever closer to Joker status in his spread of anarchy, culminating in a citywide blackout that should spell trouble in this week’s finale. 
   
The series is scheduled to return <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2017-04-24">April 24</TIMEX3>. It may shift its focus to a different budding villain, the Riddler. 
   
Chris Chalk, an alumnus of UNC-Greensboro, co-stars as Lucius Fox, a science expert who works with the Gotham City Police Department and formerly worked for Wayne Enterprises. 
   
“Black Sails,” the lavish Starz network drama set in the golden age of piracy in Caribbean in the <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="17" mod="START">early 18th century</TIMEX3>, will start its fourth and final season at <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="TIME" value="2017-04-24T21:00">9 p.m.</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3>. 
   
The series serves as a prequel to Robert Louis Stevenson novel “Treasure Island,” following rival bands of pirates, including North Carolina’s Edward “Blackbeard” Teach, played by Ray Stevenson.
