By This semester and last, I’ve been teaching courses that I haven’t taught in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P1DE" mod="MORE_THAN">more than a decade</TIMEX3>. The amount of preparatory work I do for class has been multiplied, from looking over texts I haven’t read in years to converting my old lecture notes to the formats and technologies I <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> use. It’s been exhausting ... and exhilarating. 
 
The feeling is not unlike visiting someplace where I used to live or work — that pleasant nostalgia of returning to favorite places. I find myself smiling or laughing with delight quite often lately. It’s as if I were attending a reunion with old friends and reminiscing over old times. 
 
The feeling has crept into other aspects of my life. The perpetual de-cluttering of my house — that project that never seems to be finished — has slowed as I “re-discover” things I should have tossed <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">many years ago</TIMEX3> ... and then remember why I didn’t. Shifting books around on the shelves the other night, I found a popular book from <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">a few years ago</TIMEX3> and was about to toss it in the “trade pile.” It needed reading when it was popular, but I can’t imagine that I’ll ever want to read it again. 
 
Then it hit me why I kept it in the first place. I had given it as a gift to my mother. She gave it back to me and told me how much she enjoyed it and that I should read it. It’s the only book I have that she and I both read. Not just the same “book,” but the same BOOK — we both read the same physical copy. Back on the shelf it went. I’ll probably re-read it again, too. 
 
These little voyages of re-discovery set off in uncharted waters, too, which is counter-intuitive. Usually, “re-discovery” means that the voyage covers familiar waters, someplace the voyager has been, even if not in a while. This “un-charting” and “re-charting” of the charted has taken the form of re-watching favorite old movies. Sometime around New Year’s Day, for example, I got that <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="1942">1942</TIMEX3> movie “<TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3>, Voyager” on my mind and dug out my copy of it. Before watching, I remembered that I’d bought a copy of the novel by Olive Higgins Prouty on which the movie is based. It was in the “to-read” pile, so I dug it out and read it before watching the film. 
 
The whole experience was a real hoot. Frankly, “<TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3>, Voyager” is not the best movie ever made; it’s not even the best Bette Davis movie ever made (it may be the best movie Bette Davis ever made with Paul Henreid and Claude Rains, though). It is a wonderful and memorable movie, worthy of far more recognition that it <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> has. The treat of the movie as compared to the book is watching Bette Davis go from frumpy, dowdy spinster to chic, sophisticated socialite in <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DURATION" value="PTXM">a few minutes</TIMEX3>. The treat of the book as compared to the movie is finding out more about why the transformation occurs. 
 
I don’t remember when I first saw the movie. It was either back when local television stations used to show the classics late at night, or on Turner Classic Movies, which is <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DURATION" value="P1D">the 24 hours</TIMEX3>-per-day version of that. What I do remember is that I didn’t focus in on that aspect of the movie then, but I did <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3>. Perhaps that’s the true definition of a classic, whether it be book or movie — every time a classic is experienced, it is a NEW experience, no matter how often it is RE-experienced. Those waters aren’t “un-charted” or “re-charted” as much as they are simply “un-chartable.” 
 
Digging “<TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3>, Voyager” out of the to-read pile uncovered the novel under it — Vera Caspary’s “Laura,” which was filmed as a <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3>-classic murder mystery movie. Y’all know where this one is going ... and there went my weekend. “Laura” is a true classic and one of my favorites, so when Dana Andrews and Gene Tierney flickered on-screen, I knew exactly the waters I was about to sail, but I saw things in it this viewing that I never noticed before. I’m sailing the novel <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">right now</TIMEX3>. 
 
What was next to the DVD of “Laura?” The classic western “Destry Rides Again” with Jimmy Stewart and Marlene Dietrich. I saddled up and watched it again. I think this old favorite was based on a Max Brand novel, but I don’t have it. Come to think of it, Madeline Kahn’s character in the Mel Brooks classic Western comedy “Blazing Saddles” is a parody of Marlene Dietrich’s performance in “Destry Rides Again.” Of course, Cleavon Little and Gene Wilder are brilliant in “Blazing Saddles,” and I’ve got a copy of it around here somewhere ... 
 
This is why I never get the house de-cluttered.
