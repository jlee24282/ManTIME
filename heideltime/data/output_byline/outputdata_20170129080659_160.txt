Armed and determined, an 11-year-old Nelson Mandela Bay pupil is at the cutting edge of one of the country’s oldest sports, Olympic fencing. 

With the first fencing club having been established in South Africa in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="1898">1898</TIMEX3>, the formidable sport, which is known both as fencing and Olympic fencing, faced a number of challenges, including the country’s historic exclusion from international competition in the ensuing decades. 

But it has enjoyed a strong resurgence in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent years</TIMEX3>, with a number of clubs <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> well-established around the country. 

And St George’s Preparatory School pupil Ross Henderson is playing a leading role in promoting the sport among the youth, having <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> convinced the head of his Port Elizabeth school to have the sport included as one of the institution’s sports-club activities. 

Confident and passionate about non-traditional school sports, Henderson created a PowerPoint presentation to convince his principal, Alex Hall, not only to include the activity at this school, but also to allow members of a fencing club to use the school’s premises as a base. 

The sport has gained increased traction <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="PXY" mod="MORE_THAN">over the past few years</TIMEX3>, and particularly after the first Eastern Cape Fencing Championships were held at NMMU’s Missionvale campus in <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3>. 

At the third instalment of the championships, held <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2017-W03">last week</TIMEX3> in Port Alfred, Henderson – who has only been taking part in fencing “for <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="PXM">a few months</TIMEX3>” – placed third in the under-13 category and walked away with a bronze medal.
