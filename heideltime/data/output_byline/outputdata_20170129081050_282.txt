A protest group says it needs a £20,000 cash boost from the public to fund a last ditch chance to defeat a controversial housing development which has already got the go-ahead from the Government. 
 
Community group Kedleston Voice has already spent £40,000 <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DURATION" value="P3Y" mod="MORE_THAN">over three years</TIMEX3> fighting a plan to build 500 houses on Kedleston Estate, which it believes will destroy the landscape and add extra pressure on vital local services. 
 
Despite Amber Valley Borough Council rejecting the plans in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3> the decision went to a national level and was overturned in a seal of approval from planning inspector John Gray.

But in a meeting with more than 100 residents at Allestree's Woodlands School <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3> the group said if it could raise £20,000 more it would maximise its chances of winning a High Court appeal <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017" mod="END">later this year</TIMEX3>. 
 
Kedleston Voice chairman and retired RAF officer Dave Anderson said he had been "overwhelmed" by support so far from residents and organisations like Historic England (previously English Heritage). 
 
He said: "We have got a 70% chance of winning if we can get that funding. The other side have brought out the big guns so we have got to match that - it doesn't come cheap. 
 'A quick buck for the developers'  

 
"People have been with us all the way through this campaign and all we want to see is this area protected for future generations. We accept the need for housing, but that site will not attract affordable houses by the very nature of its position." 
 
Mr Anderson said residents who donate more than £1,000 may be able to get their money back as the other side will pay all of Kedleston Voice's legal costs if it wins. If the group loses, a legal protection order means its costs will be limited to £5,000. 
 
"It will just be a quick buck for the developers if it goes ahead. We have been amazed by the generosity of the local people from Quarndon and Allestree and we wouldn't have got this far without their support." 
 'I hope the judge will have an open mind'  

 
Mid Derbyshire MP Pauline Latham was also at the meeting along with Allestree councillors Ged Potter and Roy Webb. Mrs Latham said she had high hopes for the group's last chance to defeat the developers. 
 
She said: "It does look like Kedleston Voice has got a very, very good case. I couldn't believe it when the Government went against them. It didn't seem to make any sense. I hope this judge will come to it with an open mind and not what appeared to be a closed mind before."
