A 19-year-old man who injured his baby son while caring for him at a specialist residential unit was texting a girlfriend all hours of the day and night, a family court judge has heard. A 19-year-old man who injured his baby son while caring for him at a specialist residential unit was texting a girlfriend all hours of the day and night, a family court judge has heard. Mr Justice Keehan was told that the teenager ran up a £2,400 phone bill in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P1M">a month</TIMEX3>.

The bill revealed "staggeringly" high usage and concern had been raised about the man being "distracted", said the judge.

Detail of the case has emerged in a ruling by Mr Justice Keehan following a private family court hearing in Birmingham..

The judge said no-one involved could be identified.

Social services bosses at Staffordshire County Council asked him to decide who had hurt the baby.

He said the boy had <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> been placed for adoption.

Mr Justice Keehan said the baby's mother - the teenager's girlfriend - had been ruled out as a carer.

He said the man had been allowed to care for the baby at an assessment unit under the supervision of specialist staff.

The baby suffered rib fractures and head injuries while at the unit when less than two months old.

Evidence suggested the boy had been hurt during the early hours, the court heard.

Mr Justice Keehan concluded that the teenager caused the injuries after "momentarily" losing control.

"(One staff member) spoke warmly of the father's care of (his son) but was concerned about the extent of mobile phone contact between him and the mother which distracted him from interacting as much as he could have done with (the baby)," said the judge.

"In his first month the father incurred a phone bill in excess of £2,400."

He added: "This reveals a staggeringly high degree of usage."

The judge said the teenager "plainly found" being separated from his girlfriend "very hard to bear".

Phone records showed text messages passing between them "at all hours of the day and night".

Mr Justice Keehan said the man was "extremely anxious" about the relationship and "struggling to cope" with sleepless nights and caring for the baby.

The judge said evidence showed that the teenager was the "perpetrator".

He said he could not be sure of the circumstances in which the boy was hurt.

The teenager denied harming his son and blamed a member of staff at the unit. Mr Justice Keehan dismissed the allegation and exonerated staff members.
