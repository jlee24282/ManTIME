Tips for Class X and XII Board Students by PM Narendra Modi in Mann ki Baat 
  
  
 
Proper Break: Candidates should take a proper break after few hours of study to refresh themselves 
 Enhance Concentration:  Students preparing for the board exam should concentrate on their studies during their study hours to gain more knowledge and concepts. 
 Proper Rest, Sleep and Physical Activity: The students need proper rest, adequate sleep, physical activity along with studies as they are three essential requirements during exams. 
 Don’t Find Out Ways to Cheat: Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that s ome people spend all their time in finding out ways to cheat. Despite finding ways for teaching, students should be focussed on their exam preparation that will ultimately help. 
 
Lack of Confidence leads towards failure and pressurise students to find out the ways to cheat in the exam. This is not the right path towards success. As someone has rightly said, “heights reached by greatmen, were not attained in the sudden flight. They while their companion sleep, were toiling upward in the night”.
