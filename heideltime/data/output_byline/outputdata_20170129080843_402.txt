In the world we live in, I find myself passing by all the hate and anger and negativity online and on social media. I have to skip past it because I know there are still wonderful, caring and loving people in this world. I find something like this and it renews my faith in what I believe. This is a story of goodness, care for your neighbor, literally. Love one another and give and help each other. This story is touching on so many levels. Bravo to Fox 5 for choosing to honor this very deserving family. God bless the children who lost their mother. I hope they have peace in their hearts. I'm bawling!!!
