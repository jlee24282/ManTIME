Sometimes we “,” said President Donald Trump’s White House press secretary Sean Spicer. “The party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. It was their final, most essential command,” wrote novelist George Orwell in his book "<TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="1984">1984</TIMEX3>."

After incorrect or un-provable statements made by Donald Trump and some White House aides, sales of George Orwell's "<TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="1984">1984</TIMEX3>" book are soaring.

“Thank you for calling the White House comments line. The comment line is <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> closed, but your comment is important to the president and we urge you to send us a comment online at www.WhiteHouse.gov/contact or send us a message through Facebook messenger.” Trump has banned the public from calling the White House.

<TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> that Donald Trump has won the presidential election, the committee investigating the Benghazi embassy attacks have conveniently decided their services are no longer needed; it was all a Republican witch hunt to attack Hillary Clinton and waste millions of taxpayer dollars.
