Just as the entire world (and we mean Indian television fans) is getting ready for the  Bigg Boss 10 final episode, with fireworks expected between superstar host Salman Khan and the Bigg Boss 10 contestants, a WhatsApp news flash has been going viral since <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TNI">last night</TIMEX3> stating that one of the finalists has quit the show. Yes, the WhatsApp message reads, “Manu Punjabi leaves Bigg Boss 10 for (Rs) 10 lakhs”. Is it true? We expected the Bigg Boss 10 Grand Finale episode on <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday, January 29, 2017</TIMEX3>, to be a great battle, with the four Bigg Boss 10 finalists Bani J, Lopamudra Raut, Manveer Gurjar and Manu Punjabi (aka Manoj Punjabi). So, this rumour of Manu Punjabi having quit Bigg Boss 10 ahead of the grand finale by settling for a compensation money of a meagre Rs 10 lakh comes as a shock viewers! 
 
While it is no secret that the ladies Bani J and Lopamudra Raut don’t see eye to eye on Bigg Boss 10 , being completely opposite personalities, Manu Punjabi and Manveer Gurjar have always been friends and hung out together on the show. So, has Manu Punjabi sacrificed his chance to win Bigg Boss 10 for his pal? Or is it just that Manu feels that although he started out being popular on Bigg Boss 10 , it is Manveer Gurjar who <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> has an edge and a chance to win more votes than the other contestants? 
  
The moment has finally arrived where the winner of this season so be unveiled! Tune in to the #BB10GrandFinale <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29TNI">tonight</TIMEX3>! pic.twitter.com/b5uFkOJw2X
