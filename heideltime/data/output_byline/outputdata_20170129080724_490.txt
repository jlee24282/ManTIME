Statement of Therese Langer, Transportation Program Director 
 
ACEEE welcomes the EPA’s final determination that greenhouse gas emissions standards for light-duty vehicles of model year (MY) <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2022">2022</TIMEX3>-<TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2025">2025</TIMEX3> remain appropriate in light of the information available to date. The standards will save consumers tens of billions of dollars at the pump, will help ensure that domestic automakers continue to be at the forefront of global advances in auto technology, and are essential to keeping the United States on course to meet its climate goals. 
 
EPA’s determination affirming the standards through MY <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2025">2025</TIMEX3> is part of the “midterm evaluation” required under the <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2012">2012</TIMEX3> rule setting standards for MY <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3>-<TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2025">2025</TIMEX3>. For <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="PXY">many years</TIMEX3>, automakers had emphasized the critical importance of adequate lead time for achieving substantial increases in fuel economy and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. At the same time, they voiced concern that standards set well in advance might overshoot the levels that would seem appropriate as the model years approached. Yet vehicle efficiency technology advances are <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> in fact outpacing the agencies’ earlier projections, and EPA’s action should allow the highly successful program of vehicle standards to proceed as planned. 
 
The agency’s determination is based upon a thorough draft Technical Assessment Report (TAR) issued <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2016-07">last July</TIMEX3> by EPA, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, and the California Air Resources Board, as well as stakeholders’ comments on the TAR and EPA follow-up work. The analysis shows that the standards are still achievable and cost-effective despite lower oil prices, partly due to the emergence of technologies not contemplated in the compliance packages the agencies constructed for the <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2012">2012</TIMEX3> rulemaking. Taken together, increases in vehicle standards for the period MY <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2012">2012</TIMEX3>-<TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2025">2025</TIMEX3> will nearly double the fuel efficiency of cars and light-trucks relative to MY <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2010">2010</TIMEX3>. 
 
The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy acts as a catalyst to advance energy efficiency policies, programs, technologies, investments, and behaviors.
