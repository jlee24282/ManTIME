The latest film by UCA alumnus Michael Dudok de Wit was nominated the Best Animated Feature Film category.

It has no dialogue and is centred on a man who has been shipwrecked on a deserted island and meets a giant red turtle. 

Speaking to the Los Angeles Times, Michael said: “The competition was really strong. I knew our film had a chance. It was unlike any of the other films. But many other films had a huge chance, I think. I was honestly quite nervous.”

The film, which is a co-production between Wild Bunch and Studio Ghibil, premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2016-05">May last year</TIMEX3>.

Michael graduated from one of UCA’s founding colleges – the West Surrey College of Art – in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="1978">1978</TIMEX3> and has since gone on to enjoy an extremely successful career.
