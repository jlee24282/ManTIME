A LEAGUE-LEVEL women's rugby team member has been found dead in her Málaga home aged just 26, lying in the corridor with multiple bruising all over her body, emergency services say.

The woman, who has not been named but is said to be Colombian, has been taken for an autopsy but no signs have been found of any violent attack which could have led to her death, meaning domestic abuse has been ruled out.

Forensics believe the bruising may have just been the result of the rough nature of her chosen sport.

She played regularly for Málaga University's Club Deportivo UMA team, and had been seen 'apparently normal' at <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-01-26">Thursday</TIMEX3>'s training session.

The deceased was due to play at <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29T12:00">noon today</TIMEX3> (<TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3>) against Sevilla, but the match was called off due to bad weather.

In any case, her body was discovered <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">yesterday</TIMEX3> (<TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>) before any of her fellow players would have noticed her absence.

As yet, the cause of her death has not been revealed.
