Mischa was taken to Cedars-Sinai Medical Centre after authorities were called to a West Hollywood apartment following reports of a woman yelling.

She added: “I voluntarily went to get professional help, and I was informed by their staff that I had been given GHB. 
 
“After an overnight stay, I am home and doing well. 
 
Mischa Barton (Tony Di Maio/PA) “I would like to extend a big thanks of gratitude to the professionals at Cedars-Sinai for their great care and professionalism. 
 
“This is a lesson to all young women out there, be aware of your surroundings.”
