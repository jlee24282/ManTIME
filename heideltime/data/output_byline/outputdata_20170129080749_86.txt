To the editor: 
  
I have <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> had some serious issues with home health care and receiving, good home health care for myself, and someone I take care of in my home. 
 
Many people don’t realize it, but that is what your governor is for. And the same with the attorney general. I called a young man by the name of Dave Ward, and he reached out for me to state agencies and helped me get independent home health care taken care of. Thanks to him, Gov. John Kasich and Attorney General Mike DeWine, You truly made a difference. If you have any issues, please reach out to state officials. That’s why they are here.
