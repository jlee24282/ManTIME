A mirror, we feel is an absolute must have in every home. Here are certain creative ways to use the mirror in enhancing the beauty of your home. 
 
Make 'em big: You have small rooms and you want to create an illusion of adding more depth to the room. All you need is a mirror and a dash of creativity. Placement is what matters the most. You can use a horizontal mirror in a narrow hallway or staircase to widen the space. 
 
Wall-to- wall mirrors: Mirrors blend in with anything. Alternate a pane of wall to wall mirrors with woodwork. It enhances the beauty of the room. 
    
Reflection says it all: Ensure that you place the mirrors in such a way that it reflects positive energy. Don't hang a mirror just about anywhere you see an empty space or in the kitchen. 
 
Outdorsy: If you have a terrace or a big balcony, use a clear mirror to make the space look larger. 
 
Furniture 
 
Get yourself a coffee table or a chest of drawers with mirrors on it. It will give an illusion of the floor extending beyond the walls.
