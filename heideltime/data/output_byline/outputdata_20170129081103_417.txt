Not so, says Fred Baker, of Avoca. He has found a unique way of disposing of dead chainsaws. He decorates his property with them.

The Lawrence County native retired <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">a few years ago</TIMEX3> after <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P30Y">30 years</TIMEX3> as a Teamster truck driver in the Indianapolis area. Although working in Indianapolis, he maintained his home in Lawrence County. He has lived in the same place since <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="1971">1971</TIMEX3>.

Baker started decorating his property with old chainsaws <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">a few years ago</TIMEX3>.

“I’ve always had a fascination with them,” he said. “I cut my own wood and tinkered with the saws when they weren’t working. I needed something to go in the corner of the yard. I liked the idea of collecting chainsaws.”

What he did in the corner of his yard is build a totem pole of chainsaws. The pole is surrounded by several chainsaws stuck, blade first, into the ground, forming a fence around the pole.

“I pick them up at flea markets and yard sales,” he said.

Baker said a lot of people stop by and take pictures.

“It’s really pretty in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-SU">the summer</TIMEX3>,” he said. “We have a lot of flowers around the place. I take care of the roses and my wife, LaTonia, takes care of the rest.”

In his shop in the garage, there are 14 chainsaws of various sizes. He said there are probably another 65 or so scattered around the property. There is even a model airplane built out of chainsaw bars. The wings and the fuselage are longer bars from bigger chain saws. The horizontal and vertical stabilizers at the back of the airplane are made from smaller bars, cut down to fit.

Baker built his own piston can crusher. A can is placed in the end of a tube. When the switch is hit, an electric motor powers the piston and crushes the can, which falls into a large bin.

He also built a two-story grist mill that operates 24/7 during <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2017-SU">the summer</TIMEX3>. A circulating pump supplies the water flow that powers the grist mill. The water is then collected and the process happens all over again.

In his garage is a collection of Garcia-Mitchell fishing reels.

“They are made in France,” he said. “I have about 130 of them. I have about 180 fishing rods and reels in my collection.”

He said retirement has been enjoyable, but he learned on <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2016-10-12">Oct. 12</TIMEX3> that he has cancer and may only <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DURATION" value="P3M">3</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION" value="P6M">6 months</TIMEX3> to live.
