And the winner is ... <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3>! 
 
We made the record books <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-W03">last week</TIMEX3>. It has been warm and wet start to <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3>. According to the National Weather Service records for Toledo, we broke the record for the most consecutive days above freezing for the month of <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-01">January</TIMEX3>, beating the previous record of <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P8D">eight days</TIMEX3> set back in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="1998">1998</TIMEX3>. 
 
Here’s a bit of my favorite meteorology geek data: The last time we felt the temperature drop below freezing was <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-01-16">Jan. 16</TIMEX3>, where we were at 20 degrees for the daytime high. Also, according to the National Weather Service, <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-01">January</TIMEX3> made the top 10 of the wettest months on record for Toledo with 4.4 inches of rain.

That’s because the warmer temperatures have caused the frozen soil to thaw. According to Michigan State University, soil temperatures in southeast Michigan near the state line have been hanging just above the freezing mark all month. At a 4-inch depth, they have been fluctuating from 38.7 degrees to 32.5 degrees. 
 
<TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2017-SP">Spring</TIMEX3>-like weather has been easy on the pocketbook but has taken some of our plants out of their <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017-WI">winter</TIMEX3> slumber. If you had a chance to take a look at some of the plants around your yard, you might see some of the early bloomers like forsythia and lilac already pushing their buds out on each branch. Some of the early blooming bulbs may also have some of their foliage peeking above the soil line. 
 
But <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> it is back to average temperatures around the freezing mark for the daytime high and overnight lows in the teens, with a bit of white stuff flying in the air. It may take <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DURATION" value="PXW">a few weeks</TIMEX3> below zero to get the ground frozen solid again. So what will this warm <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2017-01">January</TIMEX3> weather do to your plants? 
 
Amy Stone, Ohio State University Extension Agent for Lucas County, said, “At this point there isn't a lot gardeners can do but wait and watch.” She said many plants could see a bit of tip damage when the temps go back to average and the ground freezes again, but they will be able to survive the warm-up. 
 
Hobbyists and professionals who hunt for sugar maple trees and live near a sugar bush were watching the weather closely. Maple trees will start their sap flow when we get bright sun during the day with warmer temperatures and crisp nights. We didn’t have exactly those conditions, but the warmer temperatures were tempting the trees to come out of dormancy. 
 
Stone said, “Those that tap for maple syrup are very anxious, but at this point it is a wait-and-see. It might be a rough year for those with sugar bush.” 
 
Stone continued: “If gardeners have planted perennials, shrubs, and even trees <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2016-FA">last fall</TIMEX3>, keep your eyes open as temperatures fall and the ground freezes that there isn’t any heaving of the root ball. The act of heaving can push root balls up and expose roots, and when temperatures drop — and they will — they could be exposed and there could be some <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2017-WI">winter</TIMEX3> injury.” 
 
The warm-up isn’t all bad. 
 
“On the positive side, if silver maples bloom during a warm-up, the temperatures are sure to go down and will hopefully kill the flowers and therefore we won't have the fruit or samaras,” said Stone. 
 
<TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2017-SP">Spring</TIMEX3> isn’t far off. <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="2017-SP">Spring</TIMEX3> equinox is <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2017-03-20">March 20</TIMEX3>, but hey, who’s counting?
