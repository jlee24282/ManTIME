Federal judge Ann Donnelly of the Eastern District of New York has handed an early victory to the lawyers challenging President Trump’s executive order barring immigrants and travelers from seven majority-Muslim countries from entering the US. 

Judge Donnelly announced during an emergency hearing <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TNI">Saturday night</TIMEX3> that she was granting a stay that would prevent the government from deporting immigrants <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> detained in airports around the country. 



The decision halts part of Trump’s executive order, which barred citizens from those seven countries for <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P90D">the next 90 days</TIMEX3>. 

The Department of Homeland Security said that by <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TEV">Saturday evening</TIMEX3>, its agents had stopped 109 foreigners at U.S. airports based on Trump’s order and prevented another 173 people from boarding flights headed for the U.S. 

After U.S. District Court Ann Donnelly granted the stay, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which had filed suit to block Trump’s ban, issued a one-word celebratory tweet: “Victory!” 

Trump’s executive order, signed <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3>, suspends the entry of all refugees to the U.S. for <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="P120D">120 days</TIMEX3>, halts admission of refugees from Syria indefinitely and bars entry for <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P3M">three months</TIMEX3> to residents from the predominantly Muslim countries of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen.
