New Delhi [India], <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Jan 29</TIMEX3> : Japanese financial services firm Nomura on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> projected about 20 percent returns for the Sensex by <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017" mod="END">the end of 2017</TIMEX3> as multiples are likely to rise with normalizing growth. 
Nomura maintained its overweight view on the mix of public and private sector banks, downstream oil and gas, utilities, four-wheeler and select industrial companies, while being underweight on telecom and pharmaceutical sectors. 

In its report, it added the impact of demonetisation on the economy, investment cycle and earnings will not be significant. 

It has listed HDFC Bank, State Bank of India, Maruti Suzuki India, Zee Entertainment Enterprises and Indian Oil Corporation as its top stock picks. 

"On <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2016-11-08">November 8, 2016</TIMEX3>, the government had pulled out 86 percent of the currency in circulation by demonetizing Rs. 

500 and Rs. 1,000 notes. The equity market tumbled after that but has since gained momentum and is <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> back to pre-demonetisation levels," it added. 

Nomura estimated that overall impact of demonetisation on earnings could be three to five percent, and added that since expectations of earnings for the Sensex have been slashed by three percent, further risks to earnings would be minimal. 

"The Indian market remains cheaper than its <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P5Y">five year</TIMEX3> averages...markets appear cheap in comparison with fixed income after demonetisation," added Nomura. 

Giving its view on the Budget Expectation, the firm said that the government is unlikely to take a populist stance in the upcoming Union Budget on <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2017-02-01">February 1</TIMEX3>. 

The government is likely to deliver a "popular, but not a populist, budget", it said. "We look for the government to instead emphasize asset creation and growth in the forthcoming budget," it added.
