Ted Dawe, author of banned book Into the River, discusses censorship and the inspiration for his work. 
   
Ted Dawe's once-banned childrens novel  Into the River  is reportedly headed for the big screen. 
 
Into the River , which won a New Zealand Post Children's Book Award in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2013">2013</TIMEX3>, was temporarily banned in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3> after a complaint by conservatives about the publication's detailed scenes of sex, drugs, and course language. 
 
Dawe found himself and his book at the centre of a nationwide censorship debate, which eventually resulted in the ban being lifted, and the president of the Film and Literature Board of Review, Don Mathieson, QC, stepping down soon after.

Award-winning New Zealand filmmaker Paul Judge is said to have beaten a keen Hollywood director in snapping up film rights, according to NZME. 
 
Judge told the publication he was hoping to secure a budget in line with "modern Kiwi films of between $6m-$10 million", and would <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017">this year</TIMEX3> be looking to attract financiers, including applying to the New Zealand Film Commission. 
 
In an interview with Fairfax Media in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2016-09">September</TIMEX3>, <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3>, Dawe said controversy about the book had been "hugely positive". 
 
"It is <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> a famous book. It's in Time magazine. There is a lot of curiosity [...] I'm only guessing, but I think it's going to make a lot of money for me." 
 
With this new deal, it seems Dawe might have been right.
