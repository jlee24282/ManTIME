Rahim said the boat was reported missing about 9.50 p.m. after failing to arrive at the island, and that a search and rescue operation was launched soon after. 
 
Bad weather was hampering the search effort, which covers an area of about 400 nautical square miles, he said. 
 
“We are looking at strong winds and choppy waters, and have requested assistance from the air force to conduct an aerial search,” he said.
