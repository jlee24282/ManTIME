Hearts head coach Ian Cathro admits just the thought of Sam Nicholson playing football makes him smile - but he is in no rush to try to persuade him to extend his contract. 
 
The midfielder is set to continue his comeback from knee surgery at Celtic Park on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3> after making his first appearance in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P4M" mod="LESS_THAN">almost four months</TIMEX3> as a substitute in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-25">Wednesday</TIMEX3>'s William Hill Scottish Cup win over Raith Rovers. 
 
The 22-year-old is out of contract in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-SU">the summer</TIMEX3> and agreement over a new deal does not look imminent despite talks commencing in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-FA">the autumn</TIMEX3>. 
 
Cathro said: ``I think about Sam playing and training and I almost start smiling. I enjoy the kid's work. 
 
``I am obviously still in a process of getting to know him and spending more time with him in training and working together, but I have enjoyed seeing his work. He has nice qualities.'' 
 
Nicholson is <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> free to talk to other clubs and Rangers have been credited with an interest. 
 
But when asked about the wide player's contract situation, Cathro said: ``We can maybe look at those things further down the line but I am just getting to know him. 
 
``He is just coming back from an injury, which was his main focus. There was no need for any focus to be on anything else. 
 
``His focus <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> is on properly returning to the team, gradually building up his minutes and becoming stronger, and then reach a point he is ready to fight for a place in the team. 
 
``That has to be a natural process. I am in no rush for Sam to do anything other than fight for his place in the team.''
