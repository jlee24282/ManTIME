Erode (TN), <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Jan 29</TIMEX3> (PTI) Appreciating Tamil Nadu Chief Minister O Panneerselvam for his efforts in passing jallikattu ordinance and over Krishna river water issue, Congress leader E V K S Elangovan <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3> asked him to take steps for halting building of check dams across Bhavani river by Kerala. 
 
Addressing a press meet here, he praised Panneerselvam for the efforts taken for conduct of jallikattu and for meeting Andhra Pradesh counterpart N Chandrababu Naidu to get Krishna water to Tamil Nadu. 
 
“In a similar manner, Panneerselvam should lead a delegation of officials and representatives of political parties to meet Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and stop construction of check dams across River Bhavani,” he said. 
 
Thanking the students and others for protesting in support of jallikattu in a peaceful manner, Elangovan, a former TNCC president, condemned the police action against the protesters. 
 
He urged the Tamil Nadu government to constitute a judicial enquiry commission headed by a retired or <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> Supreme Court judge to go into the violent incidents. 
 
Such an inquiry was necessary to ascertain whether anti-socials and mischief mongers infiltrated the protesting crowd at Marina Beach in Chennai, as claimed by the state government and police, he said. 
 
On reported seating of Panneerselvam along with other party MLAs at a meeting chaired by AIADMK General Secretary V K Sasikala, he said   It is totally an insult and disrespect shown to the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu . 
 
Though it was an inner-party meeting, the AIADMK chief should provide ‘proper respect’ to the chief minister by providing a seat adjacent to her in the podium, he added. 
 
Charing that the BJP manifesto for the Uttar Pradesh elections mentioned support of some castes and communities, he wanted the Election Commission to bar the party from contesting the coming polls.
