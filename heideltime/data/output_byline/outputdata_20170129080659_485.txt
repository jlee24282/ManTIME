Leslie Hamil cherishes time she spends with special needs students. 
 
“I probably get more hugs here in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> than you would get in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3> somewhere else," said Hamil, a paraprofessional at Ben Franklin Science Academy. 
 
Hamil, 52, took a coast-to-coast journey to get there. 
 
The California native said her father was in the Air Force, so she lived in Arkansas, Maryland and Texas while growing up. 
 
"If I'd have been born <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="XXXX-XX">two months earlier</TIMEX3>, I'd have lived in Guam," she said. 
 
After attending what was then Westark Community College in Fort Smith, Ark., Hamil worked in health care. 
 
After <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="PXY">a few years</TIMEX3>, her journey took her to jobs with Girl Scouts, Muskogee's Youth Volunteer Corps, then to BFSA. She remains active in YVC.  
 
But she has a heart for her BFSA students. 
 
"YVC not withstanding, if I knew <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="P35Y">35</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="1977">40 years ago</TIMEX3> what I know <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3>, I probably would have gone a whole different direction in my career," she said. "It's just been one of the most fulfilling things." 
 
Continuing the 
 
scouting tradition 
 
Leslie Hamil's first involvement with Girl Scouts came in first and second grade. 
 
"With my dad being in the Air Force and traveling a lot, it was really hard to get into anything that was structured," Hamil recalled. "It was half of <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">one year</TIMEX3>, half of another." 
 
That brief time had some impact. 
 
"My mom still has my uniform," she said. 
 
Hamil got a job with the local Girl Scout office in <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2003">2003</TIMEX3>. 
 
"When I started, I was in outreach,” she said. “That involved going to low-income housing, at-risk schools, working with girls in those areas, bringing the Girl Scout program to them and giving them something extra after school." 
 
She said scouting is an amazing program. 
 
“It gives girls lots of learning opportunities,” she said. "There’d be a lot of girls who would not have the chance to go to the different camps that they have, journeys they go on.” 
 
Hamil <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> is a lifetime member, and her stepdaughter is on her way of becoming one. 
 
“She’ll be one when she graduates in <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2017-05">May</TIMEX3>,” Hamill said. “That was one of the things she wanted for graduation was a lifetime membership to Girl Scouts." 
 
Hamil said scouting played a big part in making her daughter the kindhearted young woman she is. 
 
"She’s big into helping other people,” she said. “We’ll go some place, something will happen and she’d say “in Girl Scouts, we always leave a place better than the way we found it.' She looks back and she remembers what she was taught in Girl Scouts and she uses that. She even tells people that was where she learned it." 
 
A chance meeting 
 
with other volunteers 
 
Hamil’s involvement with youth switched when Girl Scouts were at a joint event with Youth Volunteer Corps, where she met YVC director Eileen Van Kirk. 
 
"I was kind of ready for a change and I talked with her about YVC,” Hamil said. 
 
Hamil was hired as a team leader, overseeing volunteer groups at different projects. Teens helped during the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Day pancake breakfast, parade and party. They help with donations at Fostering Hope. They collect donations and help ice skaters during Honor Heights Park’s annual Garden of Lights. 
 
“Our volunteers average <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DURATION" value="PT100H" mod="APPROX">about 100 hours</TIMEX3> of work <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3>,” she said. “They do a lot.” 
 
Hamil said working with YVC has been awesome. 
 
“We’re working with teenagers who are there because they want to be there,” she said. “They want to volunteer their time. They want to help their community.” 
 
She said several teens have chosen careers from things they did in YVC. 
 
“There are some that are going into special education, occupational or physical therapy who have worked at Camp Bennett,” Hamil said. “Some want to work with animals who worked in our animal antics program.” 
 
She said teens are at "a very important time in their life, when they’re trying to figure out where to go.” 
 
Finding work with 
 
special needs students 
 
Hamil’s involvement with Youth Volunteer Corps led her to her <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> job as paraprofessional. 
 
She recalled bringing her teen volunteers to help at Camp Bennett, a Muskogee Public Schools <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2017-SU">summer</TIMEX3> camp for special needs youth and adults. 
 
"Once you work at Camp Bennett, you kind of fall in love with the kids,” she said. “There are <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DURATION" value="P2W">two weeks</TIMEX3> of adults camp and <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DURATION" value="P3W">three weeks</TIMEX3> of kids camp. There are a lot of activities — outdoor recreation, science and nature, games and music, fishing, bowling — some things kids don’t get to do if they didn’t have the camp.” 
 
After a few summers, people with the district asked if she wanted to help special needs students as a paraprofessional. 
 
“There’s kind of a cross-section of different kinds of disabilities,” Hamil said. “We work with them on anything, math, science, reading, English. Also life skills.” 
 
Hamil said one thing her students need is “to be treated like everybody else." 
 
“You help them when they need help and understand that they can do a lot more than people think they can. You let them do everything they can do themselves and you’re there to help and to guide them." 
 
Hamil said one her pleasures is “seeing when they accomplish something, seeing them smile." 
 
“It makes you feel great about yourself, knowing you’re doing something that’s helping,” she said.
