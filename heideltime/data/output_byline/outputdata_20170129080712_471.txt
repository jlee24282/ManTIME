Summary  Background  
Infantile haemangioma is the most common tumour of infancy, but the association with pre-eclampsia is poorly understood. 
 Objectives  
We determined the relationship between variants of pre-eclampsia and risk of infantile haemangioma. 
 Methods  
We carried out a retrospective cohort study of hospital data for all live births between <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="1989">1989</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2013">2013</TIMEX3> in Quebec, Canada. We identified 14 240 neonates with, and 1 930 564 without haemangioma before discharge, and determined whether early- or late-onset pre-eclampsia was documented on the maternal chart. We used log-binomial regression to compute prevalence ratios (PRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between pre-eclampsia and infantile haemangioma, adjusted for maternal characteristics. 
 Results  
The prevalence of any haemangioma was higher for pre-eclampsia than for no pre-eclampsia (81·3 vs. 72·9 per 10 000), with a PR of 1·15 (95% CI 1·06–1·25) after adjustment for maternal characteristics. Pre-eclampsia with onset before <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P34W">34 weeks</TIMEX3>’ gestation was associated with cutaneous (PR 2·32, 95% CI 1·68–3·21), noncutaneous (PR 3·66, 95% CI 2·49–5·37) and unspecified haemangioma (PR 2·49, 95% CI 1·77–3·49). However, the association between early-onset pre-eclampsia and haemangioma was attenuated once long neonatal length of hospital stays was accounted for. There was no association with late-onset pre-eclampsia after <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P34W">34 weeks</TIMEX3>, and associations were weaker for other variants including severe pre-eclampsia and pre-eclampsia with low birthweight. 
 Conclusions  
Early-onset pre-eclampsia is associated with increased risk of haemangioma at birth, but detection bias due to longer hospital stays and closer follow-up may be part of the reason.
