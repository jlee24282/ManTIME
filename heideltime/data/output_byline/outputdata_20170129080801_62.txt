Following the rumoured death of President Muhammadu Buhari the immediately past Governor of Edo State Adams Oshiomhole has berated those creating controversies over the President’s health

In <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DURATION" value="PXD">the past few days</TIMEX3> the social media has been blanketed with series of news that the President is dead

The Presidency however denied the claim saying the President is hale hearty and having a vacation in the UK

In a bid to prove rumour mongers wrong two set of photos have been and not dead

But Oshiomhole in his reaction described the report as unnecessary stressing that routine medical checkup was normal

Addressing reporters at his hometown in Iyamho Estako West Local Government Area on <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> Oshiomhole maintained that Buhari was entitled to a period of rest and medical checkups

According to Oshiomhole ‎"I think it is unnecessary Let us be honest As the governor of Edo State we have had to sponsor and the records are there first Nigerian medical doctors who request for it in black and white that they had to be treated in India the UK or US and they give me a variety of reasons why they need that foreign medical check

"‎I have seen villagers approaching me that they had prostrate cancer They had gone to some local hospitals and they had challenges and they want support to go to India I had used state funds to support very ordinary people and all kinds of people including the media politicians and farmers

"‎I have had course to travel outside Nigeria for a comprehensive medical check when I was in doubt And the experience of Gani Fawehimi shows that if ordinary Nigerian labourers medical doctors find course to go and do what we call routine physical check why ‎would anybody make it such a big issue that any Nigerian including our president should be denied the right for a thorough check" Top Stories
