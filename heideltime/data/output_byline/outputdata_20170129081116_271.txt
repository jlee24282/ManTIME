Raising their voices once again, this time against the Muslim ban, stars like Mark Ruffalo, Mark Hamill, Ava DuVernay, Michael Moore, Miley Cyrus, Chrissy Teigen and others spoke about controversial anti-Muslim immigration ban in the US. 
 
US President Donald Trump signed an executive order on <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="TIME" value="2017-01-27TAF">Friday afternoon</TIMEX3> to suspend the entry of refugees to the US for <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P120D">120 days</TIMEX3> and imposed an indefinite ban on refugees from Syria. A <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P90D">90-day</TIMEX3> ban was also placed on citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. 
 
According to a report by Reuters, Gillian Christensen, spokeswoman for Department of Homeland Security said that the ban applied to green card holders as well. 
 
Star of HBO's show Silicon Valley , Kumail Nanjiani, who is a Pakistani immigrant, said, 
  
As someone who was born in Pakistan I can tell you coming into America is VERY difficult. A #Muslimban accomplishes nothing but hate.

You're saying to a billion people "You're all the same. You're all dangerous to us." Children hear this. You breed evil here & everywhere.

Speaking about Iranian filmmaker Asghar Farhadi being barred from attending the Oscars <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> ceremony owing to the ban, director Ava DuVernay quoted parts of his <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2012">2012</TIMEX3> Oscar acceptance speech for A Separation .

According to a report in Variety , the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences issued a statement slamming the ban: "The Academy celebrates achievement in the art of filmmaking, which seeks to transcend borders and speak to audiences around the world, regardless of national, ethnic, or religious differences. As supporters of filmmakers — and the human rights of all people — around the globe, we find it extremely troubling that Asghar Farhadi, the director of the Oscar-winning film from Iran A Separation , along with the cast and crew of this year’s Oscar-nominated film The Salesman, could be barred from entering the country because of their religion or country of origin." 
 
Mark Ruffalo, who has been very vocal about opposing Trump's policies and decisions, be it Standing Rock protests or the anti-Trump rally in New York on the eve of Presidential Inauguration, shared images of protests outside New York's JFK airport with the caption, "The day the music died."

To our Muslim neighbors in the world: I & tens of millions of others are so very sorry. The majority of Americans did not vote 4 this man.

Here are more reactions: 
  
Donald Trump has no fucking clue. His desperate need for self aggrandizement is destroying US. Nothing will fill his black heart. #MuslimBan

Well a bunch of countries on #MuslimBan are OPEC countries- wonder if this will drive up the price of oil..

Day 1, @POTUS talks 'maybe' going into Iraq to take the oil. But Iraqi refugees who #SupportTheTroops ? 'We don't want them here.' #Criminal

1. Trump's #MuslimBan is against the law. The <TIMEX3 tid="t58" type="DATE" value="1965">1965</TIMEX3> Immigration & Naturalization Act eliminated national origins as a basis for immigration.

We've lost something very precious. 
 
And traded it for a cowardly, foolish illusion of safety. 
 
I'm ashamed. #MuslimBan

And the fact that they did it on Holocaust <TIMEX3 tid="t66" type="DATE" value="2016-05-30">Memorial Day</TIMEX3>... 
the most vile thing I've seen in a long, long time. #MuslimBan
