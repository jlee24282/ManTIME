Carl Frampton has lost his WBA featherweight title by majority decision in clash with Leo Santa Cruz. 
 
The Mexican challenger secured the title by a majority decision, at MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas. Two judges called it 115-113 in Santa Cruz's favour, with the third ruling the match a 114-114 draw.  
 
Frampton later stated that   "Leo probably deserved it. It was my fault and I want to apologise to the travelling fans."  
 
"I hope we can do it again - we need to do it again." 
 
While Frampton, won all 23 of his previous pro fights, he was unable to overcome Cruz. While he won some rounds back,  Santa Cruz held firm, determined to take the belt. 
 
The Belfast man said: "My feet were a bit slow, I needed to let my hands go a bit more when I got close."
