Stomper Kenzo was concerned to see a cyclist riding on the Pan-Island Expressway (PIE) <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">yesterday</TIMEX3> (<TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Jan 28</TIMEX3>), at around 12.40pm. 
 
A video he sent in shows the man riding by the side of the road even though cycling is not allowed on expressways in Singapore. 
 
According to a <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2015-04">April 2015</TIMEX3> report on The New Paper. those cycling on expressways may be charged under Section 279 of the Penal Code for driving in a rash manner which endangers human life or causes hurt or injury to any other person. 
 
"Under Section 2 of the Road Traffic Act, a cyclist qualifies as a driver. So technically, they can be fined up to $5,000," said lawyer Raphael Louis.
