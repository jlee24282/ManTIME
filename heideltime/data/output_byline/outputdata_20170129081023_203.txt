North Yorkshire County Council is encouraging people to talk about mental health.

It's backing Time to Talk Day, a national campaign that aims to get people to talk more openly about mental health and well being for <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P1D">24 hours</TIMEX3>.

It takes place on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2016-02-02">2 February</TIMEX3> and is organised by the Time to Change campaign, which aims to alter the way we think and act about mental health. 

Since the campaign's launch in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2014">2014</TIMEX3>, Time to Talk Day has sparked millions of conversations in schools, workplaces, homes in the media and online and attracted support from celebrities such as Freddie Flintoff, Stephen Fry and Frankie Bridge.

Councillor Clare Wood is North Yorkshire County Council's Executive Member for Adult Social Care and Health Integration. 

She said:

"One in four of us will experience a mental health problem in any given year, but many of us are too afraid to talk about it.

Starting a conversation about mental health might seem daunting but simply sending a text, checking in on a friend or sharing something on social media can break the ice.” 

Councillor David Chance is North Yorkshire County Council's Member for Public Health and Stronger Communities.

He added:

"We are taking part in Time to Talk Day because mental health is a topic that we should all feel able to talk about.

Having these all important conversations can make a big difference to many people. The more we talk, the more lives we can change.” 

Free resources are available for workplaces and community groups to hold their own events and people can get involved on the day by tweeting #timetotalk or by visiting
