ALBUQUERQUE — As Zack Cole reminded his players before clearing out of Manzano’s gymnasium <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TNI">Saturday night</TIMEX3>, it’s better to win an ugly game than lose a bad one.

Saturday’s game was definitely both as Cole’s Santa Fe High boys basketball team missed 16 free throws and struggled from the outside while Manzano committed 29 turnovers, each more costly than the last.
