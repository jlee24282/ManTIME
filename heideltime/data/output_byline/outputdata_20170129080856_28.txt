The scheme for walk-in tourist visas for Bangladesh travellers with confirmed tickets to India is being extended to remaining eight Indian Visa Application Centers (IVACs) across the country with effect from <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-02-01">February 1</TIMEX3>. 
 
All Bangladesh travellers who have confirmed tickets (air/bus/rail) can avail the walk-in tourist visa without appointment dates at IVACs in Rajshahi, Rangpur, Sylhet, Chittagong, Khulna, Jessore, Mymensingh and Barisal, according to a press release of the High Commission of India. 
    
Applicants in Dhaka with confirmed journey tickets may continue to submit their tourist visa applications on a walk-in basis at the IVAC in Mirpur. 
 
Bangladesh travellers wishing to avail the walk-in tourist visa should have a confirmed air, train or bus ticket (issued by authorised operators) to India, according to the press release. 
 
The journey date should be within <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P1M">one month</TIMEX3> of the date of submission of the visa application. 
 
This initiative is part of the ongoing efforts to streamline, liberalise and ease the process of securing Indian visas. The walk-in tourist visa scheme was launched first in <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2016-10">October 2016</TIMEX3> for women travellers and their family members and thereafter extended to all Bangladeshi traveilers from <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2017-01-01">January 1</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017">this year</TIMEX3>. The scheme has eased access to Indian visas for Bangladesh nationals. 
 
This measure is aimed at strengthening people-to-people contacts between India and Bangladesh.
