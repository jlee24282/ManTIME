MALIBU, Calif. – It was essentially a replay of the first Gonzaga-Pepperdine game and pretty much a replay of the WCC season thus far for the Zags. No. 3 Gonzaga dominated from tip to buzzer, crushing Pepperdine 96-49 in front of 3,104 <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> at Firestone Fieldhouse. 
 
Gonzaga put together one of its best efforts of the season in its last chance to impress voters before the polls come out on <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-23">Monday</TIMEX3>. No. 1 Villanova and No. 2 Kansas lost <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-W04" mod="START">earlier this week</TIMEX3> but the Jayhawks responded with a road win over Kentucky. Villanova entertains Virginia on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3>. 
 
“We can control what we can control, our effort during games,” said center Przemek Karnowski, who had 16 points on 8-of-11 shooting. “People are there to take care of the polls, the seeding. It’s not our job to do that. 
 
“So far every obstacle we’ve had this season we’ve met it. We’re 22-0 and we have to keep it rolling.” 
 
The Zags (22-0, 10-0 WCC) matched the <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3> team for the longest winning streak in program history. GU’s closest outcome in conference so far was a 95-80 win over San Francisco . 
 
Gonzaga has made steady improvement since <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2016-11">November</TIMEX3>. 
 
“I think we’re being more patient,” Karnowski said. “We take really good care of the ball, our turnovers are low, guards and bigs. Our team defense improves week by week.” 
 
Gonzaga picked up where it left off against the Waves in Spokane, when the Zags outscored Pepperdine 48-25 in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2016-H2">the second half</TIMEX3> of a 92-62 victory in <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2016-12" mod="END">late December</TIMEX3> . 
 
The Zags bolted in front 27-8. Silas Melson, who finished with 15 points, hit a putback to make it 43-21 at halftime. Pepperdine (6-16, 2-8) was within 18 early in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2016-H2">the second half</TIMEX3> but the Zags hit the throttle again. Melson’s 3-pointer put Gonzaga up by 46 with <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="PT6M">6 minutes</TIMEX3> left. 
 
“I thought we were good for the full 40,” coach Mark Few said. 
 
Nigel Williams-Goss added 12 points, eight rebounds and six assists.
