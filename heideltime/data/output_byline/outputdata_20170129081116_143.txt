Ajax Cape Town head coach Stanley Menzo admits he is delighted to have Sameehg Doutie available to him for the rest of the season.

The former Urban Warriors academy product <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-W04">this week</TIMEX3> following his heroics with Atlético de Kolkata, where he helped them lift the Indian Super League title.

And, with Ajax set to resume their Premiership campaign against title hopefuls Bidvest Wits on <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-02-07">February 7</TIMEX3>, Menzo admits Doutie's signing is a timely boost.

“I think he is a good player, a typical Ajax player, Ajax winger – he knows the system, he knows the club,” Menzo told the official Ajax Cape Town website. “He has a lot of quality, I think it is a very good signing.

“Also again, it is some recognition for the fans, he is a real Ajax player, he was here in the academy so it is up to him <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> to showcase those qualities.

“I think with Doutie, he is more a ‘fine’ attacking player; great in playing between the lines, giving through balls, through passes. He has a good cross, good at set-pieces. He can read the game and that is important, especially up front.”

Dottie made his unofficial return to the field for Ajax on <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>, coming on as a <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2016-H2">second-half</TIMEX3> substitute in the 2-0 win over Cape Town All Stars.
