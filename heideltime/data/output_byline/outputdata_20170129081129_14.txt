Quartz Master is a quartz surfaces manufacturer, headquartered in Bayonne, New Jersey. The company produces the highest quality and largest quartz slabs in the industry. It distributes through many select locations in US and Montreal, Quebec, Canada. And is <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> expanding in California. 
 
The demand for Quartz Master’s Marble Collection prompted the company to open its first distribution center in California. In <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2016-06">June 2016</TIMEX3>, Quartz Master opened its new 6500 square foot warehouse in Los Angeles to serve Los Angeles County. But within <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="PXM">a couple of months</TIMEX3>, the distribution center was making deliveries to fabricators from as far south as San Diego to as far north as San Francisco. 
 
When it opened, the warehouse was stocked with a modest number of slabs, but within weeks it had to be restocked to meet demands. It <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> has millions in inventory. On <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2017-01-02">January 2nd</TIMEX3>, they opened an office in San Diego, and on <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2016-02-01">February 1st</TIMEX3>, an additional warehouse will open in San Francisco on Mariposa Avenue in Mountain View. 
 
Quartz Master is recognized for its Marble Collection. In <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2011">2011</TIMEX3>, after <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">12 months</TIMEX3> of laborious engineering, Quartz Master introduced the world’s first marble design to Quartz. And in <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2014">2014</TIMEX3>, they perfected the art of book matching. <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Today</TIMEX3>, most all of their marble designs are book matched. Homeowners and interior designers appreciate the low maintenance, durability and unmatched stain resistance of quartz. And they love that they can design a kitchen that has the beauty of natural stone without the expense and hassle. 
 
To meet demand and high-quality customer service, Quartz Master will have representatives throughout the state, who will supply showrooms, interior designers, and fabricators with samples and customer service.
