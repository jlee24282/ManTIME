Rugby – 6 Nations <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3>   
The <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> RBS 6 Nations will kick off on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-02-04">Saturday February 4</TIMEX3> with the games between Scotland and Ireland at Murrayfield and England taking on France at Twickenham. 
 
The tournament is set to conclude on <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2016-03-18">March 18</TIMEX3> and England will bid to not only defend their title but also maintain their winning run which <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> stands at 14 matches. 
 
Eddie Jones’ side are <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> just four wins short of New Zealand’s world record for consecutive victories and a second successive Grand Slam in the <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="FUTURE_REF">coming months</TIMEX3> would see them break that mark with 19. 
 
However, Ireland are hot on the heels of England in the betting to reclaim the trophy they last won in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3> while Wales, France and Scotland will also harbour aspirations to halt the Red Rose charge. Italy, as ever, are the tournament outsiders. 
 
In the <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3> tournament, England completed a first Six Nations Grand Slam since <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2003">2003</TIMEX3> by beating France 31-21 in Paris. 
 
In Eddie Jones’ first campaign as head coach, the Red Rose bounced back from their World Cup failure under Stuart Lancaster in the best way possible by ending a run of four successive runners-up placings in the tournament by claiming victories over Scotland, Italy, Ireland, Wales and finally France to achieve a clean sweep. 
 
Wales ended up runners-up this time, with defending champions Ireland having to settle for third place ahead of Scotland. Italy took the wooden spoon. 
 
The RBS 6 Nations title launched Jones’ regime with Twickenham’s first silverware for <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DURATION" value="P5Y">five years</TIMEX3> and by <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2016" mod="END">the end of 2016</TIMEX3> the Australian had presided over a sequence of 13 successive Test victories. 
 
England are <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> second in the global rankings and the next stage on their mission to supplant New Zealand at the pinnacle of the sport is to rid themselves of any conservatism against their European rivals. 
 
“You don’t defend a Grand Slam, you’ve got to win it again and that’s why we’ve got to be absolutely daring going into the Six Nations,” Jones said. 
 
“It’s a big part of how we want to develop our game because we want to be a side that has the courage to play our sort of rugby from the very first game of the tournament. 
 
“For the first couple of games <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3> we were quite reticent to play any rugby. We got better against Ireland and Wales and then went back into our shell against France. 
 
“That’s the challenge ahead. We’ve got a short period of time to change mindsets but I think we can do that.” 
 
This year’s Six Nations will also see the introduction of a bonus-point system – details of which as follows: 
 
Points System (including bonus details) 
 
•FOUR points awarded for a win 
 
•TWO points awarded for a draw 
 
•NO points awarded for a loss 
 
•ONE bonus point awarded for scoring four tries or more 
 
•ONE bonus point awarded if a team loses a match by seven points or less 
 
•THREE bonus points if a team wins all five of their matches 
 
  
 
Therefore a winning team can gain a maximum of five points while a losing team can still earn up to two points. The maximum total number of points a team can win over the tournament is 28 (5×5 plus three Grand Slam bonus points).
