DOVER, Del. (<TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Jan. 28</TIMEX3>) – The FAMU Women’s Basketball team pulled away from host Delaware State in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2016-H2">the second half</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TAF">Saturday afternoon</TIMEX3>, for a 65-56 Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference victory at Memorial Hall. 
For FAMU (5-15, 3-4 MEAC), the win was the team’s second straight, the first time all season they had managed back-to-back victories, and they clinched the win with a <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2016-H2">second half</TIMEX3> scoring surge which built on their slim one-point halftime lead. 
 
Junior Dawn King led FAMU with 13 points, knocking down a trio of three-pointers, while senior Cedrick Sweeting cashed in three triples en route to a 12-point effort. Junior Shakerrya Morrison added nine points and nine rebounds, while junior Alicia McCray pulled down eight rebounds. 
 
Na Jai Pollard led all scorers in the game with 18 points for Delaware State. Pollard added 11 rebounds for a double-double, while Mikah Aldridge added 16 points for the Hornets. 
 
The Rattler Women trailed 22-18 after the first period, but overtook the Hornets (2-18, 1-6 MEAC) with a 17-12 run in the second stanza to cling to a 35-34 lead at the break. 
 
FAMU shot 44 percent (13 of 29) from the floor, knocking down six of 13 three-pointers in the opening frames, while DelState shot 34.5 percent (10-of-29), but hung close by shooting 81 percent (13 of 16) from the foul line. 
 
The Hornets went ice cold in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2016-H2">the second half</TIMEX3>, managing a 19.4 percent (6 of 31) from the floor, as they scored just five points in the third period to 18 for FAMU, which proved to be the clincher for the Rattlers. 
 
Still, State outscored FAMU in the fourth stanza, 17-12, but the 13-point difference in the third was enough for the Rattlers to hold on for the victory.
