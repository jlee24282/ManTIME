BOULDER, Colo. — An early barrage of 3-pointers caught No. 10 Oregon by surprise. What really rattled the Ducks was Colorado’s steady, stifling defense. 
 
“We haven’t played with that kind of passion and energy and effort on defense for <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="PT40M">40 minutes</TIMEX3> all year,” Colorado coach Tad Boyle said after the Buffaloes’ 74-65 <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TNI">Saturday night</TIMEX3> stunner that snapped Oregon’s 17-game winning streak. 
 
“So hopefully we can build on this.” 
 
Derrick White led the Buffaloes (12-10, 2-7 Pac-12) with 23 points, including 17 in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2016-H2">the second half</TIMEX3>. 
 
Payton Pritchard’s 19 points led the Ducks (19-3, 8-1), who were seeking to snap a 0-6 record in Boulder and instead lost for the first time since <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2016-11-21">Nov. 21</TIMEX3>. 
 
The crowd sensed an upset when Buffs hit four consecutive 3s to surge to a 14-5 lead, and the building was abuzz the rest of the night. 
 
“That set the tone for the game,” Oregon coach Dana Altman said. “We were never ready to play and that’s on me. We came out flat and played from behind. I thought their energy level was better. We forced them into some turnovers in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-H1">the first half</TIMEX3>. We only had one in the second.” 
 
The Buffaloes’ defense forced the Ducks to settle for too many jump shots, and Oregon shot just 38 perfect from the field and 32 percent from long range while only getting to the line 16 times. 
 
“Our ball movement was bad,” Altman said. “We took 34 3s out of 57 shots. That’s not us, either. A lot of them were quick and not good. We got off keel there and made some bad decisions. Just fired up way too many of the long shots.” 
 
Pritchard lamented the lack of Oregon’s usual inside-outside game as Chris Boucher and Jordan Bell didn’t get enough chances inside. 
 
“We played a little selfish,” Pritchard said. “All of us. Every one of us. We weren’t moving the ball very well.” 
 
Just when it looked like the Ducks were primed to rise higher in the rankings, this setback could keep the Ducks standing pat for <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> as New Mexico State <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> owns the nation’s longest winning streak, at 18 games.
