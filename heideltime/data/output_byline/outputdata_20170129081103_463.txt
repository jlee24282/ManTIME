My Fellow Americans, 
 
Looking across this beautiful mall, I see memorials to three men who literally made America great. Washington, Jefferson, and Lincoln--along with untold millions of men and women who nurtured and harvested the seeds they planted--deserve our gratitude and our labor in service of their vision. 
 
<TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Today</TIMEX3> is not the celebration of a political victory. Nor is it a celebration of democracy. It would be disingenuous of me not to acknowledge that if <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3> were a celebration of pure democracy, Secretary Clinton would be standing here. And I would be sitting at home. <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Today</TIMEX3> is a statement that our system is not perfect, but it works. It is a celebration of our Republic form of government. While I am a latecomer to championing the Electoral College--and it might sound self-serving that I do--I am glad to have won this election and I am ready to meet the challenges ahead of us. 
 
I am one of the few presidents in U.S. history to inherit an economy stronger than the economy inherited by his predecessor. President Obama, while I do not agree with many of your policies, nor do I share much of your philosophy, I want to say, on behalf of our country, thank you for stewarding our economy back from the brink. You had to play defense. <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> we must play offense. 
 
I've been fortunate in business. A mind for business is the asset that I bring to the Oval Office. But it is also a potential liability. Measuring and managing assets and liabilities is a key part of building and growing a business. So I have to remember going forward that America is a corporation--there is a business component to running the country--but it is not just a corporation. It is also a cause, and that cause is freedom. America is also a community, and that community is diverse and has a multitude of needs. Some of those needs create conflict and require patience and thoughtful solutions. The work ahead of us is both challenging and worthwhile. 
 
We want the corporation of American government to be lean and strong. We want it to thrive with efficiency and effectiveness. But we must be vigilant that the corporation of America serves America's cause of freedom and America's diverse community. It cannot be the other way around. If the price for America's way of doing business is the loss of freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution or the oppression of our community, then the price is too high and the return on investment too low. 
 
As your president, I promise these three questions will be the filter through which we run our policy decisions and the criteria upon which we base our actions: 
 
• Does it protect and serve the community of America and the world in which we live? 
 
• Does it protect and promote the freedoms guaranteed to Americans by our Constitution? 
 
• Does it make sense in both the short term and long term, and will it make our way of governing healthier and more effective? 
 
I would like to promise that I will never let you down. But that would be a hollow and vain promise. I am surely going to let you down from time to time. I ask you to pray for me that when I do fail, I will have the humility to acknowledge it and the courage to correct my mistakes. 
 
At any given time in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P4Y">the next four years</TIMEX3> some Americans will be disappointed by what this government does, while others will be happy. One of my goals in leading this great nation is to not keep disappointing the same group of Americans. No single group should bear the burden of making America great. No small group should hoard all the blessings of America's greatness. 
 
I talked a lot on the campaign trail about radical Islamic terrorism. I want to say something <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> about radical extremist patriotism: We don't need it. Uniformity is not the same thing as unity. We need unity. We do not need uniformity. We need dissenting opinions. We need peaceful protest. The history of our country is not built on the backs of mindless drones serving a dictator. Our shared history is populated with men and women who engaged in debate until the best idea won. Then that idea was put to the test in the real world and celebrated when it worked or taken back to the drawing board when it did not. 
 
I do not call on you to sacrifice your voice to the religion of patriotism. I call on you to be patriotic. Raise your voice when you see injustice. Lend your voice to those who have none. Lift your voice in praise of all that is good and right about our people and our country. 
 
God bless you all, and God bless the United States of America.
