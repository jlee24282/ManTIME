On MLB <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3>, the crew discusses the Los Angeles Dodgers' plans for their <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> starting rotation 

Clayton Kershaw, Rich Hill, Kenta Maeda and Julio Urias are the top four, with the fifth spot up for grabs among Kazmir, McCarthy, Ryu, Wood and young starters Brock Stewart and Ross Stripling. 

Better too many than not enough, as the Dodgers painfully endured <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3>, when the four veterans missed considerable time with injuries. 

Kazmir was signed <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2015">a year ago</TIMEX3> to help replace Zack Greinke, who opted out. Kazmir went 10-6 with a 4.56 ERA in 26 starts and made only one start after <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2016-08-22">Aug. 22</TIMEX3> because of what was described as thoracic inflammation. Kazmir said it turned out his neck and shoulder problems were the result of a chain reaction that began with compensating for inflexible hips with faulty mechanics. 

After pinpointing the problem in the offseason and being treated weekly with acupuncture, cupping and yoga, Kazmir said he's ready to take back his job. 

"I'm <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P3W">three weeks</TIMEX3> ahead of schedule. I want to be at the top of that rotation," said Kazmir, who led the American League in starts and strikeouts in <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2007">2007</TIMEX3>. "The way things went <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3>, I have a chip on my shoulder and I want to prove to the fans and the front office that brought me here that they made the right decision." 

At <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>'s Dodger Stadium FanFest, president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman said Ryu has relayed news that he's healthy after shoulder and elbow operations <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DURATION" value="P2Y">the past two years</TIMEX3>. 

"The reports have been really good," Friedman said. "Came into offseason in a little bit better shape and ready to get after it a little more. We're cautiously optimistic. It's a wait-and-see approach. Obviously, it would be a major boon for us if he's healthy." 

MLB <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3>: Dodgers' pitching The guys on MLB <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> discuss Dodgers' <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> pitchingOn MLB <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3>, the crew discusses the Los Angeles Dodgers' plans for their <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> starting rotation 

McCarthy, whose recovery from Tommy John surgery was complicated by a case of the yips, said he's throwing off a mound at max velocity with no control issues and that he's also ready to reclaim his rotation spot. 

Friedman said Wood is back to starting after returning from in-season elbow surgery <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3> as a reliever. 

"I'm coming in as a starter and that's where I expect to stay," said Wood, who has thrown off a mound twice in <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2017-W03">the past week</TIMEX3>. 

@Dodgers fans this is RIDICULOUS!! What an awesome day!! Tag yourself if you're in the picture!! @kikehndez pic.twitter.com/DRn3rzIKnf

Although Wood pitched in relief successfully, most of the "extra" starters are considered starting pitchers by the Dodgers, not relievers, and shuffling back and forth is not ideal. 

"It's obviously tricky in that once you do it, it just becomes that much harder to build them back up as starters," Friedman said. "We'll have to factor all of that in, and it depends what our bullpen looks like, whether we have injuries or not in <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2017-SP">Spring</TIMEX3> Training. All of that will go into our decisions come Opening Day."

Afghanistan's Defense Ministry says it wants to raise the number of women serving in the Afghan National Army to a level where women comprise 10 percent of the force. 

Defense Ministry spokesman Mohammad Radmanesh said on <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">January 27</TIMEX3> that the government had set several measures, including a special salary scale for female recruits, to encourage more women to join up. 

'At this stage, we have 1,575 Afghan women in our army ranks, it is a mere 3 to 4 percent -- which is nothing,' Radmanesh said. 'We are aiming to raise this percentage to 10 percent.' 

Radmanesh said there <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> were about 400 Afghan women recruits training at Defense Ministry facilities.
