By As an only child who went on vacations frequently with my parents growing up, I understand the primary benefit of families sailing during <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-SP">spring</TIMEX3> break. Classes are out of session, and it's prime time for a school holiday, particularly a weeklong cruise. However, there are some suggestions we'd recommend considering to ensure smooth sailing before and during the season: 
 
Reserve Your Voyage Well in Advance 
 
With so many children off school, <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-SP">spring</TIMEX3> break (like <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-12-25">Christmas</TIMEX3>) is one of the busiest times of the year for family trips, and that means plenty of people will want to book a cruise during the same exact window as you. 
 
Parents of schoolchildren with schedules slightly staggered - <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2018-04-01">Easter</TIMEX3> break versus <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-SP">spring</TIMEX3> break, for instance - from mainstream schedules have a slight edge, but ships will fill up quicker during either period. To make sure you get the cabin choice you want, book early. Doing so even a full year or longer out is not a bad idea. 
 
Budget for Higher Cruise Fares 
 
Regardless of how soon you make a <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-SP">spring</TIMEX3> break booking, it is very likely to be more expensive than those made for the off-season. So, expect higher prices and budget accordingly. Alternatively, keep an eye out for cruise specials during the year that may apply to <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-SP">spring</TIMEX3> sailings to try and save some money at least. In many cases, third and fourth guests in a cabin can sail for reduced rates or completely free. 
 
Expect More Children and Teens 
 
It should go without saying, but your family will not be the only family onboard. <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2017-SP">Spring</TIMEX3>-break cruises see some of the greatest numbers of children and teens of the entire year. That means kids clubs, pools and the buffet will be far more crowded, especially on family-friendly cruise lines such as Carnival Cruise Line, Disney Cruise Line, MSC Cruises, Norwegian Cruise Line, Princess Cruises and Royal Caribbean International. 
 
Book an Alternative Cruise Line 
 
If you're a family with older children or teens less interested in traditional kids facilities at sea, you might do well to consider a different cruise line to find more breathing room away from lots of youngsters. 
 
Even premium, upscale and luxury lines are likely to receive more families during <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2017-SP">spring</TIMEX3> break than usual, but they will be less overrun with children than standard mainstream brands. Celebrity Cruises and Holland America Line still feature kids facilities, for example, and are great for multigenerational travelers as well. 
 
Be Considerate of Passengers Without Kids 
 
Not everyone else onboard for <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2017-SP">spring</TIMEX3> break necessarily has children of their own. While those without kids onboard are sure to expect a fair share of juvenile encounters, they surely will appreciate good behavior from all offspring. So, please be mindful that you are sharing this vacation with strangers who will thank you for keeping your children from screaming and running up and down the halls. A little discipline goes a long way. 
 
Take Advantage of Exclusive Venues 
 
Family members like to sail because of the great travel memories that can be made together, but everyone occasionally enjoys some time to themselves. That's why cruise lines include spaces just for children and just for adults to escape to. 
 
Mom and dad might enjoy a cocktail and entertainment in the evening while their children are having a blast in the kids club. The benefit of a cruise ship is neither group is ever far apart, and a rendezvous back at the cabin afterward is super easy. 
 
Pick Another Time of Year 
 
Ideally, to avoid the need to adhere to any of the tips above, your family might prefer a different time altogether. School holidays in the middle of the year are compressed with little wiggle room for planning. 
 
However, <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2017-SU">summer</TIMEX3> vacation time between school years is a broader period with more options and less density of people during any singular week. As such, this is a better alternative for scheduling a cruise <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION" value="P7D" mod="MORE_THAN">longer than seven days</TIMEX3>, or there's always the option to take shorter weekend getaways during the year with minimal time required off school or work.
