The Mail on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3> believes that Manchester United and Arsenal will battle it out for the signing of Atletico Madrid forward Antoine Griezmann . Arsenal made an approach for the player in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-SU">the summer</TIMEX3>, but will try again at the end of the season. United are believed to be in pole position given their ability to pay higher wages, and his friendship with Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba . Griezmann would cost around £85 million.

Paper Round's view: The Anfield crowd - see Brendan Rodgers and Roy Hodgson - will turn on managers quicker than is generally believed. While Klopp still has Liverpool fans' support, their patience is not to be tested. Klopp urgently needs to fix out the mediocre squad and buy some competent defenders before the end of the transfer window, and get Sadio Mane back as quickly as possible. Otherwise this wobble could turn into a slip down the table.
