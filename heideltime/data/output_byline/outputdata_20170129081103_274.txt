SAN MARCOSâ€” A reward for the return hundreds of endangered salamanders missing for <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DURATION" value="P2M">two months</TIMEX3> from a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service aquatic center in Central Texas has been boosted to $15,000. 
 
Some 253 Texas blind salamanders and 110 San Marcos salamanders vanished <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2016-11-24">Thanksgiving Day</TIMEX3> from the center in San Marcos. The center was closed that day and there's no sign of forced entry. 
 
Texas blind salamanders are pale, 3- to 4-inch amphibians with frilly gills that can regenerate lost limbs. They're believed to live only in roughly 25 square miles of aquifer beneath San Marcos.
