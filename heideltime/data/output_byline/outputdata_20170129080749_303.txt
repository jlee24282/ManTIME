Nearly all of Kim Kardashian-West’s stolen jewellery, taken from her Paris hotel room in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2016-10">October last year</TIMEX3>, have been “melted down”, a robbery suspect has told French authorities. 
 
In a leaked transcript, Aomar Ait Khedache told police his associates had melted down and sold nearly all of the jewellery taken from  Kardashian-West’s hotel room on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2016-10-03">October 3</TIMEX3>, Le Monde reports. 
 
“We made the decision to melt them. One of the people took care of it. He came back with bars….there had to be about 800 grams,” Mr Khedache said. 
 
The suspect reportedly told authorities Kardashian-West’s $A5.82 million diamond ring from rapper Kanye West was still in the possession of an unknown person.

“Everyone was afraid to sell it, because it has an (identifiable) stone” he added.
