SIOUX CITY (KTIV) - 

<TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-W04">This week</TIMEX3> will give us a mid-<TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-WI">winter</TIMEX3> breather after our ice storm <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-W02">two weeks ago</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-WI">the winter</TIMEX3> storm <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-W04" mod="START">earlier this week</TIMEX3>.

A brief warm-up will occur as southerly flow pushes us into <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="194" mod="MID">the mid 40s</TIMEX3> in Sioux City.

Areas with more snow cover will be a little cooler but still warmer than <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="PXD">the past few days</TIMEX3>.

This will be short-lived, however, as northwest flow returns <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="TIME" value="2017-01-30TNI">Monday night</TIMEX3> and returns us to seasonal temperatures with mostly cloudy skies for the rest of the week.

A small chance for some light snow arrives by <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="TIME" value="2017-01-27TNI">Friday night</TIMEX3>.
