Rev. , a long-time Tulsa resident was born <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="1924-07-24">July 24, 1924</TIMEX3>, in Collinsville, OK, to Jesse William & Maud (Jones) Plowman. He passed from this life <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-01-23">January 23, 2017</TIMEX3>, at the age of 92. When he was a baby, his family moved to Tulsa where he attended public schools and graduated from Will Rogers High School. Upon graduation he joined the U.S. Army Air Force, following his older brother to serve in WWII, and was stationed in England. It was during the war that Howard felt called to the ministry. Upon returning from the war he studied at Tulsa University where he met his future wife, Trudy McWilliams. <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2018">One year later</TIMEX3>, when he graduated from TU, they married at St. Paul's Methodist church and moved to Dallas, TX, where he attended Perkins School of Theology and Trudy completed her bachelor's degree at SMU.

When Howard graduated from seminary, he and Trudy began their life together in the United Methodist Church. Early in his career he pastored churches in Kellyville, Colbert, Calera, and Tishomingo. He served as pastor at 8th Street in Oklahoma City, Asbury in Ponca City, East Cross in Bartlesville, Elk City Methodist, New Haven in Tulsa, 1st Methodist in Ardmore, and Chapel Hill in Oklahoma City. He also served in conference leadership positions as conference council director and also district superintendent for the Stillwater and Tulsa districts. For <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="PXY">many years</TIMEX3> he was active in both jurisdictional and general conference sessions of the United Methodist Church. When he retired from the ministry he and Trudy moved back to Tulsa, where they had both grown up, and began the next phase of their life together. In <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="1998">1998</TIMEX3> he ran for the US Congress as the Democratic candidate against incumbent Steve Largent. Howard lost the election but he gained the endorsement of the Tulsa Daily World, something that made him proud. His family was awed by his courage to run for office to try and improve the world. Through that experience he and Trudy made some life-long friends in the Democratic Party. He and Trudy were active in Boston Avenue United Methodist Church, which was a second family for them. They were active in Meals-On-Wheels, Exodus House, Great Decisions, as well as numerous other causes. Howard believed strongly in the importance of interfaith collaboration and was actively involved in Tulsa Metropolitan Ministries, even serving in leadership roles over the years. Howard loved golf, they enjoyed traveling, and were active participants in the lives of their grandchildren, attending countless athletic events, theatre productions, band concerts, confirmations, celebrations, and family activities. They loved their life at Crestwood in the Oklahoma Methodist Manor and the family is deeply indebted to the entire staff at OMM for the care they showed Howard when Trudy died. We especially thank Dr. Arivn Lade and the nursing staff on Cobbs Landing, who cared for Howard with such love in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="PXM">the last few months</TIMEX3>.

Howard is survived by his sister, <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2016-06">June</TIMEX3> Hill of Denver, CO; his three children and their families: daughters, Donde Plowman and her husband, Dennis Duchon of Lincoln, NE, Sandy Plowman Kraus and her husband, Phil of New York City, son, Tom Plowman and his wife, Sarah of Austin, TX; grandchildren, Kevin Ashmos, Chijioke Onuoha, Preston and Spencer Kraus, Katie Thompson and her husband, John, and Zachary Plowman. Howard also leaves behind his <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION" value="P8M">8-month</TIMEX3> old great-granddaughter Gray Isabelle Thompson, his nephews and nieces and their families. Howard was preceded in death by his wife, his grandson, Christopher R. Ashmos, his parents, and his brother, Homer W. Plowman. He was the rock, the constant, the optimistic and encouraging force in all of our lives.
