Arima Mayor Lisa Morris-Julien has called on members of the business community to support activities in the eastern borough.

Speaking against the backdrop of the launch of Arima’s Carnival on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3>, a short distance away from the Velodrome, Morris-Julien said while some of the businessmen in the borough have responded to the calls of the borough corporation, others simply were not forthcoming. 

The mayor singled out president of the Arima Business Association Winston Budhu as well as Daniel Austin and the Naipaul Family, both of Xtra Foods, as businessmen “who have been extremely wonderful” to the corporation. 

The operators of Su Market Place and Jadoo’s also have rallied to the cause. 

Mayors in Arima have long complained about the lack of support from businessmen for activities in the borough. 

Regarding the launch of Arima Carnival, Morris-Julien said this year’s celebration was very low-keyed as the corporation has been attempting to make it a family-oriented event. 

“We cannot compete with Port-of-Spain. 

So, what we are trying to do is have things in place for the children, the adults, something for everyone,” she said. 

<TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017">This year</TIMEX3>, entertainment was provided by the Trinidad and Tobago Fire Services Band, Denise Belfon, Third Base (Adrian Hackshaw), Asten Isaac and Skatie (Carlos James).
