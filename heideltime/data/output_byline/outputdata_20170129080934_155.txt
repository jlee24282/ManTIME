A child has been born in an Iranian hospital after <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P14Y">14 years</TIMEX3> of cryopreservation, the process of preserving an embryo at sub-zero temperatures. 
 
According to Dr. Asadollah Kalantari, a founding member of Isfahan’s Fertility & Infertility Center, on <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>, the child was born in full health, adding that the <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P42Y">42-year</TIMEX3>-mother was also in a suitable medical condition. 
 
He added that this is the first time a child has been born with the use of an embryo frozen for so long with the last such case in Iran being a period of 11.5 years. 
 
“The newborn’s mother experienced two Ectopic pregnancies <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="1992">25 years ago</TIMEX3> that resulted in her inability to get pregnant. In <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2003">2003</TIMEX3>, an embryo was implanted in her womb via in vitro fertilization, or IVF, but the baby did not survive to be born,” he added.      
 
Kalantari also said that there are <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> 100,000 fertilized frozen embryos being kept in the facility in Esfahan.
