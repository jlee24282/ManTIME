BLOOMFIELD -- The Cardinals never trailed as they started a new kind of winning streak. 
 
Bloomfield (8-9) led from the opening jump to the final horn in a 59-43 victory over Brown County, the Cardinals second straight win on a night that also witnessed the crowning of the Homecoming Court and a celebration of the feats of basketball teams from years ending in seven. It marked Bloomfield’s second straight win after losing six straight. 
 
“I’m really proud of our kids,” Bloomfield coach Jaime Hudson said. “They could have easily folded. They kept their heads up. They came to work.”

Senior guard Chris Gilmore nearly had a triple double as he led Bloomfield with 22 points, 13 rebounds, and nine assists. He said he feels fully recovered from a fractured fibia that caused him to miss several games during the losing streak. “We really struggled with Gilmore,” said Brown County coach Chuck Hutchins. Hudson said he had a “phenomenal game.” 
 
“I feel like I’m back 100 percent,” Gilmore said. “I haven’t felt any pain since <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2016-12-25">Christmas</TIMEX3>. I feel pretty great.” 
 
His companions in mayhem against the Eagles defense were Isaac Combs who scored 14 points and Turner Royall who nailed three treys on the baseline as he scored all his 11 points in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2016-Q4">the fourth quarter</TIMEX3>. Combs grabbed nine rebounds as he almost had a double-double. Gilmore said they are the reason he almost got 10 assists.

“You’ve got to give them credit because they hit the shots,” he said. 
 
Hudson said the Cardinals are starting to be more unselfish with the orange sphere. 
 
“I’m very pleased with the (way) we’re sharing the basketball the last two games,” he said.

The Cardinals had a ratio of 12 assists to 12 turnovers, but Hudson said he wasn’t overly worried. 
 
“That’s all right,” he said. “We’re sharing the ball a lot better. Turnovers are going to happen. As last we’re going to the basket and I can handle that.” 
 
Gilmore said Friday’s game, in which Bloomfield humbled North Central 83-19, taught the Cardinals the importance of seeing the floor and moving the ball around. He said Friday’s triumph “really opened our eyes. 
 
“<TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29TNI">Tonight</TIMEX3> it seemed a lot easier to get the guys the ball,” he said. 
 
Hudson praised Bloomfield’s defense for holding the Eagles to 16-48 (33.3 percent) from the field and 43 points for the game. He said the Cardinals almost achieved their goal of limiting the Eagles to only 40 points. Gilmore and Combs also led the Bloomfield defense as they both swiped the ball twice and Gilmore blocked two shots. 
 
Hunter First drilled four treys as he was the only Eagle to hit double figures. 
 
“I was really pleased with our defense,” Hudson said. “The last two games I’ve been really pleased with the way our kids are playing defensively.” 
 
“It was a tough game,” Hutchins said as his club fell to 3-12. “They were able to score around the basket. Inside <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-H1">the first half</TIMEX3> they were able to get inside our zone.” 
 
He said the Eagles missed Josh Cochran, their leading scorer and rebounder, a 6-foot-10 senior who had to go to Florida to attend a family funeral. However, Hutchins said Bloomfield is a much better team than their six-game losing streak would indicate. 
 
“They’ve got a good team,” he said. “They’re a lot better than their record would suggest.” 
 
Gilmore made his presence felt immediately, dishing to Ethan Fitch and Combs for buckets and going up between two defenders for a layup to spur Bloomfield to an 8-0 lead. Isaiah Keefauver buried a trey to put Brown County on the board, but the visitors would score only one more point in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-Q1">the first quarter</TIMEX3>. Luke Vandeventer sank both his three-pointers and Gilmore put up another layup and Bloomfield had a 16-4 lead after one quarter. 
 
A.J. Sipes sank a seven-foot bank shot and an 18-footer to give the Cardinals a 19-9 lead in the second frame. First began popping treys, but the Eagles would never get closer than 24-16. Gilmore answered with a traditional three-point play. 
 
That continued for the rest of the game as Bloomfield answered every Eagle attempt at a run. A trey to open the third and Gilmore converts another antique three-point play and Vandeventer feeds Combs for a bucket. First bangs a trey to cut the margin to 36-26 with 2:56 left in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2018-Q3">the third quarter</TIMEX3> and Gilmore responds with a short jumper, two foul shots, and an assist. First ends the third with a trey to make the score 42-30 and Royal takes possession of the baseline in the fourth, earning praise from Hutchins for going 4-6 from the field. 
 
Bloomfield also posted a romp in the junior varsity game, beating Brown County 53-26 after jumping out to a 17-4 lead. 
 
Scorers were: Luke Oliphant, 17; Graysen Medina and Andrew Shelton, eight; Patrick Beard, seven; Ethan Fitch, five; Dylan Richardson, four; Tythan Turpin and Kyler Hudson, two apiece. 
 
The Cards next play at <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="TIME" value="2017-01-26T19:30">7:30 p.m. Thursday</TIMEX3> when they host North Daviess in their final Southwestern Indiana Athletic Conference game. Hudson said Saturday’s victory will be good preparation for the remainder of the seasoned and the sectional. 
 
“We’re treating this as a nine-game season,” Hudson said of the games after the losing streak. “We have nine games left and he have to win seven to go 9-0.”
