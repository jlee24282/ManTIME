The Eagle Spyder GT takes the classic <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="196">1960s</TIMEX3> Jaguar and improves on every aspect in terms of handling, performance, balance and reliability. ― AFP pic LONDON, <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Jan 29</TIMEX3> ― After <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P8M">eight months</TIMEX3> of hand shaping and forming aluminum and magnesium, the very first Eagle Spyder GT is ready for launch. 
 
Based on the classic Jaguar E-Type, the latest special-edition Eagle, like all cars from the company, takes the classic <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="196">1960s</TIMEX3> Jaguar and improves on every aspect in terms of handling, performance, balance and reliability. 
 
However, usually, the improvements stop there. But with the Spyder GT, the company has also reimagined the outer shell so that visually it's an homage to the lightweight low drag track E-Types of <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="1963">1963</TIMEX3>, but with the added advantage of a soft top, for wind-in-the-hair motoring. 
 
“The Spyder GT represents the very best of what we do here at Eagle and we're thrilled to present it to the world,” said Henry Pearman, Managing Director at Eagle. 
 
The standard E-Type, though universally considered one of the most beautiful cars ever built, will never attain the levels of classic status afforded to its peers such as the Aston Martin DB5. And that's simply because there are so many of them on the roads. Jaguar built thousands upon thousands, and it built them at budget price meaning that even by <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="196">1960s</TIMEX3> standards, though they were cheap to buy they were often less than reliable. 
 
Eagle started out in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="1984">1984</TIMEX3> restoring E-Types. Then it moved to restomodding in as much as it would tune the engine, add better disc brakes and improve elements like cooling. And the company has evolved from there to the point where it can <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> offer keen drivers with £695,000 (about RM3.8 million) to spare an E-Type that is truly rare (the company plans to build fewer than 10), truly reliable and is truly fast, even by <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3>'s standards. 
 
Thanks to that combination of lightweight aluminum and magnesium construction and a reworked Jaguar XK 4.7-litre straight six, the car can go from 0-100km/h in <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="PT5S">5 seconds</TIMEX3>, on to a top speed in excess of 170mph and offers drivers up to 330hp and a five-speed gearbox. 
 
What's more, it's got modern adjustable suspension and a limited slip differential so it will handle and behave like a modern sportscar in race mode (i.e., when traction and stability control are shut off) too. 
 
But best of all, because it started life as a standard E-Type in need of total restoration, the finished hand-built car is completely road legal and owners won't be forced to save it purely for track days. ― AFP-Relaxnews
