Jeremy Glaser:  Welcome to The Week Ahead. 
 
More blue-chip tech firms are due to report. We'll be watching demand for the iPhone 7 from Apple, Amazon's holiday profitability, and Facebook's ad growth. 
 
In pharmaceuticals, Pfizer, Merck, Baxter, and Eli Lilly will be eyed. Other earnings releases include Exxon Mobil, Visa, MasterCard, and UPS. 
 
The Fed concludes its meeting on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-01-25">Wednesday</TIMEX3>, and although another rate hike is not expected, the statement could still provide some hints as to if the central bank is still on track to raise rates several times in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3>. 
 
There's plenty of high-profile data releases, too. <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-01-30">Monday</TIMEX3> will see the release of consumption data along with its embedded inflation gauge, which is closely watched by the Fed. And then on <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017-02-03">Friday</TIMEX3>, <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-01">January</TIMEX3>'s jobs report will reveal if <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> began with the slowing, but steady, growth trend seen <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3>. 
 
Other data includes the Case-Shiller home price index, ISM Index, productivity, and auto sales.
