Within <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> of returning from the child-emperor's court, Theresa <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2016-05">May</TIMEX3> was given a golden opportunity to show how her concern for Great British values would influence Trump's foreign policy. Unfortunately, her response to the blanket on citizens of seven predominantly-Muslim states from entering or passing through America was one of stony-faced silence as she attempted to drum up excitement about a possible armaments deal with another champion of human rights, Turkey's President Erdogan.

Somewhere on the flight back from Ankara clutching her message of triumph in her hand, it appears her handlers realised that her appeasement of Trump wasn't going down too well in Blighty. Even her own true-blue Tories were squirming at reports of long-term British residents were left stranded as they were  banned from flights routed through the US. So, putting on as stern a face as possible, the latest reincarnation of Queen Boadicea decided to express her concerns.

I reckon even Charlie Flanagan at his meekest would come up with a more forceful response. 
 
Jeez, where does this leave brave new Post-Brexit Britain? The junior associate of  the new Gang of Four - Trump's America, Putin's Russia, Netanyahu's Israel and Erdogan's Turkey?
