LINDSAY Hatch could certainly get used to racing on a <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-22">Sunday</TIMEX3> at Clifford Park. 
 
Toowoomba racing had a slight schedule change at <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-W03-WE">the weekend</TIMEX3> when the weekly meeting at Clifford Park was held on <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-22">Sunday</TIMEX3> rather than the usual <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> twilight timeslot. 
 
It will go down as a memorable meeting for Toowoomba trainer Lindsay Hatch as he was at the forefront of the meeting with four winners from the eight races. 
 
Hatch's great day started with a commanding six-length win for Rhyme Nor Rhythm in the Key Sun Zinke Class 2 Handicap (1000m). 
 
The four-year-old gelding went into the race on the back of impressive form and started as a $1.35 favourite before repaying the faith of punters with a strong win, the third of his six-race career. 
 
Hatch was back in the winner's stall in race three when jockey Brad Stewart picked up his second win with the Toowoomba trainer for the meeting on board Helarocity ($1.80fav). 
 
The five-year-old grey proved too strong for We Built This City ($15), winning by two-and-a-half lengths in the Canadian Club Class 3 Handicap over 1300 metres. 
 
The Hatch stable was back in the action the next race as Stewart made it three wins courtesy of a smashing seven-and-a-half length victory to Jadentom in the Jim Beam <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P3Y">Three-Year</TIMEX3>-Old Maiden Plate (1200m). 
 
Jadentom started as $1.60 favourite and proved worthy of that backing with the spacious win over Thumbs Up ($8). 
 
The great run for Hatch didn't stop there though as the trainer combined with jockey Josh Oliver in Captains Way's triumph in the Winning Edge Benchmark 58 Handicap (1850m). 
 
Captains Way ($5) edged out Pink Chaperone ($7) by two lengths, with Ruby Guru ($7) a length further back in third. 
 
Hatch then had a fifth win in his sights as Unseemly started as a $1.70 favourite in the Wellcamp Airports Fillies and Mares Class 1 Handicap (1200m). 
 
Red Chandelier ($5) from Doug Duryea's Beaudesert stable put a stop to that though by posting a three-quarter-length win over Manhattan Muse ($5.50), with Unseemly a further half-length back in third.
