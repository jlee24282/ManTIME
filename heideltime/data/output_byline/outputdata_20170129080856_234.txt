In its centenary year the Ballarat RSL is more confident than ever that it will last the test of time and continue to play a vital role in community relations. In its centenary year the Ballarat RSL is more confident than ever that it will last the test of time and continue to play a vital role in community relations. When the group first formed <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="1917">100 years ago</TIMEX3> it was a place for returned servicemen to meet up and confide in each other. 

<TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> the group plays a vital role connecting returned service men and women and their families with support services and pensions available through the Department of Veteran Affairs.

The branch’s <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> and first female president Alexandra Tascas said reaching a centenary was critical – particularly when many other branches were struggling to survive. 

She said it was a tribute to the willingness of the branch and its members to remain involved in the community and to broaden its direction and focus. 

“The significance (of the celebration) is that for <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P100Y">100 years</TIMEX3> we have been a constant RSL with continued service to the community which is only getting stronger,” Ms Tascas said.

The branch will move from its home of <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P6Y">six years</TIMEX3>, The George, to the Midlands Gold Club in <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017-06">June this year</TIMEX3> once it’s new rooms have been built. 

The unanimous decision was made largely because of an aging population and the golf club’s better parking facilities. 

“The role of the RSL is to look after service men and service women and those that been in the services including the Army, Navy and Airforce,” Ms Tascas said.

But the branch’s role is ever evolving.

It uses funds raised from its Anzac Day and <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2017-11-11">Remembrance Day</TIMEX3> collections tom employ a welfare officer to help returned service people transition back into civilian life. Ms Tascas said it can be difficult to return to society and some veterans suffer Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. 

“The officers can help with pensions and access to services. That’s our main work to make sure we support those that have served,” Ms Tascas said. 

“We have to change, and we are stronger than ever.” 

“But we also do things for the community. For the first time we paid for and support two children from lower socio-economic backgrounds to attend a camp in Portsea.” 

They loved every moment of the camp and the branch hopes to continue to send more children to the camp. 

“We have to engage with the community and it’s really good as they can ask us what we can do for them.”
