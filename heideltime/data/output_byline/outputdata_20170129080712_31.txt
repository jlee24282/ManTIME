A statue of Princess Diana has been commissioned by Prince William and Prince Harry to mark the 20th anniversary of her death. 
 
"The time is right to recognise her positive impact" with a permanent statue in the public gardens at Kensington Palace, the two princes said in a statement. 
 
"Our mother touched so many lives. We hope the statue will help all those who visit Kensington Palace to reflect on her life and her legacy." 
 
Details on the sculptor and design will be announced later, the statement said.
