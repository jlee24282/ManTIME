Afghanistan's Defense Ministry says it wants to raise the number of women serving in the Afghan National Army to a level where women comprise 10 percent of the force. 

Defense Ministry spokesman Mohammad Radmanesh said on <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">January 27</TIMEX3> that the government had set several measures, including a special salary scale for female recruits, to encourage more women to join up. 

'At this stage, we have 1,575 Afghan women in our army ranks, it is a mere 3 to 4 percent -- which is nothing,' Radmanesh said. 'We are aiming to raise this percentage to 10 percent.' 

Radmanesh said there <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> were about 400 Afghan women recruits training at Defense Ministry facilities. 

Women serving in the military is a controversial topic in conservative Afghanistan.
