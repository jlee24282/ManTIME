Mischa Barton is home and opening up about her <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> hospitalization. 

The 31-year-old actress was hospitalized at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles on <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-26">Thursday</TIMEX3>, the morning after she celebrated her birthday with friends -- and says that the erratic behavior she exhibited that day was a result of Ghb, commonly known as the "date rape drug." 

"On the evening of the 25th, I went out with a group of friends to celebrate my birthday. While having drinks, I realized that something was not right as my behavior was becoming erratic and continued to intensify <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="PTXH" mod="MORE_THAN">over the next several hours</TIMEX3>," Barton said in a statement obtained by People. 

"I voluntarily went to get professional help, and I was informed by their staff that I had been given Ghb. After an overnight stay, I am home and doing well. I would like to extend a big thanks of gratitude Â»
