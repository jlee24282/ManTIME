Trump has said individuals who want to aid him in his quest to “Make America Great Again” should focus on the jobs they will be doing to help the American people, not thinking ahead to the future income they could rake in by peddling their influence after serving in government.

“Most of the people standing behind me will not be able to go to work,” Trump joked, referring to an array of White House officials who lined up behind him as he sat at his Oval Office desk. The officials included Vice President Mike Pence, chief of staff Reince Priebus, senior strategist Steve Bannon and counselor Kellyanne Conway. “So you have one last chance to get out.”

Trump said he talked about the ban a lot during the campaign, and “we’re <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> putting it into effect.”

Under an executive order that Trump signed in the presence of the news media, every political appointee joining the executive branch on or after <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-20">Jan. 20</TIMEX3> – the day Trump took office – must agree to the lobbying bans. That includes avoiding, for <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P5Y">five years</TIMEX3> after leaving, lobbying the agency they worked for.

Another provision sets <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P2Y">a two-year period</TIMEX3> during which appointees must avoid working on issues involving former employers or clients. Questions had been raised about how the bans would be enforced. The order says they are “solely enforceable” by the U.S. government “by any legally available means,” including debarment proceedings within any affected executive branch agency, or civil court proceedings.

Former appointees who are found to have violated the ban may also be barred from lobbying their former agency for <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="P5Y" mod="EQUAL_OR_LESS">up to five years</TIMEX3>, on top of <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P5Y">the five-year period</TIMEX3> covered by the pledge, the executive order states.

Trump said the order supersedes one that President Barack Obama signed <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2009-01-21">Jan. 21, 2009</TIMEX3>, that banned anyone from lobbying the government for a period of <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION" value="P2Y">two years</TIMEX3> after leaving. Trump said Obama’s order was “full of loopholes.”
