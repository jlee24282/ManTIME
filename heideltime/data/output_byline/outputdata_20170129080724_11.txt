Australian Test opener Matt Renshaw is seeking the counsel of former great Matthew Hayden for tips on how to conquer spin in India as he embarks on his first Test tour. 
 
One of the revelations of the home <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-SU">summer</TIMEX3> , Renshaw is not allowing himself to be daunted by the prospect of playing on the dust bowls of the subcontinent against the world's No.1 Test nation. 
 
Since recovering from concussion , the youngster has been gearing his game for the examination by spin he will face against Virat Kohli's rampaging team. His preparation has included batting on an "extreme" turner at Cricket Australia's National Cricket Centre in Brisbane which was designed to exaggerate the conditions he will confront in India. 
 
Renshaw is due to fly to Dubai on <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-23">Monday</TIMEX3> for Australia's pre-tour camp but not before consulting fellow Queenslander Hayden, who burst to international prominence in the epic <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2001">2001</TIMEX3> series in India. 
 
Hayden famously mastered the sweep shot after weeks of intense practice with his brother on a specially made dusty pitch in Brisbane. His haul of 549 runs at 109.8 in three matches is the second most by an Australian in India, behind only Kim Hughes, who hit 594 runs from a six-Test series in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="1979">1979</TIMEX3>/80. 
 
While Australia failed to end their drought in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2001">2001</TIMEX3>, Hayden's success on that campaign instilled great confidence in his teammates for the successful <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2004">2004</TIMEX3> mission. 
 
"I got his number off Andy Bichel, so I might give him a call to get a few quick pointers before I head off," Renshaw said. "I'm not as experienced in the sweep shot as him. ["I'll have] a fair bit more practice <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="PXM" mod="MORE_THAN">over the next couple of months</TIMEX3>. 
 
Despite honing his craft on the bouncy Gabba wicket, Renshaw says he is confident against spin, although there are no players in Australia in the class of Indian duo Ravi Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja. 
 
"I'm not too bad against spin in Australia but I've never experienced spin in India, so it's hard to say [how I will go]," Renshaw said. 
 
Under the watch of Queensland coach Phil Jaques, Renshaw has been preparing on a pitch that is offering more spin and bounce than what he will get in India and, in his own words, "didn't go too badly". 
 
"If it's harder there, it can go into a game and it gets a bit easier," Renshaw said. "There's a wicket at the NCC in the indoor nets that turns a lot more, it's a bit less realistic than the Mumbai wickets at AB [Allan Border] Field. It's not the worst thing to practice on." 
 
Renshaw's lack of experience on the subcontinent can be seen as a negative, though the glass half full view is it means he does not bear the scars of previous failures. 
 
"I think it helps that I've not been there. It's a challenge. I like to get up for challenges and to love the contest," he said. 
 
Renshaw said he would not be concerned if asked to field in close again despite suffering concussion after being hit on the helmet at short leg during the Sydney Test. 
 
The injury resulted in him becoming the first player to be withdrawn from a Test under Cricket Australia's stringent concussion rules. 
 
"If I have to do it in India I wouldn't be too mentally scarred from it. I'd be trying to get a couple of catches in there and win a series," Renshaw said. "They [the doctors] just said I need to stop headbutting the ball."
