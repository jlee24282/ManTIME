In that game, Regan Ware scored the opening try thanks to a no-look pass from Koroi. 
 
Argentina struck back with a scrambling try by the posts allowing the Pumas to take a 7-5 half-time lead with the conversion. 
 
New Zealand captain Scott Curry put his team back in front early in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2016-H2">the second half</TIMEX3> with try from a busting run following a quick penalty take. 
 
But Argentina quickly leveled the scores with a try from an overlap down the right-hand flank.

The resulting kick in chase ended in a try in the right corner for Argentina and the victory.
