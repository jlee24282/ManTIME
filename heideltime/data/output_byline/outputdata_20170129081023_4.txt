 ‘Miracle on Ice’ scoreboard coming down  
LAKE PLACID, N.Y. — The scoreboard flashing results during the <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="1980">1980</TIMEX3> U.S. men’s hockey team’s “Miracle on Ice” run to Olympic glory is being replaced. 
 
The 37-year-old board hanging over center ice at the Lake Placid Olympic Center will be removed on <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-02-06">Feb. 6</TIMEX3> to make way for a state-of-the-art video display. 
 
The Olympic Regional Development Authority, which operates Lake Placid’s state-owned sports venues, says South Dakota-based Daktronics designed and built the display used for the <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="1980">1980</TIMEX3> Olympic <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2017-WI">Winter</TIMEX3> Games. It showed the scores when the U.S. beat Russia in the hockey semifinals, then Sweden for the gold medal. 
 
Daktronics will get one of the scoreboard’s four panels, while another will go to the Lake Placid Olympic Museum. Locations for the other two panels haven’t been determined. 
 NHL leaning toward Olympic shutout  
LOS ANGELES — The NHL’s top officials are still leaning against allowing the world’s top hockey players to participate in the Pyeongchang Olympics <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2018">next year</TIMEX3>. 
 
Deputy commissioner Bill Daly acknowledged <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> that the NHL’s Board of Governors doesn’t want to shut down the league to allow its players to participate in South Korea. 
 
Daly says the owners’ minds would have to be changed by something dramatic, but he doesn’t know what that change would be. 
 
The league and the International Ice Hockey Federation have no firm deadline to decide whether NHL players will participate in their sixth consecutive Olympics, but the final decision has already been left for later than in <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2016">previous years</TIMEX3>. 
 The players gathered in Los Angeles for All-Star weekend are unanimously hopeful they’ll be allowed to play.

 Former Cy Young pitcher has throat cancer  
SAN DIEGO — Randy Jones, the San Diego Padres’ first Cy Young Award winner, is fighting throat cancer linked to tobacco use during his baseball career. 
 
Jones told the San Diego Union-Tribune on <TIMEX3 tid="t37" type="DATE" value="2017-01-26">Thursday</TIMEX3> that he has been undergoing radiation and chemotherapy treatments since being diagnosed in <TIMEX3 tid="t36" type="DATE" value="2016-11">November</TIMEX3>. 
 
The 67-year-old former pitcher says the cancer was caught early and hasn’t spread. Jones said doctors told him it’s a result of the chewing tobacco he used as a player. He has smoked cigars throughout his adult life. 
 
Hall of Famer Tony Gwynn, a longtime Padres star and franchise icon, died of salivary gland cancer in <TIMEX3 tid="t40" type="DATE" value="2014">2014</TIMEX3> that he believed was related to using tobacco during his major league career. Jones was drafted by the Padres in <TIMEX3 tid="t41" type="DATE" value="1972">1972</TIMEX3> and became the club’s first pitcher to appear in an All-Star Game in <TIMEX3 tid="t42" type="DATE" value="1975">1975</TIMEX3>. He was an All-Star <TIMEX3 tid="t43" type="DATE" value="1976">the following year</TIMEX3> when he won the NL Cy Young Award.

 Maine high school deploys deaf mascot  
PORTLAND, Maine — Kamron King says his goal as the first deaf mascot at Portland High School is something he won’t always notice: making the crowd louder. 
 
Fifteen-year-old Kamron is a freshman from Saco who started donning a bulldog costume during the fall football season and is <TIMEX3 tid="t44" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> working the sidelines at basketball games. 
 
Kamron says being deaf doesn’t interfere with performing, other than occasionally needing someone to direct him toward young children in need of a high-five. The costume’s heavy mask obscures his vision. Kamron’s parents say it’s a natural fit for a kid who loves sports and costumes.
