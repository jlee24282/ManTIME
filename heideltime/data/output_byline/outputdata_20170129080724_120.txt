By PORTSMOUTH — Assistant Mayor Jim Splaine believes the long-closed Jones Avenue landfill could be leaching contaminants into Sagamore Creek. 
 
During a visit to the city-owned recreation land that’s hidden at the end of Jones Avenue and contains the capped landfill, Splaine said he worries chemicals could be coming out of the sides or edges of the landfill. 
 
“There may be some bad stuff, icky goo, going into the Sagamore Creek,” Splaine said <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3> as he stood at the edge of the creek and looked up at the fenced-in landfill. “The Sagamore Creek goes into our watershed, all the way down to where the Bratskellar is, the Toyota garage is, over to the Portsmouth campus, all of that area off of Lafayette Road. This is a big area.” 
 
Splaine wants the City Council to be proactive and address the problem “before we get too far behind.” 
 
“The stuff coming out of the bottom of the Jones Avenue landfill is going somewhere, it’s got to go here because this is where it naturally would flow,” Splaine said as he stood next to the creek. “In <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="P50Y">50 years</TIMEX3>, <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P30Y">30 years</TIMEX3> as the sea level rises, it’s going to start eroding even more of the Jones Avenue landfill, and when you look at the Jones Avenue landfill you see on the edges, on the sides, there’s no capping at all.” 
 
Splaine believes one way to address what he sees as a problem at the landfill is building some kind of berm that would start underground and serve as a barrier between the landfill and creek. 
 
“When you talk about landfills, landfill caps are stupid technology, but it’s the only technology short of picking it up and moving it,” Splaine said. “You can’t just dig it all up.” 
 
But landfill caps, Splaine contends, are essentially delaying the decay of the garbage and incinerator ash that was dumped in the landfill over the years. 
 
“It’s probably not decaying very much," he said. "That is why what’s on the edge is so important to control." 
 
Splaine recalls going to the dump as a child and throwing paint cans into the landfill with his father. 
 
“There were no restrictions,” he said. 
 
Splaine previously opposed the expansion of the recreation uses outside of the 10-acre landfill on what is 50 acres owned by the city, which includes cross country trails where Portsmouth High School athletes sometimes train. But he stressed he <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> realizes those efforts are going forward. 
 
“That’s going to happen,” Splaine said. “I just want us to address the landfill.” 
 
Roger Pittroff, who lives at the end of Jones Avenue, shares Splaine’s concerns and pointed out several old tires that seemed to be buried in the ground outside of the landfill. 
 
“You’ve got contaminants down here," Pittroff said. "You need to clean it up." 
 
Both men pointed to metal debris at the edge of Sagamore Creek, which they believe is leaching into the creek. That debris is referenced by city consultants Hoyle, Tanner Associates, which recommends the landfill site be cleaned up. But the <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2007">2007</TIMEX3> report also says the site is “secure, stable and well vegetated.” 
 
During a phone interview <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2017-W04">this week</TIMEX3>, City Attorney Robert Sullivan and the city's environmental planner Peter Britz, said the city received a groundwater management zone permit from the N.H. Department of Environmental Services for the landfill and annual groundwater tests are done. 
 
“I think things are pretty well controlled there,” Britz said <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2017-W04">this week</TIMEX3>. 
 
In addition to groundwater testing, there are three surface water sampling locations “along the Sagamore Creek,” Britz said. 
 
Tests have been done for 1,4-dioxane, a carcinogen, since <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2013">2013</TIMEX3>, Britz said, but there have been no detections. 
 
Incinerator ash that was dumped there from Pease Air Force Base is enclosed in what Britz described as a “big baggie, essentially a liner under and over the ash.” 
 
“The rest of the landfill has a clay cap, which is typically of landfills from that time,” Britz said. 
 
Sullivan said the landfill operated in two different eras, first as a municipal refuse site in <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="195">the 1950s</TIMEX3> and then it received ash “from the refuse to energy facility that was located at Pease,” in <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="198">the 1980s</TIMEX3>. 
 
“Municipal refuse was burned at the site and kept there in <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="195">the 1950s</TIMEX3> using a so-called tepee, which was a primitive form of incinerator,” Sullivan said. “It was a very large corrugated metal burning facility shaped like a tepee.” 
 
Testing for PFCs, which closed the city’s Haven well at Pease International Tradeport, and have become a major concern at the Coakley landfill in North Hampton and Greenland, have not yet been done at the Jones Avenue landfill, Sullivan said. 
 
City Councilor Josh Denton stressed during an interview that there’s “no need for alarm” about any issues at the landfill. But he too worries about the side of the landfill near Sagamore Creek and thinks more testing, including testing for PFCs, would be appropriate in the future. 
 
“As a layman, yes, I think it should be done given what’s in there,” Denton said. 
 
Near the end of a <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> tour around the landfill, Splaine said the Jones Avenue location was likely chosen for a landfill site because “it was out of the way and Jones Avenue was very loosely developed.” 
 
“The question is how come we didn’t start using this for recreation back in <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="193">the 1930s</TIMEX3>,” Splaine said. “It’s a beautiful site.”
