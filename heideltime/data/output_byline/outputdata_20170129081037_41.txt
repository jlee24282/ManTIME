A Chinese court <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-23">Monday</TIMEX3> sentenced a former top official to life in prison for corruption involving millions of dollars, the latest high-profile conviction in President Xi Jinping's crackdown on graft. 
 
Su Rong, 66, was a vice chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), a discussion body that is part of the Communist Party-controlled government structure. 
 
He was found guilty of bribery, abuse of power and possessing "huge amounts" of assets whose origins he could not explain, said a statement on the verified social media site of the court in Jinan city, capital of the eastern province of Shandong. 
 
Graft has become endemic in China and Xi launched a much-publicised drive against corruption after coming to power in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2012">2012</TIMEX3>, vowing to target both high-level "tigers" and low-ranking "flies". 
 
Su was "one of the graft 'tigers'", the official Xinhua news agency said in announcing his expulsion from the Communist Party <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2016-02">last February</TIMEX3>. 
 
But analysts say China has failed to implement institutional safeguards against corruption, such as an independent judiciary and free media, leaving anti-graft campaigns subject to political influence. 
 
Su accepted 116 million yuan ($16.9 million) in bribes between <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2002">2002</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2014">2014</TIMEX3> and possessed more than 80 million additional yuan of unknown provenance, the court statement said. 
 
In addition to receiving a life sentence, he was also deprived of his political rights for life and gave up all his personal assets. 
 
Su accepted the verdict and would not appeal, it said. 
 
Previous reports in Chinese media have connected Su to corrupt land deals in Jiangxi province during his time as party secretary there. 
 
Previously, he also served as Communist Party secretary of Qinghai and Gansu provinces. 
 
He was a vice chairman of the CPPCC for <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P2Y" mod="LESS_THAN">less than two years</TIMEX3>. While the post carries political prestige, it is largely a ceremonial job tasked with advising China's rubber-stamp parliament. 
 
China investigates ex-mayor of Tianjin for bribery 
Beijing (AFP) <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2017-01-22">Jan 22, 2017</TIMEX3> - An official who was mayor of a northern Chinese city when a massive chemical explosion killed at least 165 people is under investigation for bribery, the country's top prosecuting authority said <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3>. 
 
Huang Xingguo, 62, headed the response committee after the explosion rocked Tianjin in <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2015-08">August 2015</TIMEX3>, devastating a huge swathe of the port city. 
 
He was also acting party chief of the municipality at the time. 
 
In a brief statement posted <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3> by the Supreme People's Procuratorate, the country's top prosecuting office, it said it was investigating Huang "on suspicion of taking bribes" and had taken "coercive measures". 
 
Such measures may include residential surveillance, summons by force, and detention, according to the official Xinhua news agency. 
 
The statement did not mention the Tianjin disaster, China's highest-profile industrial accident in years. 
 
In <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2016-11">November</TIMEX3> Chinese courts jailed almost 50 company managers and government officials over the deadly blasts for charges ranging from illegal storage of materials to abuse of power. 
 
A government report found that officials had routinely ignored or violated laws and regulations on chemical storage. 
 
Fears of toxic pollution were rife following the explosion, with cyanide levels in the disaster zone far above national limits.
