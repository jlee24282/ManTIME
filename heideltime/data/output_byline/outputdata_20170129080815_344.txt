Santa Cruz >> The NBA D-League season is a little more than halfway finished and that means it’s time for the Santa Cruz Warriors to start thinking playoffs. Coming into Saturday’s game against the Rio Grande Valley Vipers both teams are fighting for the fourth and final spot in the Western Conference. 
 
Luckily for the Warriors, they walked off the court clinging on to a small lead in the playoff push after they defeated the Vipers 123-115 in front of a full house on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TNI">Saturday night</TIMEX3> at Kaiser Permanente Arena. 
 
The Warriors — who shot franchise single-game record 60.6 percent on 3-point shot attempts <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="TIME" value="2017-01-27TNI">Friday night</TIMEX3> — saw guard Scott Wood set a career mark after he shot 50 percent (10 of 20) on long-range shots. He finished with a game-high 32 points. 
 
“He’s great” Warriors coach Casey Hill said. “Anytime he gets open that many times, he’s capable of doing that.” 
 
Hill said he was actually surprised that Wood didn’t make more 3-point shots. 
 
“He is one of the best shooters I’ve ever coached,” Hill said. “He’s confident, without being cocky, when it comes to his shooting, which allows his teammates to basically really grasp on to that.” 
 
The Warriors, who are in second place in the Pacific Division behind Los Angeles, gained some ground with the win. They sit just five games behind the D-Fenders. 
 
It was the first set of back-to-back games for Santa Cruz (16-12) since <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-01" mod="START">the beginning of January</TIMEX3> when they played against Austin and Rio Grande Valley. It was also the last time the Warriors faced the Vipers when they lost in a shootout, 155-148, in Hidalgo, Texas. 
 
Santa Cruz <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> leads the season series against the Vipers 2-1. 
 
The Vipers started the game with a 10-2 run led behind center Chinanu Onuaku’s five points. Wood hit back-to-back 3-pointer to make it 13-8. 
 
The Vipers’ JP Tokoto was fouled hard by Warriors guard Alex Hamilton but managed to make a spectacular shot under the hoop with a little <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="PT2M" mod="MORE_THAN">more than two minutes</TIMEX3> to go in <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017-Q1">the first quarter</TIMEX3>. The three-point play extended RGV’s lead to 28-19. 
 
Rio Grande Valley forced the Warriors to turn the ball over seven times in <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2017-Q1">the first quarter</TIMEX3> and at one point had a 14-point lead. Hamilton led the Warriors with eight points in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2017-Q1">the first quarter</TIMEX3>, including a buzzer beating layup. Still, the Vipers had a 34-23 lead. 
 
 
Wood started to heat up in <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2018-Q2">the second quarter</TIMEX3> after he knocked in his third 3-point shot with a little <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION" value="PT9M" mod="LESS_THAN">less than nine minutes</TIMEX3> to go on the game clock but the Warriors never seemed to get close enough to tie or take the lead. 
 
Wood added three more 3-pointers to give him 18 points at the half and the Warriors trailed by just three, 61-58. 
 
Wood continued to shine and gave Santa Cruz its first lead of the game, 70-67, after his first 3-point bucket of <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2016-H2">the second half</TIMEX3> with <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DURATION" value="PT8M">eight minutes</TIMEX3> left in <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2016-Q3">the third quarter</TIMEX3>. Wood put in two more 3-pointers to extend the Warriors lead to 11 points at 82-71. 
 
The Warriors started <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2016-Q4">the fourth quarter</TIMEX3> with an 18-point lead but things got a little interesting in the final <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DURATION" value="PT2M">two minutes</TIMEX3> of the game after RGV pulled to within four points, 117-113. But the Vipers couldn’t complete the comeback. 
 
“Under a 100 points,” Hill said about trying to hold RGV under a specific amount of points. “I don’t care what your philosophy is or how you play, I want to hold teams to under a 100.” 
 
Hill said it was doable, especially after allowing the Vipers to score just 17 points in <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2018-Q3">the third quarter</TIMEX3>. 
 
“Kudos to them for not giving up,” Hill said. 
 
RGV guard Darius Morris nearly finished with triple-double as he scored a team-high 24 points to go along with nine assists and nine rebounds. Not far behind was Tokoto, who finished with 22 points and Onuaku had 17 points. 
 
The Vipers, who are in third place in the Southwest Division, fall to 17-13. 
 
Warriors guard Phil Pressey on the other hand recorded a triple-double as he finished with 15 points, 13 assists and 14 rebounds. A total of six different players finished with double-digits stats in points: Hamilton (20), Dennis Clifford (18), James Southerland (11) and LaDontae Henton (10). 
 
“It was a typical RGV game,” Hill said. “Just trying to make sure that these guys (Warriors) stayed focused on the right things. ... It was stressful but I love coaching those types of games, I love them.”
