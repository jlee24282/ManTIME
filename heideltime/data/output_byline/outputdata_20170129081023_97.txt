A 55-year-old man was killed <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TAF">Saturday afternoon</TIMEX3> when his car crashed off Highway 101 and burst into flames in Paso Robles, according to the California Highway Patrol . 

The man, who has not been identified, was driving a Shelby Mustang south on Highway 101 <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28T13:00" mod="APPROX">about 1 p.m.</TIMEX3> when his vehicle crashed off the road near the Highway 46 West off-ramp, a CHP news release stated. 

The vehicle rolled several times down an embankment as it caught fire, becoming “fully engulfed” by the time it came to a stop on its wheels, the CHP said. 

Witnesses attempted to remove the driver from the car, but the fire’s intense heat and the driver’s four-point harness prevented the rescue, the CHP said. 

The driver was pronounced dead at the scene. 

As of <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TEV">Saturday evening</TIMEX3>, the CHP said it had not determined how fast the vehicle was traveling, and an investigation was in progress.
