There was some that thought that maybe, just maybe, former UFC heavyweight champion Andrei Arlovski would pose a serious threat to rising contender Francis Ngannou or at least give him a tough test. As it turned out, Ngannou is better than expected and Arlovski has been tumbling down the wrong side of the hill for a while. Just as their duel was getting warm, Arlovski missed a wild overhand right, only to get clipped by a loopy left hook and a right uppercut. The second punch floored the Belarusian, allowing the France resident to pound away with punches from on top while Arlovski turtle up. The end came just <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="PT92S">92 seconds</TIMEX3> into the fight.
