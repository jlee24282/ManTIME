Cambier Park was full <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> for Empty Bowls Naples. 
 
At the Harry Chapin Food Bank fundraiser, participants paid $20 for a keepsake bowl and then sampled soups from 50 local restaurants. 
 
After the crowd went through 3,300 handmade bowls that had been fired and painted throughout the year, event organizers had to dig up 300 more bowls. Then, they ran out of bowls altogether. 
 
Soup lovers thronged to the park, at the edge of the Fifth Avenue South shopping district, giving the tree-shaded area in front of the bandstand the look of a rock concert — except everyone was sipping soup, comparing soups and considering which soup to try next. 
 
People lined up for blocks, hours before Empty Bowls opened at <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28T11:00">11 a.m.</TIMEX3>, to be among the first to choose their bowls and their soups. 
 
After first tastings, long lines formed in front of the kettles of the most popular soups, and volunteers kept busy dishing them up. 
 
Just after noon, Texas Tony’s three-meat chili was the first to run out. 
 
Jan Maria Jagush, a <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2017-WI">winter</TIMEX3> resident from Connecticut, was next in line when highly rated roasted artichoke soup from Talis Park was the next to go, but she took it in stride. 
 
“This is a great event," she said. "I’m all in favor of organizations that give it all back, that use all of the proceeds to help people.” 
 
With 100 percent of the soups donated and labor provided by volunteers, all the money raised goes to help the work of the Harry Chapin Food Bank, the largest hunger relief organization in Southwest Florida. The food bank feeds 28,000 people <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="SET" value="P1W" quant="EACH">each week</TIMEX3>. 
 
Empty Bowls co-chairwoman Betsy Dawson said the food bank uses its connections and purchasing power to leverage every dollar raised into $8 worth of food. <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2016">Last year</TIMEX3>, the event raised $97,000, and Dawson said she was confident the goal of $100,000 <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2017">this year</TIMEX3> would be surpassed. 
 
There were 50 varieties of soup. 
 
All of the French bread was donated and served by Panera Bread, which baked 400 baguettes, enough to make 4,600 chunks of bread, to help participants sop up every bit of soup. 
 
Local artists, including Muffy Clark Gill, made one-of-a-kind ceramics that were sold in a silent auction, bringing in additional thousands of dollars. 
 
“Friends of Empty Bowls” wore miniature ceramic tasting bowls around their necks, and a volunteer crew that included many area high school students worked hard to keep everything running smoothly. 
 
Volunteer Ron Kezeske of the Naples Jaycees even showed up with a laser thermometer and stopped volunteers about to serve from one refilled kettle. 
 
“It’s 130 degrees, but it needs to be 135,” he said. 
 
In front of the stage, a dozen potters threw new bowls on the wheel, getting a start on next year’s bowls. 
 
One of the potters, Danny Ripka, has been making bowls for the event for <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DURATION" value="P9Y">nine years</TIMEX3>. Ripka said he still gets a thrill when someone comes by eating soup out of one of his creations. 
 
The restaurants furnished their soups in disposable paper bowls, so each soup could be tasted on its own.

But the souvenir ceramic bowls are reminders that thousands of people in Southwest Florida, many of them children, go to sleep every night without enough food, organizers said.
