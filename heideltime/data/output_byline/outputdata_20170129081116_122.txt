WASHINGTON - U.S. businesses ramped up their investment in industrial machinery, semiconductors and other big-ticket items <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2016-12">last month</TIMEX3>, boosting demand for factory goods. 
 
A measure that tracks business spending plans climbed 0.8 percent in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2016-12">December</TIMEX3>, after jumping 1.5 percent <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2016-12">the previous month</TIMEX3>, the Commerce Department said <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3>. 
 
Orders for all durable goods, which are meant to last <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P3Y" mod="MORE_THAN">longer than three years</TIMEX3>, slipped 0.4 percent, mostly because of a sharp fall in demand for defense aircraft, a volatile category. Excluding transportation-related goods, orders rose 0.5 percent, the sixth straight increase. 
 
The report adds to <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> evidence that manufacturers are climbing out of a roughly <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="P2Y">two-year</TIMEX3> rut. A strong U.S. dollar and falling oil and gas prices had sliced demand for factory products, as drillers ordered less steel pipe and other equipment. Yet demand has risen since oil prices have stabilized. 
 
Orders for industrial machinery rose 0.4 percent <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2016-12">last month</TIMEX3>, while demand for computers, semiconductors and electronic goods jumped 2.4 percent. Orders for autos climbed 2 percent, a sign automakers expect additional sales growth. 
 
Other measures of the U.S. manufacturing sector have also improved. A private survey <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2017-01" mod="START">earlier this month</TIMEX3> found that manufacturing activity in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2016-12">December</TIMEX3> rose to its highest level in <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="P2Y">two years</TIMEX3>, led higher by strong increases in new orders and production. 
 
And manufacturing output rose 0.2 percent in <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2016-12">December</TIMEX3>, according to a report from the Federal Reserve. Auto sales reached a record level in <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3>, and automakers continued cranking out vehicles through the end of the year. 
 
Still, manufacturing has not yet fully rebounded. Manufacturing output rose just 0.2 percent in all of <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3>, according to the Fed. 
 
And business investment in long-lasting goods fell 3.4 percent <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3>, despite the gains of <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DURATION" value="P3M">the past three months</TIMEX3>.
