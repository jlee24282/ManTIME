LAS CRUCES — The New Mexico Department of Agriculture recognizes that a small number of residential pecan trees are being affected by pecan weevils in four eastern New Mexico cities. 
 
Pecan weevil is a significant insect pest of pecan and is not recognized as being established in New Mexico commercial orchards. 
 
New Mexico Department of Agriculture and New Mexico State University’s Cooperative Extension Service recognize the economic importance of the pecan industry to the region and the negative impact that pecan weevil will have on the industry. <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P10Y" mod="MORE_THAN">Over the past 10 years</TIMEX3>, both organizations have cooperated on annual surveys and outreach programs as part of an early detection and eradication approach to prevent pecan weevil establishment in the western region. 
 
<TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">Recently</TIMEX3> pecan weevil has been identified in one residential tree in Clovis and one residential tree in Roswell. Additional pecan trees were identified with pecan weevil in Artesia and Hobbs. 
 
As a result of the <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> pecan weevil findings, the New Mexico Department of Agriculture has implemented a <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DURATION" value="P60D">sixty day</TIMEX3> quarantine effective <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">January 27</TIMEX3>. To limit the spread of pecan weevil from infested residential trees to commercial orchards, movement of pecans produced within the city limits of Clovis, Roswell, Hobbs, and Artesia are restricted. This restriction requires a certificate from the New Mexico Department of Agriculture stating specific pecans meet one or more of the following requirements: 
 
• Pecans that are sold, traded or gifted in a manner that meet the phytosanitary requirements of the receiving location and are transported in a department approved manner; 
 
• Pecans treated at 0 degrees for 168 continuous hours, or other department-approved treatment methods; 
 
• The inspection of a pecan sample in which no pecans exhibit signs of the pecan weevil or exhibit the presence of the weevil; and/or, 
 
• Pecans originating in the quarantined area but believed, by the department not to have the presence of the pecan weevil. 
 
Specifics regarding the certification of pecan nuts can be found within the quarantine rule at http://nmdaportal.nmsu.edu/nmda/laws-regulations/ . Information is also available at the affected area’s County Cooperative Extension Offices. 
 
Residential and commercial pecan tree owners should be on the lookout for pecans with round, BB-sized holes in the shells, or legless, white grubs inside the pecan nut. If you suspect you have pecan weevil in your residential pecan trees, contact your local County Cooperative Extension Office.
