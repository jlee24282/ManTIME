Crouse flying high. When Jody Crouse took the mat at 220 pounds for Becahi <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TNI">Saturday night</TIMEX3> at Easton Area Middle School, the Golden Hawks trailed 20-19 and appeared to be in some trouble against a surging Nazareth squad. When the Becahi senior left the mat after pinning Tucker Klump in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="PT3M">3 minutes</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="PT1S">1 second</TIMEX3>, Becahi all the momentum and was launched on a five-bout winning streak to end the EPC championship final. That may have happened because Crouse entered with his own momentum. “I think (beating Dillon Ryan of Wyoming Seminary) <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2017-01-26">Thursday</TIMEX3> was the best win of my career,” said Crouse, who won 5-3 in overtime at 195 pounds. “He placed seventh at the Ironman and he was really strong. That gave me a huge confidence boost.” Even with that motivation, Crouse said Klump offered a real challenge. “I was frustrated that he kept slipping off my double,” he said. “Klump is a tough kid.”

Energy levels high for Becahi. In the same gym <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3> for FLO’s ‘Who’s No. 1’ Duals, the Golden Hawks had often seemed lethargic and diffident on their bench, making little noise and less impact. Not so <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>. “We didn’t have the team energy we needed,” Crouse said. “<TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29TNI">Tonight</TIMEX3>, everyone was up cheering for their teammates. Every one has a lot more energy.” It showed. 

Bravo EPC! That gasp you just heard was conference officials fainting from reading those words in this space. It’s true we have been heavily critical of the way the way the EPC runs wrestling, but there was nothing to complain about <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>. Quite the contrary. Separating the championship match from third and fifth place spotlighted the deserving teams in the final in a terrific atmosphere; it’s a change EPC officials should be proud of. It also allowed the marvelous Liberty-Northampton third-place match, perhaps the best dual we have seen all season (won by the Konkrete Kids 34-32) to receive the attention it well deserved. The $6 admission was reasonable and fair and Easton did its usual bang-up job of hosting. Kudos all round.

Good news for Nazareth … at some point. Asked if freshman lower-weight sensation Andrew Cerniglia might be back in the lineup sometime “soon”, Nazareth coach Dave Crowell smiled and said. “There’s a good chance of that happening,” he said. Crowell declined to be more specific as to when, but whenever it happens it’s a major boost for the Blue Eagles. Cerniglia, remember, won the Beast of the East pinner award (no small feat) before he broke his collarbone, and would likely be a major generator of bonus points in the lineup. Our bet on his return – state duals. 

Next time? Becahi coach Jeff Karam said “hopefully we’ll see Nazareth again,” and while that’s probably going to happen, maybe even twice, Karam might want to be careful about what he’s hoping for. The 20-point margin didn’t come close to how the match actually felt and went – it was much closer. The Golden Hawks won 106, 113, 120, 126 and 138 – 15 team points -- by a combined 10 points, some of which came very late. Give Nazareth one more takedown in each bout and it could well have been very different – which means it might well be very different next time, if, indeed, there is a next time. "There's a lot of very good teams out there," Crowell said. Brad Wilson may be reached at bwilson@lehighvalleylive.com. Follow him on Twitter @bradwsports. Find .
