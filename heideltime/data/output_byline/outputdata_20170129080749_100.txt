“Start <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EVERY">every day</TIMEX3> off with a smile. At least it’s a good start.” 
 
This is the advice I found in a Chinese fortune cookie <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3>, and I try to follow it somewhat, but it was hard to do this <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-23">past Monday</TIMEX3>. 
 
The Steelers had gone down to defeat with multiple mistakes and the injury of Le’veon Bell. And my “Ralphie onesie” pajamas that I told about wearing for the past two games that brought victory did nothing to save the day. 
 
I wore them during the Miami Dolphin game, and there was a victory and also against the Kansas City Chiefs, although that one was too close for comfort. This time it didn’t work. 
 
I don’t know who I will be cheering for during the Super Bowl as the Green Bay Packers are gone, but I won’t be wearing my flannel onesie, that’s for sure.

<TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29TAF">Sunday afternoon</TIMEX3> was <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> of smiles, though. I was invited by Joyce Klinger to the 100th birthday of a warm and very chipper lady, Helen Bass-Smith, at the Cadiz Presbyterian Church. It was nice seeing people I have known since my days of bringing in the news while stationed at the Cadiz Bureau of the Herald-Star, starting in <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="1980">1980</TIMEX3>. 
 
Helen is quick to point out that she is not a native of Cadiz because she keeps getting reminded of this by the locals. She came to Harrison County in <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="1935">1935</TIMEX3>, after graduation from Toronto High School, the city where she had lived with her parents and siblings. And she did not always attend the Cadiz Presbyterian Church, where she <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> is noted as a loyal and active member. 
 
She sat in the pews at the Ridge Presbyterian Church on Hanover Ridge Road near Scio for <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="P61Y">61 years</TIMEX3> before becoming a member at the Cadiz Presbyterian Church. That seems like a long time ago, but when you have reached your 100th birthday, it doesn’t seem that long. 
 
Helen was born <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="1917-01-22">Jan. 22, 1917</TIMEX3>, the very day <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2017">100 years later</TIMEX3> when the Cadiz church social room was filled with well-wishers who kept streaming over to wish her many more happy years. She was married to Hugh Smith, who died <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="1997" mod="MORE_THAN">more than 20 years ago</TIMEX3>. There are no children. 
 
She lives by herself and still drives her car in town and out to the Harrison Community Hospital. It was there that she volunteered her cheerful help for <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DURATION" value="P20Y" mod="MORE_THAN">more than 20 years</TIMEX3> to those who were ailing and needed to see a smiling face. 
 
Her brother, Edward Bass, from Watertown, N.Y., who is a young 94-year-old, was present, along with nieces and other family members. 
 
Helen was greeted and given a framed certificate from Mayor Ken Zitko and some very encouraging words from Dale Norris, Harrison County commission president. 
 
Norris read from an outline on the gracious 100-year-old saying, “She has been a longtime dedicated ambassador for Christianity as a loyal and active member of the Presbyterian church, steadfast in her commitment to helping others and strengthening the Christian faith of her church members. And she continues to do so while celebrating her 100th birthday,” Norris said. 
 
“Helen has been an exceptional role model for all Harrison County residents, both young and old. She was honored by the village of Cadiz in <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="2007">2007</TIMEX3>, on this same exact date, for serving as a devoted volunteer at the Harrison Community Hospital,” the commissioner concluded. 
 
Commissioner Don Bethel wrote the words of appreciation for her love of others and unwavering devotion to Christianity, her Presbyterian Church and members. 
 
It was interesting to note that her brother, Edward, was born above his parents’ C.M.S. Store, a 5 & 10 cent business in Toronto. He went to Toronto High School until his freshman year and graduated from what was known as Cadiz High School in <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="1940">1940</TIMEX3>. There was a brother two years older, William John, who has passed away. 
 
Ed will be celebrating an anniversary himself on <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DATE" value="2017-02-02">Feb. 2</TIMEX3>. It will be <TIMEX3 tid="t36" type="DURATION" value="P75Y">75 years</TIMEX3> since he joined the U.S. Marines in <TIMEX3 tid="t34" type="DATE" value="1942">1942</TIMEX3> during World War II. With a big smile, he said, “You know the saying, once a Marine, always a Marine.” 
 
His journey through the 1st Marine Division took him through Parris Island; Quanico; the West Coast; Melbourne, Australia; and ended up in Okinawa. 
 
He plans to go with family to Hawaii in <TIMEX3 tid="t38" type="DATE" value="2017-02">February</TIMEX3> to see the U.S. Arizona, the battleship that sank at the hands of the Japanese on <TIMEX3 tid="t39" type="DATE" value="1941-12-07">Dec. 7, 1941</TIMEX3>. It was at <TIMEX3 tid="t41" type="TIME" value="1941-12-07T07:55">7:55 a.m.</TIMEX3> Hawaiian time when 350 Japanese planes bombed the U.S. Naval Base, and more than 2,000 were killed. 
 
“It has been my bucket list to see the sunken battleship for <TIMEX3 tid="t42" type="DURATION" value="PXY">many years</TIMEX3>. <TIMEX3 tid="t43" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> on my 75th anniversary from enlisting I will get to fulfill it,” Ed said. 
 
The Cadiz Presbyterian Church ladies decorated a china cake cutter with flowers and Helen’s name and birthdate to be used for the cutting of the three cakes to represent the number 100. She started with the number one and made a generous slice. Joyce Klinger took over after then, as Helen was surrounded with family and friends who wanted to take pictures and talk. 
 
I was surprised to see Sheila Bond, Smithfield fiscal officer, at the dinner party, but even though she works in Smithfield, she is a resident of Cadiz. She said she did not recognize me immediately either. I was out of my territory as well. 
 
There were mylar balloons floating in the air for the celebration, and Helen, who gets around very well and moves with ease, wore the best adornment she could possibly wear, a big beautiful smile.

Char Bell Branch, a former Smithfield resident and daughter of Bob Beall, wrote to tell me that her dad died at the age of 84 on <TIMEX3 tid="t45" type="DATE" value="2017-01-08">Jan. 8</TIMEX3> in Las Vegas, where they moved in <TIMEX3 tid="t44" type="DATE" value="1979">1979</TIMEX3>. 
 
In Smithfield, he was known as “Slick 50” because of his skillful moves on the football field and his jersey number of 50. 
 
After graduation and marriage to Grace Cooper-Beall-Webb, they moved to Steubenville, and the family joined the Mount Zion Baptist Church under the leadership of the Rev. Alfred Hunt, and he was a member of the trustee board. 
 
Lamont and I met with Char, Bob and Kara “Cobby” Bright of Smithfield for dinner when we were in Vegas in <TIMEX3 tid="t47" type="DATE" value="199" mod="START">the early 1990s</TIMEX3>. Char said that her dad, who was famous for wearing distinctive cowboy hats, boots, western shirts and a big bright smile, always spoke of that meeting. He was the type who could make anyone feel like everything was going to turn out right.

I purchased more than 20 “Spectator” Smithfield High School newspapers that were published during the years of <TIMEX3 tid="t48" type="DATE" value="1951">1951</TIMEX3> thorough <TIMEX3 tid="t49" type="DATE" value="1959">1959</TIMEX3> at the Smithfield Alumni Association banquet <TIMEX3 tid="t50" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3> at the first auction. I am finding it very interesting to read about the people I knew back then but had forgotten about and the businesses that were in the village during that time and had placed ads in the publication. Can you believe there was an advertising department at the school? 
 
I’ll ask those who still live in Smithfield if they remember any of these mentioned businesses: Doris Smith Johnson Beauty Shop, Lew’s Sunoco Service, Co-op Store, E.H. Welday Electric Co., Welday’s Orchard, Thomasson’s Hardware, Woodford’s Shell Service, Buzz Park’s Barber Shop, Slaga’s Florist, Frances Beauty Shop, Ford’s Smithfield Auto and McElroy’s Drug Store. These are the ones that placed ads that week, but there are many others. 
 
I was a feature editor for the Spectator — I think Octa Foster had something to do with naming our paper — and was awarded a Quill and Scroll Award from the Herald-Star in <TIMEX3 tid="t51" type="DATE" value="1954">1954</TIMEX3> for the best feature columns in area schools. I still have that medallion.

I would like to end this column with a poem written for the Spectator by Clara Hasley McClure, a senior at that time. There is no title but it has loads of meaning. 
 
“It’s not the motto on your wall, 
 
That counts in life, you know. 
 
It is the things you say and do, 
 
It’s what your actions show. 
 
It’s not what you say you are, 
 
That people judge you by. 
 
It’s by your attitude in life, 
 
With what standard you comply.”
