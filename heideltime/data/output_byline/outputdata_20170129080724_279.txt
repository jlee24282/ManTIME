I have not been to Annette P. Edwins Elementary School since Debra McElwy successfully dodged my follow-up gift to her <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2016-12-25">Christmas</TIMEX3> present, Mr. Soapy bubble bath which came in a clown-shaped bottle that would give today’s children nightmares and have me answering to DCF abuse charges. 
 
That was <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="1965">1965</TIMEX3>, and I was in fifth grade. I don’t remember having such a hard time finding a parking spot. 
 
But I am here <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3> because it’s Dad’s Lunch Day and I am Auxiliary Dad No. 2 to Mr. Julian, Tracey’s 10-year-old. I feel like I should be Auxiliary Granddad, and indeed, I am the only white-haired, pot-bellied codger in the line of dads stretching out the office. But I am an alumnus, dammit, so that should count for at least cuts in the milk line. 
 
I came prepared to be surprised. That’s what happened when I visited Choctawhatchee High School <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2002" mod="APPROX">about 15 years ago</TIMEX3> to speak to a class of young journalists about their futures and how they should focus on a career that would allow them to actually pay bills — oh and so people wouldn’t accuse them of underestimating the size of the inauguration crowd. 
 
When I walked into Choctaw, I was surprised that I couldn’t just walk in, which was perfectly acceptable in <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="1972">1972</TIMEX3>. Osama bin Laden could have walked in carrying an atomic bomb and several plague-infected rats and nobody would have said anything, except maybe, “Hey man, cool rats.” 
 
I was also surprised at how low the ceilings were. I could never have jabbed a pencil into the ceiling tiles in <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="1972">1972</TIMEX3>, but <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3>, if I wanted, I could lift the tile and hide a plague-infected rat inside. 
 
So when I pulled into the Edwins parking lot, I was amazed to see that the playground and fields beyond were much LARGER than I remembered. I thought, “There’s got to be an acre of property out here — and no condos. I’ve got to take a picture of this.” 
 
I checked in at the office and headed to the cafeteria. I was struck by two things: (a) The cafeteria was almost exactly like it was in <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="1965">1965</TIMEX3>, except it was tiny. (b) Turnips. 
 
Yes, it was on <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> in this very cafeteria that I was so hungry I ate the turnips on my lunch tray — and I loved them. So everyone else gave me their turnips. 
 
There was the stage up front where the firefighters gave their safety presentations and played the song “Sparky’s a Fire Dog,” which nobody to <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">this day</TIMEX3> believes was an actual song but it WAS, dammit. Why won’t anyone believe me? 
 
Julian came in wearing his faux Wayfarers and he was so cool-looking I at first didn’t recognize him. But soon we were heading off down the ramp for the last block of classrooms and, as it turned out, the very classroom I sat in during the fifth grade way back in the year of our Ford Mustang. 
 
Lunch was McDonald's — cheeseburgers, chicken nuggets and lots of fries, so many we ended up sharing them with the rest of the class (a practice I wish my co-workers would adopt). I got to meet Julian’s teachers and his classmates, including one inquisitive boy who had a conversation with me: 
 
Him: “Are you 49?” 
 
Me: “I wish.” 
 
Him: “How old are you?” 
 
Me: “Sixty-one.” 
 
Him: “You look young. You look 49.” 
 
Me: “I’m liking this. Tell me more.” 
 
Nuggets, gone. Burgers, gone. Fries, shared. I looked around the room before leaving. I can see why I thought it was so big way back in <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="1965">1965</TIMEX3> — because it was. 
 
But <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3>, as an Auxiliary Pot-Bellied Grandad, it was not so big physically. Just gigantic in my memories.
