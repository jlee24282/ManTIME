   "Rooftop solar demand was already fairly weak in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3>, leading to all rooftop solar companies to cut back on installation growth projections. At this point, it's unlikely there will be much installation growth at all in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2016" mod="END">late 2016</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017" mod="START">early 2017</TIMEX3>. That's why any pressure on demand will be a negative, even if it starts in states like Indiana and Wyoming, which have very little solar." 
To Mr Know it all aka Solarman: this proves your an A-hole. How many times did you say the Residential Market is not 
Down ? Read my lips Mr Know It all: 
" Rooftop Solar Demand is Weak ". Repeat it ten times and mark it on your Tin hat with a Magic Marker !!!! Your so caught up in your BS you can't see a Mack Truck if it was in your face !!!!
