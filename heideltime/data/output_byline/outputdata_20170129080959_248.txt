KUSA - Silverthorne residents are being reminded to shovel the snow from their roofs. 
 
The warning comes after a free-standing garage on the 700 block of Boise Drive collapsed <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TAF">Saturday afternoon</TIMEX3> under a heavy snow load. 
 
No one was injured, but firefighters say it serves as a reminder to get that snow of the roof. 
 
This comes just <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P2W">two weeks</TIMEX3> after  heavy snow was named as the cause for a roof collapse at a Breckenridge resort. 
 
The snow Breckenridge got on the flat roof was too much for it to handle, leading to its collapse.
