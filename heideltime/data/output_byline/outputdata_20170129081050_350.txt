Kejriwal, the convener of the Aam Aadmi Party, had said at a rally in Goa <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-01" mod="START">earlier this month</TIMEX3>: “We have shown this in Delhi election. People took money from the BJP and the Congress, but voted for us. If the Election Commission uses my statement and propagates it then in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P2Y">two years</TIMEX3>, the political parties will stop distributing notes”.

The Election Commission of India had censured Kejrwal for the remarks that it said breached the election code of conduct. A defiant Kejriwal however said in a letter to Chief Election Commissioner Nasim Zaidi: “By stopping me to say what I am saying, the Election Commission is not stopping corruption, but encouraging it. I hope you (the EC) will re-examine this. Through this comment, I am trying to stop bribery. In fact, the Election Commission should make me its brand ambassador”. 

Goa will cast its ballot on <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-02-04">February 4</TIMEX3>.   — Agencies
