Welcome back, <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> Campaign D-I-Y’ers! For those who tune in, welcome to the Nuts & Bolts of a Democratic campaign. <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="SET" value="P1W" quant="EACH">Each week</TIMEX3>, we discuss issues that help drive successful campaigns. If you’ve missed prior diaries, please visit our group or follow Nuts & Bolts Guide.While this series has focused on what it takes to build a successful campaign and successful county and state organizations, I’ve been taking <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01">January</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2016-02">February</TIMEX3> to talk about how you, as a voter and activist, make a difference through elections in your local community and party.For <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="PXW">the next few weeks</TIMEX3> in a row, the DNC will be hosting Future Forums, <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-W04">this week</TIMEX3> in Houston, Texas—then Detroit, Baltimore, and of course the final vote in Atlanta. I've been fortunate to receive a lot of emails and questions about proposals and positions held by candidates for different offices, and how they might impact the rank and file Democratic voters. <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-W04">This week</TIMEX3>, to match the DNC Future Forum, I hope to answer some of your questions in comments about the DNC elections, the purposes of these offices, and how proposals advanced by candidates may impact you.
