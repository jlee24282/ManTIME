Singapore started using their new A350-900 on <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-17">January 17th</TIMEX3> for services to and from Manchester from Singapore and Houston. This is the first time I've seen the A350 in the flesh and apart from the 'Zorro' cockpit, it's a very nice aircraft. SMB is seen here lining up on 23L for departure to Houston....
