In the earlier game in Harare on Saterday the Bulls got a comfortable win of 38-17 over the Lions in their first warm-up match. 
 
The Lions send a very young team to Zimbabwe and the Bulls had very little trouble in getting the victory over their Gauteng Neighbors. 
 
The Bulls led 21-10 at the break with Bothman and De Jager going over for tries with the Lions getting a penalty try in the first forty. 
 
In <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2016-H2">the second half</TIMEX3>, Jamba Ulengo, Hanro Liebenberg and Shaun Adendorff all added their names to the try-scoring tally as the Pretoria-based side came away with the desired result. 
 
The Bulls are set to kick off their Super Rugby campaign against the Stormers on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2016-02-25">25 February</TIMEX3>, while the Lions will get their season underway with a clash against the Cheetahs in Bloemfontein on <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2016-02-25">the same day</TIMEX3>.
