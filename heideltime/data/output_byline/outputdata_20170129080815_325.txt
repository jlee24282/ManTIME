Renovation work has altered the plans for the Capital Region’s largest fashion show, produced <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="SET" value="P1Y" quant="EACH">each year</TIMEX3> by Electric City Couture. 
 
Universal Preservation Hall, where the show is typically held in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-04">April</TIMEX3> in Saratoga Springs, will be under construction in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-SP" mod="END">late spring</TIMEX3>. 
 
According to the campaign manager, Teddy Foster, UPC will be shut down until <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2018-FA">the fall of 2018</TIMEX3> for construction. Work is expected to cost around $5.5 million and will be a complete restoration of the building, with the aim of making the venue <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3>-round facility. 
 
So instead of one large show, the ECC is working to produce four smaller shows throughout the year. 
When ECC producer Corey Aldrich first found out about the construction, he attempted to find another venue and stick to the tradition of having one <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2017-SP">spring</TIMEX3> show. 
 
“But to match the magnitude that we had <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3>, we couldn’t relocate,” Aldrich said. 
 
As a result, he and the ECC team are reinventing their schedule. 
 
Nothing is set in stone yet, but Aldrich is contemplating holding one show per season in various locations across the Capital Region, the Berkshires and even New York City. 
 
Formed in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2010">2010</TIMEX3> 
ECC, which was formed in <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2010">2010</TIMEX3>, works to create a sustainable fashion industry/market in the upstate area and to bring attention to local talent. 
 
<TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2016">Last year</TIMEX3>, the show took in $17,000 for the designers, $30,000 for charity, $10,000 for the creative employees of ECC and $10,000 for food and beverage vendors. 
 
Combined, the show brought in between $80,000-$90,000 in <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3>. 
 
“Everyone should benefit from it; we want to support our local artists and designers,” Aldrich said. 
 
One of the 10 designers who sent looks down the ECC runway had their entire collection purchased by a local boutique. 
 
For other designers, a handful of their pieces were purchased by local stores and it helped them to gain some name recognition. 
 
Giving the local fashion scene a bit more credibility is another goal of the ECC. 
 
Lately, they’ve not only gained credibility on a local level, but on more populated stomping grounds with an exhibit in New York City. 
 
Artist and designer Vilma Mare, who has worked with ECC in years past, is showing her collection called “Creating Beauty that Protects.” It’s a reflection of the personal aspects of politics and Lithuanian heritage. 
 
The pieces are exhibited at the Consulate General of Lithuania (420 5th Ave No. 304 | New York, NY 10018) until <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2016-02-14">Feb. 14</TIMEX3>. 
 
“<TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">The last day</TIMEX3> of the exhibit is actually during New York’s Fashion Week, so we’re going to try to get people to go to it from Fashion Week as well,” Aldrich said. 
 
Amidst finding other venues for their other shows, the ECC will have plenty of other things to keep it busy. 
Aldrich said that the ECC will most likely also take part in Troy’s Steampunk Festival <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2017-SU">this summer</TIMEX3> with a fashion show. The organization participated <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3> and had a large turnout.
