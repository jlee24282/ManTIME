Nine samples from hunter-harvested deer from near Harpers Ferry during the <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3> hunting seasons have tested positive for chronic wasting disease, bringing the total of CWD positive deer from the area to 15. 
 
The disease is spread from animal to animal through nose-to-nose contact and through environmental contamination from urine, feces and saliva left by positive deer. There is no cure once an animal becomes infected. 
 
The DNR met with hunters and landowners in Harpers Ferry and Waukon on <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-18">Jan. 18</TIMEX3> to discuss collecting additional deer samples from areas where data is limited and to get more samples from the immediate areas where new positive cases were confirmed. At each meeting, attendees volunteered to help collect additional samples. 
 
“We hope to collect 250 to 300 samples from mature deer from a specific area around Harpers Ferry and that will do two things — provide information on specific areas in the target zone where we do not have any data and to remove animals from the area where CWD-positive deer have been found,” said Dr. Dale Garner, chief of the Iowa DNR’s Wildlife Bureau. 
 
“There is no good news when it comes to chronic wasting disease. We know that if we leave it alone, it’s going to spread. By removing adult deer, we are trying to target animals that are most likely to carry the prion, which will slow the spread of the disease while still allowing for quality deer hunting experiences <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="SET" value="XXXX-FA" quant="EACH" freq="1S">each fall</TIMEX3>.” 
 
Chronic wasting disease involves a misshapen protein called a prion. Since this is a protein, a deer’s body does not recognize it as a foreign substance, so it does not produce an antibody response. 
 
“There is no way to kill the prion and the disease is always fatal,” Garner said. 
 
The DNR established a scientific collection effort from <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-01-21">Jan. 21</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2016-02-05">Feb. 5</TIMEX3> in a defined area near Harpers Ferry. 
 
Participants met with local DNR wildlife staff to discuss how to remove the deer, where they planned to focus their effort, and how to contact the DNR to provide the lymph nodes for testing. 
 
Once a sample is submitted, it takes two-to-<TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="P3W">three weeks</TIMEX3> to get results back. 
 
Participants must have a scientific collectors permit and tags and must contact the DNR within <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P1D">24 hours</TIMEX3> of collecting deer to arrange for sample collection. There is no fee for the permits. Participants may use shotguns, muzzleloaders, bows and rifles .24 caliber and larger. All other regulations, including the blaze orange requirement and shooting hours restrictions, apply. 
 
Permits are available from noon to <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="TIME" value="2017-01-23T18:30">6:30 p.m. Monday</TIMEX3> through <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3>, and from <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="TIME" value="2017-01-27T07:00">7 a.m.</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="TIME" value="2017-01-27T18:30">6:30 p.m.</TIMEX3> on the weekends until <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2017-02-05">Feb. 5</TIMEX3> at the Allamakee County Conservation office at 427 North First Street, in Harpers Ferry. A group leader may sign up other members by having their names and phone numbers. 
 
A similar effort took place in <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3>. The collection had a goal of 200 samples, of which 105 deer were collected, providing 85 usable samples. Twenty fawns were not sampled. 
 
The Iowa DNR began collecting deer tissue samples in <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2002">2002</TIMEX3> after the CWD outbreak in Wisconsin. Since then, more than 61,000 samples from wild deer and 4,000 samples from hunting preserve deer have been collected and tested. The first wild deer tested positive in <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2013">2013</TIMEX3>, followed by three in <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2014">2014</TIMEX3>, two in <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3> and nine so far in <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3>. 
 
Chronic wasting disease is not just an Iowa issue; Minnesota has had a spike in deer testing positive for the disease as well. Illinois, Nebraska, Missouri and Wisconsin are all battling this disease. 
 
Participation is voluntary and there are ways other than removing deer to help slow the spread of CWD in this area. 
 
“We encourage everyone to not use piles of feed or salt-mineral licks to attract deer. These baited sites increase the concentration of deer which facilitates transmission of the disease,” said Garner. “And don’t leave a carcass or bones from this region to decay on the land. Place remains in heavy-duty plastic garbage bags to be properly disposed of in a landfill.” 
 WISCONSIN DEER PLAN ACCEPTS APPLICATIONS  
Conservation-minded people throughout Wisconsin are encouraged to enroll in the Deer Management Assistance Program to improve wildlife habitat on property they own or hunt. 
 
DMAP provides resources for wildlife habitat management, which complements land use activities like agriculture and timber management on properties of any size. 
 
The application deadline is <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DATE" value="2017-03-01">March 1</TIMEX3> for properties larger than 160 acres, which may be eligible for a site visit and management plan in <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3>. While applications may be submitted at any time, landowners are encouraged to apply <TIMEX3 tid="t37" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> to receive immediate access to informational resources, including: 
 
• Habitat and deer management information 
 
• Communication with local DNR staff 
 
• Annual DMAP reports and publications 
 
• Volunteer opportunities 
 
• Invitations to DMAP workshops 
 
“DNR staff <TIMEX3 tid="t38" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> work with more than 1,000 DMAP cooperators and two public land agencies on nearly 221,000 acres of land across the state to improve habitat for the wildlife resources we all enjoy,” said Bob Nack, DMAP coordinator for the Department of Natural Resources. “We continue to develop new ways for cooperators to get involved and expand their knowledge of habitat and wildlife management.” 
 
Neighboring landowners with properties within one-half mile of each other are encouraged to enroll as a group cooperative. Landowners in a group cooperative with a combined acreage of 160 acres or more receive a site visit and management plan. Group cooperatives also provide an opportunity to monitor local wildlife populations and share costs and equipment on habitat projects to benefit deer and other wildlife over a greater area. 
 
Another benefit open to all DMAP cooperators is a series of annual DMAP workshops held regionally throughout Wisconsin. Six deer and habitat workshops were offered to DMAP cooperators in <TIMEX3 tid="t41" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3>, and additional workshops are slated for <TIMEX3 tid="t43" type="DATE" value="2017-SP">spring</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t45" type="DATE" value="2017-SU">summer 2017</TIMEX3>. Topics range from invasive species management and how to conduct a timber harvest to aging deer by tooth wear. 
 
“DMAP workshops are a great opportunity to network with other conservation-minded people,” Nack said. “DMAP cooperators share a common goal of promoting the principles of land stewardship and sharing their experiences with others.”
