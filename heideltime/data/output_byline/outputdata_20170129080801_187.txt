Alphabet Inc's Google urgently called back employees from overseas and told ones who might be affected by the ban not to leave the United States. 
 
CEO Sundar Pichai said in an email to staff that more than 100 Google employees were affected by the order, according to a Google executive. 
 
One Google employee of Iranian nationality with legal U.S. residency made it back to the United States just hours before the order took effect, the executive said. 
 
"We're concerned about the impact of this order and any proposals that could impose restrictions on Googlers and their families, or that could create barriers to bringing great talent to the U.S.," Google said in a statement. 
 
Microsoft Corp President and Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith said in a company-wide email posted on LinkedIn that 76 company employees were citizens of the seven countries in question and held U.S. work visas, and thus were directly affected by the order. 
 
He said the company had not determined how many people with green cards, or permanent residence status, might be affected. 
 
"As a company, Microsoft believes in a strong and balanced high-skilled immigration system," Smith said in the post. "We believe in the importance of protecting legitimate and law-abiding refugees whose very lives may be at stake in immigration proceedings." 
 
Uber Technologies Inc CEO Travis Kalanick, who has faced criticism from some employees for participating in President Trump's business advisory council, said in a statement that the company would compensate drivers from the seven countries who might not be able to return to the United States for <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DURATION" value="P3M">three months</TIMEX3> or more. He said the company knew of about a dozen affected employees.
