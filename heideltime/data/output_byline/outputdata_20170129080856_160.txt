Practices don’t begin for Ohio high school baseball teams for another <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DURATION" value="P3W">three weeks</TIMEX3>, but area coaches are already preparing for how to adapt to new pitching rules. 
 
The Ohio High School Athletic Association <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> adopted pitch-count standards that will limit hurlers to a maximum of 125 pitches per day, along with other restrictions. 
 
<TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2016">Last year</TIMEX3>, the National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS) told all states they were required to have a pitch count limit instead of a regulation based on innings pitched over a certain number of days. Previously, a pitcher could pitch up to 10 innings in a <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P3D">three-day</TIMEX3> span. 
 
”I do agree with the new rules … arm injuries are becoming more prevalent at every level,” Martins Ferry head coach Anthony Reasbeck said. 
 
In addition to limiting the number of pitches that can be thrown daily, the new rule contains other details such as the number of days required between pitching appearances based on the number of pitches thrown. 
 
Those stipulations are as follows: 1-30 pitches, <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="P0D">0 days</TIMEX3>; 31-50 pitches, <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P1D">1 day</TIMEX3>; 51-75 pitches, <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P2D">2 days</TIMEX3>; 76 or more pitches, <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="P3D">3 days</TIMEX3>. 
 
”Our initial goal was to meet the requirement of the NFHS rule that <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> requires individual states to create their own pitch count limitations,” OHSAA Assistant Commissioner Jerry Snodgrass said via a news release. 
 
”After assembling a group representing the necessary stakeholders, including a member of our Sports Medicine Advisory Committee, we have met that goal. We continue to look for further ways in which these limitations will affect teams as well as providing adequate education for our coaches and those in non-school baseball.” 
 
As far as doubleheaders go, if a pitcher throws at least 31 pitches in a game, he may not pitch in another game that day, or <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2017-01-30">the next day</TIMEX3>, as referenced to the aforementioned numbers. Also, if the daily pitch count is reached during an at-bat, a pitcher may exceed the pitch count only to finish pitching to the <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> batter. 
 
Pitches thrown in scrimmages and previews also count. 
 
”I don’t have any problem with it, and I kind of like it,” veteran River head coach Mark Romick said. 
 
”I don’t think there’s too many around that abuse arms. The inherent problem, I think, is, who’s going to monitor it.” 
 
According to the OHSAA, at the end of each game, coaches must submit pitcher data to a designated data collection system. Schools are required to keep pitch count data on all pitchers and make the data available to the OHSAA upon request. 
 
A team shall forfeit any win in which a player violates the regulation, the OHSAA said. 
 
”I think a kid’s arm is worth more than a win,” Romick said. ”<TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3>, you’ll see kids with Tommy John surgery coming out of high school. And that’s sad.” 
 
Romick said some youngsters have specialized in the sport and play it year round. He feels regulations should be placed at other levels, too. 
 
Reasbeck and Romick both believe the way they coach won’t change much. 
 
”Honestly, I really don’t see much change in my thinking,” Reasbeck said. ”We basically have adhered to plenty of days rest in the past. 
 
”The biggest change I see is when a team has a true ace. Tournament time will be very interesting. Usually, your best could throw seven innings then close the next game. Those days are over. 
 
”It does become an advantage to have a stable of pitchers. There will be some players who aren’t pitchers forced into pitching later in the week and on the back end of doubleheaders.” 
 
Romick agreed adding developing more arms will become more of a priority. 
 
”I think what will happen is it will hurt schools that have depleted pitching staffs,” he said. ”Some schools from West Virginia had to cancel games because they had no one left to pitch. 
 
”It will make you develop more pitchers.”
