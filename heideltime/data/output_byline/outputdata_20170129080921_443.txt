MOSCOW, <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">January 29</TIMEX3> (Sputnik) — Major Australian airline Qantas announced that it would offer refunds or a change of destination to their passengers in case they were affected by the order of US President Donald Trump aimed at decreasing the flow of migrants into the United States, media reported <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3>. 
"We will reflect this change in our processes and booking systems, however it is not likely to materially impact Qantas passengers," the company said in a statement, as quoted by the ABC broadcaster. 
 
Taxi service Uber has also weighed in on the issue, with its CEO Travis Kalanick announcing that the company would compensate the losses to those drivers affected by the ban "to help mitigate some of the financial stress and complications" during <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P3M">the next three months</TIMEX3>. 
 
On <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3>, Trump signed an executive ordered blocking all refugees from coming to the United States for <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="P120D">120 days</TIMEX3> and suspended the entry for citizens from Iran, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Libya and Somalia for <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P90D">90 days</TIMEX3>.
