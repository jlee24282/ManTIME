It's jazz for people who don't like jazz. 
 
That's what guitarist Barry Wahrhaftig calls the music that Hot Club of Philadelphia will perform <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> at <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28T20:00">8 p.m.</TIMEX3> at Landhaven Bed & Breakfast in Huffs Church. 
 
Based on the gypsy jazz style popularized by Django Reinhardt and Stephane Grappelli, whose Hot Club of France Quintet created a scene in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="1934">1934</TIMEX3> Paris by putting an acoustic spin on American hot jazz, the music is melodic, hook-filled and accessible. Not only that, but as jazz cats like to say, it swings. 
 
"People will come up to me at a show and go, 'Don't take this the wrong way: I don't like jazz, but I like what you guys do,' " Wahrhaftig said, "and I just go, 'Thanks.' They might think that's a left-handed compliment, but we don't take it that way." 
 
Like most of his contemporaries growing up in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="196">the 1960s</TIMEX3>, Wahrhaftig admired rock 'n' roll icons - Jimi Hendrix, the Rolling Stones and the Beatles - but as an adult he gravitated toward straight-ahead jazz guitarists like Wes Montgomery and Pat Metheny. Then, around <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2001">2001</TIMEX3>, he started really delving into the music of Reinhardt <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P1D">one day</TIMEX3> while poking around online. 
 
He found a Yahoo Newsgroup - this was pre-Facebook - composed of what he called "Reinhardt nerds" and started jamming with some of them. Finally, attending a concert by French guitarist and violinist Dorado Schmitt and his band at Lincoln Center put him over the top. 
 
"I've got to tell you," Wahrhaftig said, "I've heard jazz all my life, I've written reviews, on and on, and I was stunned at what they did. They played like it was their <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">last day</TIMEX3> on Earth, you know? I had to process it: Wow, what is this?" 
 
He was inspired to put together a Hot Club of his own, and his group has been playing greater Philadelphia venues ever since, and also has a strong following in the Lehigh Valley. 
 
For their first visit to Landhaven, Wahrhaftig will be joined by his full band, and what a lineup it is: Phyllis Chapell on vocals, Dan Pearce on rhythm guitar, Joseph Arnold on violin and Jim Stager on upright bass. 
 
Wahrhaftig said he learned about Landhaven from John Jorgenson, the virtuosic multi-instrumentalist who has played there numerous times. The two have shared stages on several occasions, and Jorgenson wrote the liner notes for Hot Club's <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2011">2011</TIMEX3> debut CD, "Wrap Your Troubles in Dreams." 
 
"He had told us years ago, 'you guys should play there,' " Wahrhaftig said. 
 
The venue qualifies as an ideal setting to hear gypsy jazz. Jorgenson himself is said to have likened the acoustics of the general store-turned-listening room to playing on the inside of a guitar. 
 
Hot Club's repertoire actually goes beyond gypsy jazz all the way back to <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="192">1920s</TIMEX3> hits like Nat King Cole's "Sweet Lorraine" and forward to Frank Sinatra standards, Jay Ungar's folk classic "Ashokan Farewell" and even a Beatles number here or there if the mood strikes. 
 
For Wahrhaftig, it boils down to entertaining the audience. 
 
"I like to work the crowd," he said. " I'll put it this way: I'm an entertainer. I happen to be playing mostly gypsy jazz for <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="P16Y">the past 16 years</TIMEX3>, and I love it, but I always want to work the room."
