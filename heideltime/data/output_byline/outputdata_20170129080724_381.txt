Nora Ball's been putting up some pretty big numbers in the Jacks & Jills League at Strike Zone Bowling Center. She fired two straight 700 series, rolled a 277 game <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-W03">last week</TIMEX3> and hit the big one with a perfect game. 
   
"I wouldn't have said that <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2016-12">a month ago</TIMEX3>," Ball said about shooting the fourth 300 of her career. "I hadn't been bowling that well." 
   
Well, <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P4W">the four-week</TIMEX3> run shows Ball's turned the corner a bit. 
   
Still, Ball didn't expect such a big number in her final game <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-01-25">Wednesday</TIMEX3> after shooting 163 the game before. 
   
"I had no shot to the pocket," she said. "The third game I moved inside. Twelve in a row. Pretty." The closest call came on the first shot in the 10th when the 4-pin went out late on a hit she called a tad high. 
   
Ball said what she must do <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> is make adjustments quicker. 
   
"I don't change things early enough," she said. "I didn't make that move until the second game was over." 
   
It was Ball's first 300 at Strike Zone. Her other three were at Colonial Lanes. She's averaging 205 on the synthetic lanes at Strike Zone. Her average on the wood at Colonial is 192. She bowls at Colonial in the <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-01-23">Monday</TIMEX3> Bombers League. 
   
Ball's <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> tied with husband Dennis for most 300s in the family with four each. 
   
There's another family member to watch. Nora'a daughter, Kodi, 16, bowls in the junior program at Colonial. She had games of 146-200-141 for a 587 <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017-W03">last week</TIMEX3> in the Teen Division.
