The consistency of the winning political candidates on key issues in red states <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="PXY">the past several years</TIMEX3>, while perhaps predictable, is both clear and troubling to those who live in them.

Winners predominantly: Oppose any new taxes or increases in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> ones; favor cutting all expenditures except military or public safety; favor reducing regulatory authority in banking/financial industry, energy production and environmental protection; favor pro-life/anti-abortion policies; oppose single payer or government controlled healthcare; oppose free trade agreements; favor repealing/restricting/restraining <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> LGBT laws; favor school choice, charter school/voucher systems; favor putting God back in schools and government, and oppose any legislation that tightens gun ownership requirements. What then, is troubling about these red state positions?
