MELBOURNE, Australia -- The Latest on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3> at the Australian Open (all times local):

<TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29T15:15">3:15 p.m.</TIMEX3> There was a lot of mutual respect going around before the Australian Open final on <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3> between Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal.

"Rafa's definitely presented me with the biggest challenge in the game," Federer said after his semifinal win over U.S. Open champion Stan Wawrinka. "I'm happy we've had some epic, epic battles over the years ..."

Nadal said neither player could have imagined making the final of the year's first Grand Slam after coming back from their respective injuries in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3> - Federer, his left knee; Nadal, his left wrist. Both men took time off last season and had difficult draws in Melbourne because of their lower rankings.

"For me, it's a privilege," Nadal said. "It's a very, very special thing, I think, for both of us to be in the final of a major again, have another chance to compete against each other after <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="PXY">a couple of years</TIMEX3> having some problems."

Nadal, who has won 14 Grand Slam singles titles, has dominated Federer, who has a leading 17 men's majors, in their head-to-head matches. Nadal has a 23-11 record overall and has won nine of their 11 Grand Slam matches.

The match was an early-evening start, expected under clear skies and in temperatures of about 25 Celsius (77 Fahrenheit), allowing the roof on Rod Laver Arena to be open.

Federer, with a leading 17 Grand Slam men's singles titles, has gone further in the tournament than he ever expected after being out for <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P6M">six months</TIMEX3> with a left knee injury. Nadal, too, spent extended injury time on the sidelines in <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3>.
