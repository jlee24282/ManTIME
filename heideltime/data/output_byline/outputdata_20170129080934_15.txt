The Anfield faithful watched on in horror as their side was dumped out the FA Cup at the hands of Wolves <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">yesterday</TIMEX3>.

They are enduring a horror <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01">January</TIMEX3>, compounded by the fact it's unlikely any new faces will arrive before the transfer window slams shut.

But they have done one deal at least with Lallana giving the green light to a new £120,000-<TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="SET" value="P1W" freq="1">a-week</TIMEX3> deal, according to the <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3> Express.

The contract will see his wages doubled from the £60,000 he <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> earns.
