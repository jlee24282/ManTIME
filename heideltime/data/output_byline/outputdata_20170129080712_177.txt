By The rampant discourse over the world’s economic future must wait. There are more important forecasts to consider as fractious factions face off on <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-02-02">Feb. 2</TIMEX3>, <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-02-02">Groundhog Day</TIMEX3>, over who has the superior groundhog. OK, I know I write about this <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="SET" value="P1Y" quant="EVERY">every year</TIMEX3>, but I think it adds some lightheartedness to the somberness of investment analysis. 
 
Peacefully sleeping members of Marmota monax are yanked out of their comfortable dens to view their shadows, the purpose being to predict the weather <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P6W">six weeks</TIMEX3> into the future. 
 
Staten Island Chuck is up against the powerful PR machine of Punxsutawney Phil and his 130th annual forecast. Unfortunately, Staten Island Chuck has never had the smoothest of relationships with New York mayors. In <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2009">2009</TIMEX3>, he took a chunk out of the finger of then-New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. 
 
<TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2015">Two years ago</TIMEX3>, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio dropped Chuck after the animal predicted six more miserable weeks of <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-WI">winter</TIMEX3>, and Chuck died <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="FUTURE_REF">several days later</TIMEX3> of internal injuries. 
 
But wait, it appears that Chuck was not, in fact, Chuck at all, but a female stand-in named Charlotte, brought in to prevent another finger-chewing “incident.” So, Chuck lives on and will hopefully take a more tasteful approach to government officials. 
 
A mayor in Wisconsin learned a valuable lesson about his city's weather predictor. It seems that Jimmy, the official groundhog in Sun Prairie, was being held too close to the mayor’s face when it promptly bit his honor's ear. Maybe groundhogs are trying to tell us something and not about the weather but rather sleep related. 
 
Meanwhile, General Beauregard Lee of Georgia, who holds “honorary doctorates” from the University of Georgia and Georgia State in "Weather Prognostication," must compete with Sir Walter Wally of North Carolina. 
 
By way of full disclosure, the University of Georgia tersely informed me <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">a couple of years ago</TIMEX3>, that academic recognition of such magnitude would not have been bestowed on a groundhog. I did not mean to imply that Beauregard had really been awarded such a degree. After all, he never actually put it on his curriculum vitae. 
 
Desirous of taking advantage of the groundswell of groundhog controversy but with no groundhog of its own to roust, Florida at one time decided to “borrow” one, devising an ad campaign indicating that Punxsutawney Phil had exited stage right in search of warmer digs. 
 
The <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> weather up north would have sent any enterprising groundhog southbound. Yet Phil's handlers were not amused, muttering something about “trademark violation,” and the promotion died an early death, unlike 130-year-old Punxsutawney Phil. 
 
Given the level of expertise most groundhogs have with the English language, not to mention meteorology, there is probably some doubt as to the scientific strength of this forecasting approach. Unfortunately, many of Wall Street’s prognosticators are in the same league as your local groundhog. 
 
Their idea is that the Super Bowl can foretell the stock market’s future. If the team from the NFC — the old NFL — wins, it will be an up year for the market. If a team from the AFC — the old AFL — is victorious, it foretells a bear market. The Super Bowl Indicator has about an 80 percent accuracy rate. 
 
Therefore, if you are invested in stocks and want to see a bull market <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2017">this year</TIMEX3>, you should root for the Atlanta Falcons. If you are short the market and want to see it fall, root for the New England Patriots. 
 
Meanwhile, there is a modicum of statistical data that correlates market aberrations with certain calendar events. For example, the so-called <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2017-01">January</TIMEX3> effect, where <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2017-01">January</TIMEX3> stock prices supposedly forecast the market's performance for the remaining months of the year. Ouch! Before you start placing trade orders, consider that <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="1997">20 years ago</TIMEX3>, David Leinweber, a visiting economist at Caltech, determined that butter production in Bangladesh had a statistically significant correlation (an r-squared of 99 percent for you math buffs) with the S&P 500 index. And he still receives requests for <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> butter production numbers, as do I.
