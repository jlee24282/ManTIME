VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - On <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="TIME" value="2017-01-24TAF">the afternoon of Jan. 24</TIMEX3>, a black BMW pulled out of a <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="15">16th century</TIMEX3> palace in Rome, crossed the Tiber River and headed for the Vatican, a short trip to end a brazen challenge to the authority of Pope Francis.

Inside the car was 67-year-old Englishman Matthew Festing, the head of an ancient Catholic order of knights which is <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> a worldwide charity with a unique diplomatic status.

Festing was about to resign, the first leader in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="PXCE">several centuries</TIMEX3> of the Order of Malta, which was founded in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="1048">1048</TIMEX3> to provide medical aid for pilgrims in the Holy Land, to step down instead of ruling for life.

The move was aimed at ending a highly-public spat between Festing and the reformist pope over the running of the chivalric institution. The weeks-long conflict had become one of the biggest internal challenges yet to Francis' efforts to modernize the 1.2 billion member Roman Catholic Church.

At issue was the Order's reaction to the discovery that condoms had been distributed by one of its aid projects in Myanmar. The Order had fired its Grand Chancellor, Albrecht Freiherr von Boeselager, whom it held responsible for the condom distribution. Von Boeselager declined to comment for this article.

Though condom use goes against Catholic teaching, the Vatican had ordered an investigation into the firing of von Boeselager. It subsequently publicly castigated Festing, who had refused to cooperate with the investigation.

Backing down, Festing, a former Sotheby's art auctioneer, gave a hand-written resignation letter to Francis in the pope's private residence, according to a senior Vatican source. Festing, who has the title of prince, declined an interview request.

Instead of quelling the conflict, however, Festing's resignation was followed by yet another challenge to Francis' authority -- led by vocal pope critic American Cardinal Raymond Leo Burke, according to Vatican and Knights sources.

In particular: Burke tried to convince Festing to withdraw his resignation and keep fighting the pope, these sources say. On <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>, the Knight's Sovereign Council accepted Festing's resignation and re-instated von Boselager, a clear defeat for Burke.

Burke declined to comment for this article.

The tussle suggested Francis is still battling to consolidate his power over the Church <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P4Y" mod="LESS_THAN">almost four years</TIMEX3> into his tenure, Vatican insiders say.

Beyond a fight over condoms, the clash pointed to lingering divisions between the Church's conservatives and more progressive factions who support the pope's reformist agenda, they add.

Francis is trying to make the Church less dogmatic and more welcoming to whose who have felt excluded, such as homosexuals and the divorced.

"While this whole saga was an internal matter that probably should have stayed that way, it metamorphosed into a clash that showed the divide between conservatives and progressives," said Andrea Tornielli, author of several books on Pope Francis.

The Vatican declined to comment on the clash and on Pope Francis' efforts to consolidate his power.

It directed Reuters to two public statements. One, on <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2017-12-22">Dec. 22</TIMEX3>, relates to the Vatican order to investigate the firing of von Boeselager. The second, on <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2017-01-17">Jan. 17</TIMEX3>, followed a pledge by Festing on the Knights' web page not to cooperate with the Vatican. It decried his resistance and ordered members of the order to cooperate.

GERMAN ARISTOCRAT

The all-male top leaders of the Knights of Malta are not clerics, but they take vows of poverty, chastity and obedience to the pope.

A German aristocrat whose father participated in a failed plot to kill Hitler in World War Two, von Boeselager was fired by Festing in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2016-12">December</TIMEX3>, and accused of having allowed the use of condoms while he was head of the Knights' global humanitarian projects.

Festing fired him in Burke's presence, arguing that the German had hidden the condom use from the order's leaders when he was named Grand Chancellor, according to Knights and Vatican sources.

Immediately, the firing set off the conflict between the Knights' hierarchy and the Vatican.

Von Boeselager , a devout Catholic, said in a statement on <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2016-12-23">Dec. 23</TIMEX3> that he was fully behind Church teachings. He closed two projects in the developing world when he discovered condoms were being distributed but kept a third running in Myanmar for a while because closing it would have abruptly ended all basic medical services to poor people.
