Two initial tranches of loan worth Rs 350 crore were hastily disbursed by IDBI bank to Kingfisher Airlines after a "holiday" meeting between liquor baron Vijay Mallya and the then bank CMD as both organisations "criminally conspired" to clear the entire deal despite weak financials of the airline, the ED has said. 
 
The total loan sanctioned and disbursed by IDBI was Rs 860.92 crore. 
 
The agency, probing the case for money laundering charges, has said its investigation found that the processes deployed to structure and re-structure the loan by the bank to the <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3>-defunct airline was planned to be defrauded and that Mallya and Kingfisher Airlines (KFA) had "no intent" to repay it. 
 
"PMLA investigation indicates that the marketable value and quality of the collateral security offered by Ms KAL (KFA) and its promoters was not assessed. There is a complete lack of due diligence on the part of the bank coupled with the fact that undue haste was shown while disbursing the initial two tranches of loan amounting to Rs 350 crore. 
 
"It is apparent that the said loans were disbursed post meeting of Mallya with the then CMD (Yogesh Aggarwal) of the bank on a holiday. It does not need an eagles' eye to decipher the cause of immediate disbursement of the loan amount of Rs 150 crore on <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2009-10-07">October 7, 2009</TIMEX3> and Rs 200 crore on <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2009-11-04">November 4, 2009</TIMEX3>," the Enforcement Directorate (ED) probe report, accessed by PTI, said. 
 
The CBI <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> arrested Aggarwal and eight others in this case. 
 
The report added this specific transaction, where "substantial amounts" were sanctioned to KFA, in an ad-hoc basis and without due diligence points to the "existence of a deep rooted criminal conspiracy between the bank officials and the promoters of KAL (KFA)". 
 
The agency, in its report, has appended the statement of the Aggarwal given to ED on <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2016-03-23">March 23</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3> wherein he told the Investigating Officer (IO) of the case that in <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2009-10">October 2009</TIMEX3>, Mallya made a telephonic call to his office and requested for an "urgent meeting the very <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2017-01-30">next day</TIMEX3>". 
 
"As <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2017-01-30">the next day</TIMEX3> was a holiday, it was pointed out to him... and he could meet at a later day. However, he (Mallya) informed that he was leaving Mumbai <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2017-01-30">next day</TIMEX3> evening and as the matter was urgent, he would be grateful if he could meet <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2017-01-30">the next day</TIMEX3> despite it being a holiday to which he (Aggarwal) agreed," the ex-CMD said, adding Mallya did meet him <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2017-01-30">the next day</TIMEX3> along with a former MD and <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> advisor of the bank and an Executive Director of IDBI. 
 
"Mallya informed that Ms KAL (KFA) was in a severe crunch and needed funds urgently to keep flying," Aggarwal said in his statement. .
