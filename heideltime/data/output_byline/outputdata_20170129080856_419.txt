Considering what Donald Trump said in the run-up to the US <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3> presidential election, “restructuring” of the US military makes sense only if it is oriented towards maintaining good relations with Russia and China as well as launching an effective military campaign against the Daesh Takfiri terrorists, an analyst says. 
 
Political commentator and radio host Don DeBar told Press TV on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> that the president’s <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> attempt to increase the country’s military spending may actually be aimed at making nice with other world powers. 
 
Ahead of the <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2016-11">November 2016</TIMEX3> vote, Trump vowed to “avoid having war and enhance relations with Russia and China, assuming that translates into military policy, and he said that he is going to be serious about fighting al-Qaeda or ISIS (Daesh),” DeBar said. 
 
Sticking to the promises demands the new president to move towards a “complete restructuring” of the US military, which is generally oriented towards political maneuvers and major wars, noted the New York-based analyst.  
 
Trump, a billionaire and former reality TV star, paid his first post-inauguration visit to the Pentagon on <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3> to sign an executive order for start of a “great rebuilding of the Armed Forces.” 
 
He further called for new warplanes, new ships, new resources, and an increase in the number of special forces. 
 
“He may well be talking about that and portraying it this way for political purposes; he is under siege from <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="PXQ">many quarters</TIMEX3>, the Republican Party and the entire Democratic Party,” DeBar argued. 
 
“The US needs to close the bases it has around the world and pull its military back to the United States and orient it towards defense,” he concluded.
