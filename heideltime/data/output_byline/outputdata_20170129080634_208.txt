He is just 11 but his name will forever be etched in the history of his school. 
 
Giancarlo Walker is considered the “little artist” of the Craighead Primary School in Manchester. 
 
<TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2015">Two years ago</TIMEX3>, the then nine-year-old student was named as a winner of the World Children’s Picture Contest held by 
 
IE-NO-HIKARI which translates to Light in (Home ) — a <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="SET" value="XXXX-XX">monthly</TIMEX3> Japanese family magazine published in Tokyo, Japan. According to its website, the World Children’s Picture Contest has been held as part of the country’s cultural activities since <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="1993">1993</TIMEX3> to promote the awareness and importance of nature and agriculture, and encourage friendship and goodwill among children around the world, to help develop well rounded characters. 
 
At it’s 23rd staging, Walker was a successful entrant. Then in grade 4, he recounted his entry to the competition. 
 
“Them say yuh was to draw something like a family but it was an animal family, an I draw a bird family,” the young artist, who is <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> in grade six, told the Jamaica Observer . 
 
“Di teacher from grade 3 tell us about it,” he continued. 
 
With a love for drawing, he said he had to enter when he heard about it. 
 
“I don’t really know enuh miss, but from me born I just love drawing. I’m always drawing,” he stated. “I draw a lot of different things, like cars, farm animals, and nuff other things.” 
 
His entry piece, he estimated, took him roughly <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="PT2H">two hours</TIMEX3> to complete. 
 
Upon winning, he noted that competition organisers visited his school to present him with his prize. There were 26,288 entries from 77 countries and regions across the world when Walker entered. Of that number, 200 winners were selected and announced on the website, after passing through two stages of rigorous judging. 
 
Walker was the only person from the Caribbean to be awarded. 
 
Though he wasn’t named as a winner of a gold award, he was delighted that he was able to represent the region globally. 
 
“I felt good about it. I was really excited,” Walker recounted. “Mommy and daddy tell mi seh I’d done a good thing and my friends dem cheer for mi an tell me dat I did a good job too.” 
 
“I won crayons and a certificate,” he added. 
 
But despite his calm demeanour about his victory, one could not miss his principal’s enthusiasm as she spoke of her star pupil. 
 
“He did so well. He went up against so many countries and people who are bigger than him and beat them,” Principal Paulette Foote said, beaming with excitement and joy. 
 
Young Walker’s photograph with Japanese organisers who presented him with the prizes is displayed boldly in the staff room, to remind teachers and students alike of the achievement. 
 
He told the <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3> Observer that he hopes to <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P1D">one day</TIMEX3> become an artist as he thinks “that’s all I should do”.
