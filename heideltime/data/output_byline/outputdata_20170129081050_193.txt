University of California students and community members from seven majority-Muslim countries targeted by an executive order from President Donald Trump should not leave the country, the University advised <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>. 
 
The University also advised visa holders or green card holders from the affected countries who are abroad to contact the International Studies Office at each campus . 
 
The UC released its statement the day after Trump issued his executive order banning all Syrian refugees from entering the country indefinitely, all other refugees for <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P120D">120 days</TIMEX3> and citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P90D">90 days</TIMEX3>. 
 
“We will continue to monitor and analyze the impact of the executive order and will issue additional guidance <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="FUTURE_REF">as soon as possible</TIMEX3>,” the UC statement said. 
 
Trump said he issued the order as part of his “extreme vetting” plan to keep out “radical Islamic terrorists” from the country. He also said he wanted to prioritize Christian and other minority refugees over Muslim refugees. 
 
The Department of Homeland Security had said the executive order would prevent U.S. permanent residents or green card holders from re-entering the country. People from the seven countries who hold dual citizenship with a country other than the United States are also restricted from entering the country. 
 
Judge Ann Donnelly of the U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York issued a stay on Trump’s order, preventing the deportation of travelers with valid visas and refugee status who had already arrived in the country. 
 
Judge Leonie Brinkema of the U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Virginia also issued a temporary order blocking the deportation of green card holders at Dulles International Airport. 
 
It is unclear whether either ruling will ultimately block the Trump administration from preventing people banned by Trump’s executive order from entering the U.S. 
 
Seven people from the targeted countries were detained at the Los Angeles International Airport <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TMO">Saturday morning</TIMEX3>, and dozens of others were detained in airports across the country. 
 
Four of those being detained are Iranian, and all hold green cards or U.S. visas, according to the Los Angeles Times. A woman of Iranian descent from Austria with a student visa was deported to Copenhagen, Denmark. 
 
Activists, protesters and lawyers flocked to Los Angeles International Airport, San Francisco International Airport and John F. Kennedy International Airport to protest the detentions and work for the detainees’ release. 
 
The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit against the executive order, arguing it violated the Due Process and Equal Protection clauses of the Constitution. 
 
Protesters, including UCLA students, plan to rally at the international terminal at LAX against Trump’s executive order <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3>.
