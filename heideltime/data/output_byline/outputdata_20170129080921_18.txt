LONGVIEW, Texas (LC) - Due to their worst shooting performance of the season, the Louisiana College men were out paced by LeTourneau <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TAF">Saturday afternoon</TIMEX3> in Longview, 88-68. The loss is the third straight for the Wildcats and their 10th overall in conference play. LC is still mathematically alive for the final tournament spot out of the East, but will need some help over the next two and a half weeks to get into the bracket. 
 
A sluggish first few minutes of the game for the Wildcats carried over through the rest of the afternoon, leading LC to their lowest shooting percentage of the season, going 24-of-71 from the floor in the game for 33.8%. The Wildcats started the game 3-for-9 from the floor in the first <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="PT5M">five minutes</TIMEX3> of play but were only down 7-6 at that point. 
 
The Wildcats hung around <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="PT10M" mod="MORE_THAN">over the next 10 minutes</TIMEX3> of play and eventually tied the game thanks to a 3-pointer from Jacquez Coleman, knotting the game at 23 with just under <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="PT7M">seven minutes</TIMEX3> remaining in the half. That was the point, however, when LeTourneau would seize control of the game, outscoring LC 16-1 over the final <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="PT7M">seven minutes</TIMEX3> of the half. LC went a miserable 0-for-12 from the floor during that stretch, that included several point-blank attempts at the basket, finishing with an 11-for-38 (28.9%) performance for the first <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="PT20M">20 minutes</TIMEX3>. 
 
LC continued to play hard in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2018-H2">the second half</TIMEX3> but the 39-24, halftime deficit was too much for them to overcome in the game. Both teams were even on the offensive side in <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2016-H2">the second half</TIMEX3> in terms of rebounds, turnovers, assists, and points, a 49-44 advantage for LeTourneau in the half. LC missed six more shots than the Yellowjackets did in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2016-H2">the second half</TIMEX3> and were outshot 55.9% to 39.4% in the half. 
 
Even with the shooting troubles of the game, Raheem Reigs led the way for the Wildcats once again with his sixth double-double of the season, and his third in the last four games, scoring 20 points and pulling in 10 rebounds. After missing <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2017-01-26">Thursday</TIMEX3>'s game due to concussion symptoms, Taylan Grogan bounced back with an 18-point outing with five rebounds, the only other Wildcat to reach double figures in the game. He converted on 4-of-6 shots from behind the arc in <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2016-H2">the second half</TIMEX3> and made 5-of-7 overall. 
 
The Wildcats return to H.O. West Fieldhouse on <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2017-01-26">Thursday</TIMEX3> for a rematch with the LeTourneau Yellowjackets in the first of a five-game home stand. LC will tip-off <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="TIME" value="2017-02-02TNI">Thursday night</TIMEX3> at <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="TIME" value="2017-02-02T19:30">7:30pm</TIMEX3> and then host UT Tyler on <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TAF">Saturday afternoon</TIMEX3> at <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28T15:00">3pm.</TIMEX3> Stay up to date on results and information at lcwildcats.net, by following @LC_MBSK or @LC_Wildcats on Twitter, or liking LC Athletics on
