Following World War II, there was an understandable desire among the nations of the world who had fought one or more of the Axis powers to create a world organization to help avoid future wars and contesting evil. The seed of the <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> United Nations was initiated during WWII as a united effort to defeat the Axis powers. The initial effort was led by U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin of the USSR — all allies at the time. The first use of the term "United Nations" was made in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="1942-01" mod="START">early January 1942</TIMEX3> when 26 nations signed the original declaration. By <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="1945" mod="START">early 1945</TIMEX3> it had been signed by 25 more. On <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="1945-10-24">Oct. 24, 1945</TIMEX3> the U.N. was officially formed. Flushed from the victory of the Allies over the Axis powers, the U.S. Senate and House voted unanimously in <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="1945-12">December of 1945</TIMEX3> to see the permanent U.N. headquarters located in New York City. A major gift of $8.5 million was given by John D. Rockfeller, Jr. toward land acquisition. In <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="1951-01">January of 1951</TIMEX3>, the U.N. building was open for business, full of lofty ideals and noble goals. 
 
However, the foundation of the U.N. began with a serious fatal flaw as the original charter had to be ratified by the U.S., France, the United Kingdom, the Republic of China and the USSR. The USSR, an ally against Hitler, was led by a tyrant as ruthless as Hitler, Joseph Stalin, who soon showed his true colors by gaining control of the countries of eastern Europe, supposedly freed by Russian troops from Nazi control. Later, China would also internally fall to communism and its brutal dictator, Chairman Mao. Between the two tyrants, Stalin and Mao, millions and millions of their own people were murdered in order for them to maintain control. Both tyrants proved to largely undermine any real effectiveness of the U.N. during their lifetimes. 
 
Aside from the U.N.'s efforts to fight against the invasion of South Korea by North Korea in <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="1950">1950</TIMEX3>, primarily defended by U.S. forces and command, the U.N. has been sliding steadily downhill since, embroiled in multiple scandals and ineffectiveness. Because any one of the original five members of the Security Council (including the USSR and China) could veto and prevent any meaningful actions the Council might take, the U.N. was structurally doomed to be an ineffective force for good fighting evil. Evil was always present and could veto any worthy endeavor. That evil still exists, as does their veto. 
 
The U.N. has grown to 193 member states/nations, many of which are dictatorships. It has become a hotbed for graft and corruption, largely unaccountable, and the U.S. taxpayers pick up close to 25 percent of the annual bill. There was proven to be a huge kickback scandal surrounding them, U.N.'s "Oil-for-Food" fiasco in Iraq, as well as the sickening U.N. sex scandals in the Congo uncovered in <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2004-02">February of 2004</TIMEX3>. 
 
While no world war has transpired since the founding of the U.N., there have been 250 armed conflicts since <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="1945">1945</TIMEX3> — an average of four per year. The organization's history has also proven to be largely anti-Israel. The U.S. has been the leading protector of Israel, the only democracy in the Middle East. However, the <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> vote by the U.S. to abstain from (instead of veto) a U.N. Security Council measure negatively affecting Israel has stunned Democrats, Republicans and Israel. It was an unforgivable act of betraying our best ally in the Middle East. In <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2016-12">the last month</TIMEX3> of his presidency, and after the presidential election, President Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry showed their true feelings. 
 
The U.N has for decades been a feckless, corrupt organization with minimal accountability and integrity. We would be better off to exit the U.N. and create a new organization composed of democracies and member nations with a proven record of non-aggression and respect for basic human rights. The noble U.N. dream of <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="1945">1945</TIMEX3> never materialized and has become a <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> geopolitical quagmire.
