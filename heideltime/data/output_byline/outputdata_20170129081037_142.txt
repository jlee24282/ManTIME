Bebe Rexha wants to work with Kanye West.

The 27-year-old singer/ songwriter - who has written songs for stars including Rihanna and Eminem - would love to collaborate with the controversial rapper because she admires him for taking risks.

She told YOU magazine: ''I'd love to work with Kanye West. He's gone through a lot of stuff in the public eye, but his music is genius. He always takes risks.''

Kanye axed his 'Saint Pablo' tour <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3> after being admitted to hospital with suspected ''temporary psychosis'' but he is <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> hard at work on new music in a temporary studio he built at his Bel-Air mansion.

And the decision to launch himself back into his work might not come as a surprise to his famous family, as he wanted to work on his music and clothing line whilst he was still recovering in hospital.

A source said: ''Kanye keeps wanting to work. At the hospital, he requested that recording equipment be brought to the hospital so he can record in his bed. And he has kept asking to see sketches of his fashion lines.

''He continues to want to work and Kim Kardashian West has to keep telling him to rest.''
