About Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones  
Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones (<TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="1899">1899</TIMEX3>–<TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="1981">1981</TIMEX3>) has been described as "a great pillar of <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="19">the 20th century</TIMEX3> Evangelical Church". Born in Wales, and educated in London, he was a brilliant student who embarked upon a short, but successful, career as a medical doctor at the famous St Bartholemew's Hospital. However, the call of Gospel ministry was so strong that he left medicine in order to become minister of a mission hall in Port Talbot, South Wales. Eventually he was called to Westminster Chapel in London, where thousands flocked to hear his "full-blooded" Gospel preaching, described by one hearer as "logic on fire". With some <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="1600">1600</TIMEX3> of his sermons recorded and digitally restored, this has left a legacy which is <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> available for the blessing of another generation of Christians around the world — "Though being dead he still speaks".
