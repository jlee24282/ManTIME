He falls for a millennium, and when he does exit, he finds that very little time has elapsed on Earth, but <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> he has hitherto unknown powers, which he soon uses to aid people. However, another man, Lewis, of dubious character, is then taken into the Source; he falls for an even longer time, and when he returns, has greater powers than Rymalone, but then seeks to dominate the world. <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3>, in order to stop Lewis, Rymalone must return to the Source, willfully enter it, and endure the seemingly endless eons alone. Will he go in, and what will he become, if and when he comes out?
