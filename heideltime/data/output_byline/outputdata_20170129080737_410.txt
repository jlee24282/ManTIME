London has set a modern record for pollution after cold windless weather trapped emissions over the city.

For several moments between <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-17">17</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-24">24 January</TIMEX3> air quality was worse in the UK capital than in Beijing, which is infamous for smog.

An air quality index maintained at King's College London, which started in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2012">2012</TIMEX3>, found it was at its worst in history at 20 different sites. 

Pollution levels were twice the legal hourly limit, leading to the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, issuing his first “very high” pollution alert. 

“The shameful state of London’s toxic air <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3> has triggered a ‘very high’ air pollution alert under my new air quality warning system," he said in a tweet.

Mr Khan’s office estimates 9,400 premature deaths <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3> are caused by poor air quality in the capital.

<TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017">This year</TIMEX3> London reached its annual limit for pollution in just <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="P5D">five days</TIMEX3>. 

A text message warning from City Hall sent to people in affected boroughs read: “High air pollution forecast for <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017-01-26">Thursday</TIMEX3>. Consider spending less time outdoors, take medication. If unwell contact GP.”

City Hall is taking steps to address the problem. More hybrid buses are set to be used in the capital and if individuals wish to drive high-polluting vehicles there are set to be extra costs to do so.
