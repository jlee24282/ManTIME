PETALING JAYA: The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) must hold an emergency meeting to discuss the United States’ ban on all refugees and also travellers from seven Muslim-majority nations, Malaysia’s Opposition leader Dr Wan Azizah Wan Ismail said <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3> 
 
She said she was disappointed with an executive order by US President Donald Trump on immigration <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3>. 
 
“While immigration and border control is the right of each sovereign nation, a blanket ban is regrettable. 
 
“It is time for a serious reflection of the level of trust that exists between the <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> US administration and the Muslim world,” she said in a statement <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3>. 
 
On <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3>, the new president ordered a <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P4M">four-month</TIMEX3> suspension on allowing any refugee into the United States. 
 
Trump also temporarily barred travellers from Syria and six other Muslim-majority countries. 
 
He was reported as saying the move would protect Americans from terrorism. 
 
“It’s not a Muslim ban,” Trump was quoted as saying. 
 
Passport holders of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen are immediately affected by the ban. All visa applications from these countries are to be put on hold for <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="P90D">90 days</TIMEX3>. 
 
It also extends to green card holders who are legal permanent residents of the United States. 
 
Meanwhile, the New York Times has reported that a federal judge in New York has blocked part of Trump’s orders, preventing the US from deporting some arrivals. But the judge “stopped short of letting them into the country or issuing a broader ruling on the constitutionality of Mr. Trump’s actions,” the US paper reported.
