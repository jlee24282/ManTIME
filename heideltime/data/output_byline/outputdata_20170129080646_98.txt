In a <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> meeting with top DA officials, the World Bank expressed its interest for the conceptualization and rollout of agricultural development programs post-PRDP implementation, as well as smaller interventions that may be immediately implemented in addition to sub-projects being implemented under the PRDP. 
 
The institution is eyeing Mindanao as the pilot area for this new engagement with the Philippine government following the steps taken under the Mindanao Rural Development Program, the PRDP’s precursor. 
 
Mara Warwick, World Bank country director, said her team had earlier met with the Department of Finance and discussed a broader framework of engagement for Mindanao and other areas of the country. 
 
Initial ideas framed an engagement that would focus on comprehensively improving agricultural productivity along key value chains, hence strengthening production, connectivity and logistics, including human capital. 
 
Warwick said that on top of the PRDP, the World Bank considers exploring new program models that may be more community based. These may not also necessarily follow the requirements observed under the PRDP. 
 
Agriculture secretary Manny Piñol expressed his appreciation of the Bank’s continued interest, saying that even during the implementation of Mindanao Rural Development Program—which eventually evolved into what the PRDP is now—the engagements with the Bank have shown good potentials. 
 
Asked for his initial ideas, Piñol cited Sulu as a particular province in Mindanao the <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> administration feels in need of immediate response because of security-related issues. 
 
The World Bank is planning to conduct field scoping missions in <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2017-W03">the last week</TIMEX3> of <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2017-01">January</TIMEX3>, with various teams looking into possible engagement areas like trade, connectivity, human development, road network and logistics, and agricultural productivity.
