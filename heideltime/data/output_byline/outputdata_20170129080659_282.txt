While I agree with Norman McNickleâ€™s basic concept of collecting internet use tax, his article was clearly one-sided and he has apparently never had the experience of being involved in online sales ("State law to collect internet use tax is toothless," <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-19">Jan. 19</TIMEX3>).

As a small-business owner I am involved in both local sales and online sales. I have no problem with collecting and remitting Oklahoma state sales tax. There is a handy online application that I use and it takes me <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="PT1H">about an hour</TIMEX3> to total up the <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="SET" value="XXXX-XX">monthly</TIMEX3> sales and remit the tax.
