The Defend Trade Secret Act contains a whistleblower immunity provision which could have a significant impact on employers. Until <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2016-12">last month</TIMEX3>, however, no court had interpreted this provision which provides that no one "shall be held criminally or civilly liable under Federal or State trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret" made in confidence to a government official or an attorney and "solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law."
