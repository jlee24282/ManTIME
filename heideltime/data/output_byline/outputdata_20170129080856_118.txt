Claude Puel believes Southampton’s 5-0 defeat to Arsenal will be a valuable learning experience for many of his young players. 
  
Saints were dumped out of the Emirates FA Cup by the Gunners <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">yesterday</TIMEX3>, with Puel naming a youthful team for the fourth-round encounter. 

While it was a chastening afternoon, Puel explained that lessons can be learned from it. 

"It's hard. It's difficult to lose 5-0 at home,” he said. “It's a disappointment of course for our fans and these young players. 

“It's a good lesson. When we win, it's easy. In a bad moment it is a good time to learn. 

“But, of course, it's a difficult moment for young players to take a 5-0 defeat, but it was not possible to give them the best balance between experienced players and young players, because this moment is difficult for us on the physical side. 

“It's important to consider this, to analyse this game and this defeat. 

“We have a lot of injuries in the squad, and we continued with this game to improve our young players. It's important to give experience and it's a good lesson for the future for all these young players.”
