A country vixen and consummate “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,” an original “Star Trek" crew member, a legendary L.A.-funk/modern rock combo, the creative force behind Creedence Clearwater Revival and an “X-Files" agent undercover as a rock star are some of the acts making the rounds in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-02">February</TIMEX3>. 
 
Platinum winning streak 
 
Miranda Lambert, <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-02-02">Feb. 2</TIMEX3>, Dunkin’ Donuts Center, Providence, R.I.; <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-02-03">Feb. 3</TIMEX3>, Mullins Center, Boston; and <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-02-04">Feb. 4</TIMEX3>, Mohegan Sun Arena, Uncasville, Conn. 
 
Six albums into her career, it is safe to say that Miranda Lambert is a platinum expert. 
 
All of her previous albums have gone platinum and her platinum blond locks have done her right. 
 
Despite finishing third on "Nashville Star" (country music's "American Idol") in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2003">2003</TIMEX3> (who was she against, Patsy Cline and Jesus Christ?), Lambert has the distinction of becoming the only artist in the history of Billboard’s country albums chart to debut at No. 1 with all of her first six albums, and she has won seven consecutive Academy of Country Music Female Vocalist of the Year Awards, which is another record. 
 
Not only is she arguably the best young female country artist out there <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">today</TIMEX3>, Lambert - who practices her right to bear arms and burn bridges, homes, you name it - is quite possibly <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">today</TIMEX3>'s best female rocker. 
 
Lambert is expected to continue her platinum-winning streak with her latest chart-topper, “The Weight of These Wings,” and concert trek, dubbed the “Highway Vagabond Tour.” 
 
The Needs of the Many Outweigh the Needs of the Few 
 
George Takei Live Plus a Screening of “Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,” <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-02-03">Feb. 3</TIMEX3>, Boch Center Wang Theatre, Boston. 
 
There’s a new trend popping up in classy theaters and concert halls across the country in <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="PXY">the last few years</TIMEX3>: the screening of a beloved movie accompanied by one of its stars fielding audience’s questions and supplying colorful behind-the-scenes commentary afterwards. 
 
In <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2016">the last year</TIMEX3> or so, we have had John Cleese with “Monty Python and The Holy Grail,” Barry Bostwick with “The Rocky Horror Picture Show,” Cary Elwes with “The Princess Bride” (all three at The Hanover Theatre for the Performing Arts in Worcester) and Mel Brooks with “Blazing Saddles.” 
 
The latest celebrity appearance/film screening pairing is the strangest - George Takei with “Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.” 
 
As any good Trekkie knows, this is the best “Star Trek” movie in the franchise and worthy to be seen again on the big screen again and again. And Takei (aka Lt. Hikaru Sulu, helmsman of the USS Enterprise) has become the most popular crew member of the original cast in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent years</TIMEX3>, mainly for his appearances on “The Howard Stern Show” where he has been very candid (and very funny) about being gay and his lingering hostility to William Shatner (aka Captain James T. Kirk). 
 
While it is always great to listen to Takei, Sulu is a very minor character in “The Wrath of Khan.” Heck, Chekov (Walter Koenig) even has a bigger role in this movie than Takei and has a memorable line to boot (“He put creatures in our bodies”). 
 
If they wanted to do this right, Takei should be paired with a screening of Sulu’s proudest moment (and the last great “Star Trek” movie) “Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country” or even 1968’s “The Green Berets” opposite “The Duke.” 
 
Blood Sugar Sex Magik 
 
Red Hot Chili Peppers, <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2017-02-07">Feb. 7</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2017-02-08">8</TIMEX3>, TD Garden, Boston. 
 
Combining the best elements of rap, funk and rock, Grammy Award-winning, Rock and Roll Hall of Famers Red Hot Chili Peppers are expected to give Bay State fans a complete funk workout when they hit the TD Garden in support of their latest (and seventh Top 10 album over), “The Getaway.” 
 
With a combustible mix of roaring guitar chords, crashing drum beats and locomotive bass lines, this LA funk-modern rock combo still erupts into a funk-rock maelstrom that is guaranteed to knock one's strategically placed tube sox off. 
 
In addition to Josh Klinghoffer (who seamlessly replaced the band’s longtime guitarist John Frusciante), the Red Hot Chili Peppers boast blistering bassist Flea and powder-keg drummer Chad Smith, arguably the best rhythm section in rock. On top of that, singer Anthony Kiedis has never sounded better. 
 
If past Chili Peppers shows have taught us anything, expect Kiedis to be fast, furious and in your face, while Klinghoffer's stinging guitar licks, Flea's snarling bass lines and Smith's bone-crunching drumbeats laying down the heavy-laden, funk-rock jams with no foreseeable end. 
 
Centerfield 
 
John Fogerty, <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2017-02-16">Feb. 16</TIMEX3>, Grand Theater at Foxwoods, Mashantucket, Conn. 
 
Not since the Vietnam War/Richard Nixon era has our country been so divided. And hopefully, like the turbulent ‘<TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="196">60s</TIMEX3> before it, we will survive as a nation and have produced some great protest songs. One of the greatest protest songs of the Vietnam Era was “Fortunate Son” from Rock and Roll Hall and Creedence Clearwater of Famer John Fogerty. 
 
Releasing a self-titled debut in <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="1968">1968</TIMEX3> and three albums in <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="1969">1969</TIMEX3>, Creedence Clearwater Revival became a rock 'n' roll staple before Fogerty disbanded it in <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="1972">1972</TIMEX3> over contract disputes with Fantasy Records, as well as infighting among the band members. While this feud raged for <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DURATION" value="P3DE" mod="MORE_THAN">more than three decades</TIMEX3>, it also made Fogerty stay clear of his classic swamp blues-rock-country-folk boogie that was "Born on the Bayou." 
 
Well, the feud is <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> over and Fogerty is embracing his rich musical legacy while playing all those great Creedence songs (including “Bad Moon Rising,” “Down on the Corner,” "Have You Ever Seen the Rain,” “Proud Mary,” “Suzie Q” and “Who’ll Stop the Rain”) that found a place in the hearts of rock lovers everywhere. 
 
The Truth Is Out There 
 
David Duchovny, <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2017-02-22">Feb. 22</TIMEX3>, The Wilbur Theatre, Boston. 
 
Joining the ranks of Jeff Bridges, Billy Bob Thornton, Russell Crowe, Johnny Depp, Hugh Laurie, Keanu Reeves and Kiefer Sutherland, David Duchovny is the latest actor who thinks he’s a rock star. 
 
Beloved as Fox Mulder on “The X-Files” and Hank Moody on “Californication (as well as cross-dressing DEA agent Denise Bryson on “Twin Peaks” and hilariously playing himself on “The Larry Sanders Show”), the New York-born and -bred, Yale-educated, Golden Globe-winning, New York Times Best Selling author is out on the road performing songs from his <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3> debut “Hell or Highwater,” along with some brand-new tracks. 
 
With a sound described as a combination of folk rock and alternative rock with elements of country, Duchovny cites Leonard Cohen, Bob Dylan, Wilco, R.E.M. and the Flaming Lips. 
 
Only time will tell if this close encounter with Duchovny will be “Spooky” (in a bad way) or out of this world.
