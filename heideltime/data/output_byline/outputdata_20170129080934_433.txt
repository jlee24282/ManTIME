Important Announcement  
As of <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-31">January 31, 2017</TIMEX3>, CBS Local will no longer be a part of the mPLUS Rewards network. 
At that time, registered users will no longer accrue points by visiting CBS Local sites; however, users will be 
able to start earning and redeeming mPLUS reward points following the instructions below. 

 
Don't worry -- you will not lose your mPLUS Rewards account or any of your points. 
You can keep enjoying mPLUS Rewards in many other apps. 
 Here's how: 
Check out the mPLus Rewards apps in iTunes or find one on the mPLUS Rewards website.  Download an app you're interested in & log into mPLUS Rewards.  You'll see your point balance & can start earning points again!   
If you have any questions, please contact us at: support@audioadcenter.com 
 
Thank you for your attention, please continue to CBS Local Rewards
