And he has also taken pictures of places and buildings in Scunthorpe that in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EVERY">every day</TIMEX3> life we might take for granted. 
 
Mr Riach said: "At The Pods you can get some lovely reflections from the pond." 
 
He also gave these tips for anyone looking to get into photography: 
 
"My advice is that if you're just starting and you're not sure if you'll continue with it, is not to spend to much initially. I started by buying cameras on Ebay," he said. 
 
He added that it was best to start off with a more basic camera and to build up and that there are plenty of places to get help and advice. 
 
He said: "There are loads of online and Facebook amateur groups who share pictures and chat about their images and you can find tutorials on YouTube."
