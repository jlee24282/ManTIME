About the Performers 
 
Simon, a distinguished pianist and nonagenarian, returns to the stage for his first performance following a hiatus due to a terrible car accident. Debargue, the French pianist who stirred audiences and critics during the <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3> International Tchaikovsky Competition, has been praised for his “incredible gift, artistic vision, and creative freedom.” Driver, one of Britain’s most respected and versatile pianists, has earned numerous awards during his career and has been applauded for his “impeccable technique and musicianship.” American pianist Schein, internationally recognized as a leader in the field, will present a poetic recital for the festival that will demonstrate her unique “grasp of style, her technical fluency, [and] her ability to make a melody sing out.”
