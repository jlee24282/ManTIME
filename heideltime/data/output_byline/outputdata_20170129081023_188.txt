President Akufo-Addo has appointed a criminologist, Prof. Ken Agyeman Attafuah as the acting Executive Secretary of the National Identification Authority (NIA). 
 
The appointment is among the few undertaken by the president <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-W04">this week</TIMEX3> to change the leadership of most government institutions following his assumption of office. 
 
Professor Ken Attafuah, a former deputy chair of the Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice (CHRAJ), and <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> the Dean of the Faculty of Law at Central University. 
 
His appointment comes at a time when the New Patriotic Party (NPP) government has reinforced its commitment to carryout out a national identification project having held a broad consultative meeting on the project <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-W04" mod="START">earlier this week</TIMEX3>, chaired by Vice President, Dr Mahamamudu Bawumia. 
 
The NPP in the run up to this year’s elections stated that it would embark on a National Identification project to register all Ghanaians to get accurate data on citizens. 
 
The commitment has received a lot of endorsement by citizens and was <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> lauded by the founder of the Progressive People’s Party (PPP), Dr Papa Kwesi Nduom believes the government must be supported to successfully complete it. 
 
Professor Atta Ken Agyeman Attafuah will become the substantive head of the NIA after a newly constituted NIA governing council approves his appointment in consultation with the Public Services Commission.
