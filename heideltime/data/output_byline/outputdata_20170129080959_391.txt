Thane, <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Jan 29</TIMEX3> (PTI) A local resident, who was “deported” from Bangkok while on a family vacation in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2007">2007</TIMEX3> due to an alleged goof-up by passport authorities, failed to get relief from Thane Consumer Forum which disposed of his complaint on the ground that the matter involves recording of evidences and submission of proofs. 
 
In its <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> order the forum chaired by President Sneha Mhatre and members N D Kadam and Madhuri Vishwarupe observed that the matter cannot be decided summarily as it involved recording of evidences and directed complainant Ashish Vaidya to approach appropriate court with his case. 
 
In his complaint Vaidya, a resident of Thane had filed the case against the Ministry of External Affairs through the Thane Passport Superintendent for “sufferings” caused during the Bangkok tour, which he could not complete due to the alleged goof up of the passport office. 
 
Vaidya contended that he was issued a passport for a period starting from <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="1998-01-13">January 13, 1998</TIMEX3> till <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2018-01-12">January 12, 2018</TIMEX3>. 
 
When he along with his family undertook a trip to Bangkok on <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2007-10-22">October 22, 2007</TIMEX3> during the immigration check it was noticed that there was an overwriting on the passport in the expiry date section. The date printed was <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3> and over it was written as <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2018">2018</TIMEX3>. 
 
The figure ‘1’ was manually written in place of ‘0’ in the passport. The immigration officials sought an explanation from Vaidya and only after they got it in writing from him that he had not written the same, allowed him to undertake the trip, says the complaint filed by Vaidya. 
 
However, at the Bangkok airport immigration officials verified online details of the passport and it was revealed that the expiry date was <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3> and not <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2018">2018</TIMEX3>. 
 
“The passport office rectified the expiry date by manually changing it from <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2018">2018</TIMEX3>, but failed to make the necessary changes in their system,” pointed out Vaidya’s complaint. 
 
Upon this they did not allow him to enter the country and deported him to India. (MORE)
