For author Anne Soares, her latest book is more than just a fun story. It is a labor of love allows Soares to put her money where her heart is. 
 
A portion of every sale of “Chuck’s Journey Home” goes to animal shelters and dog rescue operations, for which Soares is also willing to assist with setting up fundraising programs upon request. 
 
In her book, when Chuck, a four-year-old black Labrador, is dropped off at a shelter, he does not realize it is because his family is moving to a home that doesn't allow dogs. 
 
He feels sad and betrayed. He joins a group of other dogs who are all waiting for new families to take them to new homes. 
 
Chuck only has other dogs to explain to him that he is living at a shelter. There are some nice people there, but none of them have the time for him the way his human Mom and Dad did. 
 
As Chuck found out, “There's nothing better than a loving forever home.” 
 
Eventually, he makes it to a new home, several states away, with a new family welcoming him with open arms. 
 
The story was inspired by the author's own adoption of a black Labrador, Charlie, who is <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> 10 years old. 
 
“It was important to me to create something that would serve a much greater purpose,” said Soares. “Writing ‘Chuck’s Journey Home’ gave me the opportunity to honor our own rescued dog and share the plight of shelter dogs all over. The hope is that, over time, more people will consider visiting their local shelters and adopt their pets.” 
 
The book is written for readers aged six to nine. 
 
“It is ideal for any family looking to adopt a dog, or any family who loves dogs,” Soares said. 
 
“Chuck's Journey Home” can be purchased through SDP Publishing, Amazon, Barnes and Noble, and at most online retailers. It can also be found at www.LabTales.com.
