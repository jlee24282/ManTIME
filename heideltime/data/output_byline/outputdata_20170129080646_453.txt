Disclaimer 
 
My attention has been drawn to this campaign making the rounds on Facebook https://web.facebook.com/OkonjoIwealaAdesina2019Rescue/… 
 
I have nothing to do with this and I urge those behind it to stop, as I am focused on other things. 
 
While I thank those who want to have my name constantly in the headlines for one important position or the other in the country, rest assured I am fully occupied with my international assignments and loving it. 
 
Best.
