I appreciated the editorial comments this <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-22">past Sunday</TIMEX3> about the dangers of groupthink. I had to laugh reading about that moment when you all realized that the path was much longer than anyone expected or was prepared for. Haven’t we all done that? Somewhat lost, stuck in the mud, on slippery slopes and even turning on each other a bit before refocusing on the task — what great analogies for the situation we’re in. 
  
What can we do to avoid the pitfalls so well described here? We each need to assess the situation for ourselves, to think for ourselves, and speak up about our concerns and cautions. That means asking how do we know what we know. Some decisions are made on how we feel in our gut, but there are decisions where the gut needs the mind. More information is called for. Talking it over with trusted friends and family. Talking it over with someone different than you. Being curious, investigative. Knowing history is called for. Knowing what inspires you. Knowing the sources of your information, and knowing the sources’ biases and financial incentives — who stands to gain? Would a powerful leader have prevented this predicament? Maybe, but a leader can be just as lost and afraid to admit something was a bad idea as anyone else. So, yes, I would say we keep questioning leaders as well as ourselves. 
 
We have elected President Trump. I’m thinking about that and asking what are the signs saying? In the soap operas and movies, the greatest betrayals occur right after the words “Trust me.” Trust is earned. And Mr. Trump will earn our trust by releasing his tax returns, disclosing conflicts of interest, and divesting of his business interests. He is accountable to us, the American people. We pay his salary, his expenses, and protect him and his family. How do we know where his debts, obligations, deals, or profits, are — who is he beholden to, who is he profiting from? Is he being blackmailed? We don’t know. Why would a president, who has pledged to uphold the highest law of the land, fudge on something this crucial to our country’s well-being? Does he have our nation’s interest at heart, or his own, or the Russian’s? Groupthink will not save us. Questions, and answers, <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3>, might.
