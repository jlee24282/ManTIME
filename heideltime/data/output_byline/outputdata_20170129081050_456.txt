COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. Freshman goalie Alex Leclerc made a career-high 45 saves to lead Colorado College to a 3-0 win over North Dakota <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> in the National Collegiate Hockey Conference. 
 
The winning goal for the Tigers with just <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="PT30S">30 seconds</TIMEX3> left in the first period was a deflection off a UND player. Luc Gerdes got credit for the goal. Sam Rothstein and Alex Berardinelli added empty-net goals in the third period. 
 
The victory was the first for the Tigers (7-17-2, 3-11-2 NCHC) at home this season. It also snapped a 14-game winless streak against UND (14-10-3, 7-8-1-1) and ended the Fighting Hawks' seven-game road winning streak. 
 
Matt Hrynkiw got his first start of the season in goal for North Dakota and made 17 saves. The 12th-ranked Hawks have lost four of their last six games.
