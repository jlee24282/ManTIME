The movies vying for top honors at the Producers Guild Awards are nearly identical to those up for best picture at the Oscars, with the exception of "Deadpool." 

Producers included the superhero romp among its 10 nominees for the Darryl F. Zanuck Award, along with "Arrival," "Fences," "Hidden Figures," "Hacksaw Ridge," "Hell or High Water," "Lion," "La La Land," "Manchester By the Sea" and "Moonlight." 

The winner will be revealed <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="TIME" value="2017-02-04TNI">Saturday night</TIMEX3> during a ceremony at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills, California. Producers have predicted the Oscars' best-picture winner for seven of the eight <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2016">past years</TIMEX3>.
