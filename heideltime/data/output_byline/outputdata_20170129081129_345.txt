Description: 
If you have given up on New Year’s resolutions because they just don’t work for you, then creating a vision board is a great alternative. Successful people like Katy Perry, Ellen DeGeneres, and Oprah Winfrey swear they intentionally create incredible outcomes using vision boards. And they don't just quickly slap a bunch of stuff on a board. It's a thoughtful process of clarity, connection, and inspiration. This workshop is a full-day immersive experience.
