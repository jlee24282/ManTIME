I have some thoughts on the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact. 
 
In the <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3> election, roughly 70 percent of West Virginians voted for Trump. Had the NPVIC been in effect, W.Va. electors would have been required to cast their votes for Hillary Clinton because she won the nationwide popular vote. The same would be true in all the states Trump carried. The NPVIC would have made electors puppets of Clinton and the Democratic Party. 
 
Thankfully, the NPVIC was not in effect in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3>. 
 
We elect our members of congress and senators to represent us in Washington. We should choose our electors to do the same in the Electoral College. If electors aren’t free to represent their constituents, why have electors? Why have an Electoral College? 
 
The Electoral College concept reflects our founding fathers’ concerns with separation of powers and checks and balances to prevent a future tyranny in our country. That is the reason they gave the individual states so much power and latitude in the selection of their electors and the rules concerning how electors vote. 
 
The NPVIC negates those separations of powers and checks and balances by shifting the power to decide elections into the blue state population centers and leaving rural red states out of the process. 
 
Allowing too much power in the hand of any one individual, political group or area of the country is a form of tyranny. 
 
The , period. 
 
In his <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-01-15">Jan. 15</TIMEX3> letter, Ralph Chambers correctly states “Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of a religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof” appears in the First Amendment. 
 
Mr. Chambers graciously makes my case for me. No where is the term “separation of church and state” mentioned in the Constitution. 
 
The term “separation of church and state” was coined in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="196">the 1960s</TIMEX3> when liberal judges began their attacks on our religious freedoms by banning prayer and Bible reading in public schools. Those decisions should be made by parents, local schools and local officials, not the federal government. 
 
Since then, nativity scenes have been banned from public squares, praying before football games, even saying “Merry <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2016-12-25">Christmas</TIMEX3>” is forbidden for fear of offending some atheist. 
 
<TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> one atheist can restrict the free exercise of religion by the majority. 
 
What part of “prohibiting the free exercise thereof” can’t liberals understand?
