Authorities are preparing for the worst fire danger day of the <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3>-<TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> fire season with soaring temperatures coupled with gusty winds pushing the region into a severe danger period. Authorities are preparing for the worst fire danger day of the <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3>-<TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> fire season with soaring temperatures coupled with gusty winds pushing the region into a severe danger period. CFA district 15 duty officer Kade Dowie has urged residents to keep updated on the local fire situation and ensure they have fire action plans in place and are prepared to leave early. 

A total fire ban day has been declared statewide with temperatures in the Ballarat region expected to peak at 32 degrees followed by a slight change in the mid-afternoon which will bring gusts of around 40km/h. 

“We are expecting what we a call a spike day in the fire index,” Mr Dowie said.

“We are expecting some very hot temperatures and some reasonably strong winds followed by a change in the mid to later afternoon.

“The fire danger will peak before the change comes through.” 

Bureau of Meteorology forecaster Richard Russell said Monday’s fire danger was the most severe during a so far subdued fire season. 

CFA will prepare for the brutal conditions by running an incident control centre from <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="TIME" value="XXXX-XX-XXT08:00">8am</TIMEX3> and ensuring crews are on stand-by through out the day. 

Ground crews continue to be supported by automatic dispatch aircraft from the Ballarat airport and a <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P1D">one-day</TIMEX3>-only Black Hawk aircraft. 

<TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-SP" mod="END">Late spring</TIMEX3> weather and rain led to high fuel growth in region. Much of that has not been able to be slashed and is continuing to dry out and poses a significant risk of high fire danger days. 

“There’s significant fuel in the district and that intensifies the problem. (The danger) is pretty much throughout the whole state of Victoria, right from north western Victoria all the way through,” Mr Dowie said. 

He has reminded all Victorians to ensure they are aware of the restrictions on a total fire ban.

“That high risk activity, we are asking people to delay till later in the week We are really asking them to be smart as well as well (do what is) legal – use common sense,” Mr Dowie said.

Temperatures are expected to plunge on <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="TIME" value="2017-01-23TNI">Monday night</TIMEX3> with temperatures on <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2017-01-24">Tuesday</TIMEX3> expected to reach a maximum of 23.

Conditions will remain cool through the week, with temperatures picking up on <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>. Mr Russell said low wind activity forecast for <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2017-02-04">the following week</TIMEX3> would significantly reduce the fire risk.
