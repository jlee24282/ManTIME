So of course, it's pretty shocking to hear that Kendall actually kept a huge secret from both her parents back during her days as a high-school student. 
 
Kendall, who was homeschooled for a majority of her teens, shared that the craziest thing she ever did "during that time was fib to my parents about where I was at night". 
 
"I've grown up a lot since [high school], but I feel like, personality-wise at least, I was pretty similar to how I am <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3>". The "Keeping Up With the Kardashians" star has opened up about feeling so mortified about telling mother Kris Jenner and her father Caitlyn - formerly Bruce Jenner - of her relationships because she thought she would get told of. "Because my parents weren't very strict, Ky and I were super responsible", she wrote. The supermodel, <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> 21, took to her blog on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday, January 27</TIMEX3>, to share the "wildest thing" she ever did in high school. "We'd invite a bunch of people over to hang out but it was never a rager, lol". They were OK with it if we went to parties because they knew we weren't getting into trouble-we never did anything that bad! 
 
"My dad didn't really know I had a boyfriend!" 
 
So if there was a mutual level of trust between Kendall and her parents, what could possibly be enough to make the model lie and what more importantly what was the lie about?
