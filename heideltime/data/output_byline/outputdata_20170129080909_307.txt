LEXINGTON, Ky. — John Calipari had just finished talking extensively — about how he felt his young Kentucky team was “out-toughed” by Kansas and not where it needed to be defensively in a 79-73 loss — when he noticed his counterpart holding court with a couple of reporters in a hallway in the bowels of Rupp Arena.

Calipari tapped Jayhawks coach Bill Self on the left shoulder, wishing Self a safe trip back to Kansas. “Great job,” Calipari said.

And Self went back to answering the question at hand, a question that was worth asking Calipari as well had he lingered just <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DURATION" value="PT1S">a second</TIMEX3> longer: Was Self surprised at how effective Kansas’s zone was against Kentucky’s explosive offense?

“Yeah, I was,” Self said. “We don’t play it.”

But the Jayhawks do practice it quite a bit. They work on their standard 2-3 zone, which they utilized <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> against Kentucky after facing an early 12-point deficit, and also their triangle-and-two, which they played for a few possessions, too.

MORE HOOPS:

“There aren’t going to be any educational videos on that zone,” Self said. “But we would not have won the game unless we switched up.”

Self said he hasn’t changed defenses that much in one game in a while — at least, not without foul trouble dictating the decision, like it did when Kansas played Georgia back in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2016-11">November</TIMEX3>. But he wanted to do something to shake Kentucky’s shooters. Plus, he was dealing with an unusually short rotation after announcing the indefinite suspension of Carlton Bragg Jr. prior to Saturday’s game.

“I thought our zone won the game for us for one reason: It allowed Frank (Mason III) and Devonte’ (Graham) to play <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="PT37M">37 minutes</TIMEX3> for us and not be totally gassed,” Self said.

Mason and Graham make up one of the nation’s top backcourts, and they went up against another of the country’s best in Kentucky’s. But, as it often does, experience trumped youth. There was no panic or fear in either player’s eyes as Kansas faced that early hole. They knew they’d been in situations like this before and could turn things around. They understood why and how the zone helped, and how to do whatever was required to leave Rupp with a win. It helped slow down the game, and it helped guard against Kentucky’s greatest strength — its transition offense.

“It also gave us a chance to catch our breath on the defensive end because we don’t have that many guys,” Mason said. “Hopefully we don’t have to do it too much more because we take pride in playing man and defending our man.”

MORE HOOPS:

There were myriad other reasons Kansas walked out of this arena with arguably its gutsiest win of the season — coming off a loss at West Virginia, without Bragg and amid a police investigation into an alleged <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2016-12">December</TIMEX3> rape in which five Kansas players are considered witnesses. Freshman Josh Jackson was the best freshman on the court, outshining Malik Monk, De’Aaron Fox and the rest of the Kentucky superstars who sputtered down the stretch while Jackson and company took over.

But the best example of all of why Self and his program are so good and, more important, so consistently good is this: That he switched to a zone defense against one of the most dynamic offenses in the country — and it worked. It wasn’t notable, it wasn’t tricky. But it forced Kentucky to work harder and play differently, and the 'Cats couldn’t do it.

It was that simple.
