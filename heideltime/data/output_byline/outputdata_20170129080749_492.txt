By PORTSMOUTH — Stratacuity holds a special niche not only in Patrick Marshall’s professional life, but in his personal life as well. 
 
Marshall is chief business officer of Stratacuity at 1 Cate St., a staff and recruiting business that specializes in biopharmaceutical companies. 
 
He is also the father of Kate, who was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P7M">seven months</TIMEX3> after her birth <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2000">17 years ago</TIMEX3>. Cystic fibrosis is a disorder affecting the exocrine glands that, among other symptoms, can cause breathing problems. 
 
Her diagnosis was a factor in the creation of Stratacuity (a combination of Strategy and Acuity) by Marshall and co-founder and Chief Operating Officer Rob Patten in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2001">2001</TIMEX3>, and it continues to propel the company <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3> in its effort to affect advancements in biomedical research and medicine. 
 
“It’s not just a good market,” Patten said of the biopharmaceutical industry, “it puts people, scientists in a position to make a real difference.” 
 
That includes making a difference for people such as Kate, who at age 15, as an all-star soccer player and student athlete at York High School, was named a Sports Illustrated High School Athlete of the Month for <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2014-12">December 2014</TIMEX3>. 
 
Marshall and Patten worked together in a recruiting company that specialized in high technology in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="199" mod="END">the late 1990s</TIMEX3>. 
 
With Kate’s birth and diagnosis, Marshall – describing himself as “sad, scared” – did what every parent would do. He learned as much about the ailment as he possibly could including its treatments, research to address it and what options there were to not only manage the disorder but perhaps find a longer-term prognosis. 
 
“My curiosity got the best of me,” he said. 
 
His research pointed him to what was happening in biopharma in the Boston/Cambridge area of Massachusetts and the venture capital investments that were being made in the research. 
 
“That was something Rob and I could relate to,” he said. 
 
They tried to spin off a division specific to the biopharma industry within the recruiting company they were working for but met resistance, so they struck out on their own, creating Stratacuity and operating initially in a small office on Islington Street. 
 
“The philosophy early on was to get a good client and then do everything they wanted us to do,” Patten said. 
 
There are two parts to the business – the recruiting and the staffing. 
 
For the recruitment part, Stratacuity identifies top talent to, as it says, help companies handle “a wide range of scientific skill sets to find your needle-in-the-haystack talent.” 
 
“As long as patients need innovative medicines,” Patten said in his LinkedIn profile, “I will be helping my clients hire the best scientists to discover and develop them.” 
 
Stratacuity develops a relationship – ideally a long-term relationship – with the people it recruits. 
 
“It’s a relationship, it’s not transactional,” Marshall said. “When we connect with someone we can see a great number of years ahead that we’ll be working together.” 
 
Stratacuity started its staffing part of the business in <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2006">2006</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> has 100 of its employees contracted out to various biopharma and biotechnology companies mostly in the Boston/Cambridge area. 
 
Stratacuity has 25 people working at its Cate Street location, where it’s been since <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2007">2007</TIMEX3>. According to Marshall and Patten, the privately held company has, on average, doubled its revenue in each of <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DURATION" value="P2Y">the last 24 months</TIMEX3>. 
 
They love Portsmouth and have no intention of leaving. 
 
“There’s no reason to move away from such a beautiful place,” said Marshall, and they recruit heavily from the University of New Hampshire in Durham. 
 
And they have strong beliefs of what New Hampshire should do in terms of enhancing its job growth, particularly around biotech. Forget about biotech and biopharma research, they say, and concentrate instead on biotech and biopharma manufacturing. 
 
“We need more Lonzas,” Marshall said in reference to Lonza Biologics, the company at Pease International Tradeport that custom manufactures ingredients for pharmaceutical products. 
 
New Hampshire can’t compete with Boston and particularly Cambridge for the research end of the industry, but they say Lonza has shown the state has a capacity to attract and keep the manufacturing end. 
 
“We can start being proactive that we want to be a bio-manufacturing state,” Marshall said. “We have to learn how to start making these drugs perfect every time.” 
 
Stratacuity’s passion for making a difference is also evident in its community outreach. 
 
As an example, for <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2016-12-25">Christmas</TIMEX3> employees all received Yeti coolers, and they collectively decided, rather than keep the coolers, to fill with them with non-perishable food and donate them to the Seacoast Family Food Pantry. Each cooler holds about 20 to 30 pounds of food and 18 coolers were filled. 
 
Patten himself is a <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3> recipient of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Breath of Life Award that is given to someone not personally afflicted by the disease but who makes a difference in the foundation’s work. 
 
“Rob has been there for 15-plus years,” Marshall said in a video created to mark the company’s 15th anniversary. “He was there for <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DURATION" value="PXD">a few days</TIMEX3> at my house after Kate was diagnosed. He was at the first golf tournament that my wife and I had to raise money for CF. And he said yes when I told him about this idea of starting a recruitment company to make a difference in the lives of people.” 
 
The professional outreach Stratacuity does within the industry has also made a difference. 
 
Marshall said at least three companies have started CF research at his suggestion. 
 
“It was really rewarding to help influence them,” he said.
