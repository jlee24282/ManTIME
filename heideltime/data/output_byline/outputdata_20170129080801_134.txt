Theatre Tulsa’s Broadway Bash Any good theatrical presentation requires planning and rehearsals. Theatre Tulsa took the first steps toward presenting its annual Broadway Bash fundraising gala with a kickoff party <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-21">Jan. 21</TIMEX3>.

Hosted by Pat Hobbs and John Orsulak, the evening brought together supporters and board members of Theatre Tulsa and the Arts and Humanities Council of Tulsa, which will be honored at this year’s gala with the <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> Champion of the Arts award.

This year’s Broadway Bash, to be held <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-03-31">March 31</TIMEX3>, will have a “Moulin Rouge” theme, so guests at the kickoff party sampled French-themed hors d’oeuvres, champagne and a signature cocktail titled the French Kiss.

The party also marked the start of a special raffle that will conclude at the gala, with the winner receiving a five-night trip to Paris, France. Only 100 tickets at $100 will be sold for the raffle. The gala will also include wine and jewelry pulls and a silent auction, performances by Theatre Tulsa artists of music from “Les Miserables,” and the announcement of the company’s 95th annual season of shows.
