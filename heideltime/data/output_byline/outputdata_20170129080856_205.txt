A native of eastern Oklahoma, Haskell (lovingly referred to as "Hack") graduated from Spiro High School in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="1951">1951</TIMEX3>, and attended Northeastern State University in Tahlequah. He left college to play baseball in Modesto, Calif., eventually joining a farm team for the Cincinnati Reds. Following a <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="P2Y">two year</TIMEX3> stint in semi-pro baseball, Haskell joined the United States Navy, where he served honorably for <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="P6Y">six years</TIMEX3>. During his time in the Navy, he continued to play baseball and taught English in addition to his other duties. Following military service, Haskell engaged in various business pursuits, eventually relocating to Houston, Texas, where he stayed for <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P21Y">21 years</TIMEX3>. It was during that time that he met and married his wife of <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="P39Y">39 years</TIMEX3>, Patricia. 
 
In <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="1996">1996</TIMEX3>, Haskell and Patricia retired to Waveland, Miss., to live near the beach. They enjoyed nine wonderful years there and viewed it as one of the happiest times of their lives. Their retirement was interrupted in <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2005">2005</TIMEX3> when Hurricane Katrina demolished their home. Having experienced one hurricane too many, they relocated to Fort Smith. 
 
Haskell was known to all as a kind and gracious man, quick with a joke and generous with his laughter. For a time, he parlayed these traits into a part-time job as an auctioneer — something he enjoyed immensely. He had a gentle spirit, and would pull his car over to rescue a lost animal or stop on the sidewalk to help a stranger. Love and kindness are the qualities that most epitomized his life. The world is a poorer place without his generous spirit. 
 
Haskell's family expresses special appreciation to the skilled professionals of Peachtree Hospice who provided loving care to Haskell as he transitioned from this life to the next. 
 
To honor Haskell's wishes, a private memorial service is planned for <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2017-SP">the spring</TIMEX3> in Waveland, Miss. 
 
Arrangements are under the direction of Edwards Funeral Home.
