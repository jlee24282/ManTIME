The official music video for TobyMac’s “Love Broke Thru,”  is exploring the power of love and compassion in the face of adversity. Featuring a young man grappling with his anger amidst his grandfather’s calls for peace, the video tackles the subject of protests that have been happening around the country. <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Currently</TIMEX3>,  the single is approaching the Top 10 on the National Christian Airplay chart with an audience of 6.4 million. 
 
“The song was written about how God broke through in my life and we thought the video could be a symbolic picture of how we need God to break through and heal our divided nation,” TobyMac told  Billboard. “There are a lot of voices out there saying which way we should go and a lot of dialogue needs to happen but at the end of the day, we need love to break through if we are going to come together.”
