“Samantha will be wearing a specially designed outfit by Kresha Bajaj. She’s really excited about it,” the source said. 
 
Chaitanya and Samantha first met on the sets of Gautham Vasudev Menon’s Telugu romantic-drama “Ye Maaya Chesave” and went on to work together in films such as “Autonagar Surya” and “Manam”.
