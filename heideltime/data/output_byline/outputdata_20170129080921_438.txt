"(Injured forward) Brad (Newley) is a very strong chance to play <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2017-W05">next week</TIMEX3> and he'd be a great addition to have back in there." 
 
Breakers coach Paul Henare basically said his team gave up. 
 
"There's an underlying 'quit' in us when things get tough and that's concerning," Henare said. 
 
"If we go to Adelaide <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2017-W05">next week</TIMEX3> and play like that, we'll get beat by 5
