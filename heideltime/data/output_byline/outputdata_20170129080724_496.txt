<TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="1942-01-29">Jan. 29, 1942</TIMEX3>, in The Star:  There is yet considerable organizational work to be completed before Anniston will be prepared for a test “blackout,” but committee chairmen whose functions related to this phase of civilian defense will soon have their work well under way. For example, W.T. Morton is head of the air raid wardens. The duty of the wardens is to see that all lights are extinguished and more volunteers are needed for this work. Those who serve on the committee will be given all instructions they need.  Also this date:  Calhoun County Sheriff A.H. Borders <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3> urged that all automobile owners check and make a record of the numbers on their tires. That information will help authorities get them back to their owner if they are stolen — not an unforeseeable crime in these days of rubber conservation. 
   
<TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="1992-01-29">Jan. 29, 1992</TIMEX3>, in The Star:  The Anniston City Council <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TNI">last night</TIMEX3> approved liquor licenses for three establishments: City Limits lounge at <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="1214">1214</TIMEX3> Noble, The Peerless at 13 W. 10th St. and, by a vote of 3-2, the Hitching Post at 3900 U.S. 431 North. That third one drew opposition from many of its neighbors.  Also this date:  A small groundbreaking ceremony was held <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3> in northern Calhoun County at the site of the Silver Lakes golf course, part of the Robert Trent Jones golf trail, a money-making venture of Retirement Systems of Alabama. Present at the ceremony for the $11 million public golf course, one of eight being built around the state, was golf course designer Robert Trent Jones himself.
