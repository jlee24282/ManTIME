Clash leads to man’s arrest 
 
A 22-year-old Grand Junction man suspected of cornering a brother and sister in a fast-food drive-thru <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="TIME" value="2017-01-24TNI">Tuesday night</TIMEX3> — making obscene gestures toward them and waving a handgun at them — is facing multiple charges including felony menacing and prohibited weapons use. 
 
Mark Aubrey Aguilar, who was prohibited from possessing a weapon because of criminal charges in Wyoming, was arrested <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="TIME" value="2017-01-24TNI">Tuesday night</TIMEX3> after he was spotted driving away from Taco Bell, 850 North Ave., according to an affidavit for his arrest. The 15- and 16-year-old siblings told police a man matching Aguilar’s description jumped a curb and cut them off in the drive-thru before making the gestures at them, the report said. 
 
Police found a mostly empty shooter bottle of Jägermeister in Aguilar’s car and a holstered handgun. Aguilar, whose speech was allegedly slurred and who refused roadside testing when pulled over, faces possible misdemeanor counts of driving under the influence, offensive description of sexual acts and other charges.
