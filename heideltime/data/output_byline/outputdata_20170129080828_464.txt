By Forget those holiday calendars. You can tell carnival season is upon us again by the arrival of the annual parking lot on the grass across Terrebonne's Park Avenue from Southdown Mall. 
 
Those pickups and other vehicles typically stay there through Fat <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-24">Tuesday</TIMEX3>, holding the space for regulars who use them as viewing platforms near the beginning of the parade route. 
 
Speaking of Carnival: Not all of the krewes that parade in downtown Houma start in the parking lot behind Southland Mall. In <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent years</TIMEX3>, interest has grown in a pedestrian parade, promenading down Main Street from the vicinity of the bus station and feed store down Main toward Barrow. 
 
It's the Krewe of Tradition, the project of John Sonnier, Shannon Eaton and other Houma locals seeking to bring back costuming and masking as it was in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="196">the '60s</TIMEX3>. 
 
Eaton, Sonnier and their supporters urge adults and supervised children to costume as individuals or groups and march about noon Fat <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-01-24">Tuesday</TIMEX3> in a mini-parade from the feed store near Main and Barataria to Courthouse Square and back to Main and Grinage in front of Le Petit Theatre. 
 
<TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2016">Last year</TIMEX3> there were judges and prizes for originality with preference to hand-made outfits. No entry fee and no advance registration was needed. Even <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3>, walking krewe supporters meet weekly to discuss plans and costumes, and to craft hand-made souvenir throws to hand out during their grand promenade. The next meeting is 6-<TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="TIME" value="2017-01-24T20:00">8 p.m.</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2017-02-05">Feb. 5</TIMEX3> at the Waterlife Museum, 7910 Park Ave., Houma. 
 
Eaton says those intending to make their own throws should bring supplies and craft tools. Further information may be available at the Krewe of Tradition Facebook page. 
 
Event tours: Operators of at least two area businesses that either arrange tours or provide van-type transportation have emailed information about such operations. Group trips to events like "The Lion King" in New Orleans, for example. Details as soon as I can sort it all out. 
 
Beware of “orphans”! “Greeting from Juliet,” began an unsolicited email <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2017-W03">last week</TIMEX3>, purportedly from an orphan needing my help to recover and spend an inheritance. “My names are Juliet writing from Bishop Robert orphanage home and there is this money which my late parents told me about before the fatal accident which took their lives. 
 
“Also I have the contact of my father lawyer you can contact him because I call him with the orphanage phone and I told him about this decision I want to make. 
 
“I want you to contact me through this mail address...” (I omit it to avoid potential complications.) “Please help me recover the money, I am not in good condition here anymore. God bless you. I hope to hear from you soon.” 
 
The big mystery is how this sweet internet scammer learned of my expertise at recovering fortunes of this kind. 
 
Comedy coming: Le Petit Theatre's next production, "Waste Mismanagement," does not open until <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2017-03" mod="END">late March</TIMEX3>, but director Sue Peace and producer Danielle Marchive were supervising early rehearsals <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2017-W03">last week</TIMEX3>. Jeanne Scott and Reggie Pontiff were repeating the same short scene, seeking Peace's satisfaction. You will be amused; in time. 
 
New museum: Organizer Margie Scoby is excited about the opening on <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2016-02-04">Feb. 4</TIMEX3> of the Finding Our Roots African American Museum, 918 Roussel St., Houma. Watch for details. 
 
Cook-off? Still no details on that downtown Houma chili cook-off set for <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2017-03-11">March 11</TIMEX3>. To register a team, contact Anne Picou at apicou@tpcg.org. The poster suggests there will be entertainment for non-cooks attending the public event.
