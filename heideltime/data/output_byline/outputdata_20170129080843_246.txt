<TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">01/28/2017</TIMEX3>  UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. – Jack Keelan became the 17th runner in Stanford history and the 479th American to break <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="PT4M">four minutes</TIMEX3> in the mile. 
Keelan ran 3:59.62 on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TNI">Saturday night</TIMEX3> to earn a dramatic victory at the Penn State National Open indoor track and field meet on the 200-meter Horace Ashenfelter III Indoor Track. Keelan's fastest previous mile was 4:06.25, run indoors in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3>. 

A specialist at the longer distances – he was fourth in the Pac-12 10,000 meters <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2016-SP">last spring</TIMEX3> – Keelan proved he has speed. He ran a sub-4 1,600 split to anchor the distance medley relay on <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3> and returned <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="UNDEF-REF-hour-PLUS-20">20 hours later</TIMEX3> to run the invitational mile. 

Keelan tucked into fourth place on the opening laps as Penn State's Brad Rivera acted as a pacesetter, and slipped into third when Rivera stepped off the track. With the pace even at <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION" value="PT30S" mod="APPROX">about 30 seconds</TIMEX3> per lap, Keelan passed Binghamton's Eric Holt with just over two laps to go, and crept onto the heels of Penn State alum Robbie Creese, the <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3> Big Ten indoor mile champ. 

Keelan tried to make a move on the penultimate backstretch and went outside on the final turn. Though Creese held him off briefly, Keelan continued to grind and passed Creese in the final 10 meters to win. 

Keelan becomes the fourth on the Stanford team to run sub-4, joining Sean McGorty , Tom Coyle , and Grant Fisher . He also is No. 4 on Stanford's all-time indoor performer's list for a regulation, or non-oversized track. 

Stanford also was involved in another close race, finishing second in the women's 4x400 relay. The Cardinal team of Gaby Gayles , Michaela Crunkleton Wilson , Hannah Labrie-Smith , and Olivia Baker was second to Maryland, 3:40.17 to 3:40.29. 

Gayles staked Stanford to a lead and Crunkleton Wilson extended it. Labrie-Smith handed off with about three meters to spare over a closing Maryland. Micha Powell, a Canadian Olympian, passed Baker early, but Baker stayed tough and was side-by-side with Powell down the stretch.

SEATTLE –  Amber Lewis broke two personal records in the same event and finished the day at No. 8 on Stanford's all-time indoor performers' list in the 60-meter hurdles after her performance at the UW Invitational. 
Lewis, a junior, came in with an 8.89 best and nearly equaled it with a qualifying round 8.90. She surpassed that with each round, running 8.77 in the prelims and 8.70 to finish sixth in the final. 

Stanford junior Tristen Newman set his second PR in as many meets in the 35-pound weight throw. His toss of 60-10 (18.54 meters) was good for second and broke his <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DURATION" value="P2W">two-week</TIMEX3> old PR of 60-0 ½ (18.30), set on the same Dempsey Indoor ring. 

Newman has improved by two feet this season and moved up a spot to No. 8 on Stanford's all-time performers' list. 

On the 307-meter track, several Stanford freshmen excelled while running unattached during redshirt seasons. 

Christina Aragon and Fiona O'Keeffe , cross country All-Americans for the Cardinal <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2016-FA">last fall</TIMEX3>, placed second and fifth in the 3,000, running 9:12.58 and 9:15.51. They would have been the Nos. 4-5 in Stanford freshman history if wearing Cardinal uniforms. In the mile, Ella Donaghu was sixth in a strong field in 4:42.81. 

In the men's 3,000, Pac-12 Cross Country Freshman of the Year Thomas Ratcliffe placed fifth in 7:53.23 while also running unattached.
