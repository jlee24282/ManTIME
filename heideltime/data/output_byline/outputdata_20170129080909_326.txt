Northwest blitzed No. 19 Eastern Oregon out of the gate, jumping to a 7-0 lead before the Mountaineers could blink and leading by as many as nine points early. 
 
An in fusion from the bench, however, helped EOU find its footing, and the momentum quickly swung in Eastern’s favor. 
 
Payton Parrish led the Mountaineers off the bench with 15 points and eight rebounds as Eastern asserted itself and rolled to a 75-46 victory over the Eagles <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TNI">Saturday night</TIMEX3> in Cascade Collegiate Conference play at Quinn Coliseum. 
 
Ashley Knight added 11 points and seven boards — also coming off the bench. All told, EOU’s bench players scored 43 points. 
 
Parrish, Eastern’s sharpshooter who is typically the first player off the bench, found her touch early to help EOU shake off the slow start. She hit a trio of 3s in the opening quarter, the last of which pulled the Mounties within 14-12. Another bench player, Mariah Swanson — hit a short jumper with time winding down in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-Q1">the first quarter</TIMEX3> to give EOU its first lead, 18-17. 
 
Eastern opened up its lead late in the second, with Parrish again providing the spark. Her fourth 3-pointer started a 14-0 run to end the half. Reece Bauer capped the run with a trey and a short jumper for a 37-23 lead at the break. 
 
EOU finally put Northwest away for good with a 16-2 run, with Donniesha Webber polishing off the rally with a 3-pointer for a 53-29 advantage late in the third. Northwest never pulled closer than 22 points the rest of the way. 
 
Eastern shoot off its 2-for-12 start to finish 42 percent from the field and hit 10 3-pointers. The Eagles, conversely, shot just 27 percent. 
 
Maya Ah You chipped in nine points and had three assists. EOU as a team shared the ball well with 20 assists on 29 made field goals. Eastern also dominated on the boards, winning the rebound battle, 52-38. 
 
The win keep EOU (19-4 overall, 12-2 CCC) in the hunt for the conference title, though the Mounties remain 1-1/2 games back of Southern Oregon with six games to play.
