New Delhi, <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Jan 29</TIMEX3> (IANS) Beat <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-WI">the winter</TIMEX3> hair-related blues with interesting, do-it-yourself recipes using castor, coconut and jojoba oils, says an expert.

Here are some tips from Shiv Mann Singh, founder at Desert Splendour, which is on a mission to provide pure jojoba oil directly from its plantations in Rajasthan to its customers:

* Three-oil warm massage: Take equal portions of castor oil, extra virgin coconut oil and jojoba oil and mix them. Warm the oil mixture in a microwave for <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="PT30S">30 seconds</TIMEX3> and add an egg yolk, mix all the ingredients well and massage the mixture on your hair length.

Castor oil and extra virgin coconut oil help in replenishing dry and dull hair, whereas the egg yolk helps in improving the texture, leaving the tresses soft and shiny.

* Banana voluminising mask: Even if you have fine hair, sometimes dryness can occur, specially in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-WI">winter</TIMEX3>. To make sure that you hair look hydrated, mix one mashed banana with a few drops of jojoba oil and one egg white.

Apply this mixture and keep it on for half <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="PT1H">an hour</TIMEX3> before rinsing it with warm water.

* Oil massage and towel wrap: Simply apply jojoba oil on your hair whenever you know that your hair feels dry and rough in winters or when you notice that your typical hair care regime is lacking something.

Massage the oil into your hair, section by section starting from the scalp to the ends, pack in a warm towel for <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="PT15M">15</TIMEX3>-<TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="PT20M">20 minutes</TIMEX3>. Rinse, wash and condition as usual.
