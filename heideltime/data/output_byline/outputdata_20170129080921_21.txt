ALEXANDRIA, La. (LSUA) - The Generals imposed their will on the inside to pull away late from University of the Southwest as LSUA scored its highest total on the season to end a two-game losing streak with a 92-72 win over the Mustangs <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="TIME" value="2017-01-28TAF">Saturday afternoon</TIMEX3> at The Fort. 
 
Much like the first game between the two teams this season, it was the Mustangs who jumped out to a quick lead as Southwest made the first two buckets to get a 4-0 advantage just <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="PT2M" mod="MORE_THAN">more than two minutes</TIMEX3> into the game. But LSUA responded by scoring seven of the next nine points as Katie Lemieux’s three-point play put the Generals on top 7-6 with 6:00 left in the opening quarter. 
 
LSUA’s largest lead of the period was four points, done three times, the last on Lemieux’s elbow jumper that put the Generals up 20-16. Southwest finished <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2017-Q1">the quarter</TIMEX3> on a 5-0 run, and An’Jolique Woodson’s lay-up right before the horn put the Mustangs up 21-20 after one. 
 
With the game tied at 30-30 just more than 3:30 into <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2016-Q2">the second quarter</TIMEX3>, Kayla Morgan’s three gave the Generals the lead for good, and sent the Generals on a period-ending 17-8 run that another Morgan three ended with seconds left in the period to put LSUA up 47-38 at halftime. 
 
Southwest started <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2016-H2">the second half</TIMEX3> on a 9-4 push that pulled the LSUA lead down to just four points as Stephanee Carrillo’s basket made the score 51-47 Generals just <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="PT3M" mod="LESS_THAN">less than three minutes</TIMEX3> into the third period. But LSUA answered again, this time with a seven straight points as Kayla Morgan’s free throw with just about 5:30 left in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2016-Q2">the quarter</TIMEX3> gave the Generals their first double-digit lead of the game at 58-47. 
 
The Generals would get the lead to a dozen three times in <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2018-Q3">the third quarter</TIMEX3>, the final time on Nicole Bouillion’s made three-pointer that put the Generals up 70-58 with <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="PT1M">less than a minute</TIMEX3> left in the stanza. LSUA’s lead would not fall under double-digits the rest of the afternoon as the Generals led 70-60 at the buzzer. 
 
LSUA methodically built on the lead during <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2016-Q4">the fourth quarter</TIMEX3>. Kayla Morgan set the Generals on a decisive run as her jumper in the lane set off an 8-0 LSUA run midway through the period which Lillie Snowden’s free throws finished with 4:35 left in the game to give LSUA an 84-65 advantage. Temekia Bonner’s basket with just seconds left provided the Generals with both their largest lead of the game and the game’s final score, 92-72. 
 
“We played well as a team <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3>,” said LSUA head coach Bob Austin. “We moved the ball well and got it into the hands of players who had open looks, and we did a good job of converting those shots. We were also extremely active on the defensive end, which got us a lot of steals and easy looks and helped jump start our offense after a slow start and got us rolling. And I can’t say enough about Kayla, whose been shooting very well as of late and finished <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="TIME" value="2017-01-29TNI">tonight</TIMEX3> with yet another 30 point game.” 
 
Kayla Morgan led all players with 30 points on ten of 19 shooting in the contest, five of her makes coming from above the three-point arc. This was Morgan’s second straight game with 30 or more points and third time this season hitting the 30-point mark. Temekia Bonner had her second straight game with double-figure points with 15. Katie Lemieux added in <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2013">13</TIMEX3> while Luv Blackburn rounded out the LSUA leading scorers with ten points. 
 
The Generals (6-8, 4-6 RRAC) shot 47.8% from the field in the contest, including 36.8% from long distance. While rebounding was even, 39-38 in favor of Southwest, the Generals got inside to score, dominating points in the paint 46-28. LSUA also dominated fast break points, 17-2, points off turnovers, 26-6, and points off the bench, 32-17. On the defensive side, Southwest (1-20, 1-10 RRAC) shot 45.5% from the field and 36.8% from deep, but turned the ball over 25 times, 18 due to LSUA steals. 
 
LSUA returns to action <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="TIME" value="2017-01-25TEV">Wednesday evening</TIMEX3> up I-49 as the Generals take on LSU Shreveport. Tip-off between the Generals and Pilots is set for <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="TIME" value="2017-01-25T17:30">5:30 P.M.</TIMEX3> at The Dock.
