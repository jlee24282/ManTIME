With the <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> concert season underway, No Fuss Event Hire is set to provide ground protection as the national supplier for all legs of the Australian Guns N' Roses tour as well as upcoming Justin Bieber and Adele concerts at Melbourne’s Etihad Stadium. 
 
With major stadiums looking to maximise their usage through the peak <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-SU">summer</TIMEX3> season, the right surface protection can allow venues to stage concerts as well as sporting fixtures - often in the same week. 
 
No Fuss has <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> purchased additional quantities of market leading products Supa Trac and I-Trac to meet the growing demand for flooring with the ability to carry extreme vehicle and pedestrian loads, while providing both maximum protection and overnight installation. 
 
Leaders in the flooring market since successfully delivering one of the most complex ground protection projects ever in Australia, covering Randwick Racecourse for the Pope’s visit at the <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3> World Youth Day, in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3> No Fuss Event Hire purchased Australian Seating Systems and <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> supply ground protection, temporary structures and grandstands to venues and events around the country. <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Current</TIMEX3> seating projects include the Melbourne Formula 1 Grand Prix, Avalon Airshow and the Nitro athletics series. 
 
No Fuss Event Hire Managing Director Geoff Tucker explains “the acquisition of the temporary grandstand business means we can <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> offer our clients anything from flooring and furniture to seating, scaffold and structures. 
 
“And we can do it as one point of contact from concept planning and design through to installation on the ground.”
