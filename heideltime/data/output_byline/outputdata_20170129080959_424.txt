With bitter memories of large-scale violence fresh in the minds of people, Haryana was on high alert on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3> as a section of the Jat community started fresh protests in some districts. 
 
Paramilitary forces and Haryana Police were monitoring the situation in Jat-dominated districts of Rohtak, Jhajjar, Jind, Bhiwani, Sonipat, Panipat and others. 

The call to resume the protests has been given by the All India Jat Aarakshan Sangharsh Samiti (AIJASS) headed by Jat leader Yashpal Malik in 19 districts. 

The Jats are demanding fulfillment of demands like release of youths arrested during the Jat agitation <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2016">last year</TIMEX3>, jobs to kin of Jats killed in the agitation and action against officials responsible for firing on Jat agitationists. 

"Security agencies are keeping a close watch on some Jat leaders, especially those owing allegiance to the AIJASS," a senior police officer said here on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3>. 

The Haryana government has requisitioned 55 companies of central police forces and ordered the deployment of 7,000 Home Guards, besides the Haryana Police personnel, in districts where trouble was expected.
