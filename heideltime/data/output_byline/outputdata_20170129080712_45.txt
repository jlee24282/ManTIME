Yes, its proper name is the Pre Game Four Miler, but we all know what its real name is.  It’s just that a certain sports organization didn’t like the use of Super <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3> Four Miler and strongly suggested a change. 
 
So OK, it’s the Pre Game Four Miler, and it will take place on, well imagine that!  On Super Bowl <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">Sunday</TIMEX3> in Morristown. 
 
What is interesting about a race that takes place on the day of one of the most widely watched football game, a game reserved for men to play, that women have predominated in each of the previous five races. 
 
You heard that right!  In <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2012">2012</TIMEX3> when it was called by its other name, 527 women ran the race and 410 men.  Thomas Poland and Elena Rozhko, both of Morristown, were the winners.  He in 20:59 and she in 23:52. 
 
In <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2014">2014</TIMEX3> when Chris Croff of Summit set the course record of 19:56, he was one of 443 men, while Allie Dublinski of Morristown was the first of 550 women, finishing in 25:12. 
 
<TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2016">Last year</TIMEX3>, <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3>, the biggest disparity was recorded --- 539 women finished the race while 399 men crossed the line.  Michael Jordon of High Bridge won the race in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3> in the second fastest time of 20:23.  Greta Sieve of Trenton was the women’s winner in a time of 23:42.  Sieve has the women’s record but she did that in <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2013">2013</TIMEX3> when she won in 23:27; one of 479 women, 63 more than men. 
 
The lowest attendance was in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3> when Mark Hess of Brooklyn and Morristown won the race in 20:34 and Catherine Beck of Newark was the women’s winner in 23:40.  It’s hard to say that 849 finishers is a low turnout, but it was for this race.  At the 11 a.m. start that year, the temperature was a not so friendly 30 degrees with a wind chill of 23.4 thanks to wind gusts of 6.9 miles per hour. 
 
Not to be a wet blanket, but the long range weather forecast for Morristown on <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2017-02-05">Feb. 5</TIMEX3> is for snow showers and a possible snowfall of 3 to 5 inches.  Let’s hope that snow ends up in Connecticut like the nor’easter did <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2017-W03">last week</TIMEX3>. 
 
Of course runners are forever optimists.  There is still time to register online or to go to the Morristown Running Company on South Street to register or to pick up your race packet and number. 
 
Rosenberg got his 31st 
 
Gary Rosenberg of Morristown did it again.  He got his sub five miler, but spectators were treated to a cliff hanger. 
 
Rosenberg ran in the spanking new Ocean Breeze facility on Staten Island on <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2017-01-19">Jan. 19</TIMEX3> .  It has a banked track, favored by short distance racers but often a problem for distance runners. 
 
“I am not used to the bank and almost fell off the track a few times on the turns,” he said with a smile. 
 
Anyone who has run a mile race knows the drill:  run slower than you want to run in <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2017-Q1">the first quarter</TIMEX3>, stay with the pace in <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2016-Q2">the second quarter</TIMEX3>, work hard in the third, which will be your slowest one, and then pick it up and haul like crazy for <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2016-Q4">the last quarter</TIMEX3>. 
 
Rosenberg said he was ahead of the pace that he was on at the Monmouth meet where he set his 30th sub five mile in <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2016-12">December</TIMEX3>, but “fell asleep” in the later laps  (200 meters each lap) and had to dig down deep on the last lap to get his coveted time. 
 
Yes, he cut it close with his 4:58.8, but that is still not the end of the story.  Rosenberg is continuing to train with a goal to get closer to 4:45 by the end of the indoor season in <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2017-03">March</TIMEX3>. 
 
Too ambitious? 
 
“I think I will be able to get close so we will see,” said Rosenberg, who is 46 years old.  “No sense in setting a goal if it is easy to get.” 
 
Side note:   Rosenberg’s story that was published here <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2017-01-22">last Sunday</TIMEX3> was picked up by the internet sites Let’s Run and Bring Back the Mile, garnering more attention for his streak.
