Serena Williams thanked everyone from God to the Australian Open volunteers after winning her record-breaking 23rd Grand Slam title in Melbourne. Well, almost everyone. 
 
She namechecked Venus - obviously - the rest of her family, her support team, the crowd, the tournament director, everyone except fiance Alexis Ohanian, who was cheering her on from her player’s box. 
 
Serena got engaged <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2016-12">last month</TIMEX3> to 33-year-old Ohanian, who is the co-founder of social media site Reddit. 
 
‘I always forget people,’ she said later with a laugh. ‘After 20, <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P30Y">30 years</TIMEX3>, I’m still forgetting.’
