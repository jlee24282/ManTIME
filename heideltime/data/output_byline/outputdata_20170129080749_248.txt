The wonderful "As I See it" exposition (<TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-10">Jan. 10</TIMEX3>) by Paul S. Ropp, professor of History at Clark, was welcome and cogent. There is so much being written that is either a polemic or a criticism of the <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> political scene that it is refreshing to read something so very reasonable and well written. 
 
I also would like to say that my husband and I appreciate Dianne Williamson's witty and engaging columns. It is true that we agree with her point of view, however, even if we didn't we would have to appreciate her fun way of expressing herself. Thanks, Dianne, for your efforts to enlighten as well as amuse us.
