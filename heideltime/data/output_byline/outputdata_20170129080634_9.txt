Although the protest appeared peaceful throughout much of the night, police were on hand to keep the protesters contained. There were some scuffles, according to reports, between protesters and arriving passengers. Some protesters were blocking gates and risking arrest.

Judges around the U.S. - including one in Seattle - made emergency rulings against Trump's executive order, but some travelers to the U.S. had already been affected. 
 
At least one man who arrived at Sea-Tac was turned away. The Seattle Times reported that local resident Ibado Ahmed was at the airport to pick up her husband, who was coming to Seattle from Somalia. He was turned away and sent back to Germany, where his flight had originated from. 
 
Earlier on <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>, there was outrage that some Sound Transit light rail trains were skipping the Sea-Tac stop. Transportation leaders are set to meet on <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2017-01-23">Monday</TIMEX3> to discuss how to handle such situations in the future. 

 On <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2017-01-30">Monday</TIMEX3>, leaders from ST and Metro will meet to evaluate and develop a clear protocol moving forward.

Also on <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DATE" value="2017-01-28">Saturday</TIMEX3>, Gov. Jay Inslee held a press conference at Sea-Tac pushing back on Trump's order, comparing it to the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II.
