SINCE the restored Eel House in Alresford began its series of open days during <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2008-SU">the summer of 2008</TIMEX3>, it has welcomed more than 6,000 visitors. 
 
While up until <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> they have been able to witness an interesting but inactive building, the trustees are <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> in the process of getting the Eel House working again. 
 
During <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2017-FA">the autumn</TIMEX3>, the traps were restored, with the help of a generous £2,000 grant from Winchester City Council, and the New Alresford Town Trust (NATT) is <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> applying to the Environment Agency for an “educational” trapping licence. 
 
Trustee Pam Stevens said: “This will enable us to put together a programme with local schools to demonstrate this historic local activity – letting them see (and handle) eels trapped during <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-FA">the autumn</TIMEX3> nights, before releasing the eels again on their 3,000 mile journey back to the Sargasso Sea.” 
 
And she added: “As always, we have had great local support, both practical and financial, for which we are hugely grateful and hope that <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> will see the Eel House doing its thing for the first time in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P40Y" mod="MORE_THAN">more than 40 years</TIMEX3>.” 
 
This year’s open days take place from <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="TIME" value="XXXX-XX-XXT11:00">11am</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="TIME" value="XXXX-XX-XXT17:00">5pm</TIMEX3> on <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2018-04-01">Easter Sunday</TIMEX3> (<TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2017-04-16">April 16</TIMEX3>), <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2017-05-14">May 14</TIMEX3>, <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2017-07-02">July 2</TIMEX3>, <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2017-08">August</TIMEX3> Bank Holiday <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2017-01-23">Monday</TIMEX3> (<TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2017-08-28">August 28</TIMEX3>), and <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2017-09-10">Sunday, September 10</TIMEX3> – to coincide with heritage weekend.
