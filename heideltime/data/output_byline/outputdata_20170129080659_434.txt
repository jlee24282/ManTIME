WASHINGTON — The U.S. economy lost momentum in the final <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P3M">three months</TIMEX3> of <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3> as a downturn in exports temporarily depressed activity. But there were hopeful signs in housing and business investment that the economy will rebound in the <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="FUTURE_REF">coming months</TIMEX3>. 
 
The gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of just 1.9 percent in the <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2016-10">October</TIMEX3>-<TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2016-12">December</TIMEX3> period, a slowdown from 3.5 percent growth in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2016-Q3">the third quarter</TIMEX3>, the Commerce Department reported <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2017-01-27">Friday</TIMEX3>. GDP, the broadest measure of economic health, was held back by a swing in trade with exports of soybeans plunging in <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2016-Q4">the fourth quarter</TIMEX3> after having surged in <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2016-Q3">the third quarter</TIMEX3>. 
 
“If you smooth out the volatility in soybeans, you get growth of around 2.5 percent in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P2Q">the two quarters</TIMEX3>,” said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS Markit. “We really didn’t have a slowdown at the end of the year.” 
 
For all of <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3>, the economy grew 1.6 percent. It was the worst showing in <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION" value="P5Y">five years</TIMEX3> since a similar 1.6 percent gain in <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2011">2011</TIMEX3>. GDP grew 2.6 percent in <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3>, and since the recession ended in <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2009" mod="MID">mid-2009</TIMEX3>, growth has averaged a weak 2.1 percent. 
 
But analysts believe there were signs in Friday’s report of a rebound in business spending and housing activity, which could lead to stronger growth in <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> of around 2.5 percent. 
 
President Donald Trump has set a goal of doubling growth to 4 percent in <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="FUTURE_REF">coming years</TIMEX3> through an ambitious stimulus program featuring tax cuts, deregulation and higher infrastructure spending. 
 
Private economists believe sustained annual growth rates of 4 percent will be a high hurdle, given underlying trends such as slow growth in the labor market and weak productivity. However, many analysts have been boosting their forecasts believing that Trump will succeed in getting at least a portion of his program approved by a Republican-led Congress. 
 
For <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2016-Q4">the fourth quarter</TIMEX3>, the biggest factor contributing to the slowdown was a widening in the trade deficit. Exports, which had been temporarily bolstered by a surge in sales of soybeans to Latin America, retreated in <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2016-Q4">the fourth quarter</TIMEX3>. Meanwhile, imports surged. 
 
Trade cut 1.7 percentage points from growth in <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2016-Q4">the fourth quarter</TIMEX3> after adding 0.9 percentage point to growth in <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2016-Q3">the third quarter</TIMEX3>. A higher trade deficit subtracts from economic growth because it means more production is being supplied from abroad. 
 
Consumer spending, which accounts for 70 percent of economic growth, slowed to still-solid growth of 2.5 percent in <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2016-Q4">the fourth quarter</TIMEX3> from a 3 percent gain in <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2016-Q3">the third quarter</TIMEX3>. But business investment spending accelerated in <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2016-Q4">the fourth quarter</TIMEX3>, rising at a 2.4 percent rate, the best showing in <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DURATION" value="P1Y" mod="MORE_THAN">more than a year</TIMEX3>. That’s a hopeful sign that a prolonged slowdown in investment spending, reflecting in part big cuts by energy companies, is coming to an end. 
 
Residential construction, which had been falling for two quarters, rebounded in <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DATE" value="2016-Q4">the fourth quarter</TIMEX3>, rising at an annual rate of 10.2 percent while government spending grew at a 1.2 percent rate as strength in state and local activity offset a drop in activity at the federal level. 
 
Rebuilding of business stockpiles added 1 percentage point to growth in <TIMEX3 tid="t35" type="DATE" value="2016-Q4">the fourth quarter</TIMEX3>. The cutbacks in business investment along with efforts by companies to reduce an overhang of unwanted inventories were major reasons growth slowed in <TIMEX3 tid="t36" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3>. 
 
Economists are forecasting a better performance in <TIMEX3 tid="t37" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3>, with many raising their forecasts to incorporate the potential impact of Trump’s stimulus program. They believe that the prolonged reduction in stockpiles has run its course and business spending on new plants and equipment will begin to rebound. 
 
Economists at the International Monetary Fund <TIMEX3 tid="t39" type="DATE" value="2017-W03">last week</TIMEX3> boosted their outlook for U.S. GDP to 2.3 percent <TIMEX3 tid="t40" type="DATE" value="2017">this year</TIMEX3> and 2.5 percent in <TIMEX3 tid="t38" type="DATE" value="2018">2018</TIMEX3>, saying the increase reflected expectations that Trump’s economic program of tax cuts, regulatory relief and higher infrastructure had boosted growth prospects. 
 
Some private economists are even more optimistic. Stuart Hoffman, chief economist at PNC, said he had pushed his outlook up to growth of 2.4 percent in <TIMEX3 tid="t41" type="DATE" value="2017">2017</TIMEX3> and 2.7 percent in <TIMEX3 tid="t42" type="DATE" value="2018">2018</TIMEX3>. 
 
Sung Won Sohn, an economics professor at California State’s Martin Smith School of Business, said there is a lot of uncertainty at the moment about Trump’s program since the new administration has yet to put forward its plan for Congress to consider. 
 
“At the moment, we don’t know the size, the scale and the timing of the Trump program,” Sohn said. “But it is very possible that we will get a significant boost to economic growth in <TIMEX3 tid="t44" type="DATE" value="2018-H2">the second half of next year</TIMEX3> if Trump is successful getting his program through Congress.” 
 
Sohn predicted growth rates could jump to 3.5 to 4 percent. GDP growth has averaged a lackluster 2.1 percent in the 7½ years since the recession ended, a point that Trump repeatedly brought up during the campaign.
