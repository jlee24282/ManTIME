Nothing compares to the magic of live choral music. It begins the moment one enters the concert hall and there is a feeling of anticipations in the air an expectation that what is about to happen will transport you to a special emotional and spiritual plane. 
 
No one knows ahead of time how it will turn out. The atmosphere is charged with intensity. The music is captivating and electrifying. This is the feeling one experiences at the annual Festival of Choirs hosted by the Boulevard Baptist Church.
