Well, everything seems normal, just a normal day.. not much happening <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2017-01-29">today</TIMEX3>. 
I'm just working on my project, EXARUNA. A project I have been working on for <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="PXW">a few weeks</TIMEX3>. 
<TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2017-W04">This week</TIMEX3>, I have made an IndieGoGo campaign , a GameJolt page , and wrote about the game on the GameDev forums . 
Everything's been going smoothly 'til <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3>. 
It's good to start slow 
I hope everything will be going well until the end.. and unlike my other cancelled project, I hope this one succeed.
