Local folk artists captivated audiences with an extravagant display of molten iron splashing in the air <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="TIME" value="2017-01-27TNI">Friday night</TIMEX3> in north China's Hebei Province to celebrate the Chinese <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2017-SP">Spring</TIMEX3> Festival. 

Molten iron splashing in the air to create a unique light display is a unique folk art known as "Dashuhua". It was staged in the town of Nuquanin in Yuxian County, Zhangjiakou City. 

The town has a history of <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P500Y" mod="MORE_THAN">over 500 years</TIMEX3> in "Dashuhua" performances during the Lunar New Year. 

Performers threw over 1,000 degree of molten iron onto the cold brick wall to create a breathtaking firework-like display to usher in the new year and to extend wishes for success. 

Apart from the local audience, the performance also attracted visitors from Beijing, Tianjin and from the neighboring Shanxi Province. 

"We came to watch the Dashuhua performance on Chinese <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2017-12-31">New Year's Eve</TIMEX3>. It is astonishing and brings out new perceptions for bettering our lives," said an audience member. 

Before the molten iron was ready to be displayed, various performances set the mood with lantern dancing, folk dancing and other traditional cultural performances.
